    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Dandie, Sharpe
and Greer JJ.) dated March 7, 1997</pre>
    <pre>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal raises the issue whether a record is &#147;under the
control&#148; of a provincial government institution giving rise to a
right of access under s. 10 of the Freedom of Information and
Protection of Privacy Act 1 (the Act).  Each of the respondents,
John Doe I, II and III sought access to backup audio tapes
prepared by the court reporter at their disposition hearings
before the Ontario Criminal Code Review Board.  The Board refused
these requests.  It took the position that the backup tapes were
not under its control but rather were under the control of the
court reporter who was an independent contractor hired by the
Board.  The John Does appealed to an Inquiry Officer.  The
Inquiry Officer held that the backup tapes were under the control
of the Board and ordered that the Board obtain copies of them
from the court reporter.
[2]  The Board applied for judicial review.  The Divisional Court
dismissed the application.  This appeal, brought by the court
reporter, supported by the Board, is from that decision.  For the
reasons below, I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Facts</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The Board is an administrative tribunal which was
established in 1992.  It was created and receives its authority
from s. 672.38 of the Criminal Code.2  The Board&#146;s mandate is to
review dispositions of persons who have been found unfit to stand
trial or not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder.
The proceedings of the Board are called &#147;disposition hearings.&#148;
[4]  Section 672.52(1) requires the Board to keep a record of its
proceedings.  It reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>   The court or Review Board shall cause a record of the
   proceedings of its disposition hearings to be kept, and include
   in the record any assessment report submitted.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The record of the Board&#146;s disposition hearings includes the
verbatim record of the oral evidence given at a hearing.  This
record may take different forms depending on the method of
recording used by the court reporter responsible for a particular
hearing.  Some court reporters take shorthand notes, others make
stenographic notes using a stenographic machine, and others
employ a tape recorder using steno mask technology.  Some use a
backup system, others do not.
[6]  Appeals from disposition hearings of the Board lie to the
Court of Appeal and are based on transcripts of the proceedings.
An appellant is usually required to provide the Court of Appeal
and the respondent with a transcript of the evidence taken before
the Board certified to be accurate by the stenographer (court
reporter).3
[7]  The Board employs independent fee-for-service court
reporters to create records of its proceedings and to prepare
transcripts of those proceedings when required.  These reporters
are paid a per diem fee for attending at a hearing and creating
the record that the Board is required to keep under s. 672.52(1).
The practice is that the court reporter maintains the physical
custody of the record on behalf of the Board.  In addition, the
court reporters are entitled to charge a per page fee for
preparing transcripts.
[8]  In July 1994, the Board held separate disposition hearings
for each of the three respondent John Does.  The Board hired the
appellant, Simcoe Court Reporting (Barrie) Inc., to provide court
reporting services for each of these hearings.  The individual
court reporter employed by the appellant was Carol Forde, a
Chartered Shorthand Reporter.  Ms. Forde used a stenographic
machine to make stenographic notes of each hearing.  In addition,
she also used a single track tape recorder and an open microphone
to create tape recordings of all or portions of the proceedings.
Ms. Forde described these tapes as &#147;backup audio tapes&#148; which
were created as aids to assist her in preparing an accurate
record.  It is these backup tapes that are in issue in this
appeal.  The appellant is Ms. Forde&#146;s personal corporation.
Nothing turns on this and for simplicity, I will refer to Ms.
Forde as the court reporter.
[9]  The three John Does each made a request under s. 10(1) of
the Act for access to the backup tapes of their respective
hearings.  Section 10(1) provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Every person has a right of access to
	  a record or a part of a record in the custody
	  or under the control of an institution unless,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a) the record or the part of the record
          falls within one of the exemptions under
          sections 12 to 22;  or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) the head is of the opinion on
          reasonable grounds that the request for
          access is frivolous or vexatious.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The Board refused these requests, taking the position that
the backup tapes were in the custody of the court reporter and
not the Board.  The Board indicated that the requesters could
contact the court reporter directly and obtain a copy of the
record (a transcript) at a cost determined by the court reporter.
[11] The John Does appealed under s. 50 of the Act.  Pursuant to
s. 56(1), an appeal under this section is determined by the
Commissioner of Information and Privacy or by a person designated
by him.
[12] A notice of inquiry was provided to the John Does and to the
Board. In addition, the court reporter and the Chartered
Shorthand Reporters Association of Ontario (CCSRAO) were asked to
make representations.  The Board, the court reporter, the CCSRAO
and also the Society of Ontario Adjudicators and Regulators made
representations opposing the request for access to the backup
tapes.
[13] In its written submission to the Inquiry Officer, the Board
took the position that the stenographic notes constituted the
official record of the Board&#146;s proceedings.  The Board accepted
that the stenographic notes were under its control within the
meaning of s. 10(1) of the Act even though they were kept by the
court reporter for safekeeping.4  The Board argued, however, that
the backup tapes belonged to the court reporter and were not in
the custody or under the control of the Board.  The backup tapes
were simply an aide memoire for the reporter.  She could listen
to them to clarify a word or phrase that might be unclear in the
stenographic notes.  Except for the requests by the John Does
that the backup tapes be produced, the Board would not have
inquired about their existence nor the circumstances under which
they were created.  The use the court reporter may make of the
backup tapes was of no concern to the Board.  Unlike the
stenographic notes, the Board did not request that they be made,
was not concerned about their existence, and was not concerned
about whether they continued to exist or were destroyed.
[14] The Board also submitted that it did not have a right to
possession of the backup tapes, nor did it exercise control over
their use by the court reporter.  The Board said that it was
impossible for it to compel the court reporter to surrender the
backup tapes.  The tapes were created by the court reporter
solely for her own benefit.
[15] The court reporter took essentially the same position.  She
said that the backup tapes were aids to her and that they may or
may not be complete as she turned the tape machine on and off at
various times during the proceedings.  The tapes were for her own
personal use.  In close to 20 years experience as a court
reporter, she had never released backup tape recordings.  She
said the Board did not have possession of them, that they had not
been voluntarily produced by her, nor had they been provided
pursuant to any mandatory statutory or employment requirement.
She also said &#147;the record (the backup tapes) is being held by me
for the purpose of my duties as a maker of the official record.&#148;
She drew the same distinction as the Board between the
stenographic notes and the backup tapes.  She accepted that the
Board has &#147;&#133; authority to the use of my stenographic notes.&#148;  She
concluded that she was at liberty to dispose of the backup tapes
at any time.
[16] The precise contractual terms between the Board and the
court reporter are not in the record.  There is no indication of
an agreement setting out their respective rights of property,
custody or control over the stenographic notes or the backup
tapes nor specifying what records the reporter must keep.
[17] The appeal was decided by an Inquiry Officer designated by
the Commissioner.  The Inquiry Officer allowed the John Does&#146;
appeals.  He found that the backup tapes, like the stenographic
notes, were created by the court reporter as a result of an
engagement by the Board and he considered that both of these
records, taken together, constituted the Board&#146;s record of
proceedings.  He rejected the argument that the backup tapes were
created for the court reporter&#146;s personal purposes.  He found
that the court reporter was the trustee or repository of the
backup tapes and that the right of control remained with the
Board.  The Inquiry Officer directed the Board to obtain copies
of the backup tapes from the court reporter.  It is important to
note that this order does not necessarily mean that the John Does
will be provided access to the backup tapes.  The Board has not
yet determined whether it will rely upon any of the exemptions
set out in the Act and, on that basis, refuse access.
[18] The Board brought an application for judicial review. The
Divisional Court dismissed the Board&#146;s application.  The court
reporter, with the support of the Board, appeals that decision.</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[19] The single issue before the Inquiry Officer was whether the
backup tapes were records to which there was a right of access
within the meaning of s. 10(1) of the Act.  That section limits
the jurisdiction of the Commissioner.  Records in the custody or
under the control of an institution are subject to the access
provisions in the Act.  Records that are not fall outside the
scope of the Act.  This court has held that a decision by the
Commissioner or his designate under s.10(1) of the Act is to be
reviewed on a standard of correctness, not reasonableness:
Walmsley v. Ontario (Attorney General) (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 611
(C.A.).  The reasoning behind this decision was threefold:
section 10(1) is jurisdiction limiting;  the interpretation of
the &#147;custody or control&#148; test does not require specialized
expertise;  and there is no privative clause.
[20] With this standard in mind, I turn to the question of the
application of s. 10(1) to the backup tapes.  For convenience, I
repeat s. 10(1):
          </pre>
    <pre>               Every person has a right of access to a
	  record or a part of a record in the custody
	  or under the control of an institution unless,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a) the record or part of the record
          falls within one of the exemptions under
          sections 12 to 22;  or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) the head is of the opinion on
          reasonable grounds that the request for
          access is frivolous or vexatious.</pre>
    <pre>[21] It is accepted that the backup tapes are records within the
meaning of the Act (s. 2).  It is also accepted that the Board
has been designated as an institution in the regulations made
under the Act.5
[22] The only issue is whether the backup tapes are under the
control of the Board.  I start with the proposition that the
records of the Board&#146;s disposition hearings are under its
control.  Under s. 672.52(1) of the Criminal Code, the Board is
required to keep a record of its proceedings.  It seems obvious
that whatever constitutes that record must be under the control
of the Board.  If the record is not physically in the Board&#146;s
custody, then it must be kept under an arrangement by which the
Board has access to it.  Were it otherwise, the Board would be in
breach of its statutory mandate &#147;to keep a record of its
proceedings.&#148;
[23] The question then is - what constitutes the Board&#146;s record
of proceedings?  The court reporter now argues that even the
stenographic tapes do not constitute the record.  It contends
that only a transcript, if prepared, is the record of proceedings
referred to in s.672.52(1).  I disagree.  In many cases, there
will be no transcript prepared;  the Board nevertheless has a
duty to keep a record.  That record must include the non-
transcribed record prepared by the court reporter responsible for
making a record of the proceedings.
[24] Unlike the court reporter, the Board accepts that it has
control over the stenographic notes because those notes
constitute the record of its proceedings.  The Board, however,
argues that the stenographic notes constitute the entirety of
that record.  As set out above, it takes the position that the
backup tapes are prepared by the court reporter for her own
purposes and are, therefore, not part of the record.  That
argument, it seems to me, takes an unduly narrow view of the
reason that the backup tapes were created.
[25] Accepting that s. 672.52(1) requires that the record of
proceedings that must be kept is an accurate record, and it is
inconceivable that it could be otherwise, it makes sense that
there should be included in that record those documents or
materials that, when taken together, provide the accurate record.
The court reporter was hired for the purpose of making an
accurate record.  She chose to use a backup audiotape process to
assist her in doing so.  It may be that the backup tape in some
instances will add nothing to the accuracy of her stenographic
notes. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that in some
cases the backup tape must be of assistance, otherwise there
would be no purpose in making one.
[26] I am of the view that the record of the Board includes all
of those documents or materials that were created for the purpose
of making an accurate record. As Sharpe J. said in the reasons of
the Divisional Court:
          </pre>
    <pre>   I fail to see how when two methods are used to record
   proceedings, one being the primary method and the other being a
   backup or check, one constitutes the &#145;record&#146; while the other
   does not.  Both are created for the same purpose &#133; .</pre>
    <pre>[27] It is not an answer to say that some court reporters do not
employ a backup system to assist with the accuracy of a record.
The record includes whatever documents are created by the court
reporter in carrying out the mandate to prepare an accurate
record for the Board.
[28] I am also of the view that even if the backup tapes do not
constitute part of the Board&#146;s record, the Board nonetheless has
control over them within the meaning of s.10(1) of the Act.
There are three aspects to the relationship between the Board and
the court reporter that are important to this conclusion.
[29] First, the sole purpose for creating the backup tapes was to
fulfill the Board&#146;s statutory mandate to keep an accurate record.
[30] Next, it is within the Board&#146;s power to limit the use to
which the backup tapes may be put.  The Board has the broad
discretion to exclude the public from hearings or portions of
them,6 and to limit the disclosure of disposition information to
the public or to an accused.7  It follows that orders of this
nature require the Board to exercise control over all the records
of a proceeding, including backup tapes.  That level of control
is implicit in the powers conferred upon the Board by the
Criminal Code.
[31] It is reasonable to expect that the Board would ensure, by
contract if necessary, that any records of proceedings, backup
records included, be used solely for the purposes of the Board.
The Board can and should exercise control over the use of all
records made by court reporters of its proceedings.
[32] Third, the Board must have access to all of the records
prepared by the court reporter in the event that an issue arises
about the accuracy of either the record or a transcript.  In
either event the Board would require access to all of the
records, including backup tapes if any existed, that could be of
assistance in order to satisfy itself that the record or
transcript is accurate.  For this purpose, the Board must have
access to the backup tapes regardless of who has physical custody
of them.
[33] The Federal Court of Appeal has decided that, in the context
of the federal legislation, a broad, liberal and purposive
approach should be given to the interpretation of access to
information legislation:  Canada Post Corporation v. Canada
(Minister of Public Works) (1995), 30 Admin. L.R. (2d) 242.
Letourneau J.A., writing for the court, held as follows, at p.
245:
          </pre>
    <pre>   The notion of control referred to in [the Act] is left
   undefined and unlimited.  Parliament did not see fit to
   distinguish between ultimate and immediate, full and partial,
   transient and lasting, or &#147;de jure&#148; and &#147;de facto&#148; control.  Had
   Parliament intended to qualify and restrict the notion of control
   to the power to dispose of the information, as suggested by the
   appellant, it could certainly have done so by limiting the
   citizen&#146;s right of access only to those documents that the
   government can dispose of or which are under the lasting or
   ultimate control of the government.</pre>
    <pre>[34] This reasoning applies equally well to the Ontario
legislation and supports the conclusion that the Board should be
found to have control over the backup tapes.  The Federal Court&#146;s
decision was cited with approval by Dorgan J. in Neilson v. B.C.
(Information and Privacy Commissioner), [1998] B.C.J. No. 1640, a
case involving an application under the B.C. Act for the
production of notes made by a school counselor during counseling
sessions with the children of the applicant parent.  Dorgan J.
held that the statute, which also provides for access to &#147;any
record in the custody or under the control&#148; of a public body, was
broad enough to encompass these documents.  The counselor in that
case argued, as did the stenographer in this case, that the notes
were simply an aide memoire which she was not required to make,
over which she had custody and control, and which she stored at
her home.  The court, however, found that the notes were under
the control of the School Board because the counselor, as an
employee, was required to write reports on the children she
counseled and that requirement implicitly involves the keeping of
notes.  Although the facts of the instant case are not identical,
similar reasoning applies.
[35] The Board has argued throughout this proceeding that if it
is ordered to make access to the backup tapes available to the
John Does, it will be unable to comply because it is not able to
compel the court reporter to deliver the backup tapes to it.  I
must say I find this a rather surprising proposition.  We were
told that at some time in the past the Board had used employees
to do what independent court reporters now do.  If the Board had
continued to use employees there would be no issue;  the backup
tapes would be in the Board&#146;s custody and under its control.
However, the Board chose to enter into arrangements with
independent court reporters to meet its court reporting
requirements. Assuming the court reporter now refuses to deliver
the backup tapes to the Board, the Board&#146;s failure to enter into
a contractual arrangement with the reporter that would enable it
to fulfil its statutory duty to provide access to documents under
its control cannot be a reason for finding that the duty does not
exist.  Put another way, the Board cannot avoid the access
provisions of the Act by entering into arrangements under which
third parties hold custody of the Board&#146;s records that would
otherwise be subject to the provisions of the Act.
[36] In argument, the Board placed a great deal of reliance on
this court&#146;s decision in Walmsley.  In my view, Walmsley is
distinguishable.  In that case, the request was made to the
Ministry of the Attorney General to provide documents in the
personal possession of individual members of the Judicial
Appointments Committee.  In holding that the documents were not
under the control of the Ministry, this court pointed out that
the Advisory Committee was set up to provide recommendations for
judicial appointments that were to be arrived at independently
and at arms length from the Ministry.  Further, in Walmsley,
there was no statutory or contractual basis upon which the
Ministry could assert the right to possess or dispose of the
documents.  The situation in this appeal is very different.  The
court reporter is specifically hired to fulfill the statutory
duty of the Board to keep a record and to make transcripts
available, if requested.  Although the court reporter is an
independent contractor, she plays an integral part in fulfilling
the mandate of the Board under the Criminal Code.  Unlike the
situation in Walmsley, the court reporter&#146;s function is part of
the Board&#146;s function.  The court reporter has no independent
role.  She does not operate &#147;independently or at arms length&#148;
from the Board.
[37] I am satisfied that regardless of whether the backup tapes
are part of the Board&#146;s &#147;record of proceeding&#148;, the Board has
control over them within the meaning of s. 10(1) of the Act.
[38] As an alternative argument, the court reporter submitted
that if s. 10(1) of the Act is interpreted to provide access to
records of proceedings of disposition hearings there could be a
conflict between an order made under the Act and those provisions
of the Criminal Code that permit the Board to restrict access to
its proceedings.  It is argued that the doctrine of paramountcy
would result in the provisions of the Criminal Code taking
precedence.  That issue does not arise on the facts of this case.
There were no orders restricting access to the disposition
hearings involved in this appeal.  If access is permitted to the
backup tapes, there would be no conflict with any order of the
Board.
[39] We were not told, in argument, why the respondents insisted
on access to the backup tapes rather than the production of a
transcript.  There appeared to be an understandable concern on
the part of the court reporter, and probably the Board, that if
access is permitted to the backup tapes someone may be able to
prepare a transcript of a disposition hearing without paying for
it;  i.e. that it will not be difficult to have a typed version
of a backup tape prepared.  Leaving aside the fact that a backup
tape may not cover an entire hearing, a typed version will be of
limited use.  It could not be used for purposes of an appeal from
a decision of the Board nor for any other legal proceedings in
which a transcript must be filed.  It would not be a certified
transcript.  Only a transcript certified by the court reporter
who was present at a hearing is sufficient for an appeal or other
legal proceedings.
[40] For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  The
order of the inquiry officer requires the Board to obtain copies
of the backup tapes from the court reporter.  The next step is
for the Board to determine if it takes the position that any of
the exemptions set out in the Act apply to the backup tapes and
to advise the parties accordingly.
[41] The inquiry officer, who appeared as a respondent on this
appeal, does not request an order for costs. John Doe III filed a
factum and appeared by counsel on the argument of this appeal.
John Doe I and II did not.  I would direct that the appellant and
the Board are liable for John Doe III&#146;s costs of the appeal
forthwith after assessment.

     under the laws of the province.
(3)  No member of a Review Board is personally liable for any act
     done in good faith in the exercise of the member&#146;s powers or the
     performance of the member&#146;s duties and functions or for any
     default or neglect in good faith in the exercise of those powers
     or the performance of those duties and functions.

referring to its policy that court reporters do not prepare
transcripts of the proceedings for anyone requesting a transcript
unless the Board first gives its written consent.  There is some

the reasons that I set below, I do not think that it matters to
the result of this appeal whether or not there is such a policy.
