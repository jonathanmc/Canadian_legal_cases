</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Feldman J. dated December 13, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   In  1975, a consortium in which Oceanic Exploration Company
was the major stakeholder struck an agreement with Greece for the
development  of oil production in the Aegean Sea. This  agreement
was  known  as the Exploration and Development Agreement,  or  in
short form, the E &amp; D Agreement.
[2]  In 1976 Oceanic sold its rights under this Agreement to
Denison Mines Limited for $25 million, plus 15% of the
consortium&#146;s annual net earnings as calculated pursuant to the E
&amp; D Agreement.
[3]  In 1993 the consortium and Greece amended the E &amp; D
Agreement to provide a different method of calculating the net
earnings of the consortium. If that method of calculation was
used as the basis to determine Oceanic&#146;s 15% share of net
earnings, the annual amount it was to receive would be
significantly reduced.
[4]  The question in this litigation is whether the 1976 contract
between Oceanic and Denison references the calculation of net
earnings only to the original E &amp; D Agreement or to the E &amp; D
Agreement as amended in 1993.
[5]  At trial, Feldman J. determined that Oceanic and Denison had
agreed to the method of calculation provided in the original E &amp;
D Agreement. For the reasons that follow I agree, although I
reach that conclusion by a somewhat different route.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[6]   As the trial judge indicated, in large measure the relevant
facts are not in dispute.
[7]  The E &amp; D Agreement was entered into on June 14, 1975, and
was thereafter ratified in law by the Parliament of Greece. Its
purpose was to permit the consortium, in which Oceanic had a
68.75% interest, to proceed to develop oil production from
certain offshore areas in the Aegean Sea. The concept behind the
agreement was that the consortium would pay for the project and
the Greek State would share in the resulting revenue rather than
receiving a royalty.
[8]  The method of calculating the net revenue of the consortium
set out in the original E &amp; D Agreement of 1975 required several
steps.
[9]  First, from the gross revenue of the project were subtracted
the production costs for the year. These were capped after the
first five years at 40% of gross revenue. This yielded the net
revenue of the project.
[10] The Greek State then took its share which was 30% of the net
revenue.
[11] Then the consortium paid Greek income tax at a 50% rate
leaving the balance of 35% of the net revenue as the net earnings
of the consortium. This was called the &#147;Contractor&#146;s Retained Net
Share&#148;.
[12] The 1975 E &amp; D Agreement had two other provisions of
importance in this litigation. The first is found in the
Definitions provision at the beginning of the contract. It reads
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The following underlined words and
	  terms shall have the following meaning unless
	  the context of the Agreement otherwise specifies:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Agreement: means the present
          document and its Schedules, as well as any
          extension, renewal, substitution or amendment
          thereof; &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[13] The second is Article 30.3 which is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    30.3.     The Parties hereto further agree
	 that during the entire validity of this Agreement, no
	 provisions hereof shall be amended,  supplemented  or
	 replaced, except  by  mutual agreement  between them,
	 confirmed  in  writing  and  signed  by  their lawful
         representatives.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Oceanic&#146;s  business  was to  do  the  preliminary  work  on
ventures  such  as  this and then transfer  its  interest  to  an
operator  who was technically and financially able  to  carry  it
out.  It therefore entered into a Memorandum of Agreement on June
30,  1976 (which was subsequently amended on August 27, 1976)  to
sell its interest in the E &amp; D Agreement to Denison. The purchase
price  was  U.S.  $25  million together  with  an  annual  amount
equivalent to 15% of the Contractor&#146;s Retained Net Share for that
year as determined under the E &amp; D Agreement.
[15] Then on August 30, 1976, in an agreement in which Denison
and Oceanic expressly set out their desire to define the terms
and conditions upon which payments between them would be made,
the final form of the amount due each year to Oceanic was fixed.
This agreement was known as the Oil Payment and Net Earnings
Interest Agreement (the &#147;NEI Agreement&#148;).
[16] For the purposes of this litigation there are several
critical provisions of the NEI Agreement. Recitals A and B read
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A.   Pursuant to the Memorandum  of 
	  Agreement of  June 30, 1976  between  Denison 
	  and Oceanic, as amended, (such agreement  and 
	  all amendments  thereto collectively referred
	  to as the &#147;Agreement&#148;), Denison has agreed to
	  acquire all of the  interests of  Oceanic  in
	  and   to   that   certain   Exploration   and
	  Development Agreement of June 14, 1975 by and 
	  between   the   Greek   State  and    Oceanic
	  Exploration  Co.  of  Greece,  et  al.,  (the
	  &#147;Exploration and  Development Agreement&#148;) and
	  in the areas subject thereto.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    B.   The Agreement further provides
          that  Denison will make certain  payments  to
          Oceanic, referred to as the &#147;Oil Payment&#148;  or
          &#147;First  Oil  Payment&#148; and  as  the  &#147;15%  Net
          Earnings  Interest,&#148; and that  under  certain
          circumstances   Oceanic  may   make   certain
          payments  to  Denison,  referred  to  as  the
          &#147;Second  Oil  Payment.&#148;  Denison and  Oceanic
          hereby   desire  to  define  the  terms   and
          conditions upon which such payments shall  be
          made to Oceanic and to Denison.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Paragraph 3 provides for the 15% payment:
          </pre>
    <pre>        3.  Net Earnings Interest. Denison hereby
	grants to Oceanic a 15% net earnings interest
	(the &#147;Net Earnings Interest&#148;) which shall be 
	payable by Denison to Oceanic as long as there is
        production under the Exploration and Development
	Agreement, but (a) only in connection with its 
	production of oil, gas and hydrocarbons pursuant 
	to the Exploration and Development Agreement, if 
	any, (except as otherwise provided below in this
        Paragraph 3); (b) only upon completion of all 
	payments pursuant to the First Oil Payment and 
	the Second Oil Payment, if any; and (c) only upon 
	the following terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>        (a)    there  shall  be  determined   in
               respect of each calendar year, from  and
               including the year in respect of which the
               final portion of the First Oil Payment, or
               Second Oil Payment, if any, is payable, the
               amount of the Contractor&#146;s retained net share
               for such year from each Development area
               under  the  Exploration and  Development
               Agreement, after deduction of Petroleum Costs
               recovered  under  the  Exploration   and
               Development Agreement, and the Greek State&#146;s
               Percentage Participation Share, but before
               deducting Greek income tax, but excluding
               earnings  in respect of which the  final
               portion of the First Oil Payment or Second
               Oil Payment, if applicable, is payable (the
               expressions used in this clause (a) to have
               the same meanings as in the Exploration and
               Development Agreement).
         </pre>
    <pre>         (b)   there shall then be determined  the
               amount   which  is  15%  of  the  amount
               determined under clause (a) above; and
         </pre>
    <pre>         (c)   the amount determined under clause
               (b)  above  shall  be the  Net  Earnings
               Interest  payable  to  Oceanic;  Denison
               shall  withhold  from  each  payment  to
               Oceanic of its Net Earnings Interest the
               proportionate amount of
               Greek   taxes  paid  by  the  Contractor
               attributable to the net earnings payable
               to  Oceanic  and  shall promptly,  after
               receipt  by Denison, deliver to  Oceanic
               certified  copies of receipts issued  by
               the  Greek Revenue authorities  for  the
               payment  of  such  income  taxes,   such
               delivery   shall   constitute   a   full
               accounting by and acquitance of  Denison
               for such withheld amounts.</pre>
    <pre>[18]  In  the years following 1976, the production costs  of  the
venture  far  exceeded  anticipation.  Given  the  cap  on  their
recovery contained in the formula in the E &amp; D Agreement, by  the
early  1990s  the  consortium  had very  significant  unrecovered
production costs. As a result, even though there were  still  oil
reserves,  it  was  clear that the project was  going  to  become
uneconomic  for  the  consortium if it could  not  strike  a  new
revenue sharing agreement with Greece.
[19] By the end of November 1992 such an agreement had been
reached. It was formally signed on February 23, 1993, and was
subsequently ratified in law by the Greek Parliament. It was
effective as of January 1, 1993.
[20] This agreement was known as the Second Amendment Agreement.
It significantly altered the method of determining the
Contractor&#146;s Retained Net Share. The most important change was
that the cap for recovery of production costs was put on a
sliding scale and could go as high as 90% of gross revenue. In
addition, the share taken by the Greek State was reduced to 5%
and the income tax rate was reduced from 50% to 40%.
[21] The Second Amendment Agreement concluded with Article 10
which provides that the terms of the original E &amp; D Agreement not
amended by this amending agreement remain in full force and
effect.
[22] The Second Amendment Agreement was made without any
participation by Oceanic. Indeed, Denison acknowledged that it
took no account of Oceanic&#146;s interest in its negotiations with
Greece. Oceanic had been paid since 1976 on the basis of the
method contained in the original E &amp; D Agreement. Largely because
of the rise in the cap on production cost recovery and based on
the production levels actually attained between 1993 and the date
of trial, the new formula yielded a much lower return to Oceanic
than would have resulted from the original method in the 1975 E &amp;
D Agreement.
[23] Thus the issue was joined, with Oceanic taking the position
that the payment called for by the NEI Agreement should be
determined by taking 15% of the Contractor&#146;s Retained Net Share
calculated according to the original E &amp; D Agreement and Denison
asserting that the calculation should reflect the amendments
contained in the Second Amendment Agreement of 1993.
[24] Against this backdrop Feldman J. concluded that the payment
referred to in paragraph 3 of the NEI Agreement was to be
calculated using the formula in the original E &amp; D Agreement and
not that in the 1993 Amendment. She based this conclusion on the
plain meaning of the language coupled with the rules of
contractual interpretation regarding incorporation into contracts
of foreign statutes, regulations and standard foreign contracts.
[25] She also found support for this conclusion because if an
ambiguity could be said to exist here, both the subsequent
conduct of the parties and the most commercially reasonable
meaning of this agreement pointed in her view to the same
conclusion.
[26] Secondly, Feldman J. concluded that in the circumstances of
this case it was not necessary that the phrase &#147;Exploration and
Development Agreement&#148; as used in paragraph 3 of the NEI
Agreement always mean the original E &amp; D Agreement. In
particular, she found that phrase to mean the E &amp; D Agreement as
amended where paragraph 3 refers to the payment obligation
existing only &#147;as long as there is production under the
Exploration and Development Agreement&#148;. In finding that the
circumstances pointed away from giving the same meaning to this
term throughout the NEI Agreement she relied primarily on the
subsequent conduct of the parties and the doctrines of commercial
reasonableness and fairness.
[27] Finally, she offered in obiter that while the obligation of
good faith owed by one contracting party to another did not
squarely bind Denison in negotiating amendments to the original E
&amp; D Agreement that would adversely affect Oceanic, fair dealing
might require that a term be implied in the NEI Agreement to
limit any resulting adverse impact on Oceanic.
[28] On this appeal the appellant takes issue with both main
conclusions of the trial judge and with the applicability of the
doctrine of good faith to this case.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[29]  In my opinion, the outcome of this appeal depends upon  the
proper interpretation of paragraph 3 of the NEI Agreement. In the
oft  repeated phrase of Estey J. the task of the court is  &#147;&#133;  to
search for an interpretation which from the whole of the contract
would appear to promote or advance the true intent of the parties
at  the time of entry into the contract.&#148;1  It is a task which is
anchored  in  the  language used by the parties in  drafting  the
document.  When these words are clear and there is  no  ambiguity
there  is  no need to go outside the Agreement for assistance  in
the interpretive exercise.2
[30]  The  question here is whether in drafting the NEI Agreement
the  parties intended the calculation of the required payment  to
Oceanic  to  be  based  on the formula in  the  original  E  &amp;  D
Agreement or that provided in the Agreement as amended. To answer
that  question  it is useful to repeat the language  in  the  NEI
Agreement that must be scrutinized.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Recital A:
          </pre>
    <pre>                Pursuant to the Memorandum of Agreement
          of June 30, 1976 between Denison and Oceanic,
          as   amended,   (such   agreement   and   all
          amendments  thereto collectively referred  to
          as  the  &#147;Agreement&#148;), Denison has agreed  to
          acquire  all of the interests of  Oceanic  in
          and   to   that   certain   Exploration   and
          Development Agreement of June 14, 1975 by and
          between   the   Greek   State   and   Oceanic
          Exploration  Co.  of  Greece,  et  al.,  (the
          &#147;Exploration and Development Agreement&#148;)  and
          in   the  areas  subject  thereto.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               3. Net Earnings Interest. Denison hereby grants to
          Oceanic a 15% net earnings interest (the &#147;Net Earnings
          Interest&#148;) which shall be payable by Denison to Oceanic
          as long as there is production under the Exploration
          and Development Agreement, but (a) only in connection
          with its production of oil, gas and hydrocarbons
          pursuant to the Exploration and Development Agreement,
          if any, (except as otherwise provided below in this
          Paragraph 3); (b) only upon completion of all payments
          pursuant to the First Oil Payment and the Second Oil
          Payment, if any; and (c) only upon the following terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)    there  shall  be  determined in
               respect of each calendar year, from and
               including the year in respect of which the
               final portion of the First Oil Payment, or
               Second Oil Payment, if any, is payable, the
               amount of the Contractor&#146;s retained net share
               for such year from each Development area
               under  the  Exploration and  Development
               Agreement, after deduction of Petroleum Costs
               recovered  under  the  Exploration   and
               Development Agreement, and the Greek State&#146;s
               Percentage Participation Share, but before
               deducting Greek income tax, but excluding
               earnings  in respect of which the  final
               portion of the First Oil Payment or Second
               Oil Payment, if applicable, is payable (the
               expressions used in this clause (a) to have
               the same meanings as in the Exploration and
               Development Agreement). [Emphasis added.]

</pre>
    <pre>[31]  As  Recital B in the NEI Agreement makes clear, the parties
were  seeking to give definition to the terms and conditions upon
which  payments would be made to Oceanic. They were striving  for
certainty  and  clarity. Against that backdrop they  provided  in
paragraph  3(a) for the method of calculating the  annual  amount
owing  to  Oceanic, explicitly stating that the expressions  used
have  the  same  meaning  as in the Exploration  and  Development
Agreement.  Recital  A makes this a defined  term  namely,  &#147;that
certain Exploration and Development Agreement of June 14, 1975&#148;.
[32] This language together with the party&#146;s objective of
certainty make clear that the shared intention of the parties was
to incorporate into paragraphs 3(a) of the NEI Agreement the
formula for Contractor&#146;s Retained Net Share found in the E &amp; D
Agreement as it existed on June 14, 1975. They did not intend to
incorporate whatever formula might emerge from amendments that
might be made at some future date.
[33] This meaning would seem to accord with the underlying
reality of the transaction between Denison and Oceanic in 1976,
namely that Denison was acquiring the right to develop oil
production in the designated offshore areas of the Aegean Sea in
return for providing Oceanic with $25 million together with a
steady future income stream calculated according to paragraph 3
of the NEI Agreement.
[34] The alternative interpretation  urged by Denison simply does
not square with the language used by the parties in the NEI
Agreement. Denison says that because the E &amp; D Agreement defines
&#147;Agreement&#148; to mean &#147;the present document &#133; as well as any &#133;
amendment thereof&#148;, and because paragraph 3(a) of the NEI
Agreement provides that expressions used in that clause have the
same meaning as in the E &amp; D Agreement, it follows that the NEI
Agreement incorporates the definition of the E &amp; D Agreement set
out in the latter Agreement, which specifically includes
amendments to it.
[35] On the contrary, in Recital A the parties to the NEI
Agreement explicitly defined what they meant by &#147;the Exploration
and Development Agreement.&#148;  They meant &#147;that certain Exploration
and Development Agreement of June 14, 1975&#148; not &#147;the Exploration
and Development Agreement as amended.&#148;
[36] Moreover, &#147;the Exploration and Development Agreement&#148; is not
a defined term in the E &amp; D Agreement. Rather, the defined term
is &#147;Agreement&#148;. It is clear that the parties to the NEI Agreement
did not intend to incorporate the definition of &#147;Agreement&#148; found
in the E &amp; D Agreement because they expressly defined &#147;Agreement&#148;
in Recital A of the NEI Agreement to mean something quite
different &#150; namely, the Memorandum of Agreement of June 30, 1976,
as amended.
[37]  The position advanced by Denison is that the formula
referenced by paragraph 3 of the NEI Agreement is the one set out
in the E &amp; D Agreement as it might be amended in future from time
to time. This would mean that Oceanic would have placed its
ongoing economic interest in this contract entirely in the hands
of Denison and Greece. In my view, if this were the shared
intention of the parties, it would have been clearly expressed.
[38] Commercial contracts are normally designed, at least in
part, to maximize certainty. In Spooner Oils Limited v. Turner
Valley Conservation Board, [1933] S.C.R. 629 Duff C.J. addressed
this principle. That case involved a contract between the federal
government and a private lessor. Although he was speaking of the
incorporation into a contract of future government regulations
(rather than other contracts which might be amended) his words
are apposite. At pp. 641-42 he said this:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The view suggested involves the result
	  that the terms of the contract may in every respect
	  be altered (as regards rental, as regards royalties,
	  as regards the obligations of the lessee in respect
	  to the working of the mine); and by one party to the
	  lease acting alone, without consultation with the
	  other; and with the result (a result which, as we
	  have seen, actually follows in this case from the
	  acceptance of the respondent&#146;s contention) that a
	  contract radically new, in its essential terms, may
	  be substituted for that explicitly set forth in the
          document executed by the parties and the specific
	  regulations that it incorporates.
          </pre>
    <pre>                &#133;  But to us it seems clear that, if it
          had  been intended to incorporate, as one  of
          the  terms  of the lease, a stipulation  that
          all  future regulations touching the  working
          of  the  property should become part  of  the
          lease   as  contractual  stipulations,   that
          intention  would  have  been  expressed,  not
          inferentially, but in plain language.</pre>
    <pre>[39]  I  would,  therefore, conclude, as  did  Feldman  J.,  that
paragraph 3 of the NEI Agreement references the original  E  &amp;  D
Agreement, not the E &amp; D Agreement as amended in 1993.
[40] The opening paragraph of paragraph 3 requires that this 15%
payment by Denison continue &#147;as long as there is production under
the Exploration and Development Agreement&#148;. As I have said,
Feldman J. interpreted this reference to the E &amp; D Agreement to
mean &#147;as amended&#148;, contrary to her finding that the parties
intended the same reference in the payment calculation to refer
only to the original 1975 Agreement.
[41] I do not agree with this differentiation. I see no basis
here to depart from basic principles of interpretation to read
this phrase differently in different parts of paragraph 3 of the
NEI Agreement. For the reasons I have outlined, I think that
throughout paragraph 3 the parties intended to reference the
original E &amp; D Agreement. The 15% payment was intended to
continue as long as there could be said to be production under
that original E &amp; D Agreement.
[42] That condition is clearly met here. The original E &amp; D
Agreement provisions which permit oil production are Articles 1.1
and 7.4. They read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.2  Contractor is granted hereby the
	  exclusive right and license to perform, manage
	  and carry out under the terms and conditions
	  set out hereunder, all Petroleum Operations 
	  related to Hydrocarbons in the Contract Area.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                7.4  During the entire term of validity
          of  each Development License Contractor shall
          have   the  exclusive  right  to  keep,  use,
          operate  and  maintain each Development  Area
          for the purpose of carrying out the Petroleum
          Operations therein.</pre>
    <pre>[43]  These  provisions were untouched by the 1993 Amendment  and
remained  operative. Article 10 of the Second Amendment Agreement
expressly provides that all terms of the original E &amp; D Agreement
that were not amended remain in full force and effect.
[44] The Second Amendment Agreement focussed on amending the
terms of the E &amp; D Agreement relating to the allocation of the
proceeds of production. It did not touch the terms relating to
production. That production continued under the terms of the
original E &amp; D Agreement. Hence the payments by Denison to
Oceanic were still required.
[45] I therefore conclude that the references to the Exploration
and Development Agreement in paragraph 3 of the NEI Agreement are
to the original E &amp; D Agreement not the E &amp; D Agreement as
amended in 1993. I have reached this conclusion based on the
plain meaning of the contractual language. I do not find any
ambiguity in the wording and hence would not resort to the
extrinsic evidence about the subsequent conduct of the parties or
the commercial reasonableness of the outcome. Indeed, the
conclusions to be drawn from that evidence seem open to
considerable debate. Nor is it necessary to deal with the
implications of the good faith principle for this contractual
relationship.
[46] For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
