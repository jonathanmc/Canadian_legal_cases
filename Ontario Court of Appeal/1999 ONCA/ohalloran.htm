COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Appellant) and DARREL
               O&#146;HALLORAN (Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        MORDEN, DOHERTY and ABELLA JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Alex Alvaro, for the appellant
               Michael Code, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 20, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Thomas J., dated September 28, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We do not think that the motions judge correctly stated the
test to be applied by a reviewing judge, but, in any event, we
are satisfied, applying the correct test, that there was evidence
before the committing judge upon which, acting judicially, he
could form the opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put
the respondent on trial. With respect, the respondent&#146;s
submissions to us were directed not to the requirements of this
test but, rather, to what would be relevant matters for the trier
of fact to consider.
[2]  Further, if it is necessary to deal with the point, we are
not persuaded that the preliminary inquiry judge&#146;s interventions
during the course of submissions amounted to a denial of a
natural justice.
[3]  The appeal is allowed, the order of Mr. Justice Thomas is
set aside, and the motion to quash is dismissed.</pre>
