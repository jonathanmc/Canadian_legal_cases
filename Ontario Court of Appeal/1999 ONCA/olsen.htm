    <pre>Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This case reveals the depths of human depravity.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Michael Podniewicz and Lisa Olsen were convicted by a jury
of murdering their six-month-old daughter Sara. The Crown’s
theory, undoubtedly accepted by the jury, was that Podniewicz
violently shook Sara on two or three separate occasions, causing
multiple fractures to her ribs and bones, leading eventually to a
slow painful death brought on by acute pneumonia. Olsen was a
party to the offence. She knew that Podniewicz was injuring Sara,
yet she abdicated her legal duty to protect her child. Instead,
she covered up for Podniewicz and facilitated his ability to
commit the offence by concealing Sara’s injuries and by
preventing others from detecting them.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  On their convictions for second degree murder, the trial
judge, O’Driscoll J., imposed the maximum period of parole
ineligibility of 25 years for Podniewicz and a period of 15 years
for Olsen. In imposing the maximum period for Podniewicz, the
trial judge took into account that six years earlier Podniewicz
had pleaded guilty to aggravated assault on his two-month-old son
Mikey Jr. Podniewicz had violently shaken that child as well,
leaving him severely brain damaged, paralyzed, blind and deaf.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Podniewicz and Olsen each appeal against conviction and
against the increased period of parole ineligibility. On
conviction, the appellants advance seven grounds of appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (i)  the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of
          Mikey Jr.’s injuries as similar act evidence and, once
          admitted, erred in instructing the jury on its use;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (ii) the trial judge failed to put the theory of the
          defence fairly to the jury;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     the trial judge erred in admitting the video-
          taped statements of the appellants’ 10-year-old
          daughter Jasmine;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iv) the trial judge erred in charging the jury on Lisa
          Olsen’s out-of-court statements;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (v)  the trial judge erred in his charge on
          consciousness of guilt;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (vi) the trial judge erred in his rulings concerning a
          “surprise defence witness,” Lorraine Vatafu; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (vii)     the trial judge erred by leaving sections of
          the Criminal Code and notes with the jury.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  On sentence, each appellant submits that the period of
parole ineligibility imposed by the trial judge was outside an
acceptable range.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  We called on the Crown only on the first two grounds of
appeal against conviction and on parole ineligibility. For the
reasons that follow, I am not persuaded that the conviction
appeals have any merit and I would not interfere with the periods
of parole ineligibility imposed by the trial judge. I would,
therefore, dismiss both appeals.</pre>
    <pre>The Conviction Appeals</pre>
    <pre>1.   Did the Trial Judge Err in Admitting Similar Act Evidence
     and, Once Admitted, Did He Err in Instructing the Jury on
     its Use?</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The trial judge ruled that the Crown could lead similar act
evidence concerning the life-threatening injuries suffered by
Mikey Jr.  The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in
admitting this evidence and, once having admitted it, erred in
failing to instruct the jury properly on its use.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The evidence of Mikey Jr.’s injuries was powerful evidence
for the Crown. In June 1988 Podniewicz shook his son Mikey Jr.,
then just over two months old, so violently that he was left
permanently brain damaged, paralyzed, blind and deaf. Mikey Jr.
also had three rib fractures and some bone injuries that were two
to four weeks older than the neurological injuries. Podniewicz
pleaded guilty to aggravated assault on Mikey Jr. and charges
against Olsen were withdrawn. Locke J. sentenced Podniewicz to
five years imprisonment. In his reasons, Locke J. said that he
was sentencing Podniewicz for the neurological injuries caused in
June 1988. He ignored the rib injuries because, in his view, the
evidence did not link Podniewicz  to these injuries.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  After a voir dire, the trial judge ruled the evidence of
Mikey Jr.’s injuries admissible. He held:
          </pre>
    <pre>          A review of the contents of Exhibit D, the
          Applicant’s Record with regard to similar
          fact evidence, including the similar fact
          chart at the front of the booklet, persuades
          me not only of the similarity of the evidence
          in 1989-1990 and 1994 but goes beyond that
          and persuades me the proposed evidence is
          strikingly similar.
          </pre>
    <pre>          …
          </pre>
    <pre>          In my view, the happenings of 1988 that
          brought about a plea in 1989 provide
          compelling evidence that the accused Michael
          Podniewicz had the ability to perceive Sara’s
          death in 1994, and is compelling evidence
          that the accused Ms. Olsen had knowledge of
          how Sara was at risk, knowing of the
          happenings of 1988 and the terms of the
          parole which were still in force in 1994. In
          my view, the 1988 evidence, and the plea in
          1989, is evidence which is essential to the
          unfolding of the narrative. Without the 1988
          and 1989 evidence, the Crown’s case will have
          no flow to it, and indeed it may appear to
          make no sense.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In intra-family abuse cases, it is frequently
          necessary that a good deal of family history
          must be put before the trier of fact.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[10] The evidence of Mikey Jr.’s injuries was obviously relevant
to the issue of identity and to the issue of intent for second
degree murder, that is, to the foreseeability of the consequences
of causing bodily harm. The Crown relied on the similar act
evidence to show that Podniewicz inflicted the injuries on Sara
that led to her death and that he knew  she was likely to die
from these injuries. The appellants submit, however, that the
trial judge erred in admitting the evidence because it did not
meet the test for the introduction of similar act evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellants’ submission focuses on what they claim are
two different shaking mechanisms, one causing Mikey Jr.’s
neurological injuries and the other causing Sara’s rib and bone
injuries. The appellants argue that the neurological or brain
injuries to Mikey Jr. were caused by the “shaken baby syndrome”.
Sara, however, did not suffer brain injuries and the appellants
argue that her rib and bone injuries were caused by a different
shaking mechanism. They acknowledge that the rib and bone
injuries suffered by Sara were strikingly similar to the rib and
bone injuries suffered by Mikey Jr., but point out that the
evidence at the 1989 trial did not conclusively link Podniewicz
to Mikey Jr.’s rib and bone injuries. Therefore, the appellants
submit that the trial judge erred by lumping all of Mikey Jr.’s
injuries together, and thus in concluding that these injuries
could be admitted as similar act evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The trial judge’s discretion to admit similar act evidence
is entitled to deference on appeal, and I am not persuaded that
the trial judge committed a reviewable error in the exercise of
his discretion. The appellants’ argument depends on drawing a
distinction between two different kinds of shaking, but that
distinction – and it is a hair splitting distinction at best – is
not supported by the medical evidence. Dr. Mian, a paediatrician
and head of the SCAN (Suspected Child Abuse and Neglect) team at
the Hospital for Sick Children since 1984, gave extensive
evidence about the cause of the injuries to Mikey Jr. and to
Sara. In her opinion, both Sara’s rib and bone injuries and Mikey
Jr.’s neurological injuries were caused by violent or severe
shaking. She refused to draw the distinction relied on by the
appellants. Her opinion that violent shaking was the mechanism in
both cases was unaffected by the absence of brain injuries to
Sara. She commented that Sara may have avoided brain injuries
because she was older, may have had better neck control or
stronger blood vessels, or may have been shaken in a way that
resulted in less movement of her head.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Therefore, the trial judge’s ruling permitting the Crown to
lead evidence of Mikey Jr.’s neurological injuries on the issues
of identity and intent for murder was supported by the medical
testimony at trial. There was also some evidence connecting
Podniewicz to Mikey Jr.’s earlier rib and bone injuries, at least
enough evidence to admit them as similar act evidence1. Indeed,
in admitting this evidence the trial judge observed that Locke J.
did not have before him “the totality of circumstances” adduced
on the Crown’s similar act application in the present case. The
medical evidence led on the application showed that Mikey Jr.’s
brain injuries and his earlier rib and bone fractures were both
caused by violent shaking. In other words, all of Mikey Jr.’s
injuries were “shaking” injuries. Podniewicz’s admission that he
shook his son causing serious brain injury made it more likely
that, as  between him and Olsen, he had also injured Mikey Jr.’s
ribs and bones by shaking him on an earlier occasion. Moreover,
once the evidence of Mikey Jr.’s neurological injuries was
admitted, the evidence of his earlier rib and bone injuries would
have caused little or no prejudice to the appellants because they
were far less serious.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellants also submit that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury on the use of this similar act evidence
because he failed to recharge them in accordance with this
court’s decision in R. v. Millar2, even though both the Crown and
the defence asked him to do so. In his main charge, after
reviewing the similar act evidence, the trial judge instructed
the jury on how this evidence might assist them in deciding
whether Podniewicz caused Sara’s injuries. He told the jury:
          </pre>
    <pre>          You must not use the evidence regarding
          Mikey, the plea of guilty, etc., in order to
          infer that either accused person is a person
          whose character or disposition is such that
          he or she is likely to have committed the
          offence charged here. That is, you cannot
          look at 1988 and say, well, “he is the type
          of person who would do that. He did it once;
          he likely did it this time, too”.
          </pre>
    <pre>          You are entitled to find from the evidence
          (ie. “may” not “must”), that the offences of
          1988 and 1994 have characteristics in common
          that are so similar that it is likely that
          the two offences were committed by one
          person. However, it is entirely for you to
          decide whether such an inference should be
          drawn.
          </pre>
    <pre>          You should remember, too, that Lisa Olsen was
          not convicted of anything arising out of the
          injuries to Mikey. Therefore, what I just
          said does not apply to her.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I need not go over the similarities already
          discussed and set out in Dr. Mian’s
          comparison in Exhibit 62 which I just read to
          you a short time ago.
          </pre>
    <pre>          If you consider that the offence regarding
          Mikey and the offence regarding Sara were
          likely committed by one person, then the
          evidence on the charge regarding Mikey may
          assist you in deciding whether the accused
          Michael Podniewicz committed the present
          charge with regard to Sara.
          </pre>
    <pre>          If, however, you do not draw the inference
          that the offences were likely committed by
          one person, consider only the evidence
          regarding Sara and put out of your mind the
          evidence regarding Mikey.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[15] Podniewicz’s defence counsel objected to this instruction.
His position, supported by the Crown, was that the jury had to be
satisfied Podniewicz caused Mikey’s earlier rib and bone injuries
before they could use the “whole package” of injuries to Mikey
Jr. to prove Podniewicz caused Sara’s rib and bone fractures.
Podniewicz’s defence counsel relied on this court’s decision in
Millar. Counsel for both parties asked the trial judge to
recharge the jury but he declined to do so.</pre>
    <pre>[16] In my opinion, the trial judge did not err by failing to
recharge the jury as requested by counsel. In Millar, identity
was not an issue. The accused, Millar, had admitted to causing
the fatal injury but claimed that he did so accidentally. The
Crown relied on evidence of an earlier injury to prove intent and
to rebut the defence of accident. Therefore, for that evidence to
have any probative value for the offence for which Millar was
charged, manslaughter, the jury had to be satisfied that he had
inflicted the earlier injury. In the present case, the identity
of Sara’s abuser was a live issue at trial. Evidence about what
happened to Mikey Jr. was relevant to that issue. The Crown’s
theory was that Podniewicz inflicted Sara’s injuries. The similar
act evidence concerning Mikey Jr.’s injuries increased the
likelihood that Podniewicz, not Olsen, caused Sara’s injuries. To
be probative of the issue of the identity of Sara’s abuser, the
jury need not have been satisfied, however, that Podniewicz
inflicted Mikey Jr.’s earlier rib fractures. If, because of the
similarities between the injuries to Sara and the injuries to
Mikey Jr. the jury found it likely that the same person abused
both children, then the evidence concerning Mikey Jr. could help
establish the identity of Sara’s abuser. The observations of Cory
J. in the recent case of R. v. Arp, though made in the context of
the admissibility of  similar act evidence, are relevant here:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The suggestion that the evidence linking
          the accused to the similar acts must also
          link the acts to the accused goes too far.
          Once the trial judge has concluded that the
          similar acts were likely the work of one
          person and that there is some evidence
          linking the accused to the alleged similar
          acts, it is not necessary to conclude that
          the similar acts were likely committed by the
          accused. The answer to this question may well
          determine guilt or  innocence. This is the
          very question which the trier of fact must
          determine on the basis of all the evidence
          related to the similar acts, including of
          course the accused’s involvement in each act.
          The standard set out in Sweitzer should be
          maintained. This only requires that the trial
          judge be satisfied that there is some
          evidence which links the accused to the
          similar acts.3
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[17] The probative value of similar act evidence depends on
probabilities. As Cory J. commented in Arp: “it is the
unlikelihood of coincidence that gives the evidence its probative
force.”4  The unlikelihood  of coincidence is overwhelming in
this case. As the Crown accurately stated in its factum:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Looking at the whole picture – the fact that
          Podniewicz violently shook Michael Jr. on one
          occasion, when viewed in light of the fact
          that Sara was injured through the same
          mechanism of force and Mikey Jr. was
          previously injured through the same mechanism
          of force – increased the likelihood that,
          between Podniewicz and Olsen, it was he who
          abused Sara. It was open to the jury to
          reason that it defied common sense and human
          experience that this was just an unfortunate
          coincidence for Podniewicz; i.e., that he was
          unlucky enough to live with a “baby shaker”
          who had intentionally abused two of his
          children and that he just happened to
          accidentally injure one of those children
          himself by using the very same, unusual
          mechanism of force.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          I would not give effect to this ground of
          appeal.</pre>
    <pre>2.   Did the Trial Judge Put the Theory of the Defence Fairly to
     the Jury?</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appellants submit that the trial judge did not put the
theory of the defence fairly to the jury. Podniewicz testified at
trial, and the defence called five witnesses to give evidence
about Sara’s condition in order to negate the specific intent for
murder. The appellants argue that it was essential for the trial
judge to review that evidence for the jury, but instead he
referred to it only cursorily and in the context of summarizing
the closing addresses of counsel.</pre>
    <pre>[19] I do not accept this submission for three reasons. First,
the appellants were entitled to a fair charge, not a perfect
charge. If the jury understood the nature of the defence and the
relevance of the evidence to the legal issues then the appellants
have no cause to complain. I am satisfied the jury would have
understood the nature of the appellants’ defence and the
relevance of the evidence led by the appellants at trial. Each
appellant mounted a “cut throat” defence claiming the other was
responsible for Sara’s death. Each appellant said, in substance,
“I didn’t do it” and “I didn’t know about it”. Neither appellant
argued that Sara’s injuries were accidental.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Throughout his charge the trial judge outlined for the jury
the nature of each appellant’s defence and the evidence bearing
on it. For example, the trial judge reviewed the evidence of the
defence witnesses who saw Sara in her home environment,
“contemporaneous and on site”, including a woman from
Mothercraft, a parole officer, a social worker and two doctors,
all of whom testified that they saw nothing wrong with Sara; he
referred to the evidence of a Crown witness, Ms. Bauer, who did
not see any signs of abuse on Sara at any time; he told the jury
that when Podniewicz pled guilty to aggravated assault on Mikey
Jr. he did not admit to hurting his son deliberately; he
instructed the jury on the possible frailties of Jasmine’s out-of-
court statements, telling them “we don’t know who whispered what
into her ear while she was off camera”; he instructed the jury on
the defence’s position that the conclusions of the SCAN team
doctors should be viewed cautiously; he emphasized Olsen’s
reliance on the presumption of innocence; he told the jury that
all charges against Olsen for the assault on Mikey Jr. were
dropped, that she seemed to have no problems with her children
while Podniewicz was in custody and that she appeared distraught
during her video-taped interview by the police; and, he
summarized Podniewicz’s evidence that he did not harm Sara, that
he was not her main care giver and  that he was not in a position
to notice her injuries.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Admittedly, the trial judge reviewed some of this evidence
when he summarized the closing addresses of counsel, but, in my
opinion, his doing so in this case did not undermine the fairness
of his charge. Overall, I am satisfied that the jury would have
understood the theory of each appellant’s defence and the
evidence supporting it.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Second, this was a long trial and, in his charge, the trial
judge summarily reviewed all of the evidence, including that led
by the Crown. I find it hard to see how a more detailed review
would have helped the appellants. For example, had the trial
judge reviewed more extensively the evidence of the defence
witnesses who claimed to have seen nothing wrong with Sara, he
would have been obliged to point out the numerous shortcomings in
their evidence, especially that these witnesses did not see Sara
between March 16 and April 5 when her rib and other injuries were
likely inflicted. Moreover, the Crown called 32 witnesses, the
defence called six witnesses including Podniewicz. Although in
his charge the trial judge spent more time on the Crown’s
witnesses, his doing so reflected the realities of the trial. As
Dickson C.J.C. pointed out in Thatcher v. The Queen5:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The gist of the complaint is that the
          trial judge revealed to the jurors his own
          perception of the accused’s guilt, through
          undue emphasis on the crown’s evidence and
          inadequate summary of the defence. The
          defence evidence was simple, however, and the
          Crown’s case was complex, relying on
          circumstantial evidence from a large number
          of witnesses. It is simply inappropriate to
          try to measure the fairness of the charge by
          reference to quantity.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[23] Third, I agree with Ms. Klukach for the Crown that the
appellants’ argument on this ground of appeal mirrors the
dissenting judgment of Borins J.A. in R. v. Mullins-Johnson6. The
majority judgment of this court, by Catzman and Labrosse JJ.A.,
approving the adequacy of the trial judge’s charge in that case,
was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[24] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal either.</pre>
    <pre>3.   Did the Trial Judge Err in Admitting Jasmine’s Video-Taped
Statements?</pre>
    <pre>[25] Jasmine Ademovic, Lisa Olsen’s daughter and Michael
Podniewicz’s step-daughter, was eight years old when Sara died
and ten years old when the trial took place. Shortly after Sara’s
death, Jasmine gave three video-taped statements in which she
said in a variety of ways that Podniewicz had mistreated Sara.
After a voir dire, the trial judge ruled that these statements
were admissible for the truth of their contents, relying on R. v.
Khan7. The trial judge held that the three statements met the
twin requirements of necessity and reliability. The appellants
submit that the trial judge erred in admitting the statements.
Their main argument centers on the reliability requirement. The
officer who interviewed Jasmine lost some of his interview notes,
left his job after the interviews because he had suffered post-
traumatic stress disorder and at the time of trial was facing
criminal charges for theft. These problems with the interviewing
officer, according to the appellants, bring into question the
reliability of Jasmine’s statements.</pre>
    <pre>[26] The ruling of a trial judge on a Khan application, like a
ruling on the admissibility of similar act evidence, is entitled
to deference on appeal. Even apart from deference, however, I am
satisfied that the trial judge was correct in admitting Jasmine’s
statements for the truth of their contents.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Before discussing the reliability requirement, I will deal
briefly with necessity. The Crown sought to establish necessity
on either of two grounds: because of her fear of the appellants,
Jasmine would be seriously traumatized and would likely suffer
irreparable psychological harm if forced to testify at trial
about what occurred before Sara died; or, because of her fear of
the appellants, she would be unable to testify at trial. In
either case the jury would not have the benefit of her evidence
unless they saw the video-taped statements. The trial judge
accepted that the Crown had met the necessity requirement on both
bases. In his ruling he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          … the totality of the evidence of six (6)
          witnesses called on this voir dire, who
          testified on behalf of the Crown, persuades
          me that Jasmine is petrified of the accused
          Michael Podniewicz. The same evidence
          persuades me that it would be detrimental to
          the psychological health and well-being of
          Jasmine if she were forced to come here and
          testify. I am persuaded on the evidence of
          Dr. Sas that the mere recounting of the
          events that led to Sara’s death may well
          cause Jasmine to disassociate and cause her
          irreparable harm. I am also persuaded that if
          Jasmine were brought to Court, she would
          continue to refuse to testify, a position
          that she has consistently and adamantly
          maintained throughout.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I am persuaded upon the evidence that out-of-
          Court statements of Jasmine, as captured in
          the videotapes, (Exhibit L, Exhibit M, and
          Exhibit N) are the only way to obtain her
          version of the events. …
          </pre>
    <pre>          It will also be noted that  the proposed
          evidence of Jasmine is not hearsay evidence.
          It is the evidence of Jasmine recorded within
          in[sic] days of the death of her half-sister.
          It records, tells and demonstrates how Sara
          received the internal injuries found on post-
          mortem. If the triers of fact do not get to
          see Jasmine’s evidence in this form, they
          will not receive Jasmine’s evidence at all. I
          find, therefore, that the onus on the Crown
          to prove necessity, as required by R. v. Khan
          has been met.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>The evidence called by the Crown on the voir dire amply supported
the trial judge’s finding of necessity.</pre>
    <pre>[28] The trial judge also concluded that the reliability
requirement had been satisfied. He found:
          </pre>
    <pre>          With regard to reliability, … on each video,
          it can be seen and heard that Jasmine has not
          been led by leading questions. As the
          witnesses have stated, she blurts things out.
          She gives incremental disclosure. On each
          video, Jasmine promises to tell the truth. On
          each tape the police officers test her
          regarding truth/lies with some simple
          questions. Moreover, some of the medical
          evidence confirms what Jasmine says.
          </pre>
    <pre>          How the child Jasmine listens, reacts, talks,
          laughs, and, indeed clams up or answers is
          there on tape for the jury to see and hear.
          It is not a question of anyone relating on
          how Jasmine did or did not react to a
          question. It is not a question of how Jasmine
          phrased or answered any questions. The
          picture and the sound track that the jury
          sees is Jasmine, on the dates recorded, “as
          is”.
          </pre>
    <pre>          There is no evidence before me that Jasmine
          was coached or prepped on or off camera.
          There is no evidence she was offered anything
          or promised anything or was coerced or
          threatened.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Jasmine was telling her account in her own
          way and doing so at a time close to the
          events being related, but two months before
          charges were laid. She tells us on video what
          went on at 16 Temple Avenue, Apartment 2.
          That’s all in the first person. She was
          there. The Crown has no other available
          source for this evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>           I see no basis or reason to admit one video
          and exclude the others. The interviews all
          build on each other.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In my view, the Crown has satisfied the
          second requirement, that is, reliability. …
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[29] This finding, too, was fully supported by the evidence. Most
of the indicators of reliability were present  in this case.
Jasmine’s video-taped statements were taken within days of Sara’s
death. Her personality and demeanour told as much about the
relevant events and their significance as did her words. Because
the  statements were video-taped, the jury could assess Jasmine
for themselves and did not have to rely on third party accounts.
The experts testified that Jasmine was intelligent and knew the
difference between fact and fiction, truth and lies. Her evidence
did not suggest any motive to fabricate. Moreover, the interviews
were carefully and skilfully conducted, in a manner approved of
by the experts who testified on the voir dire. The interviewing
officer did not ask leading questions, but instead asked simple,
open-ended questions and did not pressure Jasmine.</pre>
    <pre>[30] Admittedly, the interviewing officer had lost some of his
notes and was mired in personal difficulties at the time of
trial. The defence claimed that the lost notes hampered their
ability to cross-examine the officer about all the circumstances
surrounding the interviews. The officer, however, did provide a
will-say statement, he testified that he had a good memory and he
was thoroughly cross-examined by defence counsel. The appellants
could not articulate how they might have been prejudiced by not
having these notes. Moreover, the trial judge was aware of the
lost notes and personal difficulties of the interviewing officer
and held that they did not undermine the reliability of Jasmine’s
statements. In my view, the trial judge was correct. With the
jury being able to see and hear Jasmine for themselves, to
exclude her statements because of the lost notes or the problems
of the officer would have been unwarranted. This ground of appeal
fails.</pre>
    <pre>4.   Did the Trial Judge Err in Charging the Jury on Lisa Olsen’s
     Out-of-Court Statements?</pre>
    <pre>[31] Lisa Olsen did not testify at trial. However, she gave three
out-of-court statements, which were admitted in evidence. The
trial judge referred to part of one of Oslen’s statements when
discussing Podniewicz’s possible motive for injuring Sara. In
that part of the statement, Olsen said that Podniewicz was seeing
a Dr. Pollock as a condition of his parole. Podniewicz submits
that the trial judge erred by failing to charge the jury that
they could not use Olsen’s out-of-court statements against him.</pre>
    <pre>[32] This submission has no merit for two reasons: first, the
trial judge more than  once instructed the jury on the limited
use they could make of Olsen’s statements; and, second, the part
of the statement Podniewicz complained of did not prejudice him.</pre>
    <pre>[33] When one of Olsen’s video-taped statements was admitted, the
trial judge correctly told the jury that out-of-court statements
were evidence only against the person making them:
          </pre>
    <pre>          … perhaps this would be an appropriate time
          to remind you that when you are dealing with
          out-of-court statements, they are evidence
          for or against the person making them, and no
          one else. So that what you’d seen on the
          television, you are going to see again, is
          the statement of Lisa Olsen. So that’s
          evidence for or against her. If there is a
          statement by Mr. Podniewicz and he is by
          himself in the absence of Lisa Olsen, what he
          says out of court is evidence for or against
          him. You can’t mix and match. If you have the
          two of them together, as I believe it was
          with P.C. Gill, when he talked to them in the
          hospital and they were there together, that
          is evidence for or against either or both. We
          will hear more about that at the end, but
          just keep that in mind.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          He repeated that instruction in his charge to
          the jury:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Next is to Detective Wilson and Detective
          Perry. … the interview of Lisa Olsen … I may
          be referring to those statements of the
          accused later on, but I want to tell you now
          that whatever an accused person says to
          police officers, whether oral or in writing,
          is admissible only regarding that particular
          accused and is not evidence against any other
          accused. Moreover, anything said out of court
          by an accused to a person other than police
          officers is likewise admissible only
          regarding that accused and is not admissible
          regarding any other accused.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[34] Even if Olsen’s statements were “used against” Podniewicz,
contrary to the trial judge’s express instructions, they could
not have prejudiced him. In his own evidence Podniewicz admitted
that one of his parole conditions required him to see Dr. Pollock
for a one-on-one anger management control course. Olsen’s
statements neither contradicted nor added to this evidence. This
ground of appeal therefore fails.

</pre>
    <pre>5.   Did the Trial Judge Err in his Charge on Consciousness of
Guilt?</pre>
    <pre>[35] The trial judge charged the jury on evidence capable of
giving rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt. This
evidence included false statements made by Podniewicz and Olsen
to neighbours, CAS workers and doctors when Sara was ill, and to
the 911 operator, the police, hospital personnel and doctors
after Sara died. After briefly reviewing some of this evidence,
the trial judge instructed the jury:
          </pre>
    <pre>               If you find that any accused made false
          statements, concocted stores or lied about
          their whereabouts, you must then ask yourself
          whether he or she made those statements and
          did those things to conceal his or her part
          in the crime and throw the police on a false
          scent, or hide his or her identity and try to
          put the blame on someone else.
          </pre>
    <pre>               On the other hand, you may decide that
          such things were done out of panic or fear or
          for some other excusable reason.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Not every false statement is evidence of
          consciousness of guilt. It is for you to say:
          What is the effect of the evidence and the
          significance to be attached to it?
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[36] In the light of the judgment of this court in R. v. Peavoy8
and the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in White v. The
Queen; Côté v. The Queen9, both delivered after the trial in this
case, consciousness of guilt evidence is now referred to as after-
the- fact  or post-offence conduct. Although this more neutral
language is preferable, the use of the term consciousness of
guilt, by itself, is not a reversible error. The appellants
however, attack the trial judge’s charge on consciousness of
guilt on two other grounds: first, they submit that the trial
judge erred by treating this evidence separately,  by
compartmentalizing it, instead of leaving it with the rest of the
circumstantial evidence; and second, they submit that the trial
judge erred by telling the jury that evidence before Sara’s death
as well as evidence after her death could give rise to an
inference of consciousness of guilt.</pre>
    <pre>[37] On the first ground, as Major J. indicated in White and
Côté, it is preferable that after-the-fact conduct be dealt with
together with other circumstantial evidence instead of being
treated separately in the charge. However, the trial judge’s
separate instruction on consciousness of guilt did not amount to
a reversible error in this case. The charge was brief and
balanced. It was even favourable to the defence in the sense that
the trial judge  did not refer in detail to the extensive
circumstantial evidence the jury could rely on to infer
consciousness of guilt.</pre>
    <pre>[38] On the second ground, in my view, the lies told by
Podniewicz and Olsen before Sara died were potentially probative
of the appellants’ guilt. These lies were told after Podniewicz
had violently shaken Sara, at a time when the appellants knew
that Sara was likely to die from her injuries. For these reasons
this ground of appeal also fails.

</pre>
    <pre>6.   Did the Trial Judge Err in His Rulings Concerning the
     “Surprise Defence Witness” Lorraine Vatafu?</pre>
    <pre>[39] On a Thursday near the end of the trial, the defence became
aware of a new witness – Lorraine Vatafu,  previously the
appellants’ neighbour, – who, they believed, had important
information. They asked the trial judge to adjourn the trial to
Monday to permit them to interview Ms. Vatafu. The trial judge
granted them an adjournment, but only until the following day,
Friday.</pre>
    <pre>[40] The defence called Ms. Vatafu on the Friday. She claimed to
have seen Sara on April 24, 1994, the day Sara died and testified
that Sara seemed fine though she had a runny nose. Ms. Vatafu
tied her observations of Sara to when she moved her belongings
out of her neighbouring apartment. She said that she had called
the police on April 23rd to force the landlord to allow her in
because he had changed the locks. Ms. Vatafu had given a taped
interview to the police and at trial the Crown cross-examined her
on her interview. She was asked: “And nowhere, not once in about
an hour of interview with homicide detectives, in all of this
time that you’ve been waiting to tell what you know, did you ever
mention seeing this baby on April 24th. Did you Ms. Vatafu?”  The
Crown was then permitted to call reply evidence to show that Ms.
Vatafu had called the police, but on April 15th, not on April
23rd.</pre>
    <pre>[41]  The appellants make three objections to the way the trial
judge dealt with Ms. Vatafu’s evidence. First, they argue that
the trial judge erred in failing to grant a longer adjournment.
Second, they argue that once the Crown accused Ms. Vatafu of
fabricating her evidence the trial judge erred in failing to play
Ms. Vatafu’s taped interview for the jury. Third, they argue that
the trial judge erred in permitting the Crown to call reply
evidence on what they submit was a collateral point, relevant
only to credibility. I would not give effect to any of these
arguments.</pre>
    <pre>[42] The short adjournment did not prejudice the appellants. They
concede that they would not have elicited more evidence from Ms.
Vatafu had the trial been adjourned until Monday.</pre>
    <pre>[43] The taped interview of Ms. Vatafu was not made an exhibit at
trial and, therefore, was not available to this court on appeal.
However, it was likely of little or no assistance to the defence.
When Ms. Vatafu was cross-examined, she agreed that she had not
told the police about seeing Sara on April 24th. At first she
explained this oversight by claiming that the police had not
asked her about the 24th. She then abandoned that explanation and
proffered another one: she did not realize until after the police
interview that she had seen Sara on April 24, 1994. I doubt that
the playing of the taped interview for the jury would have helped
the defence.</pre>
    <pre>[44] In my view, the Crown’s reply evidence was properly
admissible. The state of Sara’s health on April 24 – whether she
was dead or near dead – was a central issue in the case. Ms.
Vatafu claimed that Sara was alive on April 24th and showed no
outward signs of illness. She claimed to be certain of the date
because of her phone call to the police. The reply evidence,
placing Ms. Vatafu’s phone call to the police on April 15th,
showed that she did not see Sara on April 24th. Thus, the reply
evidence addressed a main, not a collateral, point. Moreover, it
was needed to correct an otherwise inaccurate portrayal of what
occurred. The interests of justice demanded that the jury not be
left with any misapprehension about the events surrounding Sara’s
death. For these reasons, I would not give effect to this ground
of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>7.   Did the Trial Judge Err by Leaving Sections of the Criminal
     Code  and Notes with the Jury?</pre>
    <pre>[45] The trial judge left with the jury the relevant sections of
the Criminal Code and some brief notes highlighting the
applicable legal principles. The appellants acknowledge that the
notes did not misstate or misrepresent the law. They submit,
however, that the trial judge erred by giving the jury the
sections of the Code and the notes because by doing so, he likely
overemphasized the importance of certain provisions and therefore
detracted from his instructions in his charge.</pre>
    <pre>[46] This ground of appeal has no merit. Trial judges are not
prohibited from giving jurors written material. The concern about
the practice is that jurors might embark on their own
interpretation of the law and thus undermine the verbal
instructions in the charge. Trial judges can safeguard against
this concern by instructing the jury that they must accept the
law given to them in the charge. The trial judge so instructed
the jury in this case and he cautioned them about misusing the
written material when he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Ladies and gentlemen, I had prepared for you
          a booklet setting out the charges, the charge
          rather, and some relevant sections of the
          Criminal Code. This booklet is given to you
          so that  you may follow along as we deal with
          the various sections of the Criminal Code as
          they relate to this case.
          </pre>
    <pre>          As I said earlier, and I repeat, you must
          accept the law as I state it to be. There can
          be no private interpretation of the meaning
          of the sections of the Criminal Code. The
          booklet is given to you as a memory aid only.

</pre>
    <pre>I, therefore, would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The Sentence Appeals: The Periods of Parole Ineligibility</pre>
    <pre>[47] On a conviction for second degree murder, s.745.4 of the
Criminal Code gives the trial judge discretion to increase the
mandatory minimum 10-year parole ineligibility period up to 25
years. In exercising this discretion, a trial judge is required
to consider the character of the offender, the nature of the
offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and any
recommendation made by the jury. In this case, eight jurors
recommended no increase in the period of parole ineligibility for
either appellant and four jurors made no recommendation.
O’Driscoll J., nonetheless, increased the period of parole
ineligibility for Podniewicz to the maximum, 25 years, and for
Olsen to 15 years.</pre>
    <pre>[48] The period of parole ineligibility is  an element of the
sentence for second degree murder. Therefore, a trial judge’s
exercise of discretion under s.745.4 is entitled to deference on
appeal. As Iacobucci J. observed in R. v. Shropshire10 that
discretion “should not be more strictly circumscribed than the
sentencing itself.” And an appellate court should not interfere
with the exercise of that discretion unless the trial judge
misapprehended or disregarded evidence relevant to the factors
prescribed in s.745.4, made an error in principle or imposed a
period of parole ineligibility that was outside an acceptable
range11. In this case, neither appellant suggests that the trial
judge misapprehended or disregarded evidence relevant to the
factors in s.745.4 or that he made an error in principle.
Instead, the appellants submit that 25 years parole ineligibility
for Podniewicz and 15 years for Olsen are each outside an
acceptable range. I do not agree with this submission.</pre>
    <pre>[49] The discretion vested in the trial judge under s.745.4
recognizes that second degree murders can vary both in
seriousness and in moral culpability. By giving courts discretion
to impose a 25-year period of parole ineligibility, Parliament
has recognized that some second degree murders are as serious and
as morally culpable as a first degree murder. A frequently cited
standard is that the maximum period should be reserved for “the
worst offence and the worst offender”12. I find that standard
unrealistic in the sense that no matter how repugnant the crime
and no matter how repulsive the criminal, the fertile human mind
can always conjure up a worse offence and a worse offender13. I
prefer to think of a “worst group of offences and a worst group
of offenders” for which the maximum period of parole
ineligibility may be imposed.</pre>
    <pre>[50] In my view, the nature of this offence falls within the
worst group of offences and Podniewicz falls within the worst
group of offenders. Therefore, although I do not know of any case
in which this court has previously upheld or imposed the maximum
25-year parole ineligibility period for second degree murder, I
am satisfied that 25 years is warranted for Podniewicz. Olsen is
not as morally culpable as Podniewicz, as the trial judge
recognized, but in my opinion she deserves to be ineligible for
parole for more than the mandatory minimum 10 years. Although 15
years may be at the high end of an acceptable range, it is not
outside that range. I will elaborate on my conclusion by briefly
discussing the factors to be considered under s.745.4 of the
Code.</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  The Nature of the Offence and the Circumstances
          Surrounding its Commission</pre>
    <pre>[51] This was an offence of extraordinary cruelty and inhumanity.
O’Driscoll J. accurately concluded that this was “one of the most
serious offences committed in the most despicable way on a
totally innocent, helpless, six-month-old child – a slaughter of
the innocent.” Sara was violently shaken, fracturing her ribs and
bones, leading to her slow and painful death from pneumonia. And
it was not a single, spontaneous act of violence. She was shaken
at least twice and perhaps three times. Both appellants showed a
callous indifference to Sara’s suffering. They ignored her cries
for help and instead they engaged in an extended cover-up,
including scripting a story for the 911 operator, the doctors and
the childcare workers. In his reasons for increasing the periods
of parole ineligibility, O’Driscoll J. poignantly commented:
          </pre>
    <pre>          We know that she was assaulted more than
          twice to produce the injuries that brought on
          the terminal pneumonia. You watched her die.
          You not only abused Sara, but you turned your
          back on her and let her die without medical
          help that would have saved her. After she was
          dead for several hours, you staged a cheap
          soap opera, commencing with the middle of the
          night caravan and followed by the 911 call.
          Neither one of you cared one iota about
          Sara’s well-being.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Again, I cannot think of anything worse.
          You killed her over a period of weeks or
          months and when she died,  you did not have
          the decency to do the right thing.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[52] Each appellant committed an egregious breach of parental
trust. Sara was a defenceless child, the most vulnerable of
victims, repeatedly and brutally abused by her two parents. Her
death had a horrible impact on the other children in the house,
who witnessed their sister’s ordeal and were traumatized by what
they saw. This case called out for a sentence that strongly
reflected the principles of deterrence and denunciation. As
O’Driscoll J. said: “If there can be a worst case of second
degree murder, I have trouble imagining it.”
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  The Character of the Offender Podniewicz</pre>
    <pre>[53] Podniewicz is a mature adult, 33 years old when he was
sentenced. When he was 25, he brutalized another of his children,
Mikey Jr., leaving him in a state of living death – blind, deaf,
paralyzed and severely brain damaged. On a second conviction for
second degree murder, s.745(b) of the Code requires a 25 year
parole ineligibility period, even absent any aggravating factors.
Section 745(b) does not directly apply to Podniewicz, but the
spirit of the section surely does in the light of Mikey Jr.’s
injuries.</pre>
    <pre>[54] Podniewicz has a previous criminal record and he was on
parole when he murdered Sara. His prospects for rehabilitation
are poor to non-existent. He has had the benefit of numerous
programs, yet he has failed to respond to treatment or to
community support and supervision. After being released from
prison, he returned home to conduct another reign of terror. He
poses a future danger to any child who might be in his care. He
has shown no remorse for what he did. Instead, he has refused to
accept any responsibility for his actions. And nothing in his
background explains or mitigates his conduct. In short,
Podniewicz is among the worst of offenders.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (c)     The Character of the Offender Olsen</pre>
    <pre>[55] Lisa Olsen, too, is a mature adult. Although less morally
culpable than Podniewicz, as O’Driscoll J. said her “conduct in
all of this is totally unbelievable”. She witnessed the
frightening abuse of her child. Yet instead of doing something –
anything – to help Sara, she repeatedly lied and covered up for
Podniewicz. She prevented detection or medical treatment of
Sara’s injuries. She showed no remorse for what she did to Sara.
And nothing in her background explains or mitigates her conduct.
On the evidence before the trial judge, her prospects for
rehabilitation appeared poor. In this court, her counsel tendered
fresh evidence to shows that her rehabilitative prospects had
improved.  This evidence show that while incarcerated she has
made some efforts to rehabilitate herself. Obviously, her efforts
are to be encouraged. But I am  not persuaded the fresh evidence
is so compelling that it justifies interfering with the period of
parole ineligibility imposed by the trial judge.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (d)     The Jury’s Recommendation</pre>
    <pre>[56] In upholding the periods of parole ineligibility imposed by
the trial judge, the only factor that causes me concern is the
recommendation of eight jurors that the 10-year minimum period
not be increased for either appellant. The trial judge did not
ignore this recommendation because he expressly referred to it in
his reasons. He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          At the end of an emotional day of
          deliberations, the jury was asked to give a
          recommendation. It is one of the matters that
          I have to consider. In my view, the non-
          eligibility period of 10 years for either one
          of these accused is totally unrealistic.</pre>
    <pre>In my opinion, he was correct to view the jury’s recommendation
as unrealistic. No juror acting rationally could possibly have
recommended the minimum period for Podniewicz. Indeed, his
counsel on appeal candidly acknowledged that at least an 18-year
period of ineligibility was warranted.</pre>
    <pre>[57] Jurors, of course, are not given any guidance on the
principles underlying s.745.4 of the Code, but are simply asked
the question prescribed by s.745.2. Still, the trial judge is
required to take their recommendation or even their lack of a
recommendation into account. But when a jury’s recommendation is
unreasonable or irrational, a trial judge is entitled to give it
little or no weight. It is the trial judge, not the jury, who
must impose a fit period of parole ineligibility, a period that
does not bring the criminal justice system into disrepute. In my
view, O’Driscoll J. did not err in his treatment of the
recommendation made by the eight jurors.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[58] I would dismiss the conviction appeals. On the sentence
appeals, the trial judge considered the factors set out in
s.745.4 of the Code. He imposed periods of parole ineligibility
for Podniewicz and Olsen that were within an acceptable range.
Therefore, I would not interfere with the exercise of his
discretion. I would grant leave to appeal the periods of parole
ineligibility, but would dismiss these appeals as well.
