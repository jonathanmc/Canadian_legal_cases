    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            FRIMA OLSZYNKO and FRANK OLSZYNKO (Plaintiffs/
               Appellants) &#150;and&#150; ANNE LAROCQUE, BRUCE W. COWTAN,
               JAMES L. DUGAN and JUDITH DUGAN 
               (Defendants/Respondents)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, WEILER and O&#146;CONNOR JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       William J. Sammon, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Brian Elkin, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 26, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Sedgwick J., sitting with a jury,
dated December 15, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellants&#146; principal ground of appeal was that the
verdict of the jury was perverse with respect to liability and
damages.  To establish that a verdict is perverse, the appellants
must show that it is a dishonest verdict.  In other words, the
appellants must show that the jury did not appreciate their duty
or acted willfully in violation of it.  See Saint John&#146;s Gas
Light Co. v. Hatfield (1894), 23 S.C.R. 164 at 169, quoted with
approval in Graham v. Hodgkinson (1983), 40 O.R. (2d) 697 at 700
(Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[2]  As to liability, the trial judge ruled on a motion to set
aside the verdict that there was evidence to support the verdict
and on this we agree.  As to damages, the appellant Frima
Olszynko&#146;s complaints were subjective and the diagnosis put
forward was fibromyalgia or chronic pain syndrome.  The validity
of this syndrome is based largely upon the credibility of the
patients and, in this case, the appellant&#146;s credibility was
severely compromised by a surveillance video taken over a fifteen-
day period.  Accordingly, the jury&#146;s verdict in awarding zero
damages was based on credibility and cannot be characterized as
perverse.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The trial judge reviewed his charge to the jury with counsel
in his chambers prior to delivering it and, after the charge was
delivered, no objection was taken to it by counsel for the
appellants.  In any event, we find no error in the instructions
given.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Finally, we find no errors in the rulings of the trial
judge, and, in particular, in the ruling with respect to the
manner in which the videotape was introduced into evidence.  The
appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
