</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Peter Cumming J. without a jury
dated July 22, 1998</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The Education Quality Improvement Act, S.O. 1997,  Cc.
31 (the &quot;EQIA&quot;) received royal assent on December 8, 1997.  It
amended in various respects the Education Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. E.2 and in doing so, it brought about fundamental changes in
the governance and funding of education in Ontario.  In the court
below, the EQIA was referred to as &quot;Bill 160&quot;, in reference to
its original enactment.
[2]       In this appeal we are asked to find that several parts
of the EQIA are, for various reasons, unconstitutional.  These
challenges, which we will deal with in turn, are as follows:
  1.   In rendering inoperative the right of separate school boards
     to tax their supporters with respect to separate schools, the
     EQIA violates s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867.</pre>
    <pre>  2.   By limiting the budgeting and spending powers of separate
     school boards and by providing for supervision by the Minister of
     Education of separate school boards in financial difficulty, the
     EQIA also violates s. 93(1).</pre>
    <pre>  3.   The EQIA adversely affects the rights and powers of public
     school boards in the same way and thereby violates the s. 93
     rights of those boards.</pre>
    <pre>  4.   In rendering inoperative the school board right to tax, the
     EQIA is in violation of constitutional convention.</pre>
    <pre>  5.   The EQIA is ultra vires insofar as it permits the Minister
     of Finance to impose school taxes by regulation.
  
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  These issues were the subject of two applications heard
together before the Honourable Mr. Justice Cumming.  His reasons
for judgment were released on July 22, 1998, and are reported at
162 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)).</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Save for the first issue, that of the right to tax, the
other constitutional challenges all failed at first instance.  In
disposing of the first issue, Cumming J. declared the EQIA (and
the Education Act as amended by the EQIA) unconstitutional
insofar as it removes or affects the right or privilege to tax
from the Roman Catholic community with respect to their its
denominational schools.  He suspended the operation of this order
for seventeen months to enable the provincial government to
restore the right to tax to denominational schools by the year
2000.
[5]  In this court the parties divided themselves into two
groups.
[6]  Those seeking to uphold the legislation were led by the
Attorney General of Ontario.  He was supported by the Ontario
Catholic School Trustees Association (&quot;OCSTA&quot;) representing
twenty-nine English language separate school boards.  Also
supporting the Attorney General were the Association franco-
ontarienne des conseils scolaires catholiques (&quot;AFOCSC&quot;)
representing French language separate school trustees and the
Association des conseillers(ères) des écoles publiques de
l'Ontario (&quot;ACEPO&quot;) representing trustees of the four French
language public school boards in Ontario.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Those challenging the legislation were led by the Ontario
English Catholic Teachers' Association (&quot;OECTA&quot;) which represents
some 32,000 separate school teachers in Ontario.  OECTA was
supported by Marshall Jarvis and Claire Ross, two separate school
teachers, and by Annemarie Ross, a separate school supporter.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The second major challenger of the legislation was the
Ontario Public School Boards' Association (&quot;OPSBA&quot;) representing
over ninety public school boards in Ontario.  It was joined by
the Upper Grand District School Board and the Toronto District
School Board.  In the same group were the Ontario Secondary
School Teachers' Federation (&quot;OSSTF&quot;) representing some 35,000
secondary school teachers in the public school system, the
Elementary Teachers' Federation of Ontario (&quot;ETFO&quot;) representing
elementary school teachers in the public school system, Robert
Churchill and Elizabeth Sandals as public school supporters,
David Edwards and Joleene Kemp as separate school supporters, and
Annie Kidder as the spokesperson of People for Education,
representing parents from both public and separate schools in
Ontario.
[9]  With this introduction we now move to the issues raised on
this appeal.  We will address them in turn and, in each case,
will refer to the relevant facts and legislative history
necessary for our discussion of that issue.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Before doing so, however, it is important to underline that
our task is to address the legal issues presented to us.  The
EQIA undoubtedly provides the context for much important policy
debate and public discussion.  It is not for us to participate in
that debate or, indeed, to comment on those matters.  Our task is
to address the legal questions before us and to that we now turn.</pre>
    <pre>THE RIGHT TO TAX</pre>
    <pre>[11] The EQIA added s. 257.106 to the Education Act.  That
section renders inoperative the right to tax held by public and
separate school boards. Cumming J. held that the removal of the
taxation power from separate boards violated the guarantee
provided by s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867.  The Attorney
General and those supporting him appeal from this finding.
[12] Section 93(1) reads as follows:
               In and for each Province the Legislature may exclusively
          make Laws in relation to Education, subject and according to the
          following Provisions:—
               (1)  Nothing in any such Law shall
               prejudicially affect any Right or Privilege
               with respect to Denominational Schools which
               any Class of Persons have by Law in the
               Province at the Union:</pre>
    <pre>[13] The essence of the decision under appeal at the instance of
the Attorney General is captured in the following passage found
at p. 299 of the judgment below:
            There are five certainties.  First, there is a denominational
          right of Roman Catholics in Ontario to a separate school system.
          Second, adequate financing is a necessary means to the real
          achievement of that separate school system.  Third, the language
          of s. 7 of the Scott Act in conferring the right to tax locally
          is clear and express in providing an independent means to the
          Roman Catholic community to achieve the realization of their
          separate school system.  Fourth, the language of s. 93(1)
          protects the rights and privileges &quot;with respect to
          Denominational Schools&quot; accorded by the law, including s. 7 of
          the Scott Act, at Confederation.  Fifth, the right to tax
          locally, recognized by s. 7 of the Scott Act, is repealed by Bill
          160.  Constitutional rights are constitutional rights.  In the
          absence of a constitutional amendment, the province cannot
          lawfuly impinge upon such rights.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[14] The analysis of this issue must begin with a consideration
of s. 93(1) and the jurisprudential approach to it that has
evolved through its much litigated history.
[15] The section represents one of the great compromises which
made Confederation possible.  It accords to the provinces
legislative jurisdiction over education, but provides clear
protection to the denominational educational rights of the
religious minorities in both Canada East and Canada West.  In the
new Ontario, this minority was the Roman Catholic community.
[16] In Reference Re an Act to Amend the Education Act (Ontario)
(1987), 40 D.L.R. (4th) 18 at 44 (S.C.C.) at 44, Wilson J.
described the challenge facing the court as that of breathing
life into this compromise.  She went on to say this at p. 58:
               Section 93(1) should, in my view, be interpreted in a way
          which implements its clear purpose which was to provide a firm
          protection for Roman Catholic education in the province of
          Ontario and Protestant education in the province of Quebec.
     And again, at p. 59:
                    This conclusion, it seems to me, is fully
          consistent with the clear purpose of s. 93,
          namely that the denominational minority's
          interest in a separate but suitable education
          for its children be protected into the
          future.</pre>
    <pre>[17] The importance of taking a purposive approach was underlined
by Iacobucci J. in the recent case of Ontario Homebuilders' Assn.
v. York Region Board of Education (1996), 137 D.L.R. (4th) 449 at
489 (S.C.C.) at 489 when he cautioned that a formalistic
interpretation of s. 93(1) may not, in fact, protect the
substance of the guarantee contained therein.
[18] Without a purposive approach there is a risk that the
delicate compromise embodied in s. 93 could become a historical
straitjacket for both the provincial power to legislate about
education on the one hand, and the denominational guarantee of
separate schools on the other.
[19] Speaking of the provincial jurisdiction over education,
Viscount Cave L.C. put it this way in the famous passage in
Hirsch v. Protestant Board  School Com'rs of Montreal et al.,
[1928] 1 D.L.R. 1041 at 1052 (J.C.P.C.) at 1052:
               While s. 93 of the Act of 1867 protects every right or
          privilege with respect to denominational schools which any class
          of persons may have had by law at the Union, it does not purport
          to stereotype the educational system of the Province as then
          existing.  On the contrary, it expressly authorizes the
          provincial Legislature to make laws in regard to education
          subject only to the provisions of the section; and it is
          difficult to see how the Legislature can effectively exercise the
          power so entrusted to it unless it is to have a large measure of
          freedom to meet new circumstances and needs as they arise.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Referring to the denominational guarantee, Beetz J. in
Greater Montreal Protestant School Board v. Attorney General of
Quebec (1989), 57 D.L.R. (4th)  521 at 536 (S.C.C.) at 536 said
this:
            It is true that the rights or privileges under ordinary law to
          which s. 93(1) refers have been frozen at Confederation.  But
          just like the basic provincial power which, as Viscount Cave
          explained, was not &quot;stereotyped&quot; at the Union, the exception to
          that power has also matured over time through judicial
          interpretation.  The approach courts have taken to the
          interpretation of the expression &quot;with respect to Denominational
          Schools&quot; in cases such as Hull, [Attorney General of Quebec v.
          Greater Hull School Board et al. (1984), 15 D.L.R. (4th) 651
          (S.C.C.)], which I will discuss below, demonstrates that the law
          in force &quot;at the Union&quot; cannot on its own set the content of the
          constitutional right in s. 93(1).</pre>
    <pre>[21] Hence, it is clear that only a purposive approach can move
this great compromise of Confederation across the ages to
preserve for today the delicate balance of interests that is
s. 93.
[22] Where legislation is challenged as violating the
constitutional guarantee of s. 93, the test to be applied was
first elaborated by Chouinard J. in Attorney General of Quebec v.
Greater Hull School Board et al., supra at p. 657.  There must be
a right or privilege affecting a denominational school enjoyed by
a particular class of person by a law, in effect at the time of
the Union and which is prejudicially affected by the challenged
legislation.
[23] In Greater Montreal Protestant School Board, supra at p.
545, Beetz J. provided a significant refinement to the approach
which the court is to apply in determining whether a right is
protected by s. 93.  The court must first distinguish between the
denominational and the non-denominational aspects of
denominational schools, and then further distinguish between
those non-denominational aspects which are necessary to give
effect to denominational guarantees and those which are not.  A
right that is a non-denominational aspect of denominational
schools is protected only insofar as it is necessary to give
effect to denominational guarantees.
[24] The right at stake here is the right of separate school
boards to tax separate school supporters for education purposes.
This right was clearly provided for at Confederation by s. 7 of
the Act to restore to Roman Catholics in Upper Canada certain
rights in respect to Separate Schools (1863), 26 Vic. C. 5.  This
Act, known as the Scott Act, provided the following in s. 7:
               7.  The Trustees of Separate Schools forming a body
          corporate under this Act, shall have the power to impose, levy
          and collect School rates or subscriptions, upon and from persons
          sending children to, or subscribing towards the support of such
          Schools, and shall have all the powers in respect of Separate
          Schools, that the Trustees of Common Schools have and possess
          under the provisions of the Act relating to Common Schools.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[25] The companion to s. 7 was s. 20 of the Scott Act which reads
as follows:
            20.  Every Separate School shall be entitled to a share in the
          fund annually granted by the Legislature of this Province for the
          support of Common Schools, and shall be entitled also to a share
          in all other public grants, investments and allotments for Common
          School purposes now made or hereafter to be made by the Province
          or the Municipal authorities, according to the average number of
          pupils attending such school during the twelve next preceding
          months, or during the number of months which may have elapsed
          from the establishment of a new Separate School, as compared with
          the whole average number of pupils attending School in the same
          City, Town, Village or Township.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Together these two sections provided the means of financing
separate schools at the time of Confederation.  This financing
regime was created in the context of the general purpose of the
Scott Act as set out in its preamble:
            WHEREAS it is just and proper to restore to Roman Catholics in
          Upper Canada certain rights which they formerly enjoyed in
          respect to separate Schools, and to bring the provisions of the
          Law respecting Separate Schools more in harmony with the
          provisions of the Law respecting Common Schools….
          
</pre>
    <pre>[27] Accordingly, the context in which s. 93(1) was written was
one where funding for both separate and public schools in Ontario
came from a combination of local taxes as set by the particular
school board and provincial grants. Complete provincial
responsibility for the financing of education was simply outside
the experience of the founders of Confederation.
[28] The record in this matter contains much history of the
financing of education in Ontario since 1867.  It is sufficient
to say that this history shows that the relative importance of
local taxes compared to provincial grants in funding education
has waxed and waned over the years.  Two problems, though, have
remained relatively constant for separate schools in Ontario.
First, the assessment base per pupil provided by separate school
supporters has generally been poorer than the assessment base
available to public schools so that at the same tax rate, less
funding per pupil is provided from local taxes to separate school
boards than to their counterparts in the public system.  Second,
because local taxpayers can switch their support from the
separate school to the public school, separate school boards have
generally been constrained from imposing a higher tax rate than
that imposed by their counterpart public boards for fear of
taxpayer migration.
[29] Cumming J. set out his finding in this respect as follows at
p. 275:
               Another aspect of the complex funding dilemmas has been that
          the fiscal autonomy of separate boards has been somewhat illusory
          in reality.  As a practical matter, a separate school board was
          limited in the mill rate it could impose by that set by the
          coterminous public board.  Experience has shown that a separate
          board cannot tax at a higher rate than the coterminous public
          school board or the separate school board will lose some of its
          supporters to the public school system, and its tax base will
          erode.  Therefore, in reality, the separate boards have been
          captive to the taxing decisions of their coterminous public
          school boards.</pre>
    <pre>[30] The EQIA introduced an entirely new approach to the raising
of funds for education and to the expenditure of those funds.  As
to the former, the right to tax held by both public boards and
separate boards is made inoperative.  Local taxes remain a source
of funding, although much less important.  The provincial
Minister of Finance sets the local tax rate to be paid by both
public school supporters and separate school supporters.  The
balance of the funding is provided from provincial funds.
[31] The EQIA, in s. 234(2), requires that education funding will
be distributed fairly and without discrimination as between
public boards and separate boards.  Funding equivalence with
public schools is, therefore, statutorily guaranteed to separate
schools.
[32] Moreover, there can be no argument raised that under the
EQIA the overall level of funding provided to separate boards is
reduced to a level that is inadequate to ensure the continued
viability of the separate system.  Indeed, at pp. 297-298 of his
reasons for judgment Cumming J. had this to say:
               The rights guaranteed by s. 93(1) include the right to
          proportional sharing by separate schools in provincial government
          funding for education.  Bill 160 meets this obligation.  As well,
          the Government has brought a greater quantitative amount of
          funding to the overall separate school system through the
          redistribution scheme inherent to Bill 160.  In this sense, Bill
          160 enhances the separate school system at this point in time by
          providing more monies to it.</pre>
    <pre>[33] Set in this context, then, the debate is whether the right
of separate boards to tax their supporters is constitutionally
protected by s. 93(1).  The appellant Attorney General's
position, stripped to its essentials, is that what is protected
by s. 93 is not the right to tax but funding of the separate
school system necessary to provide its students with the
constitutional guarantee of equality of educational opportunity.
Since the EQIA supports and does not undermine this objective it
does not violate s. 93.
[34] While OCSTA supports this position, it also argues for
constitutional protection of the assessment base provided by the
supporters of the separate system as insurance against a day when
locally imposed taxes might be necessitated to preserve the
separate system in the face of a removal of provincial funding.
Since the EQIA provides for provincially imposed taxes to be
levied on separate school supporters, this assessment base is
preserved by the challenged legislation.
[35] On the other hand, OECTA and those supporting its position
argue that Cumming J. was correct in finding the right to tax to
be constitutionally protected.  They say that binding
jurisprudence dictates this result and that the right to tax is
necessary to assure the autonomy of the separate school system
which is at the heart of the constitutional guarantee.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[36] It is appropriate to begin the analysis by turning to the
jurisprudence that is said to constitutionally guarantee the
right to tax.
[37] The principal decision relied on by the respondents is
Attorney General of Quebec v. Greater Hull School Board et al,
supra.  The context of this decision was the province of Quebec
education system, whereunder which both Catholic and Protestant
schools in Montreal and Quebec City are accorded s. 93
protection.  The case concerned provincial legislation passed in
1979 in Quebec that made significant changes to the financing of
denominational education in that province.
[38] One of the legislated changes that was challenged in the
litigation was the change made to the power of local school
boards to tax their supporters for educational purposes.  The
1979 legislation introduced the requirement that the power to
impose taxes above a specified level be subjected to approval by
referendum.  However, the legislation did not limit the voters in
the referendum to the supporters of the particular school board.
This aspect of the legislation was found by the Supreme Court of
Canada to violate the s. 93 guarantee.  Speaking for the
majority, Chouinard J. put his conclusion this way at p. 668:
               Under the 1861 Act, school commissioners and trustees had
          the power to levy taxes &quot;in their respective municipalities&quot;.
          Catholic and Protestant commissioners in Montreal and Quebec and
          the trustees of dissentient schools had the power to levy such
          taxes on their Catholic or Protestant populations, as the case
          might be.  It is a prejudicial invasion of the rights and
          privileges of classes of persons encompassed by s. 93 to subject
          the exercise of the power of a school board to decide on an
          expense requiring a tax, to the approval of all electors in the
          Island of Montreal, whatever school board they belong to and
          whatever their religious affiliation.</pre>
    <pre>[39] It was argued that this constitutes a finding that the right
of denominational school boards to tax their supporters is
constitutionally guaranteed by s. 93 in all circumstances.
However, a closer reading of the case indicates that this is not
correct.
[40] Chouinard J.'s concern was not simply that the right to tax
was tampered with.  Rather, he was troubled by the way in which
it was limited.  The defect in the 1979 legislation was that it
subjected the right to tax the denominational community to the
control of those outside that community.  That was the
prejudicial effect of the challenged amendments.  In other words,
Chouinard J.'s judgment does not support the conclusion that
there is a constitutionally guaranteed local right to tax
simpliciter.  Rather, it establishes that where there is to be a
local right to set the tax to be paid by denominational
supporters, s. 93 requires that that right it be exercised by the
denominational community itself, free of control from outsiders.
[41] This reading of Greater Hull is consistent with the Supreme
Court of Canada decision in Reference re Education Act (Quebec)
(1993), 105 D.L.R. (4th) 266.  There, Gonthier J., speaking for
the full court, referred at 285-286 to Greater Hull as
establishing that the right of commissioners and trustees to levy
taxes within the boundaries of their respective municipalities is
a right protected by s. 93(1).
[42] That he was referring, not to the right to tax simpliciter,
but rather to the right to exercise the power to tax free from
control of those outside the boundaries of the denominational
community is made clear by his later discussion at pp. 321-322.
There, he was considering the constitutionality of certain
provisions in Bill 107 that transferred the local school taxing
power for the entire island of Montreal to the Conseil scolaire
de l'île de Montréal.  This transfer created the possibility that
a dissentient school board that was newly created on the island
of Montreal, but outside the City of Montreal, would not have the
right to tax which it would have had in 1867.  Gonthier J. found
that this did not violate the s. 93 guarantee and that Bill 107
met the requirements laid down in Greater Hull.  He put it this
way at pp. 321-322:
               A problem would arise in the event a dissentient school were
          created outside the territory of the City of Montreal, either as
          the result of a reduction in the territory of the denominational
          boards in Montreal or otherwise.  In such a situation, a
          dissentient school could then be created on the island of
          Montreal and, under Bill 107, it would be subject to the
          authority of the Conseil, while, as I have just said, it would
          &quot;ordinarily&quot; have the right to collect its taxes itself.  It is
          not certain that this would have a prejudicial effect.
               One may also take a broad view of the
          guarantees offered by the Constitution, as
          does René Hurtubise, &quot;La confessionnalité de
          notre système scolaire et les garanties
          constitutionnelles&quot; (1962), 65 R. du N. 167.
          According to that author, and I share his
          view, fundamentally what matters is having
          the financial and physical resources to
          operate school boards.  The taxing power is
          only one possible means of attaining this
          end.  If it can be done otherwise, such as by
          an equal, or at least appropriate and
          equitable, allocating of financing sources,
          it is hard to speak of a prejudicial effect.</pre>
    <pre>[43] Thus, the fundamental necessity in financing denominational
education is having the financial and physical resources to
operate the separate school system.
[44] This theme conclusion is reinforced by Reference re an Act
to Amend the Education Act (Ontario), supra.  There, Wilson J.
found that the constitutionally guaranteed right to a separate
school system includes secondary school as well as elementary
school. At p. 59 she says stated in reference to this right of
the Roman Catholic community to have their children receive
instruction at the secondary school level:
               It is clear that if the foregoing right was to be meaningful
          an adequate level of funding was required to support it.  This
          court held unanimously in A.-G. Que. v. Greater Hull School Board
          (1984), 15 D.L.R. (4th) 651, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 575, 28 M.P.L.R.
          146, that the right of dissentient schools in Quebec to a
          proportionate share of government funding was a right protected
          by s. 93 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  Likewise, in my view,
          the right of separate schools in Ontario.  They were entitled to
          the proportionate funding provided for in s. 20 of the Scott Act.
          This conclusion, it seems to me, is fully consistent with the
          clear purpose of s. 93, namely that the denominational minority's
          interest in a separate but suitable education for its children be
          protected into the future.</pre>
    <pre>[45] The theme holding is picked up again reaffirmed in Ontario
Homebuilders' Association, supra.  That case focussed on the
right of denominational schools found in s. 20 of the Scott Act
to share in provincial education grants rather than the right of
denominational school boards to tax their supporters.
Nevertheless, at p. 490 Iacobucci J. spoke of the constitutional
baseline provided by s. 93(1) in the following terms:
            While the notion of proportionality contained in s. 20 of the
          Scott Act is a constitutional right embodied in s. 93(1), the
          substantive purpose of this notion must be borne in mind: the
          achievement of an educational system that distributes provincial
          funds in a fair and non-discriminatory manner to common and
          separate schools alike.  This is the substantive guarantee
          offered by s. 93(1).</pre>
    <pre>[46] The conclusion, therefore, is that the jurisprudence does
not support the proposition that s. 93(1) guarantees to
denominational school boards the right to tax simpliciter.  The
constitutional protection is not so narrowly focussed.  Rather,
s. 93(1) guarantees to the separate school community financial
resources distributed in a fair and non-discriminatory manner in
such a way as to manifest the purpose of the section,; namely, in
Wilson J.'s eloquent phrase, that the denominational minority's
interest in a separate but suitable education for its children be
protected into the future.
[47] This conclusion drawn from the jurisprudence is firmly
grounded in principle.  The right of separate school boards to
tax their supporters for separate school purposes is a right
affecting denominational schools enjoyed by the Roman Catholic
community by law at Confederation.  This right to tax is clearly
a non-denominational aspect of denominational schools.  However,
to attract the protection of s. 93(1) it must be a right which is
necessary to give effect to denominational guarantees.  It is
this criterion which cannot be met.
[48] The right to tax is simply a particular method of funding
denominational education.  There is nothing denominational about
the right to tax, nor does it serve denominational ends that
other ways of funding the separate system would not.  It is the
existence of funding, not the specific method used to provide it,
that ensures the survival of the separate school system and
permits those responsible for it to make the expenditure
decisions that are required to ensure its denominational
character.  For these objectives to be achieved there is no need
that the funding be provided by way of taxes imposed by separate
school boards on their supporters.
[49] If there is funding the separate school system can continue
to exist and can continue to provide education with a
denominational character, with or without the right to tax.  It
is the funding, not the right to tax, that is the necessity.
[50] Moreover, we do not agree that the right to tax is
constitutionally guaranteed because it protects the financial
autonomy of the separate school system.
[51] First, the right to tax has historically not given the
separate system financial autonomy.  Its poorer assessment base
and the risk of taxpayer migration away from the system have
always placed very significant practical constraints on the power
of separate school boards to tax their supporters.  The right to
tax has never provided separate school boards with more than
limited financial autonomy.
[52] Second, even if the right to tax could be said to give a
certain measure of financial autonomy to the separate system,
that is not necessary to protect the constitutional guarantee.
What is necessary is that there be funding for the separate
system sufficient to continue to deliver separate but suitable
education for Roman Catholic children.
[53] This constitutionally protected right is not as tightly
drawn as the right to tax.  Hence, it permits the province
considerable flexibility in legislating in relation to education
so as to meet new circumstances and needs as they arise.  The
delicate balance of s. 93(1) is thus preserved.
[54] Our conclusion, therefore, is that the EQIA does not violate
s. 93(1) insofar as it renders inoperative the right to tax.
That right is not constitutionally protected.  Moreover, the
legislation does not prejudicially affect the right to funding
that is guaranteed by s. 93(1).  It provides greater funding to
separate schools than that previously available and it ensures
that funding for education is distributed equitably to separate
schools and public schools alike.  It respects the constitutional
guarantee of s. 93(1).
[55] We have found that there is a constitutionally guaranteed
right to funding which the EQIA does not diminish.  It is,
therefore, unnecessary to address the argument of OCSTA that this
constitutional protection extends to protect the denominational
assessment base.  OCSTA acknowledges that the EQIA preserves that
base and cannot, therefore, be said to prejudicially affect it.
This constitutional issue is best left to be resolved in a
context in which the legislation puts that assessment base at
risk.
[56] In the result, the appeal on this issue must be allowed, the
declarations of unconstitutionality must be set aside, and the
applications in this respect must be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     THE RIGHT OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[57] In the challenge to the EQIA, OECTA, and those in like
interest, say that the legislation violates the constitutionally
protected right of financial management held by separate school
boards over separate schools in two respects.  First, the EQIA
imposes a regulatory regime on both public school boards and
separate school boards that places certain limits on their
ability to make spending decisions.  Second, Division D of the
EQIA (s. 257.30 to s. 257.52) provides for supervision by the
Minister of Education of separate school boards in financial
difficulty.
[58] The essence of OECTA's argument is that in both respects the
EQIA violates s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act because it
prejudicially affects the constitutional right of the Roman
Catholic community to separate management and control of its
denominational schools by imposing restrictions on the autonomy
of separate school boards to make spending decisions.
[59] Cumming J. found that in neither respect did the EQIA
violate s. 93(1).  First, he concluded that there was no evidence
of any prejudicial effect on a denominational right because of
the restrictions on the power of financial management imposed by
the EQIA.  Second, he found that Division D of the EQIA set out
defined and assessable standards both for the imposition and
removal of the vesting order by which the Minister of Education
takes over supervision of a separate school board in financial
difficulty.  He concluded that the legislation meets the
requirement of s. 93(1).
[60] For the reasons that follow, we agree with these
conclusions.  We will deal in turn with these two challenges made
to the EQIA.</pre>
    <pre>     LIMITATIONS ON SPENDING AUTONOMY</pre>
    <pre>[61] As we have described, s. 93(1) represents a delicate balance
between the province's right to legislate in respect of education
and the constitutional protection accorded to separate schools.
The application of s. 93(1) must be done purposively.  It
requires that there be a right or privilege affecting a
denominational school enjoyed by a particular class of persons by
law at Confederation and which is prejudicially affected by the
challenged legislation.  The protection of s. 93(1) extends to
denominational aspects of denominational schools, as well as non-
denominational aspects, necessary to give effect to
denominational guarantees.
[62] The analysis of OECTA's argument on this issue must begin
with an examination of the spending power held by separate school
boards by law at Confederation.  That s. 93(1) protects only
rights and privileges held by law was established by Wilson J. in
Reference Re an Act to Amend the Education Act (Ontario), supra
at p. 45:
               It must be remembered, however, that s. 93(1) only protects
          rights and privileges guaranteed by law.  Our task therefore is
          to examine the laws in force prior to Confederation to see what
          rights or privileges they gave.  Whether various bodies or
          officials were in fact exercising the powers statutorily
          conferred upon them is irrelevant to our inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>[63] By s. 7 of the Scott Act separate school trustees were given
the same powers as public school trustees.  To reiterate, s. 7
reads as follows:
            7.  The Trustees of Separate Schools forming a body corporate
          under this Act, shall have the power to impose, levy and collect
          School rates or subscriptions, upon and from persons sending
          children to, or subscribing towards the support of such Schools,
          and shall have all the powers in respect of Separate Schools,
          that the Trustees of Common Schools have and possess under the
          provisions of the Act relating to Common Schools.</pre>
    <pre>[64] The spending power of public school trustees (or common
school trustees as they were known at Confederation) is found in
An Act respecting Common Schools in Upper Canada, 22 Vict., c. 64
(known as the Common Schools Act of 1859), particularly in ss. 27
and 79.  Broadly speaking, that legislation gave trustees the
power to make expenditures for school purposes including
expenditures for maintaining school buildings, purchasing
equipment and paying teachers' salaries.  The relevant parts of
ss. 27 and 79 read as follows:
            27.  It shall be the duty of the Trustees of each school
          section, and they are hereby empowered:
                                    . . .
                 10.  To provide for
              the salaries of Teachers and all other
              expenses of the School, in such manner as may
              be desired by a majority of the freeholders
              and householders of such section, at the
              annual school meeting, or at a special
              meeting called for that purpose, and to
              employ all lawful means, to collect the sums
              required for such salaries and other
              expenses; and should the sums thus provided
              be insufficient to defray all the expenses of
              such school, the Trustees may assess and
              cause to be collected an additional rate, in
              order to pay the balance of the Teacher's
              salary and other expenses of such school;
          </pre>
    <pre>               79.  It shall be the duty of the Board
          of School Trustees of every City, Town and
          Village respectively, and they are hereby
          authorized:
                             . . .
                5.  To manage or dispose of such
               property, and all moneys or income for
               Common School purposes;
          
</pre>
    <pre>[65] However, in 1867 neither public nor separate school boards
had unconstrained autonomy in spending decisions.  While s. 20 of
the Scott Act gave separate schools the right to an equitable
share of provincial grants for education, ss. 123 and 124 of the
Common Schools Act made it clear that both public and separate
schools were required to spend these funds wholly on teachers'
salaries.  Sections 123 and 124 read as follows:
            123.  The sum of money apportioned annually by the Chief
          Superintendent of Education to each County, Township, City, Town
          or Village, in aid of Common Schools therein respectively, shall
          be payable on or before the first day of July, in each year, to
          the Treasurer of each County, City, Town and Village, in such way
          as the Governor in Council from time to time directs, and such
          sum, together with at least an equal sum raised annually by local
          assessment, shall constitute and be called the Common School Fund
          of such County, Township, City, Town or Village; and no part of
          the Salaries of the Chief or Local Superintendents, nor of any
          other persons except Teachers employed or of any expenses
          incurred in the execution of this Act, shall be paid out of the
          said Common School Fund, but such Fund shall wholly and without
          diminution, be expended in the payment of Teachers' Salaries as
          herein provided.
               124.  No County, City, Town or Village
          shall be entitled to a share of the
          Legislative School Grant without raising by
          assessment a sum at least equal (clear of all
          charges for collection) to the share of the
          said School Grant apportioned to it; and
          should the Municipal Corporation of any
          County, City, Town or Village, raise in any
          one year a less sum than that apportioned to
          it out of the Legislative School Grant, the
          Chief Superintendent of education shall
          deduct a sum equal to the deficiency, from
          the apportionment to such County, City, Town
          or Village, in the following year.</pre>
    <pre>[66] A further important legal constraint on the spending power
of separate school boards at Confederation was the regulatory
authority of the provincial office of the Council of Public
Instruction. Section 114 of the Common Schools Act created the
Council of Public Instruction as an agency for the province.  By
s. 119(4) the Council was empowered to make such regulations as
it deemed expedient for the organization, government and
discipline of common schools. Section 26 of the Scott Act made
separate schools subject to such regulatory authority as the
Common Schools Act did in respect of public schools.  Section 26
of the Scott Act reads as follows:
            26.  The Roman Catholic Separate Schools, (with their
          Registers), shall be subject to such inspection, as may be
          directed from time to time, by the Chief Superintendent of
          Education, and shall be subject also, to such regulations, as may
          be imposed, from time to time, by the Council of Public
          Instruction for Upper Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[67] In Reference Re an Act to Amend the Education Act (Ontario),
supra Wilson J. made clear that the regulatory authority of the
Council was not unfettered and could not be used to frustrate the
very legislative scheme under which the authority was conferred.
It could not nullify the separate school trustees' power under
the Scott Act to provide a secondary level of instruction in
their schools if they deemed it appropriate.
[68] Two years later, in Greater Montreal Protestant School
Board, supra Wilson J., in concurring reasons, described the
other side of the coin, namely the extent of the Council's
regulatory authority in the context of the s. 93(1) analysis.
The issue in that case concerned the extent to which of the
protection provided by s. 93(1) protects the right of
denominational trustees to control by denominational trustees of
the separate school curriculum.
[69] At p. 554 of that judgment she concluded that while separate
schools enjoyed a substantial measure of control over the
curriculum as a factual matter at the time of Union, the s. 93(1)
protection accorded was limited because &quot;… the Province of
Ontario had by law the overriding authority to restrict that
control if it so desired, provided that in doing so it did not
undermine the denominational character of the separate schools&quot;.
[70] This overriding provincial regulatory authority thus limited
the constitutional protection accorded to control over curriculum
by denominational schools to that control necessary to secure the
denominational character of the separate schools.
[71] This reasoning applies equally to the right of separate
school boards to make spending decisions.  At Confederation the
Council had the overriding regulatory authority to restrict
expenditure decisions provided that in doing so the
denominational character of the separate schools was not
undermined.  Hence, even if the provincial office of the Council
did not in fact exercise its regulatory authority over separate
boards' spending decisions in 1867, the existence of this
authority limits the scope of the constitutional protection
accorded by s. 93(1) to spending decisions necessary to secure
the denominational character of the separate schools.
[72] It is next necessary to examine the constraints on the
spending decisions of separate school trustees that are imposed
by the EQIA.  Section 234 of the Act empowers the Lieutenant
Governor in Council to make regulations governing the making of
grants for educational purposes from money appropriated by the
legislature.  Ontario Reg. 287/98, passed pursuant to this
authority, sets out the new funding model for public and separate
schools in Ontario.  Each school board receives an annual
foundation grant made up of ten components.  It also receives
annually specialized grants including a pupil accommodation
grant, a phase-in adjustment, and nine special purposes grants,
one being for special education and another being for school
administration.  These various categories of funding are defined
by the model as either &quot;classroom spending&quot; or &quot;non-classroom
spending&quot;.
[73] The model imposes specific restrictions on spending by
school boards. First, funds cannot be shifted from &quot;classroom
spending&quot; to &quot;non-classroom spending&quot;, although the reverse is
permitted.  Second, special education grants may not be spent on
other costs.  Third, certain parts of the pupil accommodation
grant may be used only for construction expenditures.  Fourth,
the school board administration grant cannot be supplemented from
any other grant.  Finally, the model determines the total funding
which each board will receive each year, thereby providing a
ceiling on board expenditures for that year.
[74] It is these constraints that OECTA contends prejudicially
affect the right of separate school boards to the spending
autonomy that is said to be constitutionally protected by
s. 93(1).  For the following reasons this contention must fail.
[75] First, none of the constraints created under the EQIA
prejudicially affects powers over spending held by separate
school boards in 1867 that were protected by s. 93(1).  Because
of the existence in 1867 of the overriding provincial regulatory
authority, such spending powers are limited to those necessary to
secure the denominational character of school boards.  The EQIA
restrictions apply equally to public and separate school boards
so as to limit the spending power of trustees of both school
systems in relation to matters that are entirely non-
denominational.  For example, public school boards and separate
school boards alike are prohibited from making non-classroom
expenditures from funds designated for classroom expenditures.
There is nothing in the record that would permit the conclusion
that this limitation affects in any way the spending necessary to
secure the denominational character of separate schools.  The
same is true of the other spending restrictions imposed under the
EQIA.  There is no suggestion that any of these limits prevent
separate school boards from hiring Roman Catholic teachers or
chaplains, from providing space for chapels, or from designing
and delivering denominational aspects of the curriculum.
[76] Second, the s. 93 analysis propounded by Beetz J. in Greater
Montreal Protestant School Board, supra yields the same
conclusion.  There is nothing in the record to suggest that
limitations on the spending powers of separate school boards
prejudicially affect any right or privilege of these boards which
is necessary to give effect to denominational guarantees.  The
spending limits simply do not appear to damage the continuing
viability of the separate school system, or its ability to
provide suitable education with a denominational character.
[77] We therefore agree with Cumming J. who rejected OECTA's
argument in this respect at p. 286:
               This submission is rejected.  Leaving aside the issue of the
          right to tax locally and the possible consequences of the denial
          of the right, there is not otherwise any evidence of any
          prejudicial effect on a denominational right because of the
          strictures upon the powers of management imposed by Bill 160.
          Within the constraints of the spending envelopes for all school
          boards under Bill 160, the separate school boards retain full
          managerial discretion.  The prescriptive elements of the new
          funding model will direct board spending to a considerable
          degree.  However, there is nothing to suggest that Catholic
          boards will be prevented from taking denominational matters into
          account in all aspects of their operations, such as teacher
          hiring, curriculum, programs and in respect of capital
          facilities. [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[78] Third, we disagree with the submission of OECTA that these
limitations are unconstitutional because they constitute a
restriction on the full spending autonomy of separate school
boards which is argued to be necessarily inherent in the
constitutional right to have a separate school system.  There
can, of course, be no doubt that s. 93(1) guarantees the
denominational minority a separate system in which to educate
their children.  That guarantee does not, however, stretch to the
kind of complete autonomy contended for by OECTA – an autonomy,
as we have described, which did not exist by law in 1867 and
which is not necessary to protect the constitutional value.
Moreover, just because there must be a separate denominational
school system does not necessarily mean that separate school
boards must have full spending autonomy.  On the contrary, the
history of separate schools, both before and after Confederation,
reveals that the system has remained distinct and viable without
such autonomy.
[79] We therefore conclude that Cumming J. was correct in finding
that the EQIA does not impose unconstitutional limits on the
spending rights of separate school boards.</pre>
    <pre>     PROVINCIAL SUPERVISION OF SEPARATE SCHOOL BOARDS</pre>
    <pre>[80] Division D of the EQIA lays out a detailed scheme providing
for provincial supervision of the affairs of a school board that
has experienced certain defined financial difficulties.  These
provisions replace those of the Municipal Affairs Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. M. 46 which empower the province to take supervisory
authority over a municipality or school board once certain pre-
conditions, as spelled out in that legislation, have arisen.
[81] Division D is triggered where a school board has a deficit
in a fiscal year (something prohibited by the EQIA), fails to pay
its debts when due, or otherwise conducts itself so that the
Minister of Education has concerns about its ability to meet its
financial obligations.  In any of these circumstances, the
Minister may direct an investigation of the board's financial
affairs.
[82] Where the investigation report recommends provincial
supervision due to financial default, deficit, or serious
financial mismanagement, the Lieutenant Governor in Council may
make an order vesting in the Ministry the administration of the
affairs of the board.  Likewise, where after receiving the
investigation report the Minister has issued a direction to the
board that in his opinion has not been complied with, the same
result is mandated.
[83] Section 257.50 provides that once the Lieutenant Governor in
Council is of the opinion that the affairs of the board no longer
need provincial supervision, or once the board ceases to have a
deficit for a fiscal year, the vesting order must be revoked.
[84] At first instance, and on appeal, both sides argued that the
resolution of this issue depended upon the applicability of the
relevant jurisprudence, particularly Ottawa Separate School
Trustees v. City of Ottawa (1916), 32 D.LR. 10 (J.C.P.C.) and Re
Ottawa Separate Schools (1917), 40 D.L.R. 465 (O.S.C. App. Div.).
[85] Cumming J. concluded that Division D of the EQIA did not
impinge on the constitutional guarantee accorded to separate
schools by s. 93(1).  He put it this way at pp. 305-306 of his
reasons:
               Because Division D meets the concerns identified in Ottawa
          Separate School Trustees and Re Ottawa Separate Schools, it is,
          on its face, constitutionally valid.  There are defined and
          assessable standards, both for the imposition and removal of a
          vesting order.  That is all that is necessary to meet the
          requirement of s. 93(1).</pre>
    <pre>[86] In Ottawa Separate School Trustees, supra, the Privy Council
struck down provincial legislation which, in essence, permitted a
provincial commission to take over the affairs of a school board
whenever the Minister was of the opinion that the board had
failed to comply with any of the provisions of the Education Act.
The legislation permitted this provincial supervision to continue
until the Minister thought it was desirable to restore to the
board its authority.
[87] The central concern of the Privy Council was the indefinite
nature of this suspending power.  This concern was expressed as
follows at p. 13:
               The case before their Lordships is not that of a mere
          interference with a right or privilege, but of a provision which
          enables it to be withdrawn in toto for an indefinite time.  Their
          Lordships have no doubt that the power so given would be
          exercised with wisdom and moderation, but it is the creation of
          the power and not its exercise that is subject to objection, and
          the objection would not be removed even though the powers
          conferred were never exercised at all.  To give authority to
          withdraw a right or privilege under these conditions necessarily
          operates to the prejudice of the class of person affected by the
          withdrawal.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[88] Following this decision the Ontario legislature enacted
replacement legislation which more precisely defined the
circumstances under which the province could assume the authority
of a school board and when that authority had to be returned to
the board.  In Re Ontario Separate Schools, supra this
legislation was found not to violate the s. 93(1) guarantee.
[89] In his book, Constitutional Law of Canada, (Toronto:
Carswell, 1992) 3rd. ed., at p. 54 Professor Peter Hogg offers
this explanation of these two cases, with which we agree:
               In the Court's view, it was the indefinite and discretionary
          nature of the suspending power in the first statute which made it
          bad.  The more limited suspending power in the second statute was
          good.  A provision calculated only to secure the observance of
          the law by separate school trustees was not inconsistent with the
          trustees' power of management, because that power should not be
          treated as enabling the trustees to conduct their schools in
          defiance of the law.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[90] When this jurisprudence is applied to Division D of the
EQIA, it is clear that the present legislation does not leave the
removal of the authority of a board to the unlimited discretion
of the Minister.  Nor can that supervision run for an indefinite
time.  The imposition of a vesting order first requires a serious
financial situation – a board which has incurred a deficit
(something that is unlawful under this legislation), defaults on
its debts, or raises ministerial concerns about its ability to
meet its financial obligations.  It also requires an
investigation that recommends vesting, or results in ministerial
directions that in the Minister's view are not followed.
Finally, the vesting order is subject to automatic termination
either when the Lieutenant Governor in Council is of the opinion
it is no longer necessary, or when the board ceases to run a
deficit in a fiscal year.
[91] The conditions for a vesting order and the provisions for
its termination are designed to ensure compliance with the EQIA.
They do not provide an unconstrained provincial discretion to
suspend indefinitely the powers of the separate school board.
Rather, they are sufficiently defined and precise that they
cannot be said to prejudicially affect the right of separate
school trustees to financially manage their schools.  Division D
of the EQIA, therefore, does not violate s. 93(1) of the
Constitution Act.
[92] In the result, these two aspects of the challenge to the
EQIA both fail.  In neither respect does this legislation
prejudicially affect the constitutionally protected right of
financial management held by separate school boards for separate
schools.  The appeal by OECTA from Cumming J. on this issue must
be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>THE RIGHTS AND POWERS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARDS AND s. 93(1) OF THE
CONSTITUTION ACT, 1867</pre>
    <pre>[93] In their challenge to the EQIA, the OPSBA appellants argue
that the legislation violates s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act,
1867 because it adversely affects the rights and powers of public
school boards to raise revenue and to make budgetary and
expenditure decisions.  According to these appellants, s. 93(1)
implicitly incorporates the principle of equal treatment of the
separate and public school systems.  They assert that s. 93(1)
guarantees to public school boards, like the separate school
boards, the right to raise revenue through local taxation and to
control budget and expenditures.  They further contend that the
EQIA contravenes s. 93(1) by eliminating the right of public
school boards to levy taxes and by imposing constraints on the
budgetary and expenditure decisions of public school trustees.</pre>
    <pre>[94] Having concluded that s. 93(1) does not guarantee to
separate school boards the right to raise revenue through local
taxation and, further, that it does not guarantee unconstrained
autonomy over expenditure decisions, it follows that the rights
asserted in favour of the public school system do not exist.
Accordingly, the argument that the EQIA contravenes s. 93(1) in
respect of public schools also fails.  It is unnecessary to
address the submission that s. 93(1) extends to public schools
the same constitutional protection that it does to separate
schools.


</pre>
    <pre>THE DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION</pre>
    <pre>[95] OPSBA advanced the alternative argument that if the EQIA
provisions removing the power of school boards to determine and
levy property tax rates are found not to contravene s. 93(1) of
the Constitution Act, then these provisions nonetheless
contravene the doctrine of constitutional convention.  According
to OPSBA, a constitutional convention arises in regard to the
right of school boards to levy and determine property taxes
because such a right was a fundamental term of Confederation and,
therefore, cannot be unilaterally altered by the provincial
government.</pre>
    <pre>[96] Constitutional conventions are rules of the Constitution
that are not legally enforceable.  These rules prescribe the way
in which legal powers are to be exercised. Constitutional
conventions are generally regarded as politically, but not
legally binding.</pre>
    <pre>[97] The Supreme Court described constitutional conventions as
follows in Re Resolution to Amend the Constitution, [1981] 1
S.C.R. 753 at 880-81:
     </pre>
    <pre>          The conventional rules of the constitution present one
          striking peculiarity.  In contradistinction to the laws
          of the constitution, they are not enforced by the
          courts.  One main reason for this situation is that,
          unlike common law rules, conventions are not judge-made
          rules.  They are not based on judicial precedents but
          on precedents established by the institutions of
          government themselves.  Nor are they in the nature of
          statutory commands which it is the function and duty of
          the courts to obey and enforce. Furthermore, to enforce
          them would mean to administer some formal sanction when
          they are breached.  But the legal system from which
          they are distinct does not contemplate formal sanctions
          for their breach.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Perhaps the main reason why conventional rules cannot
          be enforced by the courts is that they are generally in
          conflict with the legal rules which they postulate and
          the courts are bound to enforce the legal rules.  The
          conflict is not of a type which would entail the
          commission of any illegality.  It results from the fact
          that legal rules create wide powers, discretions and
          rights which conventions prescribe should be exercised
          only in a certain limited manner, if at all.
</pre>
    <pre>[98] The view that conventions are not to be enforced by the
courts was reinforced in Reference Re Succession of Quebec,
[1998] 2 S.C.R. 217 at 270:
          The respective roles of the courts and political actors
          in discharging the constitutional obligations we have
          identified follows ineluctably from the foregoing
          observations.  In the Patriation Reference, a
          distinction was drawn between the law of the
          Constitution, which, generally speaking, will be
          enforced by the courts, and other constitutional rules,
          such as the conventions of the Constitution, which
          carry only political sanctions.
</pre>
    <pre>[99] Cumming J. dismissed the constitutional convention argument
with brief reasons.  He concluded that while conventions may be
“part” of the Constitution, they are not a justiciable part.  He
observed that regardless of whether or not there is in fact a
constitutional convention, it cannot be applied so as to strike
down or overrule a clear and specific law.  He further noted that
at p. 322:  “[w]hatever the application of conventions, it seems
extremely unlikely that any such putative convention as the one
proposed by the applicants could exist.  For such a convention to
exist, it would be an expansion of an explicitly defined right in
s. 93, in the face of another explicitly defined capacity, the
province’s power to legislate in this field.”
     
</pre>
    <pre>[100]     We agree with Cumming J.'s conclusion that the
constitutional convention argument advanced by OPSBA cannot
succeed and adopt his reasons for that conclusion.  Accordingly,
this challenge to the legislation also fails.</pre>
    <pre>DELEGATION OF THE POWER TO PRESCRIBE THE RATE OF TAX</pre>
    <pre>[101]     We will now consider the final issue raised by the
OPSBA appellants, namely whether the EQIA is ultra vires insofar
as it permits the Minister of Finance to impose school taxes by
regulation.
[102]     Before Cumming J., the appellants presented the issue
as follows:
               Is Bill 160 unconstitutional in conferring upon the Minister
          of Finance power [to make regulations] with respect to taxation,
          including the power to determine the amount thereof free from
          legislative scrutiny, debate and approval, without the submission
          of a &quot;Money Bill&quot;, thus constituting &quot;taxation without
          representation&quot;, contrary to sections 53 and 54 and the Preamble
          of the Constitution Act, 1867?</pre>
    <pre>[103]     Cumming J. found that Bill 160 does not contravene ss.
53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867.</pre>
    <pre>[104]     Before Cumming J., and before this court, the
appellants advanced an alternative position.  Although we were
asked to consider this issue only if we find found that the
delegation to the Minister of the power to set the tax rate is
not unconstitutional, it was dealt with by Cumming J. before he
considered the constitutionality of the delegation.  In his
reasons for judgment, he described the issue, which was issue 5
before him,, which was issue 5 before him, in this way at p.323:
            Are the provisions of Bill 160, which confer on the executive
          branch of government legislative powers with respect to
          education, unconstitutional in that they violate and undermine
          the &quot;rule of law&quot; and the principle of effective representation
          through responsible taxation?
</pre>
    <pre>[105]     Central to the appellants' position on this issue was
the submission that the power delegated to the Minister of
Finance in s. 257.12(1)(b) of the Education Act, as amended by
the EQIA, to prescribe the tax rates is completely unfettered,
contrary to the rule of law and the principle of effective
representation through responsible government.  In addition, the
appellants submitted that this power is impermissibly vague. The
appellants' submissions were rejected by Cumming J.</pre>
    <pre>THE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK</pre>
    <pre>[106]     Section 257.106 of the amended Education Act renders
&quot;inoperative&quot; the powers of all school boards to determine, levy,
and collect property taxes for school purposes found in Division
C of the Act, which is entitled &quot;Taxes Set by Boards&quot;.  In
Division C, the powers granted by s.257.16(1) and s.257.19(1) are
the taxing powers.  Section 257.16(1) states:
            257.16(1)  For the purpose of raising money for its purposes, a
          board may determine, levy and collect rates on assessment for
          real property that is rateable for the board's purposes as
          provided in section 257.17.
     Section 257.19(1) gives a board that</pre>
    <pre>levies or collects rates for school purposes,</pre>
    <pre>inter alia, the same powers to collect the</pre>
    <pre>rates that a municipality has in respect of</pre>
    <pre>the collection of rates for municipal</pre>
    <pre>purposes.  For municipal purposes, a rate is</pre>
    <pre>the equivalent of a tax.  It is a sum</pre>
    <pre>assessed, or made payable, by a municipal</pre>
    <pre>authority in respect of the occupation of</pre>
    <pre>property in proportion to its value (pro</pre>
    <pre>rata, hence &quot;rate&quot;).
</pre>
    <pre>[107]     It is significant to observe that the taxing powers
delegated to a board of education are both broad and explicit.  A
board is given the powers to determine and levy a rate.  This
means that it can decide the amount of the rate based on the
assessment value of property and compel the property owner or
tenant to pay that rate by means of a tax.  In addition, a board
is given the power to collect the rate.  Section 257.26(1)
imposes requirements on a board in its determination of rates on
different classes of property, and s. 257.26(2) enables a board
to determine different rates for a municipality, a part of a
municipality, territory without municipal organization or part of
a territory without municipal organization.  However, the
legislation places no limits, or controls, on the tax rate that a
school board can set.
[108]     Under the Education ActAs a result of the EQIA,
Division C has been replaced by Division B, entitled &quot;Education
Taxes&quot;.  It is the position of counsel for the Attorney General
that the legislature has established the education tax in s.
257.6(1) and s. 257.7(1) which read as follows:
               257.6(1)  Except as otherwise provided under this or any
          other Act, real property that is liable to assessment and
          taxation under the Assessment Act is taxable for school purposes.</pre>
    <pre>               257.7(1)  Subject to the regulations, the following shall in
          each year levy and collect the tax rates prescribed under section
          257.12 for school purposes on the property indicated:</pre>
    <pre>                 1.      Every municipality, on residential property and
               business property in the municipality, including territory
               without municipal organization that is deemed under section 56 or
               subsection 58.1(2) to be attached to the municipality, taxable
               for school purposes, according to the last returned assessment
               roll.</pre>
    <pre>                 2.      Every English-language public district school
               board the area of jurisdiction of which includes territory
               without municipal organization that is not deemed under section
               56 or subsection 58.1(2) to be attached to a municipality, on the
               residential property and business property in that territory
               taxable for school purposes, according to the last returned
               assessment roll.</pre>
    <pre>                 3.      Every district school area board the area of
               jurisdiction of which includes territory without municipal
               organization that is not deemed under section 56 or subsection
               58.1(2) to be attached to a municipality, on the residential
               property and business property in that territory taxable for
               school purposes, according to the last returned assessment roll.
</pre>
    <pre>       Section 257.10(1) gives a board the same powers as s.</pre>
    <pre>257.19(1) in Division C, to which reference has been made, and</pre>
    <pre>imposes upon boards the collection of the taxes.
</pre>
    <pre>[109]     Section 257.12(1)(b), which the appellants submit is
unconstitutional, states:</pre>
    <pre>                 257.12(1)  The Minister of Finance may make regulations,</pre>
    <pre>                 (b)  prescribing the tax rates for school purposes for the
          purposes of section 257.7.</pre>
    <pre>       Under s.257.12(3), the Minister of Finance is empowered to</pre>
    <pre>make regulations, inter alia, prescribing different tax rates for</pre>
    <pre>different municipalities, different parts of a municipality and</pre>
    <pre>different classes of property.  On July 7, 1998, the Minister, by</pre>
    <pre>O. Reg. 400/98, prescribed 0.46 per cent of the assessed value of</pre>
    <pre>residential property as the tax rate for school purposes for the</pre>
    <pre>purposes of s. 257.7 of the Act.
</pre>
    <pre>[110]     At this point, it is helpful to compare the taxing
powers under Division C, which have been rendered temporarily
inoperative, with the taxing powers that have replaced them in
Division B.  The basic difference between the powers under
Division C and those under Division B is in respect to the
determination of the tax rate.  Formerly, it was the school
boards which had this power, subject to the requirements of s.
257.26.  Under Division B, that power has been delegated to the
Minister of Finance.  However, like the school boards' powers to
fix rates under Division C, no limitation, or controls, are
placed on the tax rate which the Minister can set by regulation.
Thus, the province, by means of the power delegated to the
Minister, fixes the tax rates, while the school boards are
required to collect the school taxes.</pre>
    <pre>THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS</pre>
    <pre>[111]     Sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867 state:
            53. Bills for appropriating any Part of the Public Revenue, or
          for imposing any Tax or Impost, shall originate in the House of
          Commons.</pre>
    <pre>                 54.  It shall not be lawful for the House of Commons to
          adopt or pass any Vote, Resolution, Address, or Bill for the
          Appropriation of any Part of the Public Revenue, or of any Tax or
          Impost, to any Purpose that has not been first recommended to
          that House by Message of the Governor General in the Session in
          which such Vote, Resolution, Address or Bill is proposed.
</pre>
    <pre>Sections 53 and 54 are made applicable to the provinces by s.90
of the Constitution Act, 1867.</pre>
    <pre>REASONS OF CUMMING J.</pre>
    <pre>[112]     Before he commenced his analysis, Cumming J. set out
the positions of the appellants and the respondents, who were the
applicants and the respondents on the application, at pp.327-328:
            The applicants contend that section 257.12(1)(b) of the
          Education Act is unconstitutional in that it empowers the
          Minister of Finance to determine and impose the amount of taxes
          without reference to the Legislature, contrary to ss.53 and 54 of
          the Constitution Act, 1867.  The applicants submit that the
          effect of ss.53 and 54 is to require that money bills be
          submitted to the Legislature for approval, that any revenue
          raising measure is a money bill, and consequently, it is
          constitutionally impermissible to allow the Minister of Finance
          to set tax rates through regulation.</pre>
    <pre>                 The respondents submit that a clear statutory delegation
          of taxing power is not precluded by the constitutional principle
          that taxation may be imposed only by an Act of the Legislature or
          Parliament.  They further submit that the constitutional
          principle merely prohibits the imposition of a tax in the
          complete absence of statutory support for the tax, and that where
          a statute clearly authorizes a subordinate body to impose a tax
          by regulation, then the constitutional principle requiring
          statutory support for a tax is satisfied.  [Emphasis added]
</pre>
    <pre>[113]     In considering this issue, Cumming J. incorporated his
analysis of the power of a provincial legislature to delegate its
powers, which was central to his disposition of issue 5. In that
portion of his reasons, on the authority of Hodge v. The Queen
(1883), 9 A.C. 117 (P.C.), Re Gray (1918), 42 D.L.R. 1 (S.C.C.)
and Reference Re Regulations (Chemicals) Under War Measures Act,
[1943] 1 D.L.R. 248 (S.C.C.), he concluded that the legislature
may lawfully delegate the powers granted to it under s. 92 of the
Constitution Act, 1867.  As Cumming J. stated at p. 324:  &quot;Hodge
is the foundation for a wide power of delegation&quot;.
[114]     Cumming J. then considered the application of ss. 53
and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867 to the power delegated to
the Minister of Finance under s.257.12(1)(b) to make regulations
&quot;prescribing the tax rates for school purposes for the purposes
of section 257.7&quot; of the Education Act.  He observed that there
has been no case which has decided whether ss. 53 and 54 preclude
Parliament, or a legislature, from delegating its power to impose
a tax. After reference to The King v. National Fish Co., [1931]
Ex.C.R. 75, the Chemicals Reference, supra, and Reference re
Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.) (1991), 83 D.L.R. (4th) 297
(S.C.C.), Cumming J. concluded at p. 331:
               What comment there is appears to range from at least
          requiring an explicit provision for delegation of a taxation
          [power], or, more restrictively, suggests such delegation is not
          possible within the scope of ss.53 and 54.
</pre>
    <pre>[115]     Cumming J. devoted considerable thought to the
suggestion that the delegation of a taxation power results in an
implied, or implicit, repeal of ss. 53 and 54 of the Constitution
Act, 1867, thereby removing any constitutional obstacle
preventing such delegation.  As this issue was not pursued before
us, there is no need to examine Cumming J.'s analysis.  However,
we do note that he rejected this suggestion at p. 335 of his
reasons, agreeing with the opinion of Professor Hogg that the
&quot;presence of ss. 53 and 54 in a constitutional document must mean
something, even if they are not entrenched&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[116]     Because we feel it is necessary to provide the
appropriate context for our analysis of whether the powers
delegated to the Minister of Finance by s. 257.12(1)(b) are
constitutionally precluded by ss. 53 and 54 of the Constitution
Act, 1867, a substantial portion of Cumming J.'s analysis will be
reproduced.  However, before doing so, it is, in our view,
necessary to reiterate, the narrow scope of the power delegated
to the Minister.  The power delegated to the Minister is not to
create a school tax.  Rather, the delegated power is to fix the
tax rate in respect of the school tax created by the legislature
by ss. 257.6(1) and 257.7(1).  In our view, the limited nature of
this delegated power is very important when one reads Cumming
J.'s analysis, as well as the authorities whichthat we will
consider.</pre>
    <pre>[117]     Cumming J. began his analysis of the effect of ss. 53
and 54 on the power of delegation relating to taxation by
referring to competing views on the subject.  On the one hand, he
considered the view of J. M. Keyes, Executive Legislation:
Delegated Law Making by the Executive Branch, (Toronto, :
Butterworths, 1992) at 44, that as long as the enabling provision
has undergone legislative scrutiny, a delegation of taxation
power is acceptable.  On the other hand, he considered the view
of The Royal Commission Inquiry into Civil Rights (the &quot;McRuer
Commission&quot;), (Toronto:  Queen's Printer, 1968) Vol. 1, at 353,
which opposed the delegation of taxation powers without reference
to ss. 53 and 54.  This position was supported by R. Dussault and
L. Borgeat, Administrative Law, A Treatise, (Toronto:  Carswell,
2nd ed., 1985) 2nd. ed., Vvol. 1, at 446-447, who, in support of
their view, stated:
            Indeed, it is essential for the Legislature to be very vigilant
          in order to keep intact, and in the hands of Parliament, control
          over a power which may so directly affect the property of
          citizens.

</pre>
    <pre>[118]     Cumming J. concluded his analysis as follows at pp.335-
337:
            These are, of course, merely submissions as to what the authors
          recommend should be a government's approach to this issue.  The
          submissions are not binding, but they do suggest that at a
          theoretical level, it may be unwise to dismiss ss.53 and 54 as
          mere procedural steps.</pre>
    <pre>               These arguments lead me to the conclusion that it is
          necessary to acknowledge the existence of ss.53 and 54, and that
          they have some impact and effect, albeit limited. While heed
          should be paid to the existence of ss.53 and 54, their nature and
          history suggest that their requirements are sufficiently
          satisfied when the delegation of the taxing power, in a bill
          approved by the legislature, is clear and explicit, as it is in
          the present case.  This conclusion is consistent with the case
          law on these sections, discussed above.</pre>
    <pre>                 Also, reinforcing this conclusion is the submission of the
          respondents that if the legislature could not delegate the power
          to tax, then municipalities and school boards could themselves
          have no power to tax, since their powers in this regard have
          historically been delegated to them by the legislature.</pre>
    <pre>                 I am in agreement with this submission.  No case law was
          tendered to the Court suggesting that school boards and
          municipalities could not validly exercise a taxing power.
          Moreover, a brief review of the law of municipalities gives no
          indication that there is anything in the least bit questionable
          about a municipality - a delegate - exercising a taxing power.</pre>
    <pre>                 The fact that the power of municipalities to tax does not
          appear to have been challenged may not, on its own, be
          determinative.  It is, however, worthy of some weight, given the
          extensive jurisprudence in regard to municipalities.  More
          importantly, it is consistent with the other case law dealing
          with ss.53 and 54, which suggest clear and explicit delegation of
          the taxing power is sufficient to satisfy those sections.</pre>
    <pre>                 The submission of the applicants that Bill 160 constitutes
          a contravention of ss.53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867 is
          rejected.  To satisfy the requirements of ss.53 and 54 the
          delegation of the taxing power must be express.  Such is the case
          here, and consequently, the applicants must fail on this ground.
          [Emphasis added]
</pre>
    <pre>[119]     Thus, it was the opinion of Cumming J. that the
requirements of ss. 53 and 54 have been met because the
delegation of &quot;the taxing power&quot; to the Minister of Finance by
s.257.12(1)(b) is clear and express, is contained in legislation
which has received the scrutiny and approval of the legislature,
and conforms with the historic provincial delegation of taxing
powers to municipalities and school boards.</pre>
    <pre>[120]     It is the alternative position of the appellants that
if the court finds that the delegation of powers to the Minister
of Finance by s. 257.12(1)(b) is not unconstitutional on the
ground that it is contrary to ss. 53 and 54 of the Constitution
Act, 1867, the court should find that the delegation is
unconstitutional because being completely unfettered, the power
to fix tax rates violates and undermines the &quot;rule of law&quot; and
the principle of effective representation through responsible
taxation, and, in any event, is impermissibly vague.</pre>
    <pre>[121]     Cumming J. did not deal with the appellants' position
that the power delegated to the Minister of Finance to fix tax
rates for school purposes is unconstitutional because it is
unfettered, in the sense that the enabling legislation provides
the Minister with no guidelines, or cap, on the rate of tax he
can fix by way of regulation.  He limited himself to the
consideration of the scope of the legislature to delegate its
assigned powers and to whether s. 257.12(1)(b) is impermissibly
vague within the meaning of the test established by the Supreme
Court of Canada in R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society
(1992), 139 N.R. 241 at 227-278.
[122]     As we have noted in paragraph 113 12, Cumming J. was
satisfied that a provincial legislature may lawfully delegate the
powers granted to it by the Constitution Act, 1867.  This
proposition is so well-established that it does not constitute an
issue in this appeal.
[123]     Measuring s. 257.12(1)(b), and other sections of the
Education Act which the appellants attacked on the ground of
impermissible vagueness, against the Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical
Society test, Cumming J. had no difficulty in concluding that s.
257.12(1)(b) is not unconstitutionally vague.  He expressed his
reasons for this conclusion as follows at pp.326-327:
               By way of an example of vagueness, the applicants point to
          the provision in s.257.12(1)(b), allowing the Minister of Finance
          to &quot;prescribe the tax rates for school purposes, for the purpose
          of section 257.7&quot;.  Section 257.7 in turn sets out the various
          bodies, such as municipalities, which are to collect the taxes
          according to the designated rates.</pre>
    <pre>               With respect, I do not see how this fails to provide &quot;an
          adequate basis for legal debate&quot;.  The object of the taxes is
          identified, school purposes, as is the body or bodies tasked with
          their collection.  Given its context within the Education Act,
          the meaning of school purposes is also readily ascertainable;
          being expenditures connected with schooling, such as the trustee
          honoraria provided for in s.191.</pre>
    <pre>                 While one can appreciate the applicants' references to the
          rule of law, and to the possibility that the regulation-making
          powers entrusted to the government by Bill 160 are indeed very
          extensive, the statutory provisions fulfill the necessary
          procedural requirements, which is all this Court may assess.  The
          objects of the sections authorizing regulations are
          ascertainable, and there is accordingly a basis for legal debate.</pre>
    <pre>THE ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[124]     For the purposes of this appeal, the appellants have,
in effect, combined the issues considered by Cumming J. as issues
5 and 6 into three issues which focus on the application of ss.
53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867 to s. 257.12(1)(b) of the
Education Act.  The appellants have stated the issues in this
way:
            1.           The Court erred in law in failing to fully
               recognize that the constitutional principle of responsible
               government and rule of law, required that there be &quot;no taxation
               without representation&quot; as reified in Sections 53 and 54 of the
               Constitution Act 1867.</pre>
    <pre>                 2.      The Court erred in law in failing to find that the
               Bill of Rights 1688, and Sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution
               Act 1867, must be interpreted as only permitting the imposition
               of taxation upon the citizen after a specific level of taxation
               has been debated and approved by a duly elected Legislature, or
               other democratic institution, such as school boards.</pre>
    <pre>                 3.      The Court erred in law in finding that a totally
               unrestricted power to establish property taxes could be delegated
               by the Legislature to the Minister of Finance, unencumbered by
               any debate and control by the Legislature, and without strictures
               or justiciable standards of any kind.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[125]     In addressing these issues it is helpful to elucidate
the core questions which they raise.
[126]     The Education Act EQIA does not delegate to the
Minister the decision whether a person is to pay an education
tax. This decision has been made by the legislature.  The real
issue is whether the legislature, in addition to establishing tax
liability, must also fix the amount of the liability, or whether
it can lawfully delegate this power to the Minister.  To resolve
this issue, the court must determine what is involved in the
exercise of the power to impose a tax.
[127]     The issue can be further refined in this way.  The
question is whether the act of the Minister in fixing the tax
rate is purely administrative in effecting the policy of the
legislature that an education tax is to be paid, or whether, in
fixing the tax rate, he is performing an act that only the
legislature is constitutionally empowered to perform.  In other
words, does the delegation of the power to fix tax rates
constitute an &quot;abdication&quot; or &quot;abandonment&quot; by the legislature of
a portion of its exclusive power to impose a direct tax granted
by s. 92(2) as contended by the appellants.
[128]     The resolution of this issue requires the court to
answer these questions:  given the acknowledged wide power of the
legislature to lawfully delegate its s. 92 powers established by
Hodge v. The Queen, is there an exception in the case of the
power to legislate in respect to taxation as a result of ss. 53
and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867?  If there is an exception,
is it in respect to both the creation of the tax and the fixing
of the amount of the tax?  Or, can the legislature create the
tax, and constitutionally delegate the power to fix the amount of
the tax?  If so, to create a constitutionally valid delegation of
the power to fix the amount of the tax must the legislature
create guidelines to which its delegate must adhere in fixing the
amount of the tax?  The last question raises the
&quot;unconstitutionally vague&quot; argument which Cumming J. decided in
favour of the respondents.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>The Imposition of a Tax</pre>
    <pre>[129]     In our view, the starting point is the determination of
what constitutes the exercise of the legislative power to impose
a tax.
[130]     Although it may appear trite to define the terms
&quot;impose&quot; and &quot;tax&quot;, it is helpful to do so.  In Merriam-Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary, (Merriam-Webster Inc., 1993) 3rd. ed. at
pp.ages 583 and 1208 respectively, these terms are defined as
follows:
               Impose - to establish or apply by authority.</pre>
    <pre>               Tax - a charge of money...imposed by authority on persons or
          property for public purposes.
</pre>
    <pre>[131]     Under s. 92(2) of the Constitution Act, 1867, the
provinces were given the power to make laws with respect to
direct taxation.  The authorities are sparse with respect to what
constitutes the exercise of the legislative power to impose a
tax.   In our view, the power to impose a tax consists of the
intention to legislate in respect to all acts necessarily
included in the creation of the tax, as well as all acts
consequent to its creation, such as the purpose of the tax and
its nature, the tax base, the class of persons required to pay
it, the rate of the tax or the formula to enable the taxpayer to
calculate the amount of the tax, and the means for the collection
of the tax.</pre>
    <pre>[132]     It follows that an element, or component, of the
exercise of the power to tax is the establishment of the amount,
or rate, of the tax, not only to enable the taxpayer to know the
extent of his or her obligation, but to enable the taxing
authority to determine the anticipated amount of tax revenue it
will obtain.  Support for this proposition can be found in the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Burns v. Minister of
National Revenue, [1946] 4 D.L.R. 805 at 824, per Estey J; revd.
in part [1950] 2 D.L.R. 529 (J.C.P.C.).  In this case the Supreme
Court was required to consider the imposition of an income tax on
an estate or trust by s. 11(4)(a) of the Income War Tax Act,
R.S.C. 1927, c.97, which provision failed to specify the rate at
which the tax was to be paid.  In dissenting reasons, Estey J.
was of the opinion that the failure of Parliament to specify the
tax rate meant that no tax was ever imposed.  This view was
adopted by Lord Greene for the Privy Council on appeal.
Subsequently, s.11(4)(a) was amended to cure the deficiency.
Burns, therefore, compels the conclusion that the imposition of a
tax is not complete until the rate of the tax is set.  See, also,
Vestey v. I.R.C. (Nos. 1 and 2), [1979] 3 All E.R. 976 at 984
(H.L.), per Lord Wilberforce.
[133]     It follows that a tax is imposed only when the elements
discussed in paragraph 30 131 have been satisfied by legislation.
For the purpose of this appeal, it can be said that a tax is not
created until the rate of tax is imposed.  Therefore, as ss.
257.6(1) and 257.7(1) of the Education Act, which the Attorney
General relies on as establishing the education tax, do not
specify a rate of tax, they cannot be said to impose an education
tax.  The imposition of the tax is not complete until the amount
of the tax is established.  Section 257.12(1)(b) leaves the
establishment of the tax rate to the Minister of Finance, to whom
the power to prescribe the tax rate has been delegated.
[134]     Having determined what constitutes the exercise of the
legislative power to impose a tax, it is necessary to determine
whether the legislature must exercise each element of the power
by way of primary legislation, or whether it may delegate the
exercise of one, or more, of the elements to some person or body.
In the context of this appeal, the issue is whether ss. 53 and 54
of the Constitution Act, 1867, preclude the delegation of the
power to fix the rate of the tax to the Minister of Finance.</pre>
    <pre>Sections 53 and 54 of the Constitution Act, 1867</pre>
    <pre>[135]     As we have discussed, it is well-established by the
authorities that the legislature may lawfully delegate the powers
granted to it under s. 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867.
However, the appellants contend that an exception to this broad
power of delegation is created by ss. 53 and 54 of the
Constitution Act, 1867, which, they submit preclude the
legislature from delegating any part of its s. 92(2) power to
enact laws imposing direct taxation.  Although ss. 53 and 54 have
received some judicial attention and academic comment, they had
not been interpreted and applied at the time the application was
heard.  However, subsequent to the decision of Cumming J., ss.53
and 54 featured prominently in the reasons of Major J., and other
members of the Supreme Court of Canada, in Re Eurig Estate (Re)
(1998), 165 D.L.R. (4th) 1.
[136]     In Eurig, the validity of a regulation enacted pursuant
to s. 5 of the Administration of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.
A.6, which imposed an ad valorem fee for grants of letters
probate, was attacked on the ground that it was ultra vires s. 5
of the Act, and, because it was a tax, it violated ss. 53 and 54
of the Constitution Act, 1867.  Major J., on behalf of a majority
of the Supreme Court, concluded that the fee was a tax, and, as
such, its implementation violated s. 53 of the Constitution Act,
1867.  He also held that the regulation was ultra vires, because
s. 5 of the Administration of Justice Act authorized only the
imposition of fees, not of taxes.
[137]     Major J. began his analysis of s. 53 of the
Constitution Act, 1867, at p.13 by concluding that it required
that &quot;all provincial bills for the imposition of any tax must
originate in the legislature&quot;.
[138]     Major J. then discussed the rationale underlying s. 53
at pp.13-14:
                 In my view, the rationale underlying s.53 is somewhat
          broader.  The provision codifies the principle of no taxation
          without representation, by requiring any bill that imposes a tax
          to originate with the legislature.  My interpretation of s.53
          does not prohibit Parliament or the legislatures from vesting any
          control over the details and mechanism of taxation in statutory
          delegates such as the Lieutenant Governor in Council.  Rather, it
          prohibits not only the Senate, but also any other body other than
          the directly elected legislature, from imposing a tax on its own
          accord.</pre>
    <pre>                 In our system of responsible government, the Lieutenant
          Governor in Council cannot impose a new tax ab initio without the
          authorization of the legislature.  As Audette J. succinctly
          stated in The King v. National Fish Co., [1931] Ex. C.R.75 at
          p.83, &quot;[t]he Governor in Council has no power, proprio vigore, to
          impose taxes unless under authority specifically delegated to it
          by Statute.  The power of taxation is exclusively in Parliament.&quot;
            </pre>
    <pre>                The basic purpose of s.53 is to
          constitutionalize the principle that
          taxation powers cannot arise
          incidentally in delegated legislation.
          In so doing, it ensures parliamentary
          control over, and accountability for,
          taxation.  As E.A. Driedger stated in
          &quot;Money Bills and the Senate&quot; (1968), 3
          Ottawa L. Rev. 25, at p.41:</pre>
    <pre>                      Through the centuries, the principle was maintained that
               taxation required representation and consent.  The only body in
               Canada that meets this test is the Commons.  The elected
               representatives of the people sit in the Commons, and not in the
               Senate, and, consistently with history and tradition, they may
               well insist that they alone have the right to decide to the last
               cent what money is to be granted and what taxes are to be
               imposed.
</pre>
    <pre>[139]     Major J. went on to add at p.14:  &quot;Section 53 is a
constitutional imperative that is enforceable by the courts.&quot;  He
noted, however, that by virtue of s. 45 of the Constitution Act,
1867, the legislature of each province retains the discretion to
exclusively make laws amending the constitution of the province.
[140]     Major J., therefore, concluded that the regulation that
imposed the probate tax was unconstitutional because it violated
s. 53 which requires that bills for imposing any tax originate in
the legislature.  His reasons for this conclusion, at p.15, read
as follows:
                Nothing in the Administration of Justice Act purports to
          amend the constitutional requirement for imposing tax legislation
          set out in s.53.  The Ontario legislature did not delegate to the
          Lieutenant Governor in Council the authority to impose a tax.
          Therefore whether it could constitutionally do so does not need
          to be addressed.  The only power conferred by s. 5 of the Act was
          to make regulations regarding the payment of fees, not the
          imposition of taxes.  Yet the probate fees in this instance are
          in substance a tax imposed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council
          without having originated in the legislature.  While the
          legislature of Ontario may well be competent to establish probate
          taxes under the terms of the Administration of Justice Act, s. 53
          requires that they do so explicitly.  Since s. 53 was not
          expressly amended, the province was obliged to abide by its
          terms.  Its failure to do so renders the probate tax imposed
          under O. Reg. 802/94 (previously O. Reg. 293/92)
          unconstitutional.  The unconstitutionality of the impugned
          legislation is an important reminder of the fact that the
          imposition of a tax has both political and legal dimensions which
          require the legislature to act carefully if the tax is to be
          successfully implemented.
</pre>
    <pre>[141]     Major J. also found that s. 54 of the Constitution Act,
1867, had no application to the circumstances of  Eurig, as it
concerns the appropriation of taxes, and not the imposition of
taxes.  For the same reason, s. 54 is not relevant to this
appeal.  Nor is Major J.'s analysis of whether the probate levy
was authorized by s. 5 of the Administration of Justice Act.
[142]     It is helpful to examine the reasons of Major J. in
respect to what they say, and do not say, about s. 53 of the
Constitution Act, 1867 in relation to the appellants' position
that delegating to the Minister of Finance the power to prescribe
the tax rates for school purposes is unconstitutional because it
does not comply with s. 53.
[143]     In Eurig the probate tax was imposed by regulation made
by the Lieutenant Governor in Council on its own accord.
Measured against the elements of the imposition of a tax
discussed in paragraph 30131, each element of the tax was
contained in the regulation.  This offended s. 53 because, as
Major J. held, s. 53 precludes &quot;any other body other than the
directly elected legislature from imposing a tax on its own
accord&quot;.  Because the regulation actually imposed the tax, it was
not saved by the type of delegation Major J. said was permissible
under s. 53 - &quot;control over the details and mechanism of
taxation&quot;.  In other words, it is permissible under s. 53 to
delegate to administrative officers, and other bodies, duties
with respect to taxation that are merely advisory, ministerial or
administrative in nature.
[144]     Major J. was of the opinion that &quot;the Lieutenant
Governor in Council cannot impose a new tax ab initio without the
authorization of the legislature&quot;.  If we are to accept that
Major J. subscribes to the converse of this proposition, it means
a new tax can be imposed by the Lieutenant Governor in Council
with the authorization of the legislation.  Applied to this
appeal, it follows that having established the education tax the
legislature could delegate to the Minister the power to prescribe
the tax rates without running afoul of s. 53.  However, Major J.
later concluded that because the legislature did not delegate the
authority to the Lieutenant Governor to impose a probate tax, it
was unnecessary to address whether it could constitutionally
delegate its total responsibility to impose a tax.  With great
respect to Major J., it would appear that he did address this
issue at least implicitly, in the passage quoted from his reasons
in the first sentence of this paragraph.
[145]     In our view, iIt is important to observe that the issue
which Major J. declined to address was the narrow question of
whether s. 53 precludes the legislature from delegating to a
subordinate authority the total power to impose a tax - be it a
probate tax or an education tax, or any other tax.  Given the
facts of Eurig, it was unnecessary for him to consider the issue
that arises in this appeal - the delegation of one component of
the power to impose a tax.
[146]     In our view, however, this issue was considered in the
reasons of two of the judges who disagreed with Major J. in his
application of s. 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867.  Their
reasons are instructive in respect to the issue we must decide.
[147]     Bastarache J., writing on behalf of himself and
Gonthier J., was of the opinion that s. 53 has no significance at
the provincial level.  In a passage that is relevant to the issue
before this court, he stated at p. 20:
               Even if s. 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867 continues to
          apply to the provinces, the fact that the legislature has
          authorized the executive to prescribe fees in the form of a tax
          does not violate s. 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867. The tax in
          the form of probate fees is imposed by s. 5 of the Administration
          of Justice Act.  This Act was introduced in the Legislative
          Assembly of Ontario and therefore cannot violate s. 53 of the
          Constitution Act, 1867.  All that the Legislature has done is
          delegate to the Lieutenant Governor in Council the authority to
          provide for the details of the tax through regulation.  The
          provincial legislature is entitled to delegate taxing powers to
          its subordinate bodies, including the Lieutenant Governor in
          Council (Hodge v. The Queen (1883), 9 App. Cas. 117 (P.C.) at
          pp.131-33; Shannon v. Lower Mainland Dairy Products Board, [1938]
          A.C. 708 at p.722, [1938] 4 D.L.R. 81 (P.C.); Irving Oil Ltd. v.
          Provincial Secretary of New Brunswick, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 787, 109
          D.L.R. (3d) 513).
</pre>
    <pre>[148]     Although Binnie J., writing on behalf of himself and
McLachlin J., agreed with the disposition of the appeal proposed
by Major J., he did not agree that the probate tax imposed by the
regulation was unconstitutional by virtue of non-compliance with
s. 53.  His short reason for rejecting Major J.'s application of
s. 53 was that it requires that money bills originate in the
House of Commons, and the regulation that imposed the probate tax
is not a &quot;bill&quot;.  He elaborated at p. 23:

            My colleague advances the proposition in para. 32 that:</pre>
    <pre>                    The basic purpose of s.53 is to constitutionalize the
               principle that taxation powers cannot arise incidentally in
               delegated legislation.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>                 Again, in para. 40, he argues that s. 53 &quot;constitutionally
          mandates the court to strictly construct enabling legislation&quot;.
          In my view, respectfully, this analysis reads the word &quot;bills&quot;
          out of the section, and takes the section out of the context of
          the series of sections of which it forms a part.  Section 53
          addresses a state of affairs prior to any &quot;legislation&quot; coming
          into existence.  It is explicitly related to legislative
          procedure and there is nothing that I can see in its text to
          justify concluding that its &quot;basic purpose&quot; is the constitutional
          entrenchment of a principle of &quot;strict construction&quot; of
          legislation, delegated or otherwise.  Regardless of the
          attraction of my colleague's broad rationale of promoting
          &quot;parliamentary control over, and accountability for, taxation&quot;
          (para. 32), I do not think the Court can facilitate achievement
          of the objective by rewriting s. 53.  As the Court recently
          affirmed in Reference re: Secession of Quebec, [1998] 2 S.C.R.
          217, 161 D.L.R. (4th) 385, implicit principles can and should be
          used to expound the Constitution, but they cannot alter the
          thrust of its explicit text.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[149]     In beginning this analysis, at p. 22 Binnie J. made the
following observation which, in our view, is helpful in resolving
the issue presented by this appeal:
            The legislative power of the province is sovereign except as
          limited by the Constitution itself, including limitations flowing
          from the federal-provincial division of powers, and the Canadian
          Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  In the absence of a
          constitutional prohibition, the legislature has power to
          authorize a tax structure of its own choosing, and for which it
          will be politically accountable, including a tax to be prescribed
          by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.  I do not construe s.53 of
          the Constitution Act, 1867 as constituting such a prohibition.
</pre>
    <pre>[150]     In our view, it is appropriate to We conclude from the
observations of Bastarache J. and Binnie J. that the
constitutional imperative of s. 53 has been satisfied when the
bill creating the tax has been introduced in the legislature.
When this has occurred, in the opinion of Bastarache J., a
provincial legislature does not contravene s. 53 by delegating to
a subordinate person, or body, the authority to provide for the
details of the tax through regulation.  In the opinion of Binnie
J., provided that the tax arises out of a statute originating in
the legislature, a province has the power to authorize a tax
structure of its own choosing, including a tax to be prescribed
by the Lieutenant Governor in Council.  Indeed, Major J. endorsed
this view in the passage from his reasons reproduced in paragraph
138, where he opined that if a tax bill originates with the
legislature, s. 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867, permits the
legislature to vest &quot;control over the details and mechanism of
taxation&quot; in a statutory delegate.
[151]     In our view, tThe reasoning of Bastarache J. and Binnie
J. is persuasive, and, in the absence of any express
consideration of this specific issue by the majority of the
Supreme Court, we are not prevented from applying their reasons.
[152]     In this appeal, the tax bill – the amendments to the
Education Act effected by the EQIA - originated with the
legislature.  Sections 257.6 and 257.7 created the education tax.
Section 257.12(1)(b) delegated to the Minister of Finance the
responsibility of prescribing the tax rate by regulation, which
has been done in O. Reg. 400/98.  The views expressed by all
members of the Supreme Court are that s. 53 of the Constitution
Act, 1867, does not preclude the legislature from delegating the
authority to provide for the details of a tax through regulation.
In Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, supra, at p. 315, two
of the meanings of &quot;detail&quot; are &quot;extended treatment of or
attention to particular items&quot; and &quot;a part of a whole&quot;.  It
follows, applying our analysis of the exercise of the legislative
power to impose a tax, that the amount of the tax, or tax rate,
is a detail, or component, of the tax.  Accordingly, the
delegation contained in s. 257.12(1)(b) is not unconstitutional
and is in compliance complies with s. 53 of the Constitution Act,
1867.
[153]     As Major J. pointed out, by requiring that tax bills
originate in the legislature, s. 53 preserves immediate political
accountability for taxation decisions and allows the voters to
influence these tax decisions by access to their elected
representatives.  Section 257.12(1)(b) of the Education Act does
not detract from that purpose.  The legislature remains
accountable to, and under the control of, the voters.  The
legislature does not avoid its taxing responsibilities by
allowing the Minister of Finance to use his specialized knowledge
and expertise to determine the amount of revenue required to
operate the school system in accordance with the elaborate
guidelines concerning the operation of the school system
contained in Part IX, Division B of the Act.  It is to be assumed
the Minister is familiar with the costs of operating the school
system.  Although s. 257.12(1)(b) does not contain guidelines
which the Minister is required to consider in determining the
costs of the school system, they are contained elsewhere in the
legislation and we must assume that the Minister has taken them
into consideration in establishing the tax rate.
[154]     In the result, we agree with Cumming J. that s. 53 does
not preclude the delegation of the power to fix the amount of the
school tax.  However, in doing so, we are not to be taken as
agreeing with his analysis which, it would appear, focused on the
effect of s. 53 on the delegation of the total taxing powers of
the legislature, rather than a component of it.  In particular,
in light of Major J.'s opinion in Eurig, at p.14, that &quot;section
53 is a constitutional imperative that is enforceable by the
courts&quot;, we cannot agree with Cumming J.'s characterization of s.
53.  As well, it is unnecessary for us to consider whether he is
correct in his observations concerning the historic delegation of
taxing powers to municipalities and school boards.
[155]     Counsel for the appellants and the respondent made
reference to a number of authorities and treatises in support of
their respective positions, which the court has reviewed.  For
the most part, we have not referred to them in our reasons
because, in our view, it is unnecessary to do so based on the
reasons expressed by Major J., Bastarache J. and Binnie J. in
Eurig which resolve the issue.
     Is s. 257.12(1)(b) of the Education Act Unconstitutionally</pre>
    <pre>Vague?
</pre>
    <pre>[156]     The appellants submitted that if the court did not
declare s. 257.12(1)(b) to be an unconstitutional delegation of
the province's taxing power, the court should find that the
section offends the Constitution Act, 1867, and is of no force or
effect, because the Education Act &quot;fails to provide any
principles or guidelines to limit the absolute discretion of the
Minister to set tax rates&quot;.  It was their position that s.
257.12(1)(b) &quot;provides absolutely no guidelines as to how, or on
what basis, the Minister of Finance may establish levels of
taxation&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[157]     As we have pointed out, Cumming J. held that s.
257.12(1)(b) was not impermissibly vague within the meaning of
the test in R. v. Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, supra.  In
our view, he was correct.  We need not engage in a great deal of
discussion on this issue as it is essentially answered in our
analysis of s. 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867.</pre>
    <pre>[158]     If we were to consider s. 257.12(1)(b) standing alone,
and in the abstract, there might be merit to the appellants'
submission.  However, s. 257.12(1)(b) must be considered in the
context of the Education Act, in particular, in the context of
those provisions of the Act that provide guidance to the Minister
in fixing the tax rate.  In our view, s. 257.7(1) of the Act
clearly provides that, subject to the regulations, municipalities
and others &quot;shall in each year levy and collect the tax rates
prescribed under s. 257.12&quot;.  Section 257.12(1)(b) provides that
the Minister of Finance may make regulations &quot;prescribing the tax
rates for school purposes for the purpose of s. 257.7&quot;.
Similarly, clear language is found in the provisions of the Act
permitting regulations to &quot;prescribe different tax rates&quot; for
different municipalities, different parts of a municipality, and
different classes of property.  The statutory language could not
be clearer in requiring, under s. 257.7, the levying and
collecting of taxes, and permitting, under s. 257.12, the
prescribing of tax rates by regulation.  We agree with the
analysis and opinion of Cumming J. which is reproduced in
paragraph 22123 of these reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[159]     The imposition of the school tax was not an &quot;exercise
in arbitrary state action&quot; as counsel for the appellants argued.
As we have said, the tax bill originated in the legislature as
required by s. 53 of the Constitution Act, 1867, and does not
constitute a delegation, or abdication, by the legislature of the
totality of its taxing power to the Minister of Finance.</pre>
    <pre>[160]     For the reasons we have stated, we are unable to give
effect to any of the appellants' submissions concerning the issue
of the constitutionality of the delegation of the taxing power.
We conclude, therefore, that s. 257.12(1)(b) of the Education Act
is not an unconstitutional delegation of the province's taxing
power.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION
</pre>
    <pre>[161]     The Attorney General's appeal from Cumming J.'s
decision declaring the EQIA and the Education Act, as amended by
the EQIA, of no force and effect insofar as it removes the right
to tax from the Roman Catholic community is allowed. OECTA's
appeal from Cumming J.'s decision that the EQIA, as well as the
funding model prescribed by O. Reg. 287/98, do not violate s.
93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867 is dismissed.  OPSBA's appeal
from Cumming J.'s determination that the EQIA does not violate
the s. 93(1) rights of public schools is also dismissed, as is
the appeal from the lower court's decision that the EQIA is not
invalidated on the basis of the doctrine of constitutional
convention.  Finally, OPSBA's appeal from Cumming J.'s holding
that the EQIA is not an impermissible delegation to the Minister
of Finance of the power to impose school taxes by regulation is
also dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[162]     We have had the benefit of both a thorough presentation
of these appeals and a full and able argument by all counsel who
were involved.  We thank them for this assistance.  There will be
no order as to costs.
