    <pre>On  appeal from the judgment of A.G. Campbell J., dated August 4, 1997.

</pre>
    <pre>ABELLA J.A. :</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal relates to a provision in the Fewer School
Boards Act, 1997, S.O. 1997, c.3 which limits eligibility for
election as a trustee of a school board.  The appellants were
unsuccessful before Campbell J. in arguing that the provision
barring the spouse of a district school board employee from
election to a school board or school authority violates s. 15 of
the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.   They also submitted that a
provision similarly barring school board employees is contrary to
s. 93(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867. Campbell J.&#146;s judgment is
now reported at (1997), 151 D.L.R. (4th) 346.
[2]  The provision under review by Campbell J. was repealed, but
was replaced in the Education Quality Improvement Act, S.O. 1997,
c. 31 (the &#147;EQIA&#148; &#150; Bill 160) with a provision so similar that
the parties agreed that the appeal would be with respect to the
new provision. The parties also agreed that their appeal would be
heard with the appeal relating to the constitutionality of the
EQIA.  The court&#146;s decision in that appeal was released
separately.
[3]  Section 15 of the Charter states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               15.(1)    Every individual is equal before and under the law
          and has the right to the equal protection and equal benefit of
          the law without discrimination and, in particular, without
          discrimination based on race, national or ethnic origin, colour,
          religion, sex, age or mental or physical disability.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[4]  The repealed provision was s. 333 of the Education Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. 17, as amended by s. 7 of the Fewer School Boards
Act. The following parts relate to the spousal prohibition:
          </pre>
    <pre>               333.(1)   A person is qualified to be elected as a member of
          a district school board or school authority if the person is
          qualified to vote for members of that district school board or
          that school authority and is resident in its area of
          jurisdiction.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  Despite subsection (1), a person is
          not qualified to be elected or to act as a
          member of a district school board or school
          authority if the person is,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  an employee of a district school
          board or school authority;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  an employee of an existing board
          within the meaning of section 327;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  the spouse of a person mentioned in
          clause (a) or (b).
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[5]  With the introduction of the EQIA, s. 333 was repealed and
replaced by s. 219, the relevant parts of which state:
          </pre>
    <pre>               219.(1)   A person is qualified to be elected as a member of
          a district school board or school authority if the person is
          qualified to vote for members of that district school board or
          that school authority and is resident in its area of
          jurisdiction.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  Despite subsection (1), a person is
          not qualified to be elected or to act as a
          member of a district school board or school
          authority if the person is,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  an employee of a district school
          board or school authority;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  the spouse of a person mentioned in
          clause (a); [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[6]  The references in this judgment will be to the new section,
s. 219(4)(b).
[7]  Campbell J. dismissed the application for a declaration that
the section violated s.15 of the Charter for the following
reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>               a)   There is no prohibition in s. 219(4)(b) against
     &#147;spouses&#148; generally, only against spouses of school board or
     school authority employees, a group which is neither historically
     disadvantaged nor an analogous ground.
          </pre>
    <pre>               b)   The distinction is not based on a
     spousal category such as common law or unmarried
     spousal status.
          </pre>
    <pre>               c)   There is no evidence of this
     prohibition having an adverse impact on women.
          </pre>
    <pre>               d)   The prohibition is narrowly-
     focused, objective and capable of neutral
     application.
          </pre>
    <pre>               e)   Spouses form part of an integrated
     economic unit, and have mutual support
     obligations.  Citing the pre-Charter case of Re
     Moll and Fisher (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 609 (Div.
     Ct.) at p. 621, Campbell J. concluded that this
     economic interdependency placed spouses in a
     position whereby: &#147;Their family purse is in
     conflict with their public duty.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>               f)   The prohibition eliminates the
     possibility of conflicts of interest arising from
     the collective bargaining and other financial
     responsibilities of school trustees.  This makes
     the spousal prohibition less an aspect of
     stereotyping or stigmatization than of the
     realities of a trustee&#146;s work.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[8]  In essence, Campbell J. was of the view that the spousal
prohibition did not engage the enumerated or analogous groups
contemplated by s. 15 and that in any event, the spousal
exclusion was less a reflection of discrimination and more an
attempt to avoid inevitable and endemic conflict of interest
problems.
[9]  It is worth repeating, however, Campbell J.&#146;s observation at
p. 369 that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               There is some conflict of evidence over the seriousness of
          the problem.  The individual applicants stress the infrequency
          with which they personally have been faced with the problem.  The
          evidence on the impact of conflict is anecdotal and there are no
          comprehensive provincial statistics. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[10] Campbell J.&#146;s analysis preceded, and was therefore
undertaken without the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s
judgment in Law v. Canada (Minister of Employment and
Immigration) (1999), 170 D.L.R. (4th) 1.  In this decision,
released March 25, 1999, Iacobucci J. reformulated the analysis
to be applied in s. 15(1) cases.  Iacobucci J. acknowledges that
the approach in Law essentially reflects a synthesis and
refinement of the Supreme Court&#146;s equality jurisprudence, not a
reversal of its principles.  I propose therefore to undertake the
s. 15(1) analysis in this appeal based on the approach outlined
in Law, but am of the view that the pre-Law jurisprudence would
have yielded the same result.
[11] Before Law, different approaches to the actual
interpretation of s. 15(1) were enunciated by members of the
Supreme Court: see, for example, Andrews v. Law Society of B.C.,
[1989] 1 S.C.R. 143; McKinney v. University of Guelph, [1990] 3
S.C.R. 229; Egan v. Canada, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 513; Miron v. Trudel,
[1995] 2 S.C.R. 418; Benner v. The Secretary State of Canada,
[1997] 3 S.C.R. 389; and Vriend v. Alberta, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493.
[12] Throughout the development of the equality jurisprudence,
however, the underlying principles first articulated in Andrews
have remained unchanged.  The guiding principle was that the
purpose of s. 15(1) was to provide a remedy for discrimination,
and the analysis therefore was a method for assessing whether
differences in treatment resulted in an inappropriately
disadvantaging impact on the claimant because of group
membership. This is not to suggest that differences in treatment
are impermissible; it may in fact be that the remedy for
discrimination requires taking those differences into account and
accommodating them.
[13] The issue, therefore, is not simply whether there is
differential treatment, but whether that differential treatment
has a discriminatory impact, that is, whether the treatment
disadvantages the individual because of characteristics
arbitrarily or stereotypically attributed to the individuals in
his or her group.
[14] Iacobucci J. integrated these principles with the s. 15(1)
jurisprudence which has evolved since Andrews, and concluded in
Law at pp. 37-8 that the following guidelines are points of
reference for an analysis under s. 15(1):
          </pre>
    <pre>               General Approach
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  It is inappropriate to attempt to
          confine analysis under s. 15(1) of the
          Charter to a fixed and limited formula.  A
          purposive and contextual approach to
          discrimination analysis is to be preferred,
          in order to permit the realization of the
          strong remedial purpose of the equality
          guarantee, and to avoid the pitfalls of a
          formalistic or mechanical approach.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The approach adopted and regularly
          applied by this Court to the interpretation
          of s. 15(1) focuses upon three central
          issues:
                    </pre>
    <pre>                         (a)  whether a law imposes differential
               treatment between the claimant and others, in
               purpose or effect;
                    </pre>
    <pre>                         (b)  whether one or more
               enumerated or analogous grounds of
               discrimination are the basis for
               the differential treatment;  and
                    </pre>
    <pre>                         (c)  whether the law in
               question has a purpose or effect
               that is discriminatory within the
               meaning of the equality guarantee.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The first issue is
          concerned with the question of
          whether the law causes differential
          treatment.  The second and third
          issues are concerned with whether
          the differential treatment
          constitutes discrimination in the
          substantive sense intended by s.
          15(1).
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  Accordingly, a court that is called
          upon to determine a discrimination claim
          under s. 15(1) should make the following
          three broad inquiries:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    A.   Does the impugned law (a) draw a
               formal distinction between the claimant and
               others on the basis of one or more personal
               characteristics, or (b) fail to take into
               account the claimant&#146;s already disadvantaged
               position within Canadian society resulting in
               substantively differential treatment between
               the claimant and others on the basis of one
               or more personal characteristics?
               </pre>
    <pre>                    B.   Is the claimant subject
               to differential treatment based on
               one or more enumerated and
               analogous grounds?
               </pre>
    <pre>                    and
               </pre>
    <pre>                    C.   Does the differential
               treatment discriminate by imposing
               a burden upon or withholding a
               benefit from the claimant in a
               manner which reflects the
               stereotypical application of
               presumed group or personal
               characteristics, or which otherwise
               has the effect of perpetuating or
               promoting the view that the
               individual is less capable or
               worthy of recognition or value as a
               human being or as a member of
               Canadian society, equally deserving
               of concern, respect, and
               consideration?
               </pre>
    <pre>               </pre>
    <pre>[15] These inquiries are directed at determining whether the
distinction infringes the purpose of the equality rights
guaranteed in s. 15(1), a purpose Iacobucci J. defines in p.23 as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; to prevent the violation of essential human dignity and
          freedom through the imposition of disadvantage, stereotyping, or
          political or social prejudice, and to promote a society in which
          all persons enjoy equal recognition at law as human beings or as
          members of Canadian society, equally capable and equally
          deserving of concern, respect and consideration.  Legislation
          which effects differential treatment between individual or groups
          will violate this fundamental purpose where those who are subject
          to differential treatment fall within one or more enumerated or
          analogous grounds, and where the differential treatment reflects
          the stereotypical application of presumed group or personal
          characteristics, or otherwise has the effect of perpetuating or
          promoting the view that the individual is less capable, or less
          worthy of recognition or value as a human being or as a member of
          Canadian society.  Alternatively, differential treatment will not
          likely constitute discrimination within the purpose of s.15(1)
          where it does not violate the human dignity or freedom of a
          person or group in this way, and in particular where the
          differential treatment also assists in ameliorating the position
          of the disadvantaged within Canadian society.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[16] In this case, the preliminary task is the proper description
of the group. Although the legislation refers to spouses of
school board or school authority employees, this does not mean
that the category for the purposes of a s. 15(1) analysis is to
be so narrowly characterized . The people excluded from
eligibility for election are spouses.  Their claim is based not
on their technical membership in a group called &#147;spouses of an
employee of a district school board or school authority&#148;, but
rather on the fact of their spousal or marital relationship.
[17] Applying the approach in Law, the questions to be addressed
are whether the law disqualifying employees&#146; spouses from
election to school boards imposes differential treatment, whether
the differential treatment is based on an enumerated or analogous
ground, and whether the effect or purpose of the law is
discriminatory.
[18] The impugned law clearly draws a distinction between spouses
of board employees and anyone else who is resident in the area of
the district school board and qualified to vote for members of
that board.  Only the former are disqualified from election.
[19] This difference in treatment is based on being a spouse.
Being a spouse is a function of marital status, a category the
Supreme Court of Canada found in Miron v. Trudel to be an
analogous ground to the grounds of discrimination enumerated in
s.15(1).
[20] In its analysis in Miron v. Trudel, the Supreme Court said,
at p. 496, that there were several possible indicators of an
analogous ground, including such considerations as whether the
distinction is made on the basis of personal characteristics,
whether the targeted group has suffered historical disadvantage,
or whether the group constitutes a &#147;discrete and insular
minority.&#148;
[21] These are, however, merely indicators.  While the presence
of any one of these indicators may signal an analogous ground, it
is not the case that all - or even any - of them must be present
to find an analogous ground.  As McLachlin J. said, at p. 496:
          </pre>
    <pre>               All of these may be valid indicators in the inclusionary
          sense that their presence may signal an analogous ground.  But
          the converse proposition &#150; that any or all of them must be
          present to find an analogous ground &#150; is invalid.  As Wilson J.
          recognized in Turpin (at p. 1333), they are but &#147;analytical
          tools&#148; which may be &#147;of assistance&#148;.  For example, analogous
          grounds cannot be confined to historically disadvantaged groups;
          if the Charter is to remain relevant to future generations, it
          must retain a capacity to recognize new grounds of
          discrimination.  Nor is it essential that the analogous ground
          target a discrete and insular minority;  this is belied by the
          inclusion of sex as a ground enumerated in s. 15(1).  &#133;  All of
          these and more may be indicators of analogous grounds, but the
          unifying principle is larger:  the avoidance of stereotypical
          reasoning and the creation of legal distinctions which violate
          the dignity and freedom of the individual, on the basis of some
          preconceived perception about the attributed characteristics of a
          group rather than the true capacity, worth or circumstances of
          the individual.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[22] As for &#147;marital status&#148; specifically being an analogous
ground, McLachlin J. stated, at p. 497:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; [D]iscrimination on the basis of marital status touches
          the essential dignity and worth of the individual in the same way
          as other recognized grounds of discrimination violative of
          fundamental human rights norms.  Specifically, it touches the
          individual&#146;s freedom to live life with the mate of one&#146;s choice
          in the fashion of one&#146;s choice.  This is a matter of defining
          importance to individuals.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[23] The key, then, to the conclusion that &#147;marital status&#148; is an
analogous ground is found in the fundamental right of individuals
to choose to have - or not to have - a spousal relationship.
This choice ought not to result in individuals being treated in
an exclusionary way based on irrelevant, stereotypical
characteristics attributed to this choice, rather than on their
actual ability.  The human rights principle prohibiting arbitrary
treatment was confirmed by McLachlin J. in Miron v. Trudel at
pp.495-6:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; Logic suggests that in determining whether a particular
          group of characteristic is an analogous ground, the fundamental
          consideration is whether the characteristic may serve as an
          irrelevant basis of exclusion and a denial of essential human
          dignity in the human rights tradition.  In other words, may it
          serve as a basis for unequal treatment based on stereotypical
          attributes ascribed to the group, rather than on the true worth
          and ability or circumstances of the individual?  An affirmative
          answer to this question indicates that the characteristic may be
          used in a manner which is violative of human dignity and freedom.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[24] In the case before us, individuals are being disadvantaged
because they are spouses, and are therefore being disadvantaged
based on their marital status, an analogous ground.
[25] The effect of the disqualification based on marital status
is to withhold a benefit from spouses of board employees;
namely, the right to seek election to district school boards.
This right is a benefit denied in a manner which reflects and
perpetuates an assumption that spouses, unlike others in society,
are incapable of independent decision-making. There is no doubt
that the interests of spouses are in many ways inter-related, but
a blanket exclusion of all spouses reflects the unrealistic view
that spouses always share in common all interests and opinions
with their partners.  It thereby attributes a stereotypical
quality to spouses, namely, that their decision-making abilities
are in a state of perpetual conflict with their capacity to
decide issues of a public nature.
[26] The distinction based on marital status is accordingly
discriminatory since it arbitrarily disadvantages, based on
personal and presumed group characteristics, individuals who are
spouses, by restricting their right to public office and thereby
restricting their right to participate in the democratic process:
see also Brossard (Town) v. Quebec (Commission des Droits de la
Personne), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 279 and Cashin v. C.B.C. (1988), 86
N.R. 24 (Fed. C.A.).
[27] Accordingly, s. 219(4)(b) violates s. 15(1) of the Charter.
[28] Having so found, the analysis proceeds to whether the
spousal prohibition can be justified as a &#147;reasonable limit in a
free and democratic society&#148; under s. 1 of the Charter.
[29] The first step in the s. 1 analysis is to determine whether
the infringing limitation has a pressing and substantial
objective: Vriend at 555-56; Rosenberg v. Canada (A.G.) (1998),
38 O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.) at p. 584. The stated objective of the
exclusion in s.219(4)(b) is to reduce the possibility of
conflicts of interest. But as Campbell J. observed, at p. 369,
the evidence of spousal conflicts in this case is &#147;anecdotal&#148;,
and he himself questioned whether the problem was a serious one.
[30] There is, in fact, no evidence that spousal conflicts of
interest represent a problem at all, let alone a pressing or
substantial one.  A district school board, like any workplace,
undoubtedly has a variety of employees performing a variety of
jobs, but there is no evidence before us about what the range of
employee categories is in this case, or, for that matter, what
range of work those employees perform.  There is, therefore, no
way to assess how being an employee&#146;s spouse relates to the
potential for conflict, let alone to assess whether that
potential justifies the outright exclusion of all spouses of all
employees.
[31] No comprehensive provincial statistics about conflicts of
interest on school boards were presented to the court, and those
statistics which were available were not separated as to the
kinds of conflicts raised.  For example, the respondent cites the
example of the York Region Roman Catholic Separate School Board
where 8 of 18 trustees declared conflicts on the basis that they
were teachers or spouses of teachers, but the record does not
disclose how many of those conflicts were those of spouses.
[32] In fact, none of the evidence led by the respondent reveals
whether conflicts declared by members of school boards were based
on spousal relationships, or on their employment, a business
interest, or any other reason. Nor does the evidence reveal
whether spouses of board employees declare conflicts more than
other trustees.
[33] The spousal disqualification does not, as a result,
represent any pressing or substantial solution given that there
is no factual foundation for concluding that spousal conflicts
represent any real problem.
[34] Moreover, there is already legislation to deal with
conflicts of interest. The Municipal Conflict of Interest Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. M.50 states that trustees attending a meeting who
have a direct or indirect pecuniary interest in a matter under
consideration, are obliged to disclose their interest and refrain
from participating in the discussion or vote. Pursuant to s. 7 of
that Act, the remaining trustees are deemed to constitute a
quorum despite any other general or special Act, permitting the
school board to continue its decision-making duties.  To the
extent that there may be a problem arising from potential
conflicts, there is a statutory solution in place.
[35] Since there is no reliable evidence of how often spouses
declare conflicts of interest, or whether such conflicts in
anyway interfere with the ability of district school boards to
function effectively, there is no evidentiary foundation for
concluding that the prevention of conflicts of interest is a
sufficiently pressing and substantial objective to justify the
total exclusion of spouses of school board or school authority
employees from eligibility for election to district school
boards. The violation of s. 15 is therefore not saved by s. 1.
[36] Although it is not necessary to undertake any further s. 1
analysis given this conclusion, in my view the reasons for
concluding that the spousal prohibition does not have a pressing
and substantial objective can also be used to reach the following
conclusions with respect to the proportionality aspect of the s.
1 analysis:</pre>
    <pre>          A.   There is no evidence to demonstrate that the
     spousal prohibition will necessarily solve, or even contribute to
     the solution of the problem the exclusion purports to address.</pre>
    <pre>          B.   There are alternatives available such as
     amendments to the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act which
     would less drastically impair the Charter right (minimal
     impairment);</pre>
    <pre>          C.   The harmful effects of a blanket restriction on
     the right of individuals to participate in the democratic
     process because of their marital status outweighs any
     statutory benefits of the prohibition (balancing of benefits
     and burden).

</pre>
    <pre>[37] I do not, however, agree with the submission of the
appellants that s. 219(4)(a) infringed s. 93(1) of the
Constitution Act, 1867. Section 219(4)(a) states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  Despite subsection (1), a person is not qualified to be
          elected or to act as a member of a district school board
          authority if the person is,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  an employee of a district school
               board or school authority; &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[38] In my view, Campbell J. was correct in concluding that s.
219(4)(a) does not prejudicially affect denominational aspects of
education, or non-denominational aspects of separate school
education that are necessary to give protection to the core
denominational values.
[39] Accordingly, the appeal with respect to s. 219(4)(a) is
dismissed. The appeal with respect to s. 219(4)(b) is allowed;
the dismissal of the application is set aside; and the
application for a declaration that s. 219(4)(b) is
unconstitutional is granted. There will be no costs of this
appeal.

    <pre>BROOKE J.A. (DISSENTING):</pre>
    <pre>[40] I have had the opportunity to consider the judgment of my
colleague. With respect, I cannot agree. In my opinion, Campbell
J. was right and, essentially for the reasons he gave, I would
dismiss this appeal.
[41] The relevant provisions of the legislation are set out in my
colleague&#146;s judgment.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[42] When political decisions must be made, a conflict of
interest is a serious matter. Even the appearance of a conflict
of interest can be enough to damage public confidence in
political bodies.
[43] From the material filed by the parties, it is clear that the
problem that confronted the Legislature, and gave rise to this
legislation, was how best to deal with the fact that certain
elected school board trustees were regularly disqualified by
reason of the same conflict of interest and so prevented from
participating in important matters. Because of the number of such
trustees, the boards were handicapped and were seen as
functioning in critical areas as a smaller body than was
desirable.
[44] The trustees who were disqualified were teachers or other
employees of a school board, not necessarily the board to which
they had been elected, and their spouses. The problem had nothing
to do with gender, the integrity of the trustees, or their
ability to vote honestly, but rather with a principle that is and
was respected, simply, that persons with a conflict of interest
should not participate and vote.
[45] The trustees were required to declare their conflicts and
were disqualified pursuant to the Municipal Conflict of Interest
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.50. That Act provides that, where the
economic interest of an employee is affected, if a trustee, he or
she must withdraw and not vote. It also provides that, where the
economic interest of an employee is affected, there is a deemed
conflict of interest in her or his spouse, and such person, if a
trustee, must withdraw and not vote. The provisions of that Act
are not attacked in these proceedings. Nor is the fact that, at
law, such a spouse would appear to have a conflict of interest.
The provision of that Act to the effect that the remainder of the
trustees, after those who were so disqualified from participating
and voting, would constitute the board for the purpose of a
decision, did not resolve the problem.
[46] These provisions of the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act
no doubt proceed on the accepted value that employees and their
spouses are mutually dependent irrespective of the resources of
either. They are, in fact, and are seen to be, an economic unit.
That value underlies the decision of the Divisional Court in
Re Moll and Fisher et al. (1979), 23 O.R. (2d) 609, where
questions of similar conflicts of interest were resolved.
Significantly, the value is not doubted today and underlies the
continuing obligations of spouses to one another (see the recent
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in Bracklow v. Bracklow
(1999), 169 D.L.R. (4th) 577). But, while these provisions of the
Municipal Conflict of Interest Act were important and needed,
they did not offer a solution to the problems that the
Legislature sought to resolve in passing the legislation in
question.
[47] It appears that the Legislature had a good deal of
information about these conflict-of-interest problems when the
matter arose. To begin with, it had the judgment in Re Moll and
Fisher delivered in the spring of 1979 where Robins J. stated at
p.621: &#147;The importance of the issue raised by this application is
underscored by the fact that some 200 elected school trustees in
Ontario, we are told, are spouses of teachers. The consequences
of this type of conflict of interest should be made manifest.&#148;
The issue of the qualification of teachers to serve as trustees
had been considered by the Municipal Conflict of Interest
Consultation Committee (&#147;the Committee&#148;). The Committee delivered
its report in 1991. It reported to the Legislature that &#147;at any
given time, fifty percent of school board members may be required
to withdraw from decision-making due to conflicts of interest&#148;
related to their employment, or a family member&#146;s employment,
with a school board.
[48] The Legislature also had before it a letter to the then
Minister of Municipal Affairs from the Ontario Separate School
Trustees&#146; Association (&#147;the Association&#148;) written in June 1992.
Speaking with the authority of and on behalf of a number of
school boards, the letter acknowledged that the principal area of
conflict for trustees under the Municipal Conflict of Interest
Act is in the area of collective bargaining. The letter states
that: &#147;This is because many trustees are themselves employees of
school boards, or are related to employees of school boards.&#148;
Collective bargaining accounted for approximately 80 percent of a
school board&#146;s budget. I think it is clear this would include
salaries, benefits, pensions, job security, working conditions;
matters which would impact heavily on the board&#146;s work and its
budget but would also impact heavily on the economic interest of
the employee and her or his family.
[49] The letter also stated that the &#147;experience of the
association is that the results of teacher negotiations in one
area of the province eventually migrate to other areas of the
province. This is true not only for teachers but for other board
employees&#148;.
[50] The Association referred to passages in the report of the
Committee, with which it agreed, and said: &#147;What these excerpts
reveal is the essence of the problem for school boards &#151; it is
not only the reality but also the appearance of conflict which
impairs the legitimacy of board decisions.&#148;
[51] The information was updated and the Legislature had before
it the minutes of school board meetings from the year 1997.  The
minutes showed, for example, that at the York Region Roman
Catholic Separate School Board (&#147;the York Board&#148;), 8 of 18
trustees (44%) were disqualified by reason of a conflict of
interest as teachers or the spouses of teachers or employees. The
individuals are named and the relationship of each set out. These
trustees were precluded from participating in meetings and voting
on matters relating to salaries and benefits that accounted for
73% of the budget.
[52] Similarly, at Dufferin Peel Roman Catholic Separate School
Board (&#147;the Dufferin Board&#148;), one-third of the trustees are
teachers or spouses of teachers. A chart shows the 12-month
history of conflicts as recorded in that Board&#146;s minutes and the
deponent states that, in all cases, the conflicts related to
employee compensation and collective bargaining. There were 21
trustees on that board; 7 were teachers or spouses of teachers.
[53] At London, all three members of the French language section
are teachers or spouses of teachers. At Halton, one-third of the
trustees have family members employed by the Board, two of whom
are spouses.
[54] The material does not, in every case, attempt a statistical
analysis as between spouses of employees and such employees. But
it is clear from the judgment, the report referred to, and the
updated reports, that there were a number of each.  However, the
breakdown is clear in the York Region and in the Dufferin
example, and a reasonable inference could be drawn that there
were a number of trustees who were employees of boards and a
number who were spouses of employees of boards in the various
districts. In addition of course, the numbers of each group would
vary from year to year in the future. They are a group from
which, because of their interest, there would undoubtedly be many
candidates.  There was sufficient information before the
Legislature to identify the problem, and determine that it was
real and important. Spouses of employees and employees, because
of the conflict of interest, predictably would be disqualified
from carrying out important duties and obligations of a trustee.
To permit them to stand for election simply meant that, if
elected, the other trustees would have to carry the load of
decision making and all of the work in the related important
areas. In the circumstances this would be unfair to the remaining
trustees, impair the work of the board and so, unfair to the
public. Accordingly, the Legislature accepted one of the
alternatives recommended by the Committee in its report and
disqualified both the employees and their spouses from standing
for election as trustees.</pre>
    <pre>THE S.15 QUESTION</pre>
    <pre>[55] If spouses of employees and employees have very similar or
identical conflicts of interest, and accordingly are similarly
treated, being disqualified from participating in related work of
the school board, should spouses of employees and employees be
treated differently for the purposes of this legislation because
of the Charter? In other words if spouses of employees and
employees are identified as a group which, because of the same
conflicts of interest, is the root of the problem this
legislation is intended to deal with should they be treated
similarly &#150; equally or does the Charter require unequal
treatment?
[56] The judgment of my colleague sets out some of the principles
to consider and the general approach to take when a violation of
s.15 of the Charter is alleged. Those principles, derived from
Mr. Justice Iacobucci&#146;s judgment in Law v. Canada (Minister of
Employment and Immigration) (1999), 170 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.),
need not be repeated here.
[57] However, the passages that focus on the purpose of s.15 and
the need for a purposive and contextual analysis are also
important. As to the purpose, Iacobucci J. concluded that the
protection and promotion of human dignity is the core of the
section. Human dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised on
personal traits or circumstances, which do not relate to
individual needs, capacities or merits. Significantly, he said at
pp. 26-27:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Equality analysis under the Charter is concerned with the
          perspective of a person in circumstances similar to those of the
          claimant, who is informed of and rationally takes into account
          the various contextual factors which determine whether an
          impugned law infringes human dignity, as that concept is
          understood for the purpose of s. 15(1).</pre>
    <pre>[58] While he did not have the advantage of the three-step
approach suggested by Iacobucci J., in my opinion, Campbell J.&#146;s
judgment is a careful, purposive and contextual analysis.
[59] Before Campbell J., the claimants sought a finding that the
disqualification of employees, and spouses of employees, both
violated s.15 of the Charter. Having analyzed the whole of the
section as it then stood, and the background, Campbell J.
dismissed the claims. There is no appeal with respect to the
disqualification of employees of a school board from standing for
election, but only as to spouses of such employees.
[60] In my view, it is not enough to consider s.219(4)(b) alone.
Rather, to understand the purpose of the legislation, paragraph
(b) should be examined in the context of the whole section. The
section must be considered with reference to the way in which the
law and the legislative scheme evolved to deal with conflicts of
interest and the integrity and effectiveness of public tribunals.
It is unrealistic to proceed in any other way.
[61] This was, broadly speaking, the approach taken by Campbell
J. He began his analysis by saying, at p. 368: &#147;To determine the
constitutionality of the provision it is necessary first to know
its purpose&#148;. In Law, Iacobucci J. underscored the importance of
the purpose of the impugned law in determining whether it
violates s.15.  From his reasons, I think Campbell J.&#146;s approach
accords in many respects with the approach taken by the majority
in Law.
[62] Campbell J. found  the underlying purpose of this kind of
prohibition was set out in the 1991 Committee report:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The intent of these prohibitions is to ensure accountability
          and impartiality in decision-making on matters affecting the
          operation of the council, school board, or local board.  It
          embodies the rule that no person can serve as both master and
          servant.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A substantial number of individuals in
          the educational field, primarily teachers,
          hold office on school boards, and the
          majority of matters considered by school
          boards relate to educational programs and
          policies, and labour-related issues which are
          usually consistent across the province.</pre>
    <pre>[63] He pointed to the public perception of the conflict problem
as reflected by the 1991 report:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Representations to the Committee have indicated that at any
          given time, fifty percent of school board members may be required
          to withdraw from decision-making due to conflicts of interest of
          this nature.  Therefore, decisions on these issues are always
          made by the same remaining members.  Concern is largely centred
          on the fact that many members are not involved in the decision-
          making process on a continuing basis, and therefore are not
          adequately fulfilling their representative role.</pre>
    <pre>[64] He also referred to the concern of  the boards as recorded
in their letter to the Minister:
          </pre>
    <pre>            As politicians we value our credibility.  If the decisions of
          school boards are seen as illegitimate, then our effectiveness
          would be impaired to the detriment of all of society.</pre>
    <pre>[65] He relied on the decision of Robins J., as he then was, in
Re Moll and Fisher, supra.  In that case, two men who were the
spouses of two teachers were elected members of a school board.
They voted on a proposed collective agreement with the board&#146;s
teachers and were involved in collective agreement policy.  They
appealed from the judgment of a single judge finding each in
breach of the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act, and from their
consequent disqualification from the board for a period of time.
Robins J. said at p.612:
          </pre>
    <pre>            Public office is a trust conferred by public authority for
          public purpose.  And the Act, by its broad proscription, enjoins
          holders of public offices within its ambit from any participation
          in matters in which their economic self-interest may be in
          conflict with their public duty.  The public&#146;s confidence in its
          elected representatives demands no less.</pre>
    <pre>[66] Campbell J. rejected the claim that the disqualification
from standing for election to a school board of employees, in
pursuance of the goal of preventing conflict of interest and
increasing confidence in elected representatives, violated a
Charter right.
[67] As to spouses, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               So far as spouses are concerned, there is no prohibition
          against spouses generally.  It is only a narrow category of
          spouse that is excluded.  There is no discrimination on the basis
          of a spousal category such as common law or unmarried spousal
          status.  There is no evidence that the spousal prohibition
          adversely affects woman [sic] disproportionately from its affect
          on men.
          </pre>
    <pre>          There is nothing new about spousal and other
          familial conflict of interest prohibitions.
          They are all very fact-specific and they all
          have to be decided on their particular facts.
          The prohibition here is more purposive and
          narrowly focused than the prohibitions in
          Brossard (Ville) v. Laurin (Commission des
          Droits de la Personne), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 279,
          53 D.L.R. (4th) 609, per Beetz J. at p. 315.
          The prohibition here is objective, general,
          and capable of consistent neutral
          application, unlike the application of the
          prohibition in Cashin v. Canadian
          Broadcasting Corp. (1988), 86 N.R. 24
          (F.C.A.).
          </pre>
    <pre>          Spouses are an economic unit with mutual
          legal duties of economic support.  In respect
          of the kinds of issues dealt with by school
          boards and the interdependency of financial
          decisions such as collective bargaining
          settlements throughout the entire educational
          system I adopt what was said by Robins J. in
          Moll at p. 621:
               </pre>
    <pre>               Clearly, it is inimical to the
               public interest that an elected
               official having a voice in
               bargaining on behalf of the public
               should, at the same time, be in a
               position to advance his private
               economic interest.  In essence, the
               applicants have placed themselves
               on both sides of the bargaining
               table.  Their family purse is in
               conflict with their public duty.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The extension of the conflict prohibition to
          spouses does nothing more than recognize the
          nature of the spousal relationship and its
          impact on the particular economic and
          collective bargaining realities of the work
          of school trustees.  As with the other
          prohibition just dealt with, I cannot in the
          spousal prohibition find any of the badges of
          discrimination such as distinction based on
          an irrelevant personal characteristic,
          stereotyping, stigmatization, historical
          disadvantage, or any diminution of the
          recognition of anyone&#146;s value as a human
          being.  To paraphrase Jones again, spouses of
          school board employees are a heterogeneous
          group with disparate characteristics and they
          are not historically disadvantaged.  They do
          not belong to groups or classes enumerated in
          s.15 groups which can be considered analogous
          to the enumerated groups.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[68] I agree with substantially all of the above.
[69] My colleague notes that the judgment of Robins J. in Re Moll
and Fisher, supra, was delivered before the passage of the
Charter. I assume this does not suggest it is other than a
reliable authority. It is an important decision and, in many
respects, important in this case. I note it was referred to by
Sopinka J. in Old St. Boniface Residents Assn. v. Winnipeg (City)
(1990), 75 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.).   On its facts, I think it
is correct on each of the issues that also arise in this case.
The statements of Robins J. and Campbell J. respecting spousal
relationships and mutual dependence, as reflecting the economic
interest of each spouse in the economic interest of the other,
correspond with those recently expressed by the Supreme Court of
Canada in Bracklow, supra.
[70] I turn then to the three-step approach to evaluating s.15(1)
claims that was outlined by Iacobucci J. in Law.
[71] Step one. I agree that s.219(4) draws a formal distinction
between the claimant and others on the basis of a personal
characteristic which is that they are the spouse of a person
specified in part (a) of the section.
[72] Step two. Is the claimant subject to differential treatment
based on one or more of the enumerated grounds or an analogous
ground? The law continues to evolve in this area. After
considering the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Corbiere v. Canada (Minister of Indian and Northern Affairs),
[1999] S.C.J. No. 24, released May 20, 1999, I agree that the
claimants are subject to differential treatment based on marital
status, which is an analogous ground. In that case, McLachlin J.
settled the question of what constitutes an analogous ground and
that an analogous ground does not vary from case to case
depending on context. The views of L&#146;Heureux&#150;Dubé J., if to the
contrary, are rejected. While it is not specifically considered,
it appears that the approach of Gonthier J. which is referred to
as the &#147;relevancy test&#148; is also rejected notwithstanding that it
was the approach of the majority in Egan v. Canada, [1995] 2
S.C.R. 513. (See also Iacobucci J. in Benner v. Canada (Secretary
of State), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 358 at 391-2). If that test were
acceptable, then, in my opinion, spousal status would not
constitute an analogous ground in this case. The characteristic
was relevant to the purpose of legislation.  I think this was
essentially the route taken by Campbell J. but, on the basis of
Corbiere, he erred in doing so.
[73] Step three. Discrimination.  Does the differential treatment
discriminate by imposing a burden upon or withholding a benefit
from the claimant in a manner which reflects a stereotypical
application of presumed group or personal characteristics, or
which otherwise has the effect of perpetuating or promoting the
view that the individual is less capable or worthy of recognition
or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian society,
equally deserving of concern, respect and consideration?
[74] As to this, my colleague states, in paragraph [25]:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The effect of the disqualification based on marital status
          is to withhold a benefit to spouses of board employees; namely,
          the right to seek election to district school boards. This right
          is a benefit denied in a manner which reflects and perpetuates an
          assumption that spouses, unlike others in society, are incapable
          of independent decision making. There is no doubt that the
          interests of spouses are in many ways inter-related, but a
          blanket exclusion of all spouses reflects the unrealistic view
          that spouses always share in common all interests and opinions
          with their partners. It thereby attributes a stereotypical
          quality to spouses, namely, that their decision-making abilities
          are in a state of perpetual conflict with their capacity to
          decide issues of a public nature.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[75] This conclusion is fundamental to the decision. With great
respect, I cannot agree with this conclusion. To say this law
reflects such an assumption is to say that it reflects such an
assumption by the Legislature. There is no basis for this
statement. The purpose of the legislation was to deal with the
problem created by conflicts of interest. The effect of the
legislation was confined to only those persons who had an
identified conflict of interest. Neither the purpose nor the
effect of the legislation was discriminatory.  There is no
stereotypical view that spouses do not have the capacity to
decide related public issues where there is a conflict of
interest. The view is that no one has the capacity to do so.
[76] In my opinion, the distinction, in this case based on
spousal status, is not discriminatory.  The human dignity of the
claimants has not been harmed by any unfair treatment of the kind
or quality referred to Iacobucci J.  The case fails at step
three.
[77] Like my colleagues, I am concerned about the significance of
the disqualification of board employees and their spouses and the
loss of the right to stand for election to this public office. No
doubt members of the Legislature were too. No one would be more
acutely aware of the significance of the disqualification than
our elected representatives. But also, no one would be more
acutely aware of the significance of a conflict of interest.
[78] In the circumstances, the appellants have failed to satisfy
their onus to show that the Legislature violated their rights as
guaranteed by s.15 of the Charter.
[79] In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.
[80] In the event that I am wrong, the issue depends on an
analysis of whether the spousal disqualification can be justified
under s.1 of the Charter.
[81] I have a different view of the evidence than my colleagues
who say that there is no evidence that spousal conflicts
represent a problem, let alone a pressing and substantial
problem.
[82] In my view, there is evidence that spousal conflict of
interest represented a problem. The spouses of employees were
part of a group, together with employees, that had been
identified as having the same or very similar interests and thus
the conflict of interest that caused a pressing problem. The
problem was not created by one part of the group or the other,
but by all of the persons who had the same conflict of interest &#150;
the whole group.
[83] Was there evidence that the conflict of interest of the
persons in the group so identified represented a problem? The
report of the Committee to the Legislature stated that, in 1991,
up to 50 percent of school board trustees were employees of
boards or the spouses of employees who had to disqualify
themselves from participating in or voting on matters that
created a conflict. The appellant challenges the evidential value
of the report because neither the original nor the reports it
apparently relied upon were produced.
[84] However, I regard the letter from the Association as very
significant. Its value as evidence is not challenged. The letter
is important as it was written &#147;with the authority of, and on
behalf of Association francaise [sic] des conseils scolaires de
l&#146;Ontario, Association franco-ontarienne des conseils d&#146;ecoles
[sic] catholiques, Ontario Public School Boards&#146; Association, and
Ontario Separate School Trustees&#146; Association.&#148; This is obviously
a group of associations, each of which operates across the
province and represents a very large percentage of school boards
in the province. In my view, the letter is strong proof of the
problem created by conflicts of interest of trustees who are
themselves employees of a board or spouses of employees. The
letter also shows that the problem is significant, as it relates
to matters that constitute about 80% of school boards&#146; budgets
and affect the efficiency and integrity of a board. The
Association is obviously aware of the report of the Committee and
does not quarrel with its finding that up to 50% of trustees are
employees or spouses of employees.
[85] Further, the updating material, while a sampling, provides
information that supports the identification of the problem and
its cause.  The York Board reports that 44% of members are
employees or spouses of employees, and the Dufferin Board and the
others, 30%.
[86] Do spouses of employees form a part of the group that
represents the problem?  Re Moll and Fisher records that there
were 200 spouses of employees who were at that time elected
school board trustees. The letter from the Association reveals
trustees who were related to employees as part of the problem.
The Committee report is to the same effect. Finally, the update
reports all show spouses of employees and employees as making up
30% to 44% of their board.
[87] Moreover, in both the reports of the York Board and the
Dufferin Board, the information is specific. The trustees who are
spouses of employees are named, as are the trustees who are
employees. There is a record of the votes on which each was
disqualified and why. The employees and spouses of employees, as
a group, were disqualified on matters that would affect the
economic interest of employees. It is, in my respectful opinion,
unrealistic to suggest that the conflict of interest in the
material is other than that with which we are concerned. That is
what Re Moll and Fisher was about and prompted Robins J. to say
at p.621:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The importance of the issue raised by this application is
          underscored by the fact that some 200 elected school trustees in
          Ontario, we are told, are spouses of teachers. The consequences
          of this type of conflict of interest should be made manifest.</pre>
    <pre>[88] That is what the report of the Committee and the letter from
the Association were about. That is what the updating material
makes clear.
[89] The onus on this issue is on the respondent and the proof
required is of a higher degree than with respect to the s.15(1)
issue.  I find this evidence persuasive and, in my view, it
satisfies that onus. I think the decision of the Legislature was
reasonable .
[90] I would dismiss the appeal.
