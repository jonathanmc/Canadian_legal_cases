</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Taliano J. dated September 19, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal involves a property dispute over the Whitby
Court House between the City of Oshawa (&#147;the City&#148;) and the
Regional Municipality of Durham (&#147;the Region&#148;).  For the purpose
of this appeal, the Region is the successor to the County of
Ontario (&#147;the County&#148;).
[2]  Following a trial heard upon an Agreed Statement of Facts,
Taliano J. found in favour of the City and granted it the
interest it claimed in the Whitby Court House.  The facts are
fully stated in the Agreed Statement of Facts and few facts need
to be referred to for the purpose of this appeal.
[3]  On September 3, 1963, the City and the County entered into
an agreement that provided for the acquisition of land and the
construction and maintenance of a new court house and County of
Ontario administration facilities (&#147;the property&#148;).  The
agreement provided that the parties were to share the ownership
of the property as tenants in common in proportion to an agreed
formula.  The lands would be registered in the name of the County
and the County agreed that, at the request of the City, it would
convey the City&#146;s equity in the property to the City.  In other
words, the property was being held in trust by the County.
[4]  On January 1, 1968, the Province of Ontario assumed
responsibility for the administration of justice in the Province.
It entered into an agreement with the County whereby it assumed
payment of the balance of debentures issued to finance the
property and thereafter undertook to pay rent for the property.
The rent payments were commenced after payment of the debentures
in May 1974 and have been paid to this date to the Region.
[5]  In 1973, an act was passed to establish the Regional
Municipality of Durham (&#147;the Regional Statute&#148;).  The Regional
Statute amalgamated the County and various other communities to
form the Region.  Under the Regional Statute the City remained a
separate corporate entity from the Region.
[6]  The Region does not dispute that the City had an interest in
the property before the passage of the Regional Statute.
However, it takes the position, on a number of grounds, that the
City&#146;s interest was subsequently extinguished.</pre>
    <pre>     Extinguishment</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The Region submits that the interest of the City was
extinguished by the Regional Statute.
[8]  The trial judge correctly noted that there was no provision
in the Regional Statute that extinguished the City&#146;s interest.
Essentially, he concluded that, with respect to the agreement
dealing with the property, the &#147;new&#148; City stood in the shoes of
the &#147;old&#148; City and that the Region stepped in for the County.
[9]  We see no error on the part of the trial judge in his
interpretation of the Regional Statute.</pre>
    <pre>     Arbitration</pre>
    <pre>[10] The Regional Statute provided for an arbitration mechanism
for the resolution of disputes arising from the disposition of
assets and liabilities of the municipal areas involved.
[11] The trial judge noted that the City was not named as one of
the municipalities covered by the arbitration provision in the
Regional Statute.  Moreover, the arbitration award did not
indicate that anything other than the County&#146;s interest in the
property was being determined.  Nothing in the award indicated
that the City was losing its interest in the property.
[12] The trial judge concluded that the arbitration award did not
apply to the City.  We agree.</pre>
    <pre>     Acquiescence/Estoppel/Laches</pre>
    <pre>[13] The trial judge concluded that the City never did any act
that could be construed as inducing or encouraging the belief in
the Region that the City was relinquishing its property rights.
The City did nothing to mislead the Region into acting in a
manner that was detrimental to the Region&#146;s interest nor did the
Region rely on anything that the City did to its own detriment
with respect to the property.
[14] The evidence supports the conclusion of the trial judge and
this argument fails.</pre>
    <pre>     Other Arguments</pre>
    <pre>[15] The Region has also raised arguments with respect to
prescription of the City&#146;s action, constructive or resulting
trusts and oversight in the legislation.   We see no merit in
these arguments for the reasons expressed by the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>  Cross-Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[16] With respect to the entitlement of the City to claim arrears
of rent from May 1974 (or 1984 when the issue of ownership of the
courthouse was raised by the City) the trial judge found it
inexcusable on the part of the City to have sat on its rights in
this regard until 1988, when a demand was first made upon the
Region for the arrears.
[17] The trial judge applied a flexible approach to service the
ends of fairness and justice and his conclusion on this issue is
supported by the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[18] In the result, the appeal and the cross-appeal are both
dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
