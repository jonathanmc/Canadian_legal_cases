    <pre>Appeal from the judgment of Borkovich J. dated November 16, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, there was evidence upon which the trial judge
could base his decision to make a time-limited support order.
However, we are of the view that, in setting the time limit at
three years, the trial judge over-emphasized the importance of
encouraging self-sufficiency. There were a number of other
factors that militated against such a timely achievement of that
goal.
[2]  In all the circumstances, we are of the view that, as
suggested by counsel for the appellant as an alternative
submission, a period of five years is appropriate.
[3]  We are not persuaded that the trial judge made any error in
the exercise of his discretion with respect to the costs order.
[4]  The appeal is allowed, the judgment is varied to provide for
a period of five years instead of three years in paragraph 7.
Otherwise, the judgment stands.
[5]  In light of the divided success, the appellant will be
awarded one half of her costs of the appeal fixed in the amount
of $2,000.</pre></td>
