    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Potts J. dated April 21, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  This appeal involves the purchase of two condominiums by the
parties.  After the purchase, but before the closing, the market
fell.  As a result the parties were not anxious to close.
[2]  The plaintiff was in a particularly difficult situation.  In
addition to the two units he had bought with the defendant, he
had also bought one with his wife.  In his predicament, he
consulted with the vendor.  The result was that, in effect, the
purchase with his wife was cancelled and the money already
advanced on that purchase was transferred to the purchases by the
plaintiff and the defendant.  Those purchases were eventually
closed.
[3]  The plaintiff and defendant, however, disagreed about two
aspects, namely, the crediting of the money transferred and the
collecting of rents.  We are given to understand that the matter
of rent collection has now been resolved between the parties.
[4]  The plaintiff&#146;s claim for half of the value of the money
transferred was dismissed at trial. Although the judge below
found that the defendant clearly benefited from the transfer, he
accepted the defendant&#146;s evidence that he had not agreed to pay
or repay the plaintiff in this regard.  The plaintiff&#146;s claim,
however, was put on two grounds:  one was an undertaking by the
defendant to repay the plaintiff and, in the alternative, as
partners, the defendant would be bound to give the plaintiff
credit for the money transferred.  In his reasons, the trial
judge did not mention the matter of partnership, nor its
consequences in the circumstances.
[5]  The plaintiff pleaded that they were partners and testified
to that effect.  The defendant&#146;s statements in his evidence that
they were partners and the admitted conduct of the parties, at
least to the time of closing, drive us to the conclusion that
they were in fact, and in law, partners.  As a consequence, the
defendant was bound to credit the plaintiff with the amount in
issue.
[6]  The amount transferred from the transaction involving the
plaintiff and his wife to the transaction involving the plaintiff
and the defendant was $101,580.  The plaintiff is entitled to
half of that ($50,790), together with interest from the date of
the transfer, January 29, 1991, together with the costs below and
in this court.
[7]  The appeal is allowed and the judgment below set aside.  In
its place will go an order in the terms set out above.
