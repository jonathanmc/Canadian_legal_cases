    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   The appellant, Bart Beaumont (&quot;Beaumont&quot;), appeals from the
quantum  of the judgment awarded against him. The award was  made
on the basis of unjust enrichment. The measure of damages was the
amount  by which the personal expenses paid on Beaumont's account
by  P &amp;  B Plumbing &amp; Heating Ltd. (&quot;P &amp; B&quot;) ( a company owned by
his parents) exceeded the salary to which he was entitled for his
services to the company.
[2]   The  trial judge held that Beaumont's employment terminated
on  November 30 and that he was entitled to total remuneration of
$145,000  for the period of time he was employed by P  &amp;  B.  The
trial  judge  also  found  that,  following  November  30,  1990,
Beaumont still performed services for P &amp; B for a period of  time
during  which,  to  the  knowledge of P &amp;  B,  he  was  receiving
unemployment benefits. In light of this latter finding, the trial
judge  ruled  that, with respect to the period of time  following
November 30, 1990, neither Beaumont could claim a salary nor P  &amp;
B  a  reimbursement of personal expenses. No appeal is taken from
these findings.
[3]   Given the findings and reasoning of the trial judge, we are
satisfied  that there were two errors in the calculation  of  the
personal expenses paid to Beaumont. First, P &amp; B should not  have
been  credited  the  sum  of $15, 691.20  for  expenses  paid  on
Beaumont's account after November 30, 1990. Second, an amount  of
$7,634.74  in relation to Beaumont's occupation of 10  Brant  was
credited twice to P &amp; B. Consequently, we would allow the  appeal
and reduce the award by the sum of $23, 325.94.
[4]    We   are  otherwise  satisfied  that  the  trial   judge's
calculation  of  damages  was in accord with  his  reasoning  and
supported  by the evidence. Further, we would not interfere  with
the  exercise  of  his  discretion with respect  to  pre-judgment
interest and costs.
[5]   The  trial  judge  rendered  his  judgment  orally  at  the
conclusion of the trial. Prior to doing so, he indicated that  he
decided  to deliver his reasons in this expedient fashion  in  an
attempt  to alleviate the stress between the parties. He  clearly
left  his  reasons  open for correction if required.  The  errors
complained  about on appeal were not brought to the attention  of
the  trial  judge  after  the trial by the  appellant.  In  these
circumstances, we make no order as to the costs of the appeal.

AUSTIN J.A. (dissenting)

[6]  I disagree.  Both counsel attempted to reconcile the figures
in  the  reasons for judgment with those found in  the  evidence.
There  were a variety of ways of arriving at the figures  in  the
reasons  but  little, if any, agreement between  counsel  to  the
correct, or more correct path to follow.
[7]   The  conclusion  reached  by  Charron  and  Moldaver  JJ.A.
requires interpreting the language of the trial judge as  meaning
that  although Bart Beaumont was paid in fact after November  30,
1990, he was to be treated as not being employed, because of  the
position  taken  by  the  parties with  respect  to  unemployment
insurance.
[8]   I  am  unable  to  reconcile this with  the  trial  judge's
approach on other matters.  Accordingly, I would refer the matter
back to the trial judge for clarification, if possible, or to the
General Division for re-trial.
[9]  I agree with the disposition of costs by the majority.
