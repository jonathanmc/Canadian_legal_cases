    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            PACKARD PRESS NEW ENGLAND, INC. (Plaintiff
               (Respondent)) v. THE WIDECOM GROUP INC. (Defendant
               (Appellant))</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        DOHERTY, AUSTIN and GOUDGE JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       R. David Murray
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Thomas G. Andrews
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 12, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Coo dated March 12,
1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The reasons provide the basis upon which the trial judge
made the necessary credibility assessments and findings of fact.
Those reasons suggest no misapprehension of the evidence or
failure to consider relevant evidence.  Nor can we say that any
of the findings of fact are unreasonable.
[2]  The trial judge did not use the defence failure to call
certain witnesses to &#147;fill gaps&#148; in the plaintiff&#146;s case.  There
were no such gaps once the evidence of the plaintiff&#146;s witnesses
was accepted, as it was, by the trial judge.  The trial judge&#146;s
reference to the defence failure to call witnesses, one of whom
was potentially crucial, was, in our view, nothing more than an
indication of a further weakness in the defence case which, among
others, led him to prefer the plaintiff&#146;s case.
[3]  We do not agree that the evidence of the printing costs of
the second IPO, revealed on cross-examination of the defendant,
was inadmissible.  Its weight was for the trial judge and it does
not appear from his reasons that he gave it any prominence in his
determination of the case.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.
