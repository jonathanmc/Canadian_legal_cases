    <pre>HEARD:         April 15, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from conviction and sentence by Mr. Justice Rutherford
with a jury dated July 18, 1997 and August 21, 1997 respectively.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of second degree murder and
sentenced to life imprisonment, with no parole eligibility for 12
years. He was also convicted of arson causing bodily harm for
which he received a concurrent sentence of 15 years. He appeals
against conviction and the sentence imposed for second degree
murder.</pre>
    <pre>     OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In the early morning of December 10, 1995, fire broke out in
a second floor apartment at 292 Lajoie Street in the City of
Vanier. After extinguishing the flames, the attending
firefighters found two people on the bedroom floor:  Claude
Poitras, the 36-year old tenant of the apartment who had expired
in the blaze and his guest, Janice Bryan who survived with severe
and extensive burn injuries.
[3]  Some hours earlier, the appellant and two friends had
visited the tenant of the adjacent apartment, Michael Atkin, in
search of drugs. Mr. Atkin knew that his neighbour, Mr. Poitras,
might assist and the four went next door. There, the initially
congenial atmosphere disintegrated when the appellant began to
loudly accuse Mr. Poitras of reneging on his end of the
transaction by holding back an amount of marijuana. Mr. Poitras,
the stronger of the two, took offence and scuffled with the
appellant, punching him a number of times before ordering the
four out of his apartment.
[4]  It was the position of the Crown that shortly thereafter the
appellant learned that Mr. Poitras and Ms. Bryan were fast asleep
and he went to Mr. Poitras&#146; apartment alone to set fire to it as
a deliberate act of vengeance. The evidence in support of this
position was advanced principally through the testimony of the
appellant&#146;s three companions who, with reasonable consistency,
testified that back in Mr. Atkin&#146;s apartment, the appellant had
repeatedly and aggressively given voice to an intent to kill Mr.
Poitras; that he had hurried out of the Atkin apartment carrying
an empty pizza box after hearing that Mr. Poitras and his
companion were asleep; that he had returned very shortly
thereafter without the pizza box; and that minutes later, smoke
began to billow into the Atkin apartment from the Poitras unit.
Two of the appellant&#146;s friends testified that the appellant
acknowledged having set the fire. The empty pizza box was later
found in the deceased&#146;s apartment.
[5]  The position of the appellant was that the fire was either
accidental, or had been set by someone else. In support of a
defence of alibi, he offered the evidence of his mother who
stated that she saw her son arrive home with an injured face at
precisely 2:17 that morning. The appellant did not testify.</pre>
    <pre>     CONVICTION</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal against
conviction.</pre>
    <pre>          Cross-examination of the appellant&#146;s mother as to her
     relationship with the appellant</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Crown counsel sought permission from the trial judge to
elicit evidence from Mrs. Pagé, the appellant&#146;s mother that: she
had been violently assaulted by her son on numerous occasions in
the past; she had never taken the initiative to have her son
charged; to the extent the charges had been laid as a instance of
other family members, Mrs. Pagé had approached the Crown and
requested that the charges be withdrawn and she had allowed her
son to return home to live with her despite his abusive conduct.
[8]  It was the position of Crown counsel that he was entitled to
elicit this evidence to explore whether Mrs. Pagé&#146;s relationship
with her son went beyond that of a normal parent/child
relationship and that she was motivated, by love or fear, to
improperly support his alibi to shield him from criminal
responsibility.
[9]  Defence counsel objected to the admissibility of this
evidence on the basis that it disclosed morally repugnant conduct
on the part of the appellant and that its prejudicial effect
outweighed its probative value.
[10] The trial judge disagreed. After instructing himself in
accordance with the relevant legal principles, he concluded that
the probative value of the impugned evidence outweighed its
prejudicial effect. In this respect, he stated in part as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The facts that the Crown seeks to cross-examine on, do,
          in my view, relate to Mrs. Pate&#146;s credibility as an alibi
          witness, and having read the necessary portions of her
          examination and cross-examination at the preliminary inquiry, I&#146;m
          satisfied that this is a real issue and that there is real
          relevance to her credibility. Indeed, it is at or near the center
          of the trial issues. The importance of her credibility in this
          trial is underscored, or demonstrated by the fact that the alibi
          is at odds with the evidence of the Crown witnesses, both those
          with whom the accused was associating and with some of the local,
          less interested or should one say, disinterested witnesses who
          testified for the Crown.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Serious as the prejudicial effect
          the facts sought to be cross-examined on
          could be for the accused, I am persuaded that
          the probative value of these contested facts
          is higher. To have the mother&#146;s alibi
          evidence go to the jury, bereft of the more
          detailed appreciation of the relationship
          between her and her son, would, in my view,
          seriously impede the jury in a most important
          function, namely, the assessment of the
          credibility of the mother&#146;s evidence, which,
          as I have said, is of significant importance
          to the question of guilt or innocence.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Of course, it goes without saying,
          that I will necessarily instruct the jury
          clearly, I hope, and carefully, on the
          limited use they are to make of the contested
          evidence; and thus, insure that the jury does
          not make prohibited use of it.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[11] As promised, the trial judge provided a careful and detailed
limiting instruction on the use which the jury could make of this
evidence, both when it was led and later in his charge to the
jury. In particular, he made it clear that under no circumstances
could this evidence be used to show that the appellant was the
type of person more likely to have committed the crimes charged
and that the evidence could only be used in assessing the worth
of the alibi evidence offered by his mother.
[12] As indicated, the trial judge gave express consideration to
the issue of relevance and he carefully weighed all of the
appropriate factors in deciding that the probative value of the
evidence sufficiently outweighed its potential prejudicial effect
to warrant its admission. In the final analysis, we are not
persuaded that he erred in exercising his discretion as he did
and accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>          Reasonable doubt</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing
to define reasonable doubt in accordance with the guidelines set
forth in R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). In
particular, he contends that the trial judge failed to
distinguish the criminal from the civil burden of proof.
[14] When the trial judge&#146;s instructions are read in their
entirety, we are satisfied that the jury would not have been
misled as to the standard of proof required of the Crown or of
the meaning of reasonable doubt. Accordingly, this ground of
appeal fails.</pre>
    <pre>          The admissibility of the appellant&#146;s videotaped
statement</pre>
    <pre>[15] Following his arrest, the appellant provided a statement to
the police after he had twice spoken to counsel and been apprised
of his legal rights. The appellant contends that the statement
should not have been admitted because the police exerted undue
pressure upon him and he did not fully understand his right to
remain silent.
[16] The trial judge rejected both of these arguments. He found
as a fact that the appellant fully understood his right to remain
silent and that the conduct of the police did not constitute
impermissible police persuasion.
[17] In our view, it was open to the trial judge to make those
findings and we see no basis for interfering with them.
[18] Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[19] In increasing the parole ineligibility from 10 to 12 years,
the trial judge took into account the following circumstances of
the offence and the offender:
     </pre>
    <pre>(a)       the fact that the fire was set during the night in a
          house with multiple inhabitants;
(b)       the &#147;horrendous&#148; and &#147;life lasting&#148; quality of the
	  burns to Janice Bryan;
(c)       the &#147;explosive character&#148; of the appellant in
	  connection with drugs and alcohol, reflected in his history of
	  violent acts against his domestic partner and his mother; and
(d)       the appellant&#146;s age of 31 years and the diagnosis that
	  he is HIV positive.
     </pre>
    <pre>     </pre>
    <pre>[20] The trial judge&#146;s reasons for sentence reflect no error in
principle and, in our view, he was entitled, in the exercise of
his discretion, to increase the period of parole ineligibility to
12 years. In all of the circumstances, the sentence was fit and
we see no basis for interfering with it.
[21] Accordingly, leave to appeal  sentence is granted and the
appeal from sentence is dismissed.</pre></td>
