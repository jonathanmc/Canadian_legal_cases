    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Greer J. dated December 2, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>CATZMAN J.A.:
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The foundation for the order of Greer J., and for the
earlier order made by Laforme J., was a reservation of title
contained in invoices for footwear sold by the respondent
(&#147;Pajar&#148;) to a retailer (&#147;Bootmaster&#148;), by which the goods were
to remain the property of Pajar until such time as the entire
purchase price was paid in full.
[2]  As of November 2nd, 1998, the value of the footwear
delivered to Bootmaster but not paid for was said to be close to
$42,000.00.     On that date, Pajar issued a statement of claim
and brought a motion, returnable the following day, for an order
for interim preservation of property.   Bootmaster did not appear
on the return of the motion.  On November 3rd, 1998, Laforme J.
made an order that the footwear in question be returned to Pajar,
but further ordered that the footwear be taken and held by the
Sheriff for ten days, within which Bootmaster might bring a
motion &#147;in the event it seeks to assert a higher or better title
to the property&#148;.  If Bootmaster failed to bring such a motion,
Pajar was at liberty to apply for an order requiring the Sheriff
to deliver all of the seized footwear to it.
[3]  Bootmaster brought no such motion.  On November 12th, 1998,
it filed an assignment in bankruptcy.  On the same day, the
trustee in bankruptcy served a notice of motion for an order
directing that the seized footwear be delivered to it.  The
trustee asserted, without contradiction, that the security
interest reflected in the reservation of title to the footwear
was never perfected by Pajar in accordance with the provisions of
the Personal Property Security Act (&#147;PPSA&#148;).
[4]  The trustee&#146;s motion was heard by Greer J. on November 18th,
1998.  She dismissed it and allowed a cross-motion by Pajar
directing the Sheriff to deliver the seized footwear to it.
After concluding that &#147;the order of Mr. Justice Laforme [was] not
affected by the bankruptcy which occurred one week later&#148;, Greer
J. said:
               Mr. Justice Laforme [ordered] that the goods identified in
          Schedule &#147;A&#148; be returned to the plaintiff (Pajar).  He allowed
          Bootmaster 10 days to bring a motion or application if it sought
          a higher or better title to the goods and it did not do so.  The
          title to the goods remained in Pajar when the order was made by
          Mr. Justice Laforme and, in my view, the intervening hastily
          registered security of Mr. Arvanitopoulos [the principal of
          Bootmaster] did nothing to affect either the title to the goods
          or the terms of Mr. Justice Laforme&#146;s order.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In my respectful view, Greer J. erred in concluding that the
order of Laforme J. was unaffected by Bootmaster&#146;s subsequent
bankruptcy.  Bootmaster&#146;s bankruptcy on November 12th &#150; before
the expiration of the ten days prescribed by the order of
Laforme J. &#150; significantly altered the nature of the contest over
the footwear from one between Pajar and Bootmaster (and its
principal, Arvanitopoulos) over the title to the goods to one
between Pajar and Bootmaster&#146;s trustee in bankruptcy over the
effectiveness of Pajar&#146;s unperfected security interest in the
goods.  With the bankruptcy of Bootmaster came the entitlement of
the trustee under the PPSA to challenge Pajar&#146;s security
interest. Having failed to perfect its security interest in
accordance with the PPSA, Pajar could not rely on the principle
that the rights of the trustee could be no higher than that of
Bootmaster: Re Bellini Manufacturing &amp; Importing Ltd. (1981), 32
O.R. (2d) 684 at 691 (C.A.).  By virtue of sec. 20(1)(b) of the
PPSA, Pajar&#146;s security interest was not effective against the
trustee and, accordingly, Greer J. should have granted the
trustee&#146;s motion.
[6]  During the argument, we were advised that, following the
institution of the appeal from the order of Greer J., Pajar took
possession of the goods and disposed of them in a manner unknown
to the trustee.  In these circumstances, I think it appropriate
to accede to Mr. O&#146;Reilly&#146;s suggestion that Pajar be ordered to
account to the trustee for the wholesale  value of the goods in
such sum as the parties may agree or, failing agreement, as may
be found upon a reference for that purpose.
[7]  I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of Greer J.
and direct that Pajar pay to the trustee the sum agreed or found
upon a reference. Pajar should pay to the trustee, forthwith
after their assessment, the trustee&#146;s costs of the motion before
Greer J. and of this appeal.
