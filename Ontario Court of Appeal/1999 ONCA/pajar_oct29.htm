    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Greer J. dated December 2, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      SUPPLEMENTARY REASONS</pre>
    <pre>CATZMAN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In my reasons released on September 15th, 1999, I said, at
paragraph 6:</pre>
    <pre>   6. During the argument, we were advised that, following the
      institution of the appeal from the order of Greer J., Pajar took
      possession of the goods and disposed of them in a manner unknown
      to the trustee.  In these circumstances, I think it appropriate
      to accede to Mr. O&#146;Reilly&#146;s suggestion that Pajar be ordered to
      account to the trustee for the wholesale value of the goods in
      such sum as the parties may agree or, failing agreement, as may
      be found upon a reference for that purpose.
          </pre>
    <pre>[2]  The suggestion that Pajar be ordered to account to the
trustee for &#147;the wholesale value of the goods&#148; originated with
Mr. O&#146;Reilly&#146;s factum.  Neither counsel made submissions
regarding the meaning of that phrase at the hearing of the
appeal, and the panel therefore assumed that counsel were agreed
as to its meaning in the event that the appeal was allowed and an
order made in those terms.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In this, the panel was mistaken.  It transpired that counsel
for the parties could not agree on the meaning of &#147;the wholesale
value of the goods&#148;, and they sought guidance from the court on
that subject.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  We invited counsel for the parties to file written
submissions, which we have now received and considered.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  I respectfully agree with the submissions filed by Mr.
O&#146;Reilly on behalf of the appellant.  In my view, the wholesale
value of the shoes is to be determined by using the invoice price
of the footwear shipped by Pajar to Bootmaster for those items
seized by the sheriff and returned to Pajar.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The order of the court of September 15th, 1999, will be
amended accordingly.
</pre>
    <pre>Released: OCT 29 1999           Signed:  &#147;M.A. Catzman J.A.&#148;
          MAC                            &#147;I agree Louise Charron J.A.&#148;
                                         &#147;I agree K. Feldman J.A.&#148;</pre></td>
