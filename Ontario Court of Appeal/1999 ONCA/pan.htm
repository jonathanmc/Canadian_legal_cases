    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On May 18, 1989, the appellant was charged with first degree
murder.   His first two trials ended in mistrial orders.  At  his
third  trial,  presided over by the Honourable Mr. Justice  Watt,
the appellant was convicted of first degree murder by the verdict
of  the jury.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for life, without
eligibility for parole for 25 years.  He appeals his conviction.
[2]  For the reasons that follow, the appellant's appeal is
dismissed.
[3]  These reasons will first provide a history of the
proceedings and a summary of the evidence that was before the
jury that convicted the appellant.  The various grounds of appeal
will then be dealt with in the following order.
[4]  First, we will consider the appellant's application to
introduce fresh evidence of matters relating to the jury
deliberations in his second trial before O'Connell J.  He seeks
to admit evidence of what transpired in the jury room among the
jurors at his second trial to demonstrate that O'Connell J. erred
in declaring a mistrial when the jury had in fact reached a
verdict.
[5]  To dispose of the fresh evidence application, it is
necessary as a threshold matter to consider the appellant's
constitutional challenge to the common law as well as the
Criminal Code provision governing the admissibility of evidence
related to jury deliberations. The combined effect of the common
law and the Criminal Code is to prohibit the disclosure and
admission into evidence of any information about the proceedings
of a jury when the jury is out of the courtroom.  The appeals in
R. v. Henderson and R. v. Galbraith; R. v. Sawyer, which were
argued along with this appeal, raise the same constitutional
challenge.  Accordingly, our reasons on the issue of the
constitutionality of the statutory and common law jury secrecy
provisions will consider those appeals to the extent that they
raise this issue.
[6]  Next we will deal with the appellant's argument that Watt J.
erred in his preliminary ruling refusing the appellant's motion
for a stay of proceedings on the grounds of abuse of process.
According to the appellant, Watt J. ought to have awarded a stay
for two reasons:  i) O'Connell J. erred in declaring a mistrial
on the second trial because the jury had in fact reached a
verdict and;  ii) it was an abuse of process to proceed with a
third trial against the appellant considering that his first two
trials ended in successive mistrials.
[7]  Finally, we will deal with a number of additional grounds of
appeal that concern various rulings by Watt J. in the course of
the trial as well as errors he allegedly made in his charge to
the jury.  These grounds include the objection that Watt J. erred
in dismissing the appellant's motion for a directed verdict on
first degree murder and that he failed to adequately charge the
jury on reasonable doubt.  The appellant also contends that the
jury's verdict of guilty of first degree murder is unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>THE HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</pre>
    <pre>[8]  On May 18, 1989, the appellant was arrested and charged that
between  February  10, 1988 and March 10, 1988 he  killed  Selina
Shen  and  did  thereby  commit  first  degree  murder.   He  was
committed  for  trial  on  October 11,  1989.   His  first  trial
commenced on May 28, 1990, before Doherty J. After four  days  of
deliberation, the jury advised the trial judge that it was unable
to agree on a verdict.  Doherty J. thus declared a mistrial.  The
appellant did not testify at his first trial.
[9]  On February 11, 1991, the appellant&#146;s second trial began.
This trial continued over approximately 50 court days.  On April
25, 1991, the trial judge, O&#146;Connell J., completed his charge to
the jury.  Jury deliberations began at about 4 p.m. that day.  On
May 1, 1991, the trial judge received a note from one of the
jurors.  That note asked the trial judge to poll the jury after
the jury&#146;s verdict was read in open court.  It went on to express
the juror&#146;s disagreement with the verdict.  That is to say, the
note suggested that any verdict returned by the jury would not be
unanimous.  After he discussed the note and its implications with
counsel, O&#146;Connell J. declared a mistrial and the jury was
discharged.  The appellant testified at his second trial.
[10] On May 3, 1991, ten of the jurors from the second trial
wrote to the Attorney General to complain about the &#147;jury
selection process.&#148;  This led to various discussions and
correspondence among the Attorney General, the jurors, and the
appellant&#146;s counsel.  An investigation into the conduct of the
jurors at the second trial was eventually ordered.  The details
of this investigation will be discussed at length later in this
judgment.
[11] Counsel for the appellant submitted to the Attorney General
that, in light of the circumstances of the appellant&#146;s two
trials, both of which ended in mistrials, he should not have to
face a third trial.  On November 22, 1991, counsel for the
Attorney General advised counsel for the appellant that the
interests of justice required that there be a third trial.
[12] On November 25, 1991, counsel for the appellant applied for
a stay of the proceedings and, further to that motion, filed a
notice of constitutional question,  challenging the validity of
ss. 649 and 653 of the Criminal Code.  The appellant took the
position that the jury secrecy (s. 649) and the mistrial (s. 653)
provisions of the Criminal Code were unconstitutional.  He also
sought to be permitted to call some, or all, of the twelve
persons who sat as jurors at his second trial as witnesses on his
stay application.
[13] On December 20, 1991, in a threshold ruling, Watt J. held
that s. 649 and the common law jury secrecy rule were
constitutionally valid.  He added that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          [T]he  evidence proposed to be elicited  from
          the  jurors, as well of any third  party  who
          purports  to  recount what  any  juror  said,
          about  matters inherent in their  conclusion,
          may not be received.  [Emphasis in original.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[14]  He  held,  however, that the appellant could call  evidence
about certain information that had been conveyed to O&#146;Connell  J.
shortly  before he declared a mistrial.  We will  refer  to  that
information in detail later.
[15] On January 13, 1992, the evidentiary part of the appellant&#146;s
application for a stay began.  The appellant called members of
the courthouse staff who worked at the second trial and the two
Crown counsel who had conducted the appellant&#146;s second trial.
The appellant also testified on the stay application.  On
February 5, 1992, Watt J. dismissed the application.  He stated
that &#147;reasons will follow if required.&#148;  On November 21, 1995 he
released extensive written reasons.
[16] On February 10, 1992, after a jury was selected, the
appellant&#146;s third trial began.  On May 1, 1992, after receiving
the jury&#146;s unanimous verdict of guilty of first degree murder,
Watt J. convicted the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>THE EVIDENCE</pre>
    <pre>[17]   The  Crown&#146;s  case  against  the  appellant  was  entirely
circumstantial.  We propose to review the evidence  only  to  the
degree  required to provide a reasonable factual background  from
which to consider the issues raised on this appeal as they relate
to the appellant&#146;s conviction of first degree murder.
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Overview of the Crown&#146;s case</pre>
    <pre>[18]  The theory of the Crown was that the appellant, having been
involved  in  an  intimate relationship  with  the  deceased  for
approximately three years, was obsessed with the deceased&#146;s  past
relationships  with other men.  When the deceased moved  out  and
ended  her  relationship with the appellant, he felt betrayed  by
her.  At that time he concluded the deceased had left him for one
Robert  Fisher.  He thus formulated, and carried out, a  plan  to
kill her.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Overview of the appellant&#146;s case</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant denied having anything to do with the death of
Selina  Shen.  The defence emphasized that the Crown&#146;s  case  was
entirely circumstantial and provided other explanations  for  the
evidence  relied on by the Crown.  The defence position was  that
all  of  the  evidence  which the Crown  claimed  implicated  the
appellant was the result of coincidence, or in some instances, of
panic on the part of the appellant.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   The appellant&#146;s relationship with the deceased</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The  appellant came to Canada in July 1981.   In  1983  the
deceased, Selina Shen, and her sister Sophia came to Canada.   In
October   1984,  Sophia  met  the  appellant  and  had  a   brief
relationship  with him which ended in early 1985.  The  appellant
met  the  deceased in about November 1984 and, in the  spring  of
1985,  the  deceased  moved  in with him  on  Gerrard  Street  in
Toronto.
[21] At the beginning of their relationship, the appellant had
the deceased set out her past mistakes in writing in a document
that he titled, &#147;Overall Statement of Loose Morals.&#148;1  In it the
deceased wrote:
          In  a  short  life of twenty  five  years,  I
          failed and failed again, especially these two
          years,  already lost the most valuable  thing
          in  life, don&#146;t know how to take care  of  my
          own   life,   destroying  myself  with   this
          unbearable result, and also lying to Pan  Rui
          Wen&#146;s feeling towards me and if not honest to
          him,  might  as  well  die.   Can&#146;t  face  my
          parents,  relatives and friends.   I  already
          felt  deeply  in  guilt  and  tried  to  save
          myself, climb up from the deep hell and  make
          myself  a  reborn person, encounter  all  the
          difficulties.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[22]  When the deceased&#146;s mother visited her in January 1986,  in
the  deceased&#146;s  presence,  the  appellant  used  the  deceased&#146;s
confession  of  her  past sins, set out  in  that  statement,  to
explain why he would not marry her.  The appellant testified that
he  saw  nothing  wrong with confronting the  deceased  with  her
conscripted &#147;Overall Statement of Loose Morals.&#148;
[23] Similarly, when Ming Pan, a friend of the deceased, asked
the appellant about his plans to marry the deceased, the
appellant told him that the deceased was on good terms with many
men and that she had had a baby fathered by a black man from El
Salvador.  The appellant made similar statements to others, and
to the police.
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.   Events prior to the disappearance of the deceased</pre>
    <pre>[24]  In January 1988, the deceased told Sophia that she intended
to  separate from the appellant.  She found a job in January 1988
at a coffee shop, using her sister&#146;s social insurance number.
[25] On January 16, 1988 Robert Fisher accompanied his former
wife, Anna Leung Fisher, to a dinner party at the appellant&#146;s
home.  During the course of the evening, Mr. Fisher introduced
himself to the deceased who was in the kitchen.  Among other
things, he told her that he was an instructor at the University
of Toronto School of Continuing Studies and that he taught
English as a second language. Mr. Fisher spoke with the deceased
for about 30 minutes, while she did the dishes, until the
appellant entered the kitchen.  The appellant introduced himself
and, as Mr. Fisher described it, led him away from the deceased.
Mr. Fisher then spoke with the appellant for about 30 minutes.
He testified that during that conversation, the appellant told
him that he was a medical doctor and that his specialty was
pathology.  Mr. Fisher and the appellant did not talk about the
deceased.  At the time Mr. Fisher knew nothing about the
relationship between the appellant and the deceased.  He assumed
that the deceased was a visa student who was renting a room from
the appellant and his brother.
[26] On January 18, 1988, Mr. Fisher telephoned the appellant to
thank him for the January 16th dinner party.  He also spoke to
the appellant&#146;s brother and, when that conversation ended, he
asked to speak with the deceased.  After a long pause the
deceased came on the line and Mr. Fisher thanked her for doing
the cooking at the party.  He also told her that he would be
happy to help her select courses in English at the School for
Continuing Studies.  He gave the deceased his telephone number
and said that she should feel free to call him at any time.  At
this time, Mr. Fisher still did not know of the relationship
between the appellant and the deceased.
[27] Mr. Fisher said that he received a telephone message from
the deceased on his answering machine on January 25, 1988.  He
called the number that the deceased had left but there was no
answer.  He then called the appellant&#146;s residence to ask for the
deceased.  The appellant answered and said that the deceased was
not there.
[28] The next day, January 26, 1988, Mr. Fisher again dialed the
number that the deceased had left on his answering machine.  The
appellant answered and told him that the deceased was not there.
He said that the deceased &#147; was not a good person to get involved
with&#148; and that she &#147;had problems.&#148;  When Mr. Fisher asked the
appellant if the deceased was having boyfriend problems, the
appellant told him that he should stay away from the deceased
because &#147;she would only bring me trouble and she was not a good
person.&#148;
[29] After this telephone conversation with the appellant, Mr.
Fisher, who was on good terms with his former wife Anna Leung
Fisher, dropped by Ms. Fisher&#146;s house.  When he arrived, Ms.
Fisher was speaking on the telephone with the deceased.  When
that conversation ended, Mr. Fisher spoke with the deceased and
they arranged to meet on January 27, 1988 at 11:00 a.m.
[30] On January 27th, Mr. Fisher met the deceased at the
University of Toronto School of Continuing Studies.  During the
meeting the deceased told him that she was planning to separate
from the appellant. She said that she had consulted an
immigration lawyer who was confident that she could obtain landed
immigrant status.  Mr. Fisher told the deceased that he had space
for her in his two-bedroom condominium.  The deceased did not
take him up on his offer.  Mr. Fisher testified that he never saw
the deceased again after he met with her that day.
[31] Ms. Fisher first met the appellant in February 1987.  She
met the deceased for the first time at the appellant&#146;s January
16, 1988 dinner party.  She gave the deceased her telephone
number during the evening.  Like her former husband, she was
unaware of the existence of a relationship between the appellant
and the deceased.
[32] Ms. Fisher said that on January 26, 1988 the deceased
telephoned her, and that  Mr. Fisher arrived while she was
speaking with the deceased.  When she spoke with the deceased,
Ms. Fisher offered Mr. Fisher&#146;s help to the deceased, who wanted
to obtain and complete a University of Toronto application form.
She thus turned the telephone over to Mr. Fisher who, as earlier
noted, arranged to meet the deceased on January 27th.  January
26th was the last time Ms. Fisher spoke to the deceased.
[33] Ms. Fisher said that on January 27th, near midnight, she
received a telephone call from the appellant, who said that he
wanted to talk to her in person.  Thus, Ms. Fisher and the
appellant arranged to meet the next day, January 28th.  When they
met, Ms. Fisher told the appellant that Mr. Fisher was going to
meet with the deceased.  After they had lunch, the appellant
drove Ms. Fisher to the Beaches area of Toronto.  Eventually, he
told Ms. Fisher that Mr. Fisher might be getting involved with a
Chinese woman, whom Ms. Fisher knew.  He did not name the woman.
When Ms. Fisher asked the appellant if the Chinese woman was the
deceased, the appellant said that he could not tell her.
[34] As the conversation unfolded, the appellant told Ms. Fisher
in an excited voice that she would be &#147;very surprised and
shocked&#148; about some future development.  The appellant then drove
Ms. Fisher to the hospital where she worked.
[35] Several hours later, when Ms. Fisher was leaving work, she
noticed that the appellant was parked close to the entrance to
the hospital.  He insisted on giving her a ride to the Ontario
College of Art where she was to attend a class.  She eventually
accepted his offer.
[36] On February 2, 1988, the appellant telephoned Ms. Fisher
again.  He told her that he wanted to meet with her again to
discuss something important.  Ms. Fisher agreed to meet him the
next day.  During that meeting, he mentioned that before he began
his relationship with the deceased he was involved with a girl
from Montreal.   He added that he used to drive through the
Kingston-Thousand Islands area &#147;to clear his mind.&#148;
[37] According to Ms. Fisher&#146;s evidence, the appellant again
started to refer to Mr. Fisher&#146;s involvement with a Chinese
woman.  He said Mr. Fisher and this woman would soon be moving in
together.  The appellant again told Ms. Fisher that something
very shocking and surprising was going to happen.  He added that
he would keep Ms. Fisher informed and that the future event to
which he referred could occur within one or two weeks.  Ms.
Fisher described the appellant&#146;s demeanour during this
conversation as &#147;quite anxious and quite excitable.&#148;
[38] The appellant telephoned Ms. Fisher once more on February 7,
1988 and asked to see her again.  She refused to meet with him.
[39] It was accepted at trial that the deceased separated from
the appellant and moved out of his house on February 6, 1988.
She did not leave her new address or telephone number with the
appellant.
[40] On February 9, 1988, the deceased telephoned the appellant
and, according to the appellant, gave him a &#147;tongue lashing&#148;
about the manner in which he treated her throughout their
relationship.  The appellant responded on February 13, 1988 by
writing a somewhat affectionate letter to her.  In this letter,
he suggested that they &#147;start again.&#148;  He delivered his letter to
the deceased by leaving it with a Mrs. Chan who lived near his
store. Since the deceased gave weekly violin lessons to Mrs.
Chan&#146;s son, the appellant knew that the deceased would receive
his letter. It was part of the Crown&#146;s theory that the appellant
knew that his relationship with the deceased was over at this
time and was attempting to persuade her to contact him.
[41] The appellant apparently heard nothing from the deceased in
response to his February 13th letter, so he wrote another letter
to her on February 20th.  This letter was of a quite different
character.  In it, he wrote in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If  we work hard on our future, I believe  we
          could  live happily ever after.  But now  you
          have  not  only broken your promise and  also
          destroy  everything.   Now  these  days,  you
          don&#146;t  know how cheap you have become.  Don&#146;t
          know  how many dirty men you have slept  with
          again  or maybe you have already got venereal
          disease and AIDS or you will get pregnant and
          have  a  bastard.  Anyhow, this is  your  own
          business,   you   have  to  take   your   own
          responsibility and it will serve you right in
          return.  Now in my heart, you are already the
          most  dirty, cheap and shameful woman in  the
          world.   That&#146;s why what we have in our  past
          is already finish.2
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[42]  Mrs. Chan testified that the deceased read this letter when
she  was  at Mrs. Chan&#146;s house to give her son his weekly  violin
lesson.   As  she read the letter she became very quiet  and  the
violin  lesson  stopped.  Mrs. Chan gave her  some  tea  and  the
lesson  resumed.   Then the music stopped and Mrs.  Chan  noticed
that the deceased was reading the letter again.
[43] The original of this letter, which Mrs. Chan gave to the
deceased, was never found.  The appellant gave what he said was a
copy of the letter to the police.3
[44] No one claims to have seen the deceased after she left Mrs.
Chan&#146;s on February 20, 1988.
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   Events following the disappearance of the deceased</pre>
    <pre>[45]  Sophia Shen testified that, during the morning of  February
22, 1988, when she could not contact her sister and after she had
determined  that she had not moved back with the  appellant,  she
immediately drove to the appellant&#146;s house in Scarborough.   When
she  encountered the appellant in his driveway, he told her  that
the  deceased was not there and there was no purpose  in  looking
for her in his house.  Sophia said that when she went back to the
appellant&#146;s  house  that evening she noticed that  his  hand  was
injured.  He said that he had injured his hand moving boxes.  The
next  day  when Sophia saw the appellant his hand was wrapped  in
bandages.
[46] David Mercer, who was an employee of the appellant, also
noticed the appellant&#146;s hand injury.  He had no recollection of
the appellant saying how he injured his hand.  When the
appellant&#146;s landlord collected the rent for the appellant&#146;s
Gerrard Street store he also noticed the appellant&#146;s injured
hand.  He said that the appellant told him that he had injured
his hand when he fell down while moving some merchandise.
[47] In early March 1988, Sophia called Ms. Fisher and told her
that her sister could not be located.  Ms. Fisher told Mr. Fisher
about this.  On March 4, 1988, Sophia reported the deceased&#146;s
disappearance to the police and told the appellant what she had
done.  He questioned her and then began to call her almost daily.
[48] Sophia testified that when she told the appellant that she
thought the deceased&#146;s disappearance should be reported to the
police, the appellant tried to persuade her not to contact the
police.  The appellant testified that he wanted to report the
deceased&#146;s disappearance to the police and Sophia tried to
persuade him not to do so.
[49] When the appellant told Mrs. Chan about the deceased&#146;s
disappearance, she advised him that he should have reported the
disappearance to the police.  According to Mrs. Chan, the
appellant said that the deceased was unstable and could have gone
away with someone including a &#147;western person.&#148;
[50] On March 4, March 29, May 5, 1988 and June 2, 1989, various
body parts were discovered in Eastern Ontario.  The body parts
included two legs, an arm, a thigh, a skull and a torso.  The
body parts were found on the Thousand Islands Parkway between
Rockport and Mallory Town, in the Trent River, in the Cataraqui
River, and in the Bay of Quinte.
[51] On May 13, 1988, the Ontario Provincial Police issued a
press release identifying the body parts as belonging to the
deceased, Selina Shen.  On May 14, 1988, the Toronto Star printed
a story about the identification of the body parts, which
reported that the police had not identified or located the
instruments used in the deceased&#146;s dismemberment.
[52] During the course of their investigation into the
disappearance and death of the deceased, the police began
investigating the conduct of the appellant, who was placed under
police surveillance.  The police also obtained authorization to
intercept the appellant&#146;s private communications.
[53] Constable Kaknavicius, who was involved in the surveillance
of the appellant, testified that at about 11:21 p.m. on May 14,
1988, the appellant, who was with two friends, parked his car in
the Beaches area of Toronto and removed some items from the hatch
of the car.  He took a large brown box and moved it to the
driver&#146;s seat and shut the driver&#146;s door.  He returned to the
hatch and took out a white plastic shopping bag and a small white
box about the size of a donut box.  He then walked toward the
beach.  He knelt down on the sidewalk for a short time and then
continued to walk toward the lake.
[54] When the appellant got to the beach he walked onto a pier.
Constable Kaknavicius could not see what the appellant did at the
end of the pier because of the darkness.  However, he heard some
&#147;rustling&#148; of the water and after a few minutes the appellant
left the pier with the bag and box.  According to Constable
Kaknavicius, the bag appeared to be empty.  The appellant then
walked up to the boardwalk to a point near a garbage can where he
was out of Constable Kaknavicius&#146; line of sight for a short time.
When Constable Kaknavicius again saw the appellant a few moments
later, he no longer had the bag in his hand, but he was still
carrying the small white box.  As he walked, the appellant tore
up the box and turned around in the direction from which he had
come and threw the box into a garbage can.  The appellant then
returned to his car, and at 11:42 p.m. the car left the area.
[55] At about 1:30 a.m. on May 15, 1988, Martin Hunt, a
Metropolitan Toronto Police Marine Unit diver searched the water
near the pier and recovered two quick cut 8 inch broad bladed
butcher knives, a 3½ inch paring knife, an 8 inch cooking knife
and a quick cut cleaver.  These cutting instruments were located
between 43 feet 10 inches and 60 feet from the end of the pier.
[56] Detective Sergeant Dalrymple, a forensic analyst with the
Ontario Provincial Police testified that the five instruments
found in the water came from at least three, and possibly  five,
knife sets.  They were all knives of a type sold in the
appellant&#146;s stores.
[57] That night the police also recovered from one of the
boardwalk garbage cans some pieces of ripped cardboard which,
except for one piece, when re-assembled constituted a substantial
part of the insert of a box in which knives were sold.
[58] The appellant admitted throwing the knives into the water
but denied that he tried to throw them as far as he could from
the end of the pier.  He explained that he disposed of the knives
because he was sure that he would become the target of false
allegations related to the deceased.  He said that he also threw
papers which revealed the names of people involved in the student
democracy movement in China into the water because he did not
want these papers to fall into the hands of the police.  The
police located no papers in the water, on the nearby shore, or at
the bottom of the lake.
[59] The appellant testified that when he threw the five knives
into the lake from the end of the pier on May 14, 1988, he
disposed of all knives in his residence. However, Andrew Fang who
lived at the appellant&#146;s house after his arrival in Toronto on
May 14, 1988, testified that he noticed that there were chopping
knives and smaller knives in the appellant&#146;s kitchen during that
time.
[60] After he returned home from the Beaches on May 14th, the
appellant spoke to some friends and expressed his concern about
being the target of false allegations.  This conversation was
intercepted by the police. He emphasized the absence of direct
evidence that implicated him in the death of the deceased.  As
translated, in his speech the appellant said, in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>          This  is a country ruled by law and it  gives
          great  weight  to evidence.   Yeah,  even  if
          there  is  premeditation;  they  don&#146;t   have
          direct  evidence against me.  If  they  don&#146;t
          have  your direct evidence, even if you  kill
          me,  they  have no way to convict you.   Yeah
          the  Crown  Attorney  will  not  be  able  to
          prosecute.  If he prosecutes, the judge  will
          say:  &#147;Bullshit!&#148;  And you will  be  released
          and declared innocent on the spot.  Yeah,  in
          the last analysis it&#146;s what year, what month,
          what  day you were at what place, what murder
          weapon  did  you  use,  in  what  kind  of  a
          (inaudible) did you kill her.  Yeah, now  our
          witnesses,  material evidence,  corroboratory
          evidence  are there.  Or are there  not  your
          fingerprints  on  this  knife.   Yeah,  blood
          traces  were found on your floor.  Her  blood
          traces  appear  on your wall.  Afterward,  we
          have  someone who saw it clearly she screamed
          and  after that saw you kill her and hit her.
          Yeah,  only  in  such a  case  can  [you]  be
          convicted, right?  It&#146;s very simple!
          </pre>
    <pre>          
     </pre>
    <pre>     6.   The manner of the deceased&#146;s killing and the
          appellant&#146;s medical training</pre>
    <pre>[61]  Dr.  Sepp,  a  pathologist, and Dr. Taylor,  an  anatomist,
testified    about   the   circumstances   of   the    deceased&#146;s
disarticulation.4  They both said that if they were going to do a
disarticulation  of limbs from torso, they would  have  used  the
same method as had been applied to the deceased.  In general, the
idea  would  be to do the dismemberment through soft tissue,  not
bone.
[62] Dr. Sepp explained that to sever a head at the neck, several
separate cuts through two cervical vertebrae would be required.
The cutter would have to know some anatomy to do this without
damaging bone, or any proximate structure.  Dr. Sepp testified
that the deceased&#146;s head was severed at the C5 level and he saw
no damage to the vertebrae or nearby structure at that level.
[63] Dr. Taylor explained in considerable detail what would be
required to sever the deceased&#146;s head from her torso.  He
expressed the opinion that the severance of the deceased&#146;s head
was effected at the C4-C5 level and  that the person undertaking
this severance would have to have had some knowledge of anatomy.
He added that cuts that he observed above the C5 were made with
precision and he saw no evidence of probing to determine where
the joints were.  All cuts were made in ideal positions to
achieve severance.  According to Dr. Taylor, what was required
was a knowledge of where joint surfaces were in relation to body
surfaces.  He said that a skilled person would be able to do the
dismemberment, &#147;remarkably quickly.&#148;  In response to questions
put to him in cross-examination, he acknowledged that &#147;it was
possible&#148; for a butcher to do the dismemberment, but he doubted
whether a butcher could do it so neatly.  He noted that the
anatomy of the hip joint of animals, with which butchers would be
familiar, is different from that of humans.
[64] Dr. Sepp testified that the larger knives retrieved from the
Lake would not have been particularly well suited for head
severance, however, they would have been suitable for the
severance of the deceased&#146;s limbs.  Dr. Taylor agreed that the
larger knives would be useful for severing the deceased&#146;s limbs.
[65] Both doctors testified about further evidence of trauma to
the deceased&#146;s body, apart from the trauma associated with the
head, arm and leg disarticulation.  This evidence included:
     ·    a wedge shaped piece about 4.5 centimetres across and six
          centimetres long was missing from the top of the deceased&#146;s right
          tibia.  This appeared to be the result of a blow by a sharp
          object as the edge was straight.  Dr. Sepp testified that the
          disarticulation would have had to have been complete, or almost
          complete, at the time of this blow.  Dr. Taylor said this
          indication of trauma was not related to the disarticulation.
          Drs. Sepp and Taylor both said that the cleaver, of the five
          knives that they examined, would have been the most suitable to
          make this wedge shaped cut.
     ·    a large deep incision across the front of the deceased&#146;s
          right elbow that extended to the back side of her elbow.  This
          cut could have resulted from an attempt at disarticulation.
     ·    the deceased&#146;s nipples and surrounding areolae were removed
          from her torso.  This mutilation was unrelated to the deceased&#146;s
          dismemberment.</pre>
    <pre>[66]  The  Crown contended that the medical evidence  established
that  the  person who murdered the deceased had a basic knowledge
of  anatomy and a relatively high level of expertise in  relation
to  surgical dismemberment.  The Crown further contended that the
appellant had the required knowledge and expertise.
[67] One of the appellant&#146;s graduation certificates filed at
trial showed that he had been &#147;outstanding in medical and
surgical clinics.&#148;  He took courses in biological anatomy,
pathology, surgical clinic and x-ray diagnosis.  He received a
mark of 95 in his anatomy course.
[68] In addition, there was considerable evidence that the
appellant frequently told others that he was a doctor, or that he
had been a doctor in China.  We see no need to review this
evidence since the relevant issue is not whether the appellant
referred to himself as a doctor, but rather whether he had the
skill and knowledge to effect the dismemberment of the deceased,
as referred to in the medical evidence.
[69] The appellant admitted that he had a basic knowledge of
human anatomy and his counsel conceded that the appellant had a
knowledge of anatomy sufficient to do the dismemberment referred
to in Dr. Sepp&#146;s evidence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     7.   The appellant&#146;s conduct following the death of Selina
          Shen</pre>
    <pre>[70] On May 16, 1988, the police interviewed the appellant.  When
they  asked  him  if  he  had reported the deceased  missing,  he
immediately blamed Sophia Shen for not doing so.  When the police
inquired  who  the  appellant thought  killed  the  deceased,  he
referred  to  a &#147;black guy&#148; with whom she had had a  child  years
earlier  and  then  to  a &#147;third party&#148; who  was  clearly  Robert
Fisher.  He gave Ms. Fisher&#146;s name, address and telephone  number
to  the  police.   Furthermore, he speculated, in his  discussion
with  the  police, that the deceased may have become involved  in
prostitution or with the mafia.
[71] On May 17, 1988, David Mercer, who was an employee of the
appellant, came to the appellant&#146;s home to get some money to
purchase insurance for a car Mercer was buying. While he was
there the appellant asked him to swear an affidavit, ostensibly
for the appellant&#146;s use in a libel action against some
newspapers.  The appellant dictated the affidavit and Mercer
signed it. When the affidavit was finished, the appellant gave
Mercer the car insurance money that he had come for in the first
place.  Two days after he signed the affidavit Mercer told the
police about it.  He also told them that the contents were true.
[72] The so-called affidavit was not sworn. The discussions
surrounding the Mercer &#147;affidavit&#148; were recorded through a room
probe in the appellant&#146;s house.  Before he dictated the
&#147;affidavit&#148;, the appellant told Mercer what to say, and not say,
to the police.
[73] In his &#147;affidavit&#148;, Mercer stated that neither he nor the
appellant knew if the deceased was missing, or if she had simply
moved in with someone else.  At trial, Mercer admitted that he
had no knowledge of her moving in with anyone, but he added that
it had been his belief that the deceased had moved to Australia
with someone.  Mercer also stated in his statement that Sophia
had not wanted to call the police after the deceased&#146;s
disappearance.  He acknowledged at trial that he did not have any
first hand knowledge about this.
[74] The Crown places a particular emphasis on a part of Mercer&#146;s
&#147;affidavit&#148; dealing with the appellant&#146;s use of his car.  The
&#147;affidavit&#148; put it this way:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Since  the  car accident last year (near  the
          end of the year) Mr. Pan&#146;s brother and I take
          turn&#146;s  [sic] driveing [sic].  The reason  we
          do  is  because Mr. Pan works long hours  and
          has made him too tired to drive.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[75]  Mercer  told  the police he drove the  appellant&#146;s  car  &#147;a
couple of times.&#148;  At trial, he said that he recalled driving the
appellant&#146;s  car  only once.  He said that  he  never  drove  the
appellant&#146;s  car  after  the  deceased&#146;s  disappearance.   Mercer
testified  that part of his &#147;affidavit&#148; where he  said  that  the
appellant was too tired to drive was not true.  It may  be  noted
that  a  police  officer  involved in  the  surveillance  of  the
appellant  over a one month period ending on May 13,  1988,  said
that  he saw the appellant drive his car 43 times, 27 times  with
another person in the car.
[76] Mercer testified that the appellant told him that the
&#147;affidavit&#148; was for use in civil proceedings against some
newspapers.  It was, however, open to the jury to conclude that
the appellant wanted Mercer&#146;s assistance, if necessary, in his
dealings with the police in connection with their investigation
of the deceased&#146;s murder.
[77] Later in the day on May 17th, the appellant arrived at Mrs.
Chan&#146;s house with a tape recorder.  The Crown contended that in
his dealings with Mrs. Chan on that occasion the appellant
attempted to manipulate her.  The appellant denied this
allegation.  He testified that he went to see Mrs. Chan because
he was concerned that she may have been spreading misleading
rumours about him.  He testified that he informed the police
about  his visit to Mrs. Chan, both before and after the visit.
[78] On May 19, 1988, the appellant held a press conference.  In
it he told the assembled reporters that both he and the deceased
had been blackmailed.  He stated that the blackmail came in the
form of a letter and a telephone call, which he recorded.  The
appellant implied at his press conference that the persons
responsible for Selina&#146;s murder may have been the persons
responsible for the blackmail. A reporter asked the appellant
whether the blackmail letter was addressed to him or the
deceased.  In response the appellant stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  cannot reveal it now, because, because  of
          my situation.  And besides, that&#146;s to say, we
          now, I have confidence and hope that the real
          murderer  will be caught soon.  Therefore  it
          is  not convenience [sic] for me to reveal it
          at the moment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[79] The appellant said at his press conference that he had given
the blackmail letter to the police.
[80] The appellant did not report being threatened or blackmailed
to the police before his May 19th press conference.  After the
press conference, he told Constable Riddell that a man had
threatened both the deceased and him and that he was looking for
the tape of the threatening telephone conversation to verify
this.  He said that he would give the tape to the police when he
found it.  None of the police involved in the investigation
received a tape or a blackmail letter from the appellant.
[81] On May 21, 1988, the police recorded a conversation that the
appellant had with his brother after the appellant picked up his
brother at the airport and returned home.  We do not propose to
review the details of this conversation.  It will be sufficient
to note that in it the appellant appears to have attempted to
tell his brother what he should say to the police.  For example,
the appellant said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Now don&#146;t say any extra things don&#146;t give  me
          any  superfluous addition when the time comes
          you  just  deal with it according to  what  I
          have told you.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
The appellant also expressed the opinion that in his dealings
with the police &#147;I will definitely win.&#148;  Later in the
conversation, the appellant seemed to tell his brother to tell
the police that he went to Ottawa and Montreal by bus, as opposed
to by car.  The appellant said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          You  went by bus that&#146;s the way it is now  we
          have  double trouble with this case you  know
          how  would he [inaudible] how would  he  know
          right if he asks you you say you went by  bus
          ...
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[82] On May 18, 1989, the appellant was arrested and charged with
first degree murder.</pre>
    <pre>THE FRESH EVIDENCE APPLICATION</pre>
    <pre>[83]  Having  set  out  the history of the  proceedings  and  the
evidence that was before the jury at the appellant's third trial,
we  now  turn  to  consider his application  to  introduce  fresh
evidence relating to the jury deliberations at the second  trial.
The  appellant seeks to introduce this evidence in support of his
contention that Watt J. erred in refusing to grant his motion for
a  stay  of proceedings, which was brought at the outset  of  the
third trial.
[84] In support of the motion before Watt J., the appellant
sought to introduce the same evidence that he now seeks to put
before this court.  He also argued before Watt J. that he ought
to be permitted to call as witnesses on the stay application any
of the jurors who sat on the second trial before O'Connell J.
Watt J. ruled that the jury secrecy rules at common law and in
the Criminal Code were constitutionally valid and refused to
receive any  evidence from the jurors.
[85] As noted earlier, the appellants in R. v. Henderson and R.
v. Galbraith; R. v. Sawyer also challenge the constitutionality
of the jury secrecy rules and seek to introduce fresh evidence of
matters relating to the jury deliberations at their trials.  The
arguments advanced by these appellants in support of the attack
on the jury secrecy rules will be considered here along with
those raised by the appellant Pan.
[86] The Crown opposes the fresh evidence applications on the
ground, among others, that admitting the evidence would be
contrary to governing principles respecting the secrecy of jury
deliberations, as reflected in both the common law and the
Criminal Code.
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Jury Secrecy and the Charter</pre>
    <pre>[87]  It  is a common law rule of long standing that a court  may
not  receive  evidence on the deliberations of  a  jury  for  the
purpose  of  impugning the jury&#146;s verdict. At  common  law,  jury
deliberations must be conducted in private and must remain secret
after  the  jury is discharged. The secrecy of jury deliberations
is also reflected in the provisions of the Criminal Code. Section
647  confirms the need for sequestration during the course of the
deliberations.5   Section 649 prohibits  jurors  from  disclosing
matters   relating  to  jury  proceedings  that  have  not   been
subsequently disclosed in open court, other than for the  purpose
of  an  investigation into or a prosecution of an alleged offence
of obstructing justice. Section 649 reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Every  member of a jury who, except  for  the
          purposes of
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)   an  investigation of an alleged offence
          under subsection 139(2) [obstructing justice]
          in relation to a juror, or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)   giving evidence in criminal proceedings
          in relation to such an offence,
          </pre>
    <pre>          discloses  any  information relating  to  the
          proceedings  of the jury when it  was  absent
          from  the courtroom that was not subsequently
          disclosed  in  open court  is  guilty  of  an
          offence punishable on summary conviction.</pre>
    <pre>[88]  The  appellants concede that the evidence  is  inadmissible
under  the  existing law but submit that the common law  rule  of
exclusion and s.649 of the Criminal Code infringe ss.7, 11(d) and
11(f)6 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.7
[89] In our view, the scope of both the common law rule of
exclusion and s.649, as circumscribed by case law and policy, are
constitutionally sound.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   The Constitutional Issues Defined</pre>
    <pre>[90]  Jury  secrecy  has long been considered  necessary  by  the
courts  to  maintain  the viability of the  jury  as  a  judicial
decision making body. Several policy reasons have been stated  in
support of the rule including the following: it fosters free  and
frank debate within the jury room; it ensures the finality of the
verdict;  and  it  protects  individual  jurors  from  post-trial
harassment, censure or recrimination.
[91] The appellants acknowledge that secrecy is essential to the
proper functioning of the jury.8 They recognize the value of
several of the stated policy objectives and agree that, within
proper boundaries, it is constitutionally permissible to espouse
both common law and statutory rules to advance these objectives.
Hence, it is conceded that, if jurors are to deliberate in total
frankness, they must be provided with some assurance that what is
said by them in the jury room will not be disclosed. It is also
not disputed that jurors who are summoned from the community to
serve as participants in our system of justice should be entitled
to return to the community free from harassment, be it from the
press, the public or the defeated litigant. Likewise, it is only
logical to conclude that, where members of a jury may have reason
to fear retaliation by litigants or public condemnation for an
unpopular decision, the anonymity afforded to individual opinions
of jurors will serve to promote impartial decision-making.
[92] The main thrust of the appellants&#146; argument relates, rather,
to finality as a policy justification for the rule. The
appellants concede that it is well established that finality of
proceedings is an important principle in our legal system. They
query, however, whether jury secrecy is based on a need to
prevent continued questioning of a jury&#146;s verdict or if it is
simply a method by which the system's frailties are kept secret.
If the secrecy rule is based on the former, the appellants
concede that finality is a valid concern. On the other hand, if
the rule is based upon the latter, it is submitted that they are
not only invalid but &#147;intolerable in a free and democratic
society.&#148; The appellants argue that the concern for finality
cannot be used to immunize jury verdicts from appropriate review.
They submit that a rule of exclusion that admits of no exception,
regardless of the particular circumstances of individual cases,
infringes the accused&#146;s rights under ss.7, 11(d) and 11(f) of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Likewise, they submit
that a statutory rule that prohibits disclosure by jurors of all
matters relating to the proceedings of the jury other than in the
context of an obstructing justice investigation or prosecution is
too broad and is unconstitutional.</pre>
    <pre>[93] The relevant Charter provisions read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          s.7   Everyone has the right to life, liberty
          and  security of the person and the right not
          to  be  deprived thereof except in accordance
          with the principles of fundamental justice.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          s.11  Any person charged with an offence  has
          the right
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)   to  be  presumed innocent until  proven
          guilty  according to law in a fair and public
          hearing   by  an  independent  and  impartial
          tribunal;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (f)  except in the case of an offence under military law tried
          before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where
          the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five
          years or a more severe punishment;
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[94]  The  appellants argue that the common law rule of exclusion
infringes  these Charter rights in that it precludes  an  accused
from  seeking  a remedy in cases where he or she  may  have  been
convicted  by  a  jury who relied on extraneous information,  was
subject  to  improper  outside  influence,  or  otherwise   acted
contrary  to its oath. They submit that, in cases where the  jury
has  so acted, the accused will not have been deprived of his  or
her   liberty  in  accordance  with  &#147;principles  of  fundamental
justice&#148;  nor will he or she have been tried in &#147;a fair  hearing&#148;
by  an  &#147;impartial  tribunal&#148; or indeed by a  &#147;jury&#148;  within  the
meaning  of these sections of the Charter. They therefore  submit
that  the  common law exclusionary rule should admit  of  certain
exceptions so as to conform with constitutional standards.
[95] The appellants submit that s.649 of the Criminal Code also
contributes to the violation of these same Charter rights because
it prevents an accused from gathering evidence to demonstrate the
infringement of his or her rights. They therefore argue that, in
as much as the common law rule should be modified to conform with
the constitutional rights guaranteed under ss.7, 11(d) and 11(f),
s.649 should be declared unconstitutional and of no force or
effect to the extent that it precludes an accused from gathering
evidence that could be used for verdict impeachment purposes. In
other words, the appellants submit that jurors should be allowed
to disclose matters that show that they have relied on extraneous
information, have been subject to improper influence or otherwise
have not acted in accordance with their oath. In order to achieve
this, some of the appellants submit that the court can read in
additional exceptions to s.649 while others argue that the entire
section must be struck down.
[96] The Crown submits that the common law rule of exclusion is
not as unforgiving as the appellants contend because, under the
existing common law, courts can and do inquire into those matters
that are of concern to the appellants.  The Crown submits that,
given the recognized value of the policy reasons underlying the
evidentiary rule, it is entirely in accord with principles of
fundamental justice to draw the line of admissibility at the jury
room door.  Similarly, the Crown submits that s.649 of the
Criminal Code is reflective of the same principles and does not
infringe the appellants&#146; Charter rights.</pre>
    <pre>[1]  [97] The main focus of the appellants&#146; argument has been  on
s.649  of  the  Criminal Code. It is important to note,  however,
that  s.649  does  not in any way define rules of  admissibility.
Section  649 simply makes it a criminal offence for  a  juror  to
disclose  certain  information relating  to  the  proceedings  in
certain  circumstances. In our view, the constitutional questions
raised on these appeals are better addressed by first considering
the common law rule of exclusion and then measuring the scope  of
the  s.649  prohibition  against  this  rule.  This  analysis  is
preferable because, in the context of these appeals, it  is  only
to  the  extent  that  s.649  may  prevent  the  appellants  from
obtaining   relevant   and  admissible   evidence   for   verdict
impeachment  purposes  that it can be  found  to  infringe  their
rights.  If,  on the other hand, the court concludes  that  s.649
only  precludes  the appellants from obtaining  information  that
would,  in  any  event, be inadmissible under a  constitutionally
valid  common law rule of exclusion, no case will have been  made
to  invalidate  s.649.  Whether  the  statutory  provision  would
withstand constitutional analysis in another context would become
a question better left for another day.9
[98] Hence, the following questions must be considered:
1.   Does  the  common  law  exclusionary  rule  precluding   the
     admission  of  evidence  on the deliberations  of  the  jury
     infringe  an accused&#146;s rights under ss.7, 11(d) or 11(f)  of
     the Charter?
2.   If  the  answer to question 1 is yes, how should the  common
     law be modified to reflect constitutional standards?
3.   To  the  extent that the evidence would be admissible  under
     the  common law rule, as it presently stands or as modified,
     does  s.649 of the Criminal Code impede an accused&#146;s  access
     to such evidence from jurors?
4.   If  the  answer to question 3 is yes, to what extent  should
     s.649  be  declared unconstitutional and  of  no  force  and
     effect?</pre>
    <pre>[99]  Nothing  on  the trial record in any of  these  proceedings
gives rise to the constitutional issues before the court. Each of
the appellants, rather, seeks to rely on fresh evidence to ground
his constitutional application.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   The Factual Basis for the Constitutional Application:
          The Fresh Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[100]      The  fresh evidence sought to be relied upon  by  each
appellant  consists of statements from jurors on matters  related
to  their deliberations. The Crown is opposed to the admission of
the  fresh  evidence on three grounds. Firstly, this evidence  is
inadmissible for all the policy reasons underlying the common law
rule  of  exclusion with respect to jury deliberations. Secondly,
the  proposed medium of proof of the evidence is hearsay  and  as
such  is inadmissible. Thirdly, even if the evidence is found  to
be otherwise admissible, it is irrelevant to the determination of
the appeals.</pre>
    <pre>[1]  [101]     This court reviewed the proposed fresh evidence at
the  hearing of the appeal and reserved its decision on the issue
of  its  admissibility. In the ordinary course, the  court  would
first  rule  on  the admissibility of the fresh  evidence  before
considering  any issue arising therefrom. In this case,  however,
it  is  our  view that we should first determine the  appellant&#146;s
constitutional application because it targets the very rule  that
excludes this type of evidence.
[102]     Crown counsel is quite correct in stating that the
proposed evidence may be inadmissible regardless of the outcome
of the constitutional application. Indeed, on the question of
medium of proof, s. 686 of the Criminal Code, which empowers this
court to receive evidence, does not dispense with the rule
against hearsay: R. v. O&#146;Brien (1977), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 209
(S.C.C.). However, in fairness to the appellants, the prohibition
under s. 649 of the Criminal Code against juror disclosures would
not permit them to obtain affidavits from the individual jurors.
Hence, the evidence may well be in the best possible form at the
present time. It would place the appellants in an impossible
&quot;catch-22&quot; situation if they were required to file affidavits
from the jurors themselves before their constitutional challenge
to s. 649 could be considered on its merits.</pre>
    <pre>[103]      We  are  therefore of the view that the constitutional
issues should be determined before ruling on the admissibility of
the  fresh  evidence.  In order to provide some  context  to  the
constitutional debate, it may be useful to consider the nature of
the  proposed fresh evidence and the ultimate use the  appellants
seek  to make of it in their respective appeals. We have included
in  this  summary  matters which are not part of the  appellants'
applications but that the Crown would seek to introduce in  reply
in  the  event that the appellants&#146; evidence is admitted  by  the
court.


</pre>
    <pre>     i)   Pan&#146;s appeal</pre>
    <pre>[104]       Pan   seeks  to  introduce  a  number  of  post-trial
statements  from the jurors at his second trial. These statements
include letters to the Attorney General as well as statements and
transcripts  of  interviews obtained  during  the  course  of  an
investigation into an alleged offence of obstructing justice. Pan
contends that this material should have been received by Watt  J.
on Pan&#146;s application for a stay on the ground of abuse of process
in relation to the second trial.
[105]     As  referred to in the earlier discussion of the
history of these proceedings, on May 1, 1991, Pan&#146;s second trial
resulted in a mistrial as a result of a note sent to the trial
judge by one juror, unbeknownst to the other jurors. The note
read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Your  honour, will you please pole  us  after
          the  virdict [sic] is read but if  you  could
          make  it  look as if this is what is done  in
          the  courts  I have to do what I feel  I  was
          sworen [sic] to do &amp; what I feel is right  in
          my  heart &amp; after what I've been put  through
          in  the  jury room this was the  only  way  I
          could  do  it.  Please let me say I  am  very
          sorry if this has caused so much time &amp; money
          but as I said I have to do what based on what
          you said hearing what every one else said day
          after  day  &amp; still keeping an open  mind  in
          order  to reread &amp; go over the facts.  For  I
          feel I have made the right choice.  Thank you
          for letting me serve in your court.  Its been
          an honour.  Juror #1.</pre>
    <pre>[106]      After  the  trial judge discussed  the  note  and  its
implications with counsel, he declared a mistrial and  discharged
the  jury.   Then,  there commenced a series of  letters  to  the
Attorney  General. The first letter dated May 3, 1991 was  signed
by  the eleven other jurors who expressed concern about the  jury
selection  procedure. They stated their view that more  questions
should  be asked regarding mental health, medication, vision  and
hearing. They indicated their belief that &#147;if it hadn&#146;t been  for
the  misconduct  and clandestine behaviour of juror  #1,  justice
would  have been served and our unanimous verdict (including  the
12th  juror in question) would have been accepted, rather than  a
mistrial  being  called.&#148; Lastly, they  opined  that  a  terrible
injustice had been done with respect to Mr. Pan.
[107]     Juror #1 responded by letter dated May 7, 1991 wherein
she denied the portrait of herself painted by the eleven others
in the letter of May 3rd.
[108]     When these letters were published by the media, seven
jurors from the appellant&#146;s first trial were prompted to write to
the Attorney General on May 12, 1991. The first trial, it will be
recalled, also ended in a mistrial after a jury could not reach a
verdict. The seven jurors from the first trial stated &#147;without
telling you exactly what we concluded, we feel that it is our
duty as citizens to say that we clearly may not have come to the
same conclusion as the second jury; please do not assume that we
did.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[1]   [109]     Some further letters were sent by the jurors from
the  second  trial  complaining about juror  #1.  She  responded,
asking  that an investigation be commenced with respect  to  what
occurred in the deliberation room. She claimed that she had  been
forcibly prevented from leaving the jury room when she had wanted
to announce that the jury was hung.
[110]     As a result of this correspondence, the Attorney
General of Ontario commenced an investigation with respect to the
alleged offence of obstructing justice, contrary to s. 139 of the
Criminal Code.  The twelve jurors as well as four members of the
court staff were interviewed by the police.  No charges were
laid.
[111]     In the course of the investigation, juror #1 revealed
that the incident in the jury room led her to decide that she
would feign agreement with the other jurors until the verdict was
announced in open court at which time she would indicate her
dissent. In order to achieve this, she wrote the note to the
judge. Although the investigation did not require any inquiry
into the nature of the vote, it was almost inevitable that this
would be revealed during the course of questioning the jurors.
The fresh evidence makes it plain that juror #1 was holding out
for a conviction.
[112]     After the Attorney General decided to proceed with a
third trial, which came on before Watt J., an application was
made on behalf of the appellant to stay the proceedings in
relation to the third trial.  Counsel for the appellant
challenged the constitutional validity of the common law jury
secrecy rule and s.649 of the Criminal Code.  He argued that in
support of this challenge, he ought to be permitted to call as
witnesses on the stay application any of the jurors who sat on
the second trial before O'Connell J.
[113]     Watt J. ruled that s.649 and the common law jury
secrecy rule are constitutionally valid and that he would not
receive any of the jurors' evidence.  However, he further  ruled
that the appellant could call evidence from witnesses who were
able to indicate what information had been conveyed to O'Connell
J., at times reasonably proximate to the declaring of the
mistrial.  Watt J. also ordered the Crown to disclose to the
defence the transcripts of police interviews with jurors who
served at the second trial.
[114]     Before this Court, the fresh evidence tendered by the
appellant consists of the transcripts of the audio-taped police
interviews of the jurors, including juror #1. Pan seeks to rely
on the fresh evidence to show that juror #1 so misbehaved during
the course of his second trial that the trial judge should have
discharged her from the jury and permitted the trial to continue
with the remaining eleven jurors. Pan also seeks to rely on this
evidence in support of his contention that the trial judge
improperly terminated the trial at a time when the jury had
reached what Pan contends was &#147;a verdict of acquittal.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[1]       ii)  Henderson&#146;s appeal &#150; C22502</pre>
    <pre>[115]     Henderson seeks to introduce fresh evidence in the form
of  a  letter from one of the jurors at his trial. The letter  is
dated  almost a year after the verdict and is addressed to  Crown
and defence counsel. The juror expresses dissatisfaction with the
verdict  and complains about several matters that went on  during
the  course of the trial and the deliberations. The matters which
occurred  during the course of the trial form part of the  record
and are otherwise reviewable by this court.
[116]     What is more germane to the constitutional application
is the complaint in the letter that one of the jurors was very
biased against defence counsel and kept putting him down. In
particular, the juror in question is reported to have stated to
the other jurors that the defence counsel &#147;only defended people
who are guilty.&#148; Henderson seeks to rely on this evidence as an
additional ground to impeach the verdict. If his appeal is not
otherwise granted, Henderson wants the opportunity to explore
this matter further with the author of the letter and the other
jurors. Hence he brings this constitutional application. If
successful on his application, he seeks permission &#147;to tender
such evidentiary record as is held to be permissible and
appropriate&#148; to found a ground of appeal based on this complaint.</pre>
    <pre>     iii) Sawyer&#146;s and Galbraith&#146;s appeal &#150; C24688 and C24687</pre>
    <pre>[117]      The  appellants Sawyer and Galbraith seek to  rely  on
Sawyer&#146;s   affidavit  setting  out  the  gist  of   a   telephone
conversation  he  had with one of the jurors after  the  verdict.
Sawyer  reports that, two days after the verdict and  before  the
imposition  of  his sentence, one juror called  him  at  home  to
express how terrible she felt over what had happened and how  the
verdict  had been &#147;eating her inside.&#148; During the course  of  the
conversation,  she  disclosed to him  things  that  had  happened
during  the deliberations. The juror alleged that undue  pressure
had  been  exerted  upon  her  in  coming  to  the  verdict.   In
particular, she claimed that she was told by other members of the
jury  that  they would have to be sequestered for at least  three
weeks  before  a hung jury could be declared. The juror  is  also
reported to have stated that many racial slurs were made by  some
jurors  who  were obviously racist and that she did  not  believe
that  was  fair.  Although  it is not  stated  whom  the  alleged
comments  were directed at, it should be noted that the appellant
Galbraith  is  black and Sawyer is white.  Prior  to  sentencing,
defence  counsel  brought  the  juror's  telephone  call  to  the
attention of the trial judge and asked that he conduct an inquiry
into  the matter. The trial judge declined, stating that  he  did
not have the jurisdiction to do so.
[118]     The appellants Galbraith and Sawyer argue that their
convictions should be quashed on the basis of this fresh evidence
showing that a &#147;miscarriage of justice&#148; has occurred.
Alternatively, they seek permission to tender &#147;such further
evidentiary record as may assist the court in determining whether
a miscarriage of justice occurred during the course of the jury
deliberations.&#148;
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.   Constitutionality of the Common Law Exclusionary Rule</pre>
    <pre>     i)   The Rule in the Context of the Trial and Appellate
Process</pre>
    <pre>[119]      The  question raised on these appeals  necessitates  a
consideration of the entire trial and appellate process. The rule
of exclusion which in effect limits the scope of review of a jury
verdict cannot be considered in isolation. It is only when it  is
considered  in the context of other safeguards that its  justness
can be properly assessed.</pre>
    <pre>[120]      The  appellants correctly note that one of  the  basic
tenets  of our legal system is the principle that an accused  may
be  convicted  only on the basis of legally admissible,  relevant
and probative evidence properly adduced before the trier of fact.
This requirement derives from the basic requirement of fairness.
[121]     The appellants are also correct in noting that the
danger of juries making use of impermissible and irrelevant
considerations is well-recognized in our jurisprudence. Indeed,
many of our rules are intended to guard against that eventuality
and ensure that jurors properly discharge their oaths. Crown
counsel lists some of these safeguards in her factum:
     ·    the availability of peremptory challenges which permit some
          screening of prospective jurors;
     ·    the availability of challenges for cause where there is
          demonstrated a realistic potential for partiality;
     ·    the juror&#146;s oath or affirmation which is intended to bind
          the conscience of some who might otherwise be disposed to decide
          matters based on assumptions and preconceptions;
     ·    the judicial exclusion of evidence where the risk that it
          might be misused outweighs its probative force;
     ·    judicial instructions in the charge to the jury;
     ·    ·    the sequestration of jurors during the deliberation
          process;
     ·    the  non-publication of proceedings taking place in the
          absence of the jury;
     ·    the requirement of unanimity; and
     ·    the polling of individual jurors.
</pre>
    <pre>[122]      The  appellants  concede  that  the  rules  respecting
admissibility  of  evidence and the various procedures  governing
the trial go a long way towards ensuring that accused persons are
not  convicted  on  the  basis of improper  considerations.  They
argue, however, that these are preventative measures designed  to
prevent the potential harm before it occurs.  They claim that  it
is  unrealistic to suppose that such preventative  measures  will
always  effectively prevent a jury from making  use  of  improper
considerations.  They also recognize the additional safeguard  of
appellate  review of jury verdicts and concede that,  where  some
irregularity  occurs  during  the jury  deliberations,  the  mere
possibility  of  the  jury having been improperly  influenced  or
having  based its verdict on improper considerations  is  usually
sufficient to warrant a new trial.</pre>
    <pre>     ii)  The Appellants&#146; Argument for Expanded Reviewability</pre>
    <pre>[123]      The appellants argue that the existing safeguards  are
insufficient  to  ensure  that jury verdicts  are  not  based  on
improper  or  extraneous considerations. They take  the  position
that  the  courts&#146;  refusal  to inquire  into  whether  the  jury
actually  did  base its verdict on improper considerations,  even
where that evidence is available and is voluntarily advanced by a
juror,  is unjustified. They submit that the rule of secrecy  can
lead  and  has led to miscarriages of justice. They submit  that,
while the question of whether reviewability of convictions  is  a
principle  of  fundamental  justice  remains  unsettled,  it   is
nonetheless a well-established principle. They quote the words of
Arbour J.A. in R. v. Farinacci (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 at 42:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Reviewability  of convictions for  indictable
          offences  has been an integral  part  of  our
          criminal  law  system  at  least  since   the
          enactment of the Criminal Code 100 years ago.
          Although  a  right of appeal is  said  to  be
          statutory  rather than inherent, in  contrast
          to  review by prerogative writs, the right of
          appeal  against conviction for an  indictable
          offence  has long been part of our  statutory
          law. It is arguable, but it does not fall  to
          be  decided in this case, that the principles
          of fundamental justice in Canada, as they had
          evolved  at the time the Charter was enacted,
          provide an entitlement to some form of review
          of  convictions  resulting  in  imprisonment.
          Review may take one of a number of forms,  as
          it  has  historically; it could be by way  of
          prerogative  writ  or by way  of  appeal.  It
          could  have threshold leave requirements  and
          its scope could range from the limited review
          of   jurisdictional  errors  to  the  broader
          scrutiny  of  errors  of  law,  or  it  could
          encompass a full review of the facts.
</pre>
    <pre>[124]      Arbour  J.A.  later observed at  p.  48  that  &#147;public
confidence  in  the  administration  of  justice  requires   that
judgments be reviewed and that errors, if any, be corrected.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[1]   [125]      The appellants submit that, in order  to  accord
with  principles  of  fundamental justice, the  evidentiary  rule
should be subject to certain exceptions that would allow for  the
rectification  of  any  miscarriage  of  justice.  The  appellant
Henderson urges the court to adopt an approach similar to that in
the  United  States as set out in the Federal Rules of  Evidence.
The  other appellants adopt this argument but argue that the rule
should  admit even more exceptions, as is necessary to do justice
in individual cases. The relevant American rule reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          s.606(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict  or
          indictment. Upon an inquiry into the validity
          of  a verdict or indictment, a juror may  not
          testify   as  to  any  matter  or   statement
          occurring  during the course  of  the  jury&#146;s
          deliberations  or to the effect  of  anything
          upon  his  or  any  other  juror&#146;s  mind   or
          emotions as influencing him to assent  to  or
          dissent  from  the verdict or  indictment  or
          concerning his mental processes in connection
          therewith, except that a juror may testify on
          the  question whether extraneous  prejudicial
          information  was improperly  brought  to  the
          jury&#146;s   attention  or  whether  any  outside
          influence was brought to bear upon any juror.
          Nor  may  his  affidavit or evidence  of  any
          statement  by  him concerning a matter  about
          which  he  would be precluded from testifying
          be  received  for  these purposes.  [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[126]      In  essence, the Crown does not take  issue  with  the
fundamental  premise  of the appellants&#146;  argument.  Rather,  the
Crown  takes the position that the existing law already  provides
for  the  scope of review sought by the appellant Henderson.  The
Crown,  however, opposes any further intrusions into jury secrecy
along the lines suggested by the other appellants. The Crown also
submits  that the Canadian rule is very similar to that in  other
jurisdictions,   including   the   United   States.   The   Crown
acknowledges,  however, that the rules respecting disclosures  by
jurors  are  different in the United States given the paramountcy
of the free speech guarantee in the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution. In the end analysis, the Crown submits  that
the  existing  common  law rule of exclusion  achieves  a  proper
balance  of  the  competing interests and is in  accordance  with
fundamental justice.</pre>
    <pre>               iii) Nature of the Common Law Rule and the Scope
               of its Application</pre>
    <pre>[127]      In order to consider the respective positions  of  the
parties  on  the issue of the constitutionality of  the  impugned
common  law  exclusionary rule, it is necessary  to  examine  the
nature  of  rule of exclusion, its origin and the  scope  of  its
application.
[128]     As noted, at common law, there exists an exclusionary
rule of evidence that prohibits any inquiry into the
deliberations of a jury. The rule is not a matter of privilege
benefiting individual jurors. Rather, it enures to the benefit of
society at large and is incapable of being waived by an
individual juror.10 As stated earlier, the rule is based on policy
concerns relating to the proper functioning of the jury system.
[129]     The exclusionary rule, sometimes referred to as Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule, is traced back to the 1785 case of Vaise v.
Delaval (1785), 99 E.R. 949 (K.B.). On a motion to set aside a
verdict upon an affidavit of two jurors who swore that the jury,
being divided in their opinion, tossed a coin to arrive at a
verdict, Lord Mansfield ruled that the court could not receive
affidavits from jurors attesting to their own misconduct. He
stated that in every such case, the court must derive the
knowledge from some other source such as from some person having
seen the transaction through a window or by some such other
means.</pre>
    <pre>[130]     It would appear from the very brief ruling in Vaise  v.
Delaval  that  the  decision was based on the  principle  that  a
person  is  incompetent  to  allege his  or  her  own  turpitude.
Although  the  restrictions on self-impeachment have  essentially
disappeared over time, the rule itself has endured since the time
of  Lord Mansfield&#146;s judgment. It is the policy justification for
the  rule  that has evolved.  The rule was explicitly adopted  in
Canada  in  Danis v. Saumure (1956), 3 D.L.R. (2d)  221  (S.C.C.)
where  the  Court  concluded  at p. 223   that  &#147;[s]tatements  or
affidavits  by any member of a jury as to their deliberations  or
intentions  on  the  matter  to be  adjudicated  upon  are  never
receivable.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[131]      The  inviolability  of  jury  deliberations  has  been
recognized  by courts in numerous jurisdictions, including  Great
Britain, Australia, New Zealand and the United States. The courts
have  consistently  refused to examine the internal  workings  of
juries engaged in the deliberative process. An examination of the
jurisprudence shows that this approach is not a product of  blind
adherence  to tradition, but rather, reflects a continued  belief
that the secrecy of jury deliberations is necessary to ensure the
proper and effective operation of the jury trial system.
[132]     As indicated, the policy justification for the rule has
evolved since the time of Lord Mansfield&#146;s ruling in Vaise v.
Delaval. The courts have recognized a number of policy objectives
advanced by the exclusionary rule: it fosters free and frank
debate within the jury room; it ensures the finality of the
verdict; and it protects individual jurors from post-trial
harassment, censure or recrimination.
[133]     A review of the relevant jurisprudence also reveals
that another interest has served to circumscribe the rule within
proper limits. The courts have recognized that society, as well
as the convicted accused, have an interest in seeing that &#147;the
accepted rules and formalities of a fair trial are maintained and
enforced.&#148;11 Hence, the Crown is quite correct in noting that the
rule does not extend to all aspects of juror conduct. Crown
counsel, in her factum, provides a summary of the existing common
law rule as it has generally been applied by Canadian courts:
          </pre>
    <pre>          While   the   Canadian  jury   secrecy   rule
          prohibits inquiry into the proceedings of the
          jury  when  it was absent from the courtroom,
          the  rule  does not extend to all aspects  of
          juror  conduct. The cloak of secrecy  applies
          to   the   thoughts,  statements,   opinions,
          arguments  and  votes of  individual  jurors.
          However,  secrecy does not attach  to  events
          occurring outside of the jury room. Nor  does
          secrecy  attach to communications or contacts
          between jurors and third parties. It  is  the
          internal deliberation process which is sought
          to   be  protected.  Significantly,  Canadian
          courts have been prepared to receive evidence
          which  establishes that the jury was  subject
          to   external  influence,  even  where   that
          evidence  emanates  from a  juror,  and  even
          where   it   falls  short  of   alleging   an
          obstruction of justice. Canadian courts  have
          routinely   considered  evidence   concerning
          discussions between jurors and third parties,
          including police officers, bailiffs,  accused
          persons,  spouses, friends, and  unidentified
          telephone callers. Similarly, the courts have
          considered  evidence establishing that  third
          parties  have intruded upon the  sanctity  of
          the  jury room, as for example, in Mercier,12
          where  the  crown entered the jury  room  and
          erased  something written on the  blackboard.
          Thus, a review of the case law indicates that
          the  Courts have drawn a distinction  between
          those  matters  which  are  internal  to  the
          deliberation  process, and  those  which  are
          either  external to deliberations, or involve
          external  influence  of  jurors.  While   the
          former  is protected, the latter falls within
          a   permissible  zone  of  inquiry.  To  this
          extent,  the effect of the rule is  tempered.
          ...[T]his distinction between &#147;intrinsic&#148; and
          &#147;extrinsic&#148; matters is applied by  courts  in
          other  jurisdictions. The courts are  willing
          to  police  external influence of jurors  for
          the   same  reason  that  they  promote  jury
          secrecy - in order to protect the sanctity of
          the   deliberation  process.   [Emphasis   in
          original.]</pre>
    <pre>[134]      We  agree with the Crown that the case law shows  that
the  rule  of  exclusion is not as unforgiving as the  appellants
contend.  While  the  rule  prohibits  inquiry  into  the  actual
deliberation  process,  courts have often inquired  into  matters
that  are  extrinsic  to the deliberation process.  However,  the
courts  have, on occasion, applied the rule in a more restrictive
fashion. The following brief review of some of the cases  in  the
area will provide examples of how the rule has been applied.
[135]     The case law reveals that, when appropriate, both trial
and appellate courts have received evidence from jurors and other
witnesses to show the following: a juror&#146;s pre-existing bias;
improper influence was exerted on a juror; and improper
communications or prejudicial information were conveyed to the
jury. While we are primarily concerned with appellate review of
these matters, it is important to note, in the context of the
overall process, that these types of inquiries are frequently
made during the course of the trial.
[136]     Section 644(1) of the Criminal Code provides that a
juror may be discharged during the course of a trial where the
trial judge is satisfied that the juror &#147;should not, by reason of
illness or other reasonable cause, continue to act&#148;. Under this
section, courts routinely inquire during the course of a trial
into any number of allegations including improper communications
between a juror and persons not on the jury, prejudicial
information conveyed to a member of the jury, bias or danger of
bias on the part of a juror and juror misconduct interfering with
the deliberation process. These inquiries often include
statements of jurors.  The following case provides an example.
[137]     In R. v. Lessard (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 552 (Que.C.A.),
during the course of the trial of accused persons who were
members of a motorcycle gang, the judge received a note from one
of the jurors indicating that he had been bribed by the Hell's
Angels. The trial judge made further inquiries of the juror. The
evidence received on the inquiry pertained strictly to this
question of outside influence.  Beyond inquiring whether the
juror who had been the subject of outside influence had made that
fact known to the others, no inquiries were made into the thought
processes or discussions in the jury room. The trial judge
decided to discharge the juror and continue the trial with eleven
jurors.</pre>
    <pre>[138]      The Quebec Court of Appeal did not interfere with  the
exercise of this discretion.  In its judgment, the court  reviews
a  number  of  cases where evidence of bribes or  other  improper
influences  have led to the discharge of the juror  or,  in  some
cases,  to  the discharge of the whole jury. Lessard  illustrates
how  incidents of outside influence upon a juror can be  examined
by  a  trial  judge under s.644 of the Criminal Code  during  the
course  of the trial even when the inquiry necessitates receiving
evidence  from  members of the jury. See also:  R.  v.  Hertrich,
Stewart and Skinner (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.); R. v.
Cameron  (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 96 (Ont. C.A.); R.  v.  Taillefer
(1995),  100 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Que. C.A.);  R. v. Martineau  (1986),
33  C.C.C.  (3d) 573 (Que C.A.); R. v. MacKay (1980),  53  C.C.C.
(2d)  366  (B.C.C.A.). Any inquiry under this section should  not
extend  to  the actual deliberation process: see R.  v.  Sophonow
No.2  (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 415 (Man. C.A.) for an example of  a
fact situation where the line may be difficult to draw.
[139]     Turning now to the appellate process, the case law
reveals that while matters intrinsic to the deliberation process
fall outside the scope of appellate review, matters that are
extrinsic to the deliberation process have been reviewed on
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  matters intrinsic to the deliberation process</pre>
    <pre>[140]      The  deliberation  process includes  statements  made,
opinions expressed, arguments advanced, or votes cast by  members
of  a  jury  in  the course of their deliberations in  any  legal
proceedings.13 It is this core that is sought to be protected  by
the rule of exclusion.</pre>
    <pre>[141]      Courts  have consistently refused to receive  evidence
from  jurors on what evidence or motivation formed the basis  for
their  verdict14 or on their understanding of the evidence or  of
the  law.15  It is of course well established that, although  the
jurors must agree upon their verdict there is no requirement that
they arrive at a verdict on the basis of the same evidence.16 This
principle  is  not  in  dispute. The  appellants  are  concerned,
rather,  with  the  possibility that  the  verdict  is  based  on
improper considerations. It is of course quite conceivable that a
juror may draw an unwarranted or even an improper inference  from
the  evidence or that he or she may not understand or misapply  a
principle  of law.  Further, it is possible that a juror  may  be
influenced to vote in a particular manner by factors internal  to
the  deliberation  process  that have  nothing  to  do  with  the
evidence and should have no bearing on the vote.
[142]     However, the strength of the verdict lies not in the
assessment of the evidence by each individual juror or in each
juror&#146;s vote, but rather, in its unanimity.17  It is difficult to
see what would be gained by an inquiry into the process. Indeed,
the manifestation of differences of individual opinions amongst
jurors would only serve to undermine the confidence of the public
in the jury verdict.</pre>
    <pre>[143]     The fact that courts do not inquire from the jurors  as
to  what  formed  the basis of their verdict  does  not  put  the
verdict  beyond review. The evidentiary basis for a jury  verdict
is routinely reviewed on appeal. Whenever a question arises as to
the  effect that an item of evidence or its absence may have  had
on  a  jury,  a  court  can consider the  matter  without  making
inquiries  of  the jurors. The following case provides  a  useful
example on this point.
[144]     In R. v. Chionye (1989), 89 Cr. App.R. 285 (Eng. C.A.),
the jury returned a verdict of guilty on a charge of importation
of a drug. After the jurors delivered their verdict and while
they were still in the courtroom, counsel for the prosecution
sought an order confiscating the money which had been found upon
the accused at the time of his arrest. The trial was adjourned to
deal with this question and with sentencing.</pre>
    <pre>[145]      After  the  court adjourned, one member  of  the  jury
approached  one  of the court constables and indicated  that  the
jury  had been unaware that the accused had money on him when  he
was  arrested. In the circumstances of the arrest, the fact  that
the  accused would have no money on him adversely impacted on the
theory  of  the  defence. The juror further  indicated  that  the
jury&#146;s belief that the accused had no money on him had influenced
the  verdict.  This matter was reported to the  trial  judge  who
inquired  into  the  matter and then proceeded  to  sentence  the
appellant.
[146]     On appeal, both counsel acknowledged that the evidence
showing that the appellant had money on him at the time of his
arrest, although not introduced at trial, was admissible,
relevant and possibly significant. At issue was whether the
appeal court would receive evidence from the foreman of the jury
on this matter. The court held that the disclosures by the
foreman on behalf of the jury should play no part in the decision
of the court. Rather, the evidence of the money found on the
accused was accepted as fresh evidence and a new trial was
ordered on this basis.
[147]     In our view, nothing could have been gained by opening
an inquiry into the jury deliberations in Chionye. Even if all
jurors were examined at length on the matter, there is no
assurance that this process would provide any assistance to the
court. The absence of the evidence in question is not likely to
have had the same effect on any one juror. To permit such an
inquiry could subject jurors to unwarranted intrusions in their
private lives well beyond the call of jury duty. There would be
no end to the proceedings if every juror could be examined on his
or her understanding of the evidence and of the law and it is not
clear what more could be elucidated from the process.  Again, the
strength of the verdict is in its unanimity. The weaknesses of
any individual juror are likely to be offset by the strengths of
another.</pre>
    <pre>[1]   [148]      It  is  also questionable how reliable  a  post-
verdict  reconstruction of a jury&#146;s understanding of the evidence
and  the  law  would be. Memories are likely to fade.  Individual
jurors  could be subject to pressure from litigants who  want  to
influence  the process. Further, some jurors, for any  number  of
reasons,   may  want  to  revisit  their  decision   and   hence,
unwittingly or not, could tailor their recollection accordingly.
[149]     For much the same reasons, courts have also
consistently refused to hear post-verdict evidence of
dissatisfaction or disagreement with a verdict where the verdict
has been announced in open court with no indication of dissent by
any of the individual jurors.18</pre>
    <pre>      (b)   matters  extrinsic  to the deliberation  process[150]
Appellate courts have received evidence from jurors in  order  to
determine  whether a juror was biased against the accused  before
the trial even commenced. In R. v. Box (1963), 47 Cr. App. R. 284
(C.A.), the appellant presented evidence on the state of mind  of
the  foreman of the jury at the time he was sworn as a  juror  in
the  form of affidavits from two persons to whom the foreman  had
made  statements.  The English Court of Appeal  decided  to  hear
evidence from the foreman himself and concluded that he  had  not
come  to  a  determination  about the  case  before  hearing  the
evidence.  The  court noted that counsel had quite  properly  not
sought to adduce evidence as to what happened in the jury room.
[151]     An inquiry was made of the jurors in R. v. Putnam,
Lyons and Taylor (1991), 93 Cr. App. R. 281 (C.A.) on appeal from
an acquittal where it was alleged that some of the jurors had
been offered a bribe to sway the jury into bringing a verdict of
not guilty.</pre>
    <pre>[1]   [152]     Appellate courts have also received evidence from
a  juror  to  determine  whether the juror  possessed  extraneous
prejudicial information about the appellant at the time he served
on  the jury. In R. v. Hood (1968), 52 Cr. App.R. 265 (C.A.), the
trial  judge  was  informed  that one  of  the  jurors  knew  the
appellant&#146;s wife and that this gave rise to the possibility  that
the juror was aware of the appellant&#146;s criminal record. The trial
judge  refused to discharge the juror on that basis.  On  appeal,
the  court received affidavit evidence from the juror in question
on  this  issue noting, however, that the affidavit of the  juror
was &#147;not dealing with what took place in the jury room or dealing
with  the  manner in which the jury arrived at the conclusion  at
which they did. He is dealing entirely with extrinsic matters.&#148; 19
[153]     Evidence has also been received on appeal from jurors
to show misconduct on the part of a court officer. The case of R.
v. Mercier, supra is one example. In Mercier, the Quebec Court of
Appeal allowed the appeal against conviction on the basis of
fresh evidence showing that the Crown attorney entered the jury
room and, in the absence of the jury, had erased certain writings
which the foreman of the jury had written on the blackboard. The
fresh evidence was in the form of an affidavit from a juror who
attested to that fact. The court received this evidence. Other
parts of the affidavit, relating to certain conversations between
jurors and stating what effect the erasure of the words had had
on the vote, were not considered by the court. This case
illustrates how matters extrinsic to the deliberation process can
be received for the purpose of verdict impeachment without doing
any violence to jury secrecy.
[154]     The case law also shows that appellate courts have
regularly received evidence on any irregularities occurring
during the deliberation process. For example, in R. v. Ryan
(1951), Crim. Rep. Vol. 13, p. 363 (B.C.C.A.), the court ordered
a new trial where the jurors, accompanied by the sheriff, went to
the movies during an adjournment. The jurors mingled with the
crowd and, as well, many of the jurors telephoned their homes or
businesses. As part of the evidence on appeal, the court received
affidavits by the jurors themselves on this issue.
[155]     In R. v. Nash (1949), 94 C.C.C. 288 (N.B.C.A.), it was
discovered after the verdict that the jury, in the course of its
deliberations, had gone to the theatre and had mingled with the
crowd. The Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered a
new trial on that basis. The evidence before the court came from
persons who were not members of the jury but there is no reason
why the evidence on this issue could not have come from the
jurors themselves.
[156]     In R. v. Gilson (1965), 4 C.C.C. 61 (Ont. C.A.), it was
discovered after the jury returned a verdict of guilty that the
sheriff had entered the jury room during its deliberations
without the authorization or knowledge of the trial judge or
counsel and had purported to advise the jurors with respect to a
question raised by them concerning the validity of a certain
search warrant. The matter was reviewed on appeal and was found
not to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The decision,
however, does not indicate how the information was brought before
the court. Again, we see no reason why this evidence could not
come from the jurors themselves. The jurors could attest to the
information they received from the sheriff without divulging
matters intrinsic to the deliberation process.</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  an overly restrictive approach</pre>
    <pre>[157]      In some cases, it is our view that courts have adopted
too  restrictive an approach to the common law rule of exclusion.
For example, in R. v. Thompson (1961), 46 Cr. App. R. 72 (C.C.A.)
the  appellate  court refused to receive evidence that  the  jury
possessed  prejudicial, extraneous information.  Defence  counsel
received  information from one juror that a number of jurors  had
been  in  favour  of acquittal, however, in the course  of  their
deliberations,  the  foreman produced a  list  of  the  accused&#146;s
previous convictions and thereby influenced the jury to return  a
guilty  verdict. The English Court of Appeal was asked to inquire
into the matter and to adjourn the appeal in order to see whether
the  alleged  statement by the juror could be supported  by  some
statement  or  affidavit  by  him. The  adjournment  was  refused
because  the court was satisfied that it had no right to  inquire
as  to  what had occurred in the jury room.  The  court purported
to  follow  the  general  rule &#147;that the  court  does  not  admit
evidence  of  a juryman as to what took place in the  jury  room,
either  by  way  of  explanation of the grounds  upon  which  the
verdict  was given, or by way of statement as to what he believed
its  effect  to  be.&#148; Some of the rationales for  the  rule  were
reviewed, namely the securing of the finality of the verdict  and
the  protection  of  the jurors from pressure  to  explain  their
verdict.  The  court  quoted the following  passage  from  R.  v.
Armstrong (1922), 16 Cr. App.R. 149 at 159:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If  one  juryman might communicate  with  the
          public upon the evidence and the verdict,  so
          might  his colleagues also; and if  they  all
          took  this  dangerous course, differences  of
          individual  opinion might  be  made  manifest
          which,  at  the  least,  could  not  fail  to
          diminish  the  confidence  that  the   public
          rightly  has  in  the  general  propriety  of
          criminal verdicts.
</pre>
    <pre>[158]      In  our  view,  it  is unnecessary  to  adopt  such  a
restrictive  approach  to advance the stated  objectives  of  the
exclusionary rule. While any evidence on the jury&#146;s intended vote
would be inadmissible, we do not regard the rule as precluding an
inquiry  into the simple question of whether or not the jury  had
received   outside  information  about  the  accused&#146;s   previous
convictions.  The  inquiry need not, and indeed  should  not,  go
further. If the appeal court receives confirmation of that  fact,
it  is  then  open  to the court to consider its  effect  on  the
verdict  without inquiring into the deliberation process.  Little
would be gained by inquiring of the individual jurors what effect
the  prejudicial information may have had on their  vote  because
the  information may not have had the same effect on all of them.
The  ultimate issue for the court is really no different than  in
the  many cases where inadmissible evidence is heard by the  jury
during  the course of the trial. In those cases, appellate courts
are  routinely  asked  to  consider the possible  effect  of  the
inadmissible evidence upon the verdict.
[159]      Similarly, in R. v. Wilson (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 568
(Man. C.A.) the court refused to consider evidence that one of
the jurors had received information from a police officer about
the appellant&#146;s co-conspirator and that this information had been
repeated in the jury room. While the evidence may have been
otherwise inadmissible in the form in which it was presented, the
court refused to consider it on the basis that it formed part of
the deliberations. Again here, we see no reason why evidence on
the question of whether or not outside information about the co-
conspirator was conveyed to the jury should be deemed
inadmissible.
[160]     A conservative approach was also taken in R. v. Barnes
(1907), 13 C.C.C. 301 (N.S.C.A.) where the court queried whether
evidence from jurors would be admissible to show misconduct on
the part of the sheriff. In Barnes, affidavits from two jurors
were sought to be introduced on appeal to prove the incident in
question. An affidavit from the sheriff contradicted this
evidence. A majority of the court did not find it necessary to
consider the affidavits of the jurors in order to determine the
appeal but queried whether such affidavits could be admitted in
any event. Two dissenting justices ruled that the affidavits were
admissible since they related to matters outside the deliberation
process. Russell J. noted at p. 311 that he was &#147;not aware of any
English or Canadian case in which it has been decided that a
juror&#146;s affidavit cannot be read for the purpose of shewing the
misconduct of an officer of the Court...&#148;20.
[161]     It is our view that the approach adopted by the
dissenting justices in Barnes is more consistent with the rule
and its underlying policy justifications.</pre>
    <pre>[1]       iv)  Circumscribing the Application of the Common Law
          Rule According  to its Underlying Policy Considerations</pre>
    <pre>[162]      In  order  to properly circumscribe the  principle  of
exclusion,  it  is  important to keep the  policy  considerations
behind  it  firmly  in mind. Several policy  concerns  have  been
identified  by  the  courts over time.  In  our  view,  they  are
essentially subsumed in the following:
     ·    secrecy fosters free and frank debate among the jurors;
     ·    secrecy ensures finality of the verdict;
     ·    secrecy protects jurors from post-trial harassment, censure
          or recrimination.
</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  secrecy fosters free and frank debate among the jurors</pre>
    <pre>[163]      First,  there is the consideration that unanimity  can
usually  be  achieved  only  as a result  of  a  free  and  frank
discussion  among  the  jurors while  serving  on  the  jury  and
particularly  during  the course of their  deliberations.  It  is
clearly  in the interest of both the community at large  and  the
accused that unanimity be achieved whenever possible.
[164]      It is also important that verdicts be based on the
frank views of jurors and their independent thoughts rather than
on concerns about how their views and thoughts will reflect upon
them as individuals in the community. As stated by Cardozo J.,
this &#147;freedom of debate might be stifled and independence of
thought checked if jurors were made to feel that their arguments
and ballots were to be freely published to the world.&#148;21
[165]     Freedom of debate in the jury room is just as necessary
to ensure fairness to the accused as it is to the community. As
stated by Lord Justice Bedlman, writing for the English Queen&#146;s
Bench Division in A. G. v. Associated Newspapers Ltd:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If   a   juror  were  to  be  deterred   from
          expressing  his doubt of the accused&#146;s  guilt
          because he feared subsequent recrimination or
          ridicule, the accused might be deprived of  a
          persuasive voice in his favour.22
</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  secrecy ensures finality of the verdict</pre>
    <pre>[166]      The principle at play here is not fuelled by a  desire
to hide the frailties of the system. Rather, it is inspired by  a
recognition  of the solemnity of the verdict, its true  value  as
the  product  of  a dynamic process involving a  collectivity  of
individuals  and its importance in the overall administration  of
justice.
[167]     The solemnity of the verdict is well expressed by the
Supreme Court of Victoria in Australia in these terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>          There  is secondly, the social policy whereby
          the  verdict of the jury, as stated  in  open
          court  by the foreman in the presence of  all
          the  other  jurors, they not  expressing  any
          dissent  therefrom, and as  recorded  by  the
          associate after express inquiry of  the  jury
          as  &#147;the verdict of them all&#148;, is treated  as
          the  outward, formal and exclusive expression
          and  repository of their agreement, and which
          holds each of them thereafter to the act (the
          verdict)  in  which he has thus solemnly  and
          formally joined.23
</pre>
    <pre>[168]      If verdicts were liable to be set aside by the  simple
expression  of  dissatisfaction  or  disagreement  by  individual
jurors  subsequent to its delivery, there is a risk  that  juries
may  not  approach their task with the seriousness and  solemnity
that  the occasion requires. The consequences flowing from a jury
verdict are very important to all persons involved. It is crucial
that,  when formally announced, it represents the final  word  on
the matter.
[169]     As stated earlier, the strength and authority of a
verdict in the eyes of the public rests upon the fact that twelve
members of the community have reached a consensus. The verdict is
the product of a dynamic process that would likely self-destruct
if any attempt were made to break it into its component parts.
[170]     As also noted earlier, individual jurors can arrive at
their decision by different routes and for different reasons. But
at the time the verdict is announced, they speak with one voice.
The manifestation of individual differences of opinion could only
undermine the value of the verdict in the eyes of the public.</pre>
    <pre>[1]   [171]      Further, since the verdict is the product  of  a
dynamic   process,  it  would  be  impossible   to   assess   the
significance to be attached to individual events occurring during
the deliberation process if these events were to be reported. For
example, as is alleged by the appellants Galbraith and Sawyer,  a
juror  may  disclose that certain racist comments  were  made  by
another  member  of  the  jury. When viewed  in  isolation,  such
disclosure suggests that there is cause for concern. However,  as
noted  by  Crown  counsel  in  her factum,  it  would  be  highly
artificial,  and  indeed misleading, to  view  such  comments  in
isolation. Any such incident represents a single moment  in  what
is  often  a lengthy and discursive dialogue, involving the  free
exchange of thoughts and ideas. When an improper comment is  made
by a juror, we must not thereby conclude that the jury, including
the juror who made the comment, acted upon it. It can be expected
that  the impropriety will be identified by the other members  of
the  jury. The checks and balances that occur when twelve persons
reach  a  consensus are an inherent feature of the jury  dynamic.
Doherty J.A., in R. v. Parks (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 324, noted  the
&#147;diffused  impartiality&#148;  which is produced  by  the  melding  of
twelve diverse and individual perspectives into a single decision
making  body.  Finally,  the deliberation process  is  inherently
fluid.  A  juror may express an opinion at one point in time  and
ultimately reject that opinion by the time a verdict is reached.
[172]     The verdict would be fragile indeed if the consensus
were not crystallized in time but could be revisited by the
individual juror who, for whatever reason, had second thoughts on
the matter. Even if such revisiting were allowed, there are
several reasons why juror disclosures about the deliberation
process may not provide a reliable or proper basis to set aside a
verdict duly recorded and assented to in open court.  The
reliability of juror accounts about the deliberation may be
tainted by emotion, personality clashes with other jurors,
subsequent regret over the verdict or any number of human
responses.
[173]     Finally, the jury is a very important institution in
the administration of justice. If we are to maintain the jury as
a judicial decision making body, we must trust that jurors can
perform the task assigned to them, respect their decision and
treat it with the finality that it deserves. Many of the
arguments advanced by the appellants resound as an attack on the
jury system itself. Such an attack is not new. The Law Reform
Commission of Canada in its Working Paper on The Jury in Criminal
Trials (1980) noted at p.1 that lawyers, judges, scholars and
others have debated the merits of the jury &#147;for centuries&#148;. But
the merits of the jury system cannot be brought in issue before
this court. The words of Dickson C.J.C. in R. v. Corbett (1988),
41 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 401 are instructive on this point:
          </pre>
    <pre>          [1]       It is of course, entirely possible to construct an
          argument disputing the theory of trial by jury. Juries are
          capable of egregious mistakes and they may at times seem to be
          ill-adapted to the exigencies of an increasingly complicated and
          refined criminal law. But until the paradigm is altered by
          Parliament, the court should not be heard to call into question
          the capacity of juries to do the job assigned to them. The
          ramifications of any such statement could be enormous. Moreover,
          the fundamental right to a jury trial has recently been
          underscored by s.11(f) of the Charter. If that right is so
          important, it is logically incoherent to hold that juries are
          incapable of following the explicit instructions of a judge.
          [Emphasis in original.]
</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  secrecy protects individual jurors from post-trial
          harassment, censure or recrimination</pre>
    <pre>[174]      The  inviolability  of jurors,  in  our  view,  is  an
essential   requisite   to   secure  a   free   and   independent
administration of justice. Jurors are conscripted  to  perform  a
very  important  function  in  the democratic  administration  of
justice.  Once  they have performed their duty,  they  should  be
allowed  to  return  to anonymity in their  community  free  from
unwarranted intrusions in their private lives.
[175]     It is reasonable to expect that, if secrecy of the
deliberations is maintained, individual jurors will be protected
from harassment from the public, the media or the litigants since
the incentive to pursue jurors will be removed. Any information
that the jurors could provide about their deliberations will not
serve any useful purpose.</pre>
    <pre>[1]  [176]     Similarly, if the views and thoughts of particular
jurors  are  not  made  public,  they  are  less  vulnerable   as
individuals to censure by disapproving factions of the community.
They are also less likely to suffer recrimination at the hands of
disgruntled litigants and their supporters.</pre>
    <pre>     v)   Analytical approach to s. 7 of the Charter</pre>
    <pre>[177]     Turning now to the constitutional analysis, it is first
noted  that  the debate over the constitutionality of the  common
law  rule  of exclusion falls entirely under s.7 of the  Charter.
Although  the appellants also rely on ss.11(d) and 11(f)  of  the
Charter,  they concede that these latter provisions are  entirely
subsumed  under s.7 for the purpose of these appeals.   We  agree
with this concession. In the circumstances of this case, it would
serve  no analytical purpose to isolate the appellants&#146; arguments
as being best dealt with under one section rather than the other.
A finding that either s.11(d) or s.11(f) has been infringed would
entail a finding that s.7 has been infringed as well.
[178]     For the sake of convenience, s.7 is again reproduced:
          </pre>
    <pre>          s.7   Everyone has the right to life, liberty
          and  security of the person and the right not
          to  be  deprived thereof except in accordance
          with the principles of fundamental justice.</pre>
    <pre>[179]      The  appellants take the position  that  the  rule  of
exclusion  infringes  an  accused&#146;s s.7  rights  because  it  may
prevent  an  accused from obtaining a remedy  in  cases  where  a
conviction  is  based  on improper or extraneous  considerations.
There  is  no  issue in this case that the appellants&#146;  right  to
liberty  is  engaged.  There can be  no  doubt  that  a  criminal
conviction  can  result in a deprivation of  liberty  within  the
meaning  of  s.  7.  The  real debate is  whether  the  resulting
deprivation  is in accordance with the principles of  fundamental
justice. The question is therefore: does a rule of evidence  that
precludes  an  inquiry into the deliberations of the  jury  as  a
basis  for  reviewability of the verdict accord with  fundamental
justice?
[180]     From this question stems the issue of what is the
appropriate analytical approach to s. 7. Are individual rights to
be balanced with competing societal interests under the s.7
analysis or are societal considerations best addressed under s.1
of the Charter in the event that a breach is found?
[181]     The appellants concede that a consideration of the
principles of fundamental justice under s.7 may involve some
balancing of competing interests in certain cases where the
rights of other parties are directly at stake. This would be the
case, for example, where a complainant&#146;s right to privacy is in
issue.24 The appellants argue, however, that any justification for
the rule based on societal interests must be demonstrated by the
respondent under s.1 of the Charter.
[182]     The Crown submits that the balancing of interests must
generally be made under s.7 because principles of fundamental
justice reflect not only the interests of the accused and of
other individuals but also those of society. In this case, it is
submitted that the common law jury secrecy rule enures not only
to the benefit of society but also to the accused and that this
factor provides an additional basis for balancing individual and
societal interests under s.7. It is argued further that jury
secrecy is itself a principle of fundamental justice and that,
consequently, the consideration of the relevant principles of
justice in this case necessarily entails a balancing of both
individual and societal interests. Crown counsel takes the
position that the common law rule of exclusion strikes an
appropriate balance between the competing interests and hence
accords with the principles of fundamental justice.
[183]     The Supreme Court of Canada has taken different
approaches to the issue of whether the balancing of societal
interests with individual rights, guaranteed by s. 7, should take
place within that section or under s. 1 of the Charter. One
commentator summarizes the Supreme Court's approach in these
words:25
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  cases where the Court has considered the
          principles of fundamental justice testify  to
          the  development of two competing  approaches
          to  the treatment of societal interests.  The
          first,  typified by the judgment of Lamer  J.
          in Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act26 and reaffirmed
          in  later  cases such as Swain,27 would  only
          consider societal interests under section  1,
          while  the  second, typified by the reasoning
          of  La  Forest J. in cases such  as  Lyons,28
          Beare,29 and Thompson Newspapers,30  that  of
          L&#146;Heureux-Dube J. in Thompson Newspapers  and
          by Sopinka J. in Rodriguez,31 would factor in
          these  interests in the determination of  the
          principles  of  fundamental justice.  Indeed,
          cases  such as Thomson Newspapers, Swain  and
          Rodriquez   demonstrate  the  lack   of   any
          conceptually  coherent  approach,  with  some
          justices  agreeing  with  the  inclusion   of
          societal  interests in the  determination  of
          the  principles of fundamental justice in one
          case and insisting on a section 1 analysis in
          the other.
</pre>
    <pre>[184]     While it is difficult to reconcile the cases if one  is
seeking  to  uncover a definite approach to the question  whether
societal  interests are to be considered in defining  the  rights
protected by s. 7, it is our view that the controversy is not  so
blatant  when  one  considers the issues in  context.  The  cases
reveal  that  the determination of the principles of  fundamental
justice  in  any given case depend on the following factors:  the
nature  of  the  right or rights at issue; the character  of  the
violation;  the  competing principles at play, if  any;  and  the
nature of these competing interests.
[185]      In most cases, the s.7 analysis has encompassed a
consideration of those societal concerns that are engaged in the
matter before the court. La Forest J. in Godbout v. Longueuil
(City), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 844 at 898 and 900, in writing on behalf
of the three justices who dealt with s.7, reviews the relevant
jurisprudence and states as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  cases  since Re B.C. Motor  Vehicle  Act
          have  made clear that, particularly in  light
          of the possibility of substantive review, the
          meaning of fundamental justice must depend in
          a  given  case on both the nature of the  s.7
          right  asserted  and  the  character  of  the
          alleged  violation; see Pearlman v.  Manitoba
          Law  Society  Judicial  Committee,  [1991]  2
          S.C.R.   869,   at  p.884.  In  taking   this
          contextual  approach, this  Court  has  often
          considered  it  appropriate  to  elucidate  a
          specific   principle  or  set  of  principles
          governing the particular matter before  it...
          .But  just  as  this  Court  has  relied   on
          specific principles or policies to guide  its
          analysis  in  particular cases, it  has  also
          acknowledged that looking to &#147;the  principles
          of  fundamental justice&#148; often  involves  the
          more  general  endeavour  of  balancing   the
          constitutional   right  of   the   individual
          claimant against the countervailing interests
          of   the  state.  In  other  words,  deciding
          whether the principles of fundamental justice
          have been respected in a particular case  has
          been  understood not only as  requiring  that
          the  infringement at issue  be  evaluated  in
          light  of  a specific principle pertinent  to
          the  case,  but also as permitting a  broader
          inquiry  into  whether  the  right  to  life,
          liberty or security of the person asserted by
          the  individual  can, in  the  circumstances,
          justifiably  be violated given the  interests
          or  purposes sought to be advanced  in  doing
          so.  To  my  mind, performing this  balancing
          test  in  considering the fundamental justice
          aspect of s.7 is both eminently sensible  and
          perfectly consistent with the aim and  import
          of  that  provision, since  the  notion  that
          individual rights may, in some circumstances,
          be subordinated to substantial and compelling
          collective interests is itself a basic  tenet
          of our legal system lying at or very near the
          core  of  our  most  deeply rooted  juridical
          convictions. We need look no further than the
          Charter  itself  to  be  satisfied  of  this.
          Expressed in the language of s.7, the  notion
          of   balancing   individual  rights   against
          collective interests itself reflects what may
          rightfully   be   termed  a   &#147;principle   of
          fundamental justice&#148; which, if respected, can
          serve as the basis for justifying the state&#146;s
          infringement   of  an  otherwise   sacrosanct
          constitutional right.</pre>
    <pre>[186]      La Forest J. then reviews a number of cases where  the
Court considered s.7 and concludes as follows at p. 901:
          </pre>
    <pre>          From  the  foregoing discussion, it is  clear
          that  deciding whether the infringement of  a
          s.7  right  is  fundamentally  just  may,  in
          certain  cases,  require that  the  right  at
          issue   be   weighed  against  the  interests
          pursued   by   the  state  in  causing   that
          infringement.</pre>
    <pre>[187]      The  question in this case is whether the  appellants&#146;
deprivation  of liberty, as a consequence of a jury  verdict,  is
fundamentally  just  under  the  existing  common  law  rule   of
reviewability of jury deliberations.
[188]     In our view, the rule of exclusion that precludes any
inquiry into the deliberation process continues to be supported
by sound and weighty policy considerations that enure not only to
the benefit of society but also to the benefit of the accused.
Any extension of the cloak of secrecy beyond the deliberation
process itself, however, does not advance the  policies sought to
be served and, in certain instances, can even serve to defeat
them. It is therefore important to limit the principle of
exclusion to evidence relating to matters internal to the
deliberation process.</pre>
    <pre>[189]       The   deliberation  process  includes  the  thoughts,
statements, opinions, arguments and votes of individual jurors in
relation  to  their decision making as a jury. In our  view,  the
determination  of  what  forms part of the  deliberation  process
should rest on the social policy sought to be served by the  rule
of  exclusion  and  not  on the accident of physical  location.32
Hence, we do not agree that the line should be arbitrarily  drawn
at  the jury room door. Secrecy should extend to all matters that
form part of the deliberation process whether they happen in  the
jury  room,  in the courtroom or at the hotel where the  jury  is
lodged.  Similarly, the deliberation process, for the purpose  of
this  rule, is not necessarily restricted to the actual time  the
jury  is  deliberating at the end of the case. Depending  on  the
circumstances, the same policy considerations can apply  to  many
matters taking place during the course of the trial.</pre>
    <pre>[190]     It stands to reason that the deliberation process  must
be  afforded  the  same  protection  when  information  about  it
emanates  from a source outside the jury. The objectives advanced
by  the rule would be entirely defeated if evidence from a person
overhearing  matters  inherent to the deliberation  process  were
admissible.33  The  matter would be otherwise if  the  intruder&#146;s
evidence   pertained  to  questions  of  outside   influence   or
prejudicial  extraneous  information received  by  the  jury.  As
exemplified  by the cases reviewed earlier, the rule  does  allow
for  inquiries into allegations of external influence on the jury
or contamination by extraneous prejudicial information.
[191]     In our view, the common law rule of exclusion so
defined entirely accords with principles of fundamental justice.
The appellants have not persuaded us that their s.7 rights are in
any way violated by the rule.
[192]     For these reasons, we would answer the first two
questions as follows:
1.   Does  the  common  law  exclusionary  rule  precluding   the
     admission  of  evidence  on the deliberations  of  the  jury
     infringe  an accused&#146;s rights under ss.7, 11(d) or 11(f)  of
     the Charter?
     No.
2.   If  the  answer to question 1 is yes, how should the  common
     law be modified to reflect constitutional standards?
     This question does not need to be answered.
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   Constitutionality of s. 649 of the Criminal Code</pre>
    <pre>[193]      The  remaining two questions pertain to s.649  of  the
Criminal Code:
[194]     As stated earlier, it is our view that these appeals
give rise to the following questions with respect to s.649:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  3.    To  the  extent that the evidence would be  admissible
     under the common law rule, as it presently stands or as modified,
     does s.649 of the Criminal Code impede an accused&#146;s access to
     such evidence from jurors?</pre>
    <pre>4.   If  the  answer to question 3 is yes, to what extent  should
     s.649  be  declared unconstitutional and  of  no  force  and
     effect   to   ensure   the  maintenance  of   constitutional
     standards?</pre>
    <pre>[195]     It is important to note that these appeals do not  give
rise   to  any  consideration  of  the  question  whether   s.649
constitutes  a  violation of a juror&#146;s freedom of  expression  as
guaranteed under s.2(b) of the Charter. This question would  give
rise  to  considerations  that are  beyond  the  scope  of  these
appeals.
[196]     It is useful to reproduce s.649 again:
          </pre>
    <pre>          649.  Every member of a jury who, except  for
          the  purposes  of  an  investigation  of   an
          alleged   offence  under  subsection   139(2)
          [obstructing justice] in relation to a juror,
          or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  giving  evidence in criminal proceedings
          in relation to such an offence,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b) discloses any information relating to the
          proceedings  of the jury when it  was  absent
          from  the courtroom that was not subsequently
          disclosed  in  open court  is  guilty  of  an
          offence punishable on summary conviction.
</pre>
    <pre>[197]      The  exceptions  provided to the  prohibition  against
juror disclosures relate to the offence of obstructing justice as
defined  under  s.  139(2).  It therefore  becomes  necessary  to
consider  s.  139  in  order  to  appreciate  the  scope  of  the
exception. It reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          139. (1)  Every one who wilfully attempts  in
          any manner to obstruct, pervert or defeat the
          course of justice in a judicial proceeding,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  by indemnifying or agreeing to indemnify
               a surety, in any way and either in whole
               or in part, or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  where  he  is a surety, by accepting  or
               agreeing to accept a fee or any form  of
               indemnity  whether in whole or  in  part
               from  or in respect of a person  who  is
               released  or  is  to  be  released  from
               custody,
          </pre>
    <pre>          is guilty of
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  an  indictable offence and is liable  to
               imprisonment  for a term  not  exceeding
               two years, or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)  an   offence   punishable   on   summary
               conviction.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)   Every one who wilfully attempts in  any
          manner  other  than  a  manner  described  in
          subsection (1) to obstruct, pervert or defeat
          the  course  of  justice  is  guilty  of   an
          indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
          for a term not exceeding ten years.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (3)   Without  restricting the generality  of
          subsection  (2),  every one shall  be  deemed
          wilfully  to attempt to obstruct, pervert  or
          defeat  the  course  of  justice  who  in   a
          judicial proceeding, existing or proposed,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  dissuades  or  attempts  to  dissuade  a
               person  by  threats,  bribes  or   other
               corrupt means from giving evidence;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  influences  or attempts to influence  by
               threats, bribes or other corrupt means a
               person in his conduct as a juror; or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  accepts or obtains, agrees to accept  or
               attempts  to  obtain a  bribe  or  other
               corrupt  consideration to  abstain  from
               giving  evidence, or to do or to refrain
               from doing anything as a juror.
</pre>
    <pre>[198]      As noted earlier, s.649 of the Criminal Code does  not
in  any way determine the admissibility of juror disclosures  for
the  purpose  of  verdict impeachment. That issue is  determined,
rather,  according  to the principles set out  earlier.  The  key
factor  will  be  whether  the  disclosure  forms  part  of   the
deliberation  process. It is logical to expect  that  disclosures
pertaining  to an allegation of obstructing justice will  usually
fall outside the scope of the deliberation process. However, that
will not necessarily always be the case. Matters disclosed during
the  course  of the investigation or prosecution of  the  alleged
offence  may  well form part of the deliberation process  and  as
such,  would  not  be  admissible  for  the  purpose  of  verdict
impeachment.
[199]     In any event, the appellants are not concerned on these
appeals with matters that can be disclosed by jurors but, rather,
with matters than cannot be disclosed. As discussed earlier, it
is the extent to which s.649 may prevent the appellants from
gaining access to information that would be admissible for
verdict impeachment purposes that forms the basis of their
constitutional application.
[200]     In our view, it does not necessarily follow that any
impediment to the appellants&#146; access to relevant information for
verdict impeachment purposes would constitute a violation of
their s.7 rights. Much would depend on the particular
circumstances of the case. However, for the purpose of these
appeals, the constitutionality of s.649 can be circumscribed by
reference to the same principles discussed in relation to the
common law rule of exclusion. Hence, as stated earlier, if the
prohibition against juror disclosures under s.649 extends only to
matters intrinsic to the deliberation process, the appellants&#146;
application cannot succeed. The appellants could not present
information of this nature as evidence for verdict impeachment
purposes in any event, and thus, it could not be said that their
rights are violated by s.649.
[201]     The s.649 prohibition (subject to the exceptions, of
course) extends to &#147;information relating to the proceedings of
the jury when it was absent from the courtroom that was not
subsequently disclosed in open court.&#148; The operative words here
are &#147;proceedings of the jury.&#148; These words are not defined in the
Criminal Code.
[202]     If s.649 is grounded upon the same policy
considerations as discussed earlier (and these appeals were
argued on that basis), we see no compelling reason why the words
&#147;proceedings of the jury&#148; cannot be equated with the deliberation
process as we have defined it. What else can properly be said to
form part of the proceedings of the jury other than the thoughts,
statements, opinions, arguments and votes of individual jurors in
relation to their decision making as a jury? What else is so
worthy of protection as to deserve a criminal sanction for its
breach?
[203]     It is our understanding that trial judges routinely
instruct jurors on their duty to maintain the secrecy of their
deliberations. The jurors are informed that the law makes it a
criminal offence to disclose any information relating to the
proceedings of the jury when it was absent from the courtroom
that was not subsequently disclosed in open court. This practice
is commendable and should be followed in every case.
[204]     It is our view that trial judges should also assist the
jury in further understanding the scope of the prohibition
against disclosure. In order to ensure that the effect of s.649
be kept within permissible constitutional limits, it is important
that jurors understand what matters must be kept secret as part
of the deliberation process and what falls outside this process.
[205]     It may assist in this regard to tell the jurors that
they cannot reveal the thoughts, statements, opinions, arguments
and votes of individual jurors that form part of their
deliberations. They should be advised that this prohibition
extends not only to their actual deliberations at the end of the
case but also to communications of this nature that may be made
during the course of the trial.
[206]     The jury should also be advised that the prohibition
against disclosure does not extend to matters that fall outside
the jury deliberation process. They should be told, for example,
that they must promptly report to the court if anyone attempts to
influence them or to give them information about the case that
they have not heard in the courtroom. They may be advised as well
that, in exceptional circumstances, information about their
deliberations can be disclosed to the appropriate authorities as
part of an investigation or prosecution of an alleged offence of
obstruct justice.
[207]     In order to be effective, these instructions should be
given at the commencement of the trial. It may be advisable to
remind the jurors of their duty to maintain secrecy at the end of
the case before they retire to commence their deliberations.
[208]     Therefore, in the end analysis, we are of the view that
the scope of the prohibition under s.649 is concordant with the
scope of the common law exclusionary rule. Questions 3 and 4 can
be answered as follows.
     3.   To  the  extent  that the evidence would be  admissible
          under the common law rule, as it presently stands or as
          modified,  does  s.649 of the Criminal Code  impede  an
          accused&#146;s access to such evidence from jurors?
          No.
     4.   If  the  answer  to question 3 is yes, to  what  extent
          should  s.649 be declared unconstitutional  and  of  no
          force   and   effect  to  ensure  the  maintenance   of
          constitutional standards?
          This question need not be considered.</pre>
    <pre>[209]      For  these reasons, the constitutional application  of
each appellant is dismissed.
[210]     As noted earlier, the constitutional issues raised on
these appeals are only relevant in relation to each appellant&#146;s
application to introduce fresh evidence. In our view, the
proposed fresh evidence in each appeal falls clearly within the
scope of the rule of exclusion and is inadmissible. Hence, each
application to introduce fresh evidence is dismissed.
</pre>
    <pre>THE PROPRIETY OF THE MISTRIAL AT THE APPELLANT&#146;S SECOND TRIAL</pre>
    <pre>[211]      We  will  now deal with the appellant's argument  that
Watt  J.  erred in his preliminary ruling wherein he refused  the
appellant's  motion for a stay of proceedings on the  grounds  of
abuse  of process.  According to the appellant, Watt J. ought  to
have  awarded a stay for two reasons:  i) O'Connell J.  erred  in
declaring a mistrial on the second trial because the jury had  in
fact  reached a verdict and;  ii) it was an abuse of  process  to
proceed with a third trial against the appellant considering that
his first two trials ended in successive mistrials.
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Events leading up to the Mistrial</pre>
    <pre>[212]      On April 25, 1991, O'Connell J., delivered his  charge
to  the  jury  and the deliberations began.  The jury deliberated
for the next four days.  On the morning of May 1, 1991, the trial
judge  convened  court in order to deal with a  handwritten  note
that  had been sent to him by juror #1.  As earlier set out,  the
note stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Your  honour, will you please pole  us  after
          the  virdict [sic] is read but if  you  could
          make  it  look as if this is what is done  in
          the  courts  I have to do what I feel  I  was
          sworen [sic] to do &amp; what I feel is right  in
          my  heart &amp; after what I've been put  through
          in  the  jury room this was the  only  way  I
          could  do  it.  Please let me say I  am  very
          sorry if this has caused so much time &amp; money
          but as I said I have to do what based on what
          you said hearing what every one else said day
          after  day  &amp; still keeping an open  mind  in
          order  to reread &amp; go over the facts.  For  I
          feel I have made the right choice.  Thank you
          for letting me serve in your court.  Its been
          an honour.  Juror #1.
</pre>
    <pre>[213]      In response to the note, the appellant's counsel first
proposed that the jury be re-called &quot;for a gentle exhortation&quot; of
the  advisability of unanimity, leaving it open to them to report
an  inability to agree.  He added, &quot;the other way is  to  declare
them a hung jury&quot;.  Crown counsel took the position that the jury
should be given a further exhortation concerning the desirability
of  reaching  a verdict.  He also submitted that the jury  should
not  be  declared &quot;hung&quot; and that the proceedings should  not  be
terminated short of a verdict.</pre>
    <pre>[1]  [214]     The trial judge suggested, that in his view, there
were two options:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)         declaration of a mistrial; or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)            segregation of Juror #1 from the other jurors, her
               individual re-call to the courtroom and questioning of her to
               ascertain whether she &quot;stood by&quot; what was declared in the note.</pre>
    <pre>[215]       Both  counsel  disagreed  with  an  individual  juror
interview.   Counsel for the appellant submitted that instead  of
conducting  an  individual interview, the trial  judge  ought  to
declare  a  mistrial.  Counsel for the Crown  again  opposed  the
declaration  of  a  mistrial  and  again  suggested   a   &quot;gentle
exhortation&quot;.   (Neither  counsel  suggested  that  the  jury  be
returned  to the court and asked whether they had agreed  upon  a
verdict.)
[216]     The trial judge adjourned court for approximately forty-
five minutes.  When he reconvened, in the absence of the jury, he
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I am going to tell you, I am going to declare
          a  mistrial.  I have no information before me
          other than that letter.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[217]     The prosecutor continued to press the trial judge to re-
call  the  jury  so that they could be exhorted  &quot;one  last  time
before  the  mistrial is declared&quot;.  The discussion  between  the
trial  judge  and the Crown counsel about the note  continued  as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     It is what? Ambiguous?
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR.  ASH:        I think it is very difficult
          to  know what it means.  I would ask that you
          not  repeat it in open court.  We have looked
          at  it  over the recess, it is real difficult
          deciphering what it means.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  submit  with respect that they be  brought
          back, be exhorted one last time and told  the
          verdict  must be unanimous and at that  point
          they  be asked to retire and come back  later
          this  afternoon.  At that point if they  have
          not  agreed and they don't have the  verdict,
          it  must  be  assessed then and if  necessary
          declare a mistrial.  I urge you not to do  it
          at  this  point.  We have no real  indication
          that  indeed  they are unable to  come  to  a
          verdict or unable to agree.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     I don't know what note you are
          reading.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR. ASH:       I am reading the same note you
          are reading.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     It is quite clear in this note
          that  the juror is asking for polling because
          she  has  been  coerced even  though  she  is
          agreeing.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR. ASH:       She doesn't use that word.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:     She sure doesn't,  maybe  she
          doesn't know the word.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR.  ASH:        It says, I feel I have  made
          the  right choice.  What I would ask is, they
          be  brought back, exhorted one last time.  My
          friend certainly can urge that they be polled
          at the end and I would join with him in that.
          In  view  of this note, we may be very,  very
          close  to a verdict, sir, and for that reason
          I  urge  you  not to declare the mistrial  at
          this time.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE   COURT:       Sir,  I  am  declaring   a
          mistrial.  I have no alternative.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  have thought about it and thought about it
          and  I  am  satisfied,  no  matter  what  the
          verdict  is, this particular juror  has  been
          coerced and confidentially she is telling  me
          that notwithstanding what the verdict is, she
          is  asking me to poll them so she can say she
          has  been coerced and then I have a mistrial.
          By  saying  I have a mistrial in  advance  of
          that  process I am doing what I would  do  in
          any event.  I don't intend to put her in that
          position.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR.  ASH:        I  understand your  honour's
          concerns.  It is certainly not as clear to me
          as  it  appears to be to you.   In  my  view,
          there  is  considerable room for considerable
          interpretation of the note.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  urge  you  not to declare the mistrial  at
          this time and I would ask they be brought  in
          and exhorted to come to a verdict and they be
          told, if your honour wishes, that the verdict
          must be unanimous, no pressure be used.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:      The note says  they  have  a
          verdict.  Poll us after the verdict is read.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR.  ASH:        We only have that  from  one
          person, your honour.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     Exactly.  When I got the note,
          I  told  the  Deputy to have them  cease  any
          further discussion until I discussed it  with
          you.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR.  ASH:        We still have no verdict  or
          indication what the verdict may be,  at  this
          time.   They  can  still be polled,  sir.   I
          think  that  would be the wiser  course  with
          respect.   It  has  been a  lengthy,  lengthy
          trial.  I hate to see it go into mistrial  on
          the  basis  of  the note, which  at  best  is
          confusing  and at worst is very difficult  to
          comprehend.  I would agree with your  honour,
          in  that it has been a very frustrating  long
          trial.  By the same token I urge you to  take
          the other course.  If we give them until five
          o'clock  this  afternoon, that is  more  than
          adequate to clarify the situation.  They  can
          still be polled.
          </pre>
    <pre>          That is what I urge your honour to do.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:      But they have told  me  they
          don't  want any more time.  I got this letter
          after.   I know they have no more time  as  I
          have told them to cease.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR.  ASH:        Do I understand  they  don't
          want any more time?
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     That's right.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR. ASH:       Have they reached a verdict?
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     They don't want any more time,
          I  presume.   Would  you  please,  after  the
          verdict  is  read,  poll  me.   I  have  been
          coerced.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q:         The  word coerced is  not  in  the
          letter?
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:      Probably  doesn't  know  the
          word.
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR.   ASH:         There  are  a  number   of
          misspellings and so on.  We are really trying
          to  decipher a note that is very difficult to
          understand.    I  appreciate  your   honour's
          difficulty.  I am simply attempting to save a
          very lengthy trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     I want to be fair to the Crown
          and  accused.   I don't see any  alternative.
          Mr.  Rosen agrees with me and I think  he  is
          right.  Bring the jury in.
</pre>
    <pre>[218]      The jury was then re-called to the courtroom  and  the
trial judge declared a mistrial and discharged the jury.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Watt J.'s ruling on the Propriety of the Mistrial</pre>
    <pre>[219]     As noted, Watt J. denied the appellant's application to
receive any of the jurors' evidence regarding their deliberations
in  the  second trial. On February 5, 1992 Watt J. dismissed  the
application  for  a stay of proceedings with written  reasons  to
follow.  On November 21, 1995 Watt J. released written reasons in
support of his ruling dismissing the application for a stay.
[220]     Counsel for the appellant had also submitted to Watt J.
that O'Connell J. knew that the jury had reached a verdict of
acquittal at the time he declared a mistrial, and that he misled
counsel as to the true state of affairs.
[221]     In our view it is clear from the reasons of Watt J.
that he found as a fact that O'Connell J. did not know the
&quot;nature&quot; of the jury's &quot;verdict&quot; when he declared a mistrial.  In
this context Watt J. stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  nature  of the &quot;verdict&quot; was not  known.
          It  necessarily  follows  that  it  was  not,
          indeed  could not have been disclosed to  the
          trial judge.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Before  he  returned  to  the  courtroom   to
          discuss  the juror's note with counsel  I  am
          satisfied that the trial judge was aware:
          </pre>
    <pre>          i    that the jury had reported that they had
          reached a &quot;verdict&quot;
          </pre>
    <pre>          ii    that  juror #1 had been observed  in  a
          distressed condition the previous evening, as
          well as that same morning
          </pre>
    <pre>          iii   that  juror  #1 claimed  to  have  been
          pressured,  if  not  threatened,  by   fellow
          jurors during the deliberations; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          iv    that  juror #1 asked to have  the  jury
          polled and speak in open court.
</pre>
    <pre>[222]      It is evident from the ruling of Watt J. that  he  was
satisfied that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)    O'Connell  J.  did  not   deliberately
          mislead  counsel on the question  of  whether
          the jury had reached a verdict, and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)    O'Connell  J.  did  not  exercise  his
          discretion  improperly  in  terminating   the
          second trial.
</pre>
    <pre>[223]     Watt J. also made the following observations:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It    is    worthy   of   observation    that
          notwithstanding  the plain reference  in  the
          note of juror #1 that the jury had reached  a
          verdict,  none of the persons conducting  the
          case,   whether  prosecuting,  defending   or
          presiding, considered that a verdict had been
          achieved.  The only logical inference to draw
          is  that what is now asserted to be a verdict
          of  which  the  applicant  has  been  wrongly
          deprived was not then, at that time,  thought
          to be so.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                            . . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>          At  the time he returned to the courtroom  to
          discuss  the note from juror #1 with counsel,
          as  well  as thereafter, it was open  to  the
          trial  judge to conclude that there was  not,
          as   announced,   &quot;a  verdict&quot;,   rather   an
          inability  of  the  jurors  to  agree  and  a
          statement  by  one  of the  jurors  that  she
          neither  agreed with the others nor  proposed
          to change her opinion.
          </pre>
    <pre>                                     . . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  trial judge would have been entitled  to
          exercise his discretion differently  than  by
          declaring a mistrial.  The mere existence  of
          alternatives, however, does not mean that  in
          choosing the course he did, the learned trial
          judge     improperly     terminated     trial
          proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>     
     3.   The Discretion of a Trial Judge to order a Mistrial</pre>
    <pre>[224]      The  authority of a judge to discharge  the  jury  and
terminate the trial is codified in s.653(1) of the Criminal  Code
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          s.653(1)   Where the judge is satisfied  that
          the  jury  is unable to agree on its  verdict
          and  that further detention of the jury would
          be   useless,   he  may  in  his   discretion
          discharge that jury and direct a new jury  to
          be  empanelled  during the  sittings  of  the
          court, or may adjourn the trial on such terms
          as justice may require.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)   A  discretion that is  exercised  under
          subsection (1) by a judge is not reviewable.
</pre>
    <pre>[225]      In R. v. D. (T.C.) (1988), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 434  at  447
(Ont.  C.A.), Martin J.A. held that the propriety of  a  mistrial
may  be  subject  to  Charter scrutiny if  the  proceedings  were
improperly  terminated, and the new trial  would  contravene  the
principles  of fundamental justice.  He stressed the very  narrow
scope  of  review  which is to be entertained under  the  Charter
and/or the abuse of process doctrine.  At pp. 451-52, he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The issue here is not, of course, whether  it
          would have been proper for the judge to  have
          exercised  his  discretion  differently   but
          whether  declaring a mistrial and the renewal
          of  the proceedings contravened principles of
          fundamental justice.
</pre>
    <pre>[226]      In LaForest v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 869 at  875,
Martland J. considered the issue of a judge's duty in relation to
being satisfied that a jury had reached a unanimous verdict:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  duty  of  the  trial  judge  in  such  a
          situation was stated many years ago by  Chief
          Justice  Macauley  in R. v.  Ford,  (1853)  3
          U.C.C.P. 209 at pp. 217-18:
               </pre>
    <pre>               That  a  jury may correct their verdict,
               or  that any of them may withhold assent
               and  express  dissent therefrom  at  any
               time  before  it is finally entered  and
               confirmed,  it  is clear  from  numerous
               authorities;  and  the  judge  presiding
               over  a  criminal court  cannot  be  too
               cautious in being assured that,  when  a
               result  so serious to the party  accused
               as  a  verdict of guilty is arrived  at,
               all  the jury understand the effect  and
               concur  in the decision; and if  at  any
               moment,  before it is too late, anything
               occurs  to  excite  suspicion  on   this
               subject,  he  should  carefully   assure
               himself that there is no misapprehension
               in the matter.
</pre>
    <pre>[227]      The verdict in a first degree murder case is extremely
serious  to both the accused and society, whether the verdict  is
guilty  or  not  guilty, and the same principle that  all  jurors
concur in the decision is, of course, equally applicable.
[228]     Martland J., at pp. 875-76, also affirmed the decision
of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Bryan (1971), 1
C.C.C. (2d) 342, to the effect that there are &quot;no rules to bind
the judge as to how he should assure himself that there is no
misapprehension in the matter&quot;.
[229]     While Crown counsel urged O'Connell J. to exhort the
jury and send it back for further deliberations, the law is clear
that a deadlocked jury is a very delicate situation and that no
member of the jury should in any way be encouraged to abandon his
or her oath.  This principle was enunciated in R. v. Jack (1997),
117 C.C.C. (3d) 43 at 58 by Helpen J.A.:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  integrity  of the jury process  must  be
          upheld.   Jurors must remain free  to  render
          their individual and collective decisions  in
          accordance  with the oaths they  have  sworn.
          Trial  judges must refrain from exerting  any
          subtle pressure on the jurors to take one  or
          another  view of the evidence or to acquiesce
          to  the views of the majority for the sake of
          convenience of the other jurors, the  accused
          or the judicial system.
</pre>
    <pre>[230]      The contents of the note from juror #1 suggested  that
there  was  an  irreconcilable  disagreement  and  any  agreement
between  juror  #1  and the other jurors after  several  days  of
deliberation would be highly suspect.  As was stated by Watt J.:
          </pre>
    <pre>          To  require  a  jury to continue deliberation
          despite     genuine    and     irreconcilable
          disagreement  is  more  likely  than  not  to
          defeat rather than promote the ends of public
          justice.   Capitulation from  coercion  is  a
          distinct possibility.  Erroneous verdicts may
          be the result.</pre>
    <pre>[231]      In  retrospect with the power of hindsight,  it  would
have  been  preferable for O'Connell J. to have inquired  of  the
jury in open court, as to whether it had reached a verdict. Based
on  the  note  from juror #1, it is likely that the result  would
have  been &quot;yes&quot; and the verdict wold have been announced in open
court. The jury would then have been polled following which juror
#1  may  or  may  not  have indicated her disagreement  with  the
verdict.   However,  neither counsel for the  appellant  nor  the
Crown  suggested such a course of action and in our view, it  was
not  unreasonable for O'Connell J. to conclude that the jury  was
unable  to  agree  upon  its verdict.  The  note  from  juror  #1
disclosed  that  some form of verdict had been reached  but  that
juror #1 did not agree with the verdict.  We therefore agree with
Watt  J.  that  &quot;it was open to the trial judge to conclude  that
there was not as announced, a verdict, rather an inability of the
jurors to agree...&quot;.
[232]     We therefore do not agree with the appellant's
submission that the proceedings at the second trial were
improperly terminated, thus depriving the appellant of a verdict
of acquittal.</pre>
    <pre>STAY OF PROCEEDINGS</pre>
    <pre>[233]      The  appellant  also submits that  Watt  J.  erred  in
refusing  to  grant  a stay of proceedings  on  the  ground  that
proceeding  with a third trial after two juries have been  unable
to reach a verdict would constitute an abuse of process.
[234]     The Supreme Court of Canada has held in a number of
cases that a judicial stay of proceedings is an exceptional
remedy, which is only to be granted in the &quot;clearest of cases&quot;:
R. v. Power, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 601 at 615; R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 4
S.C.R. 411; and R. v. Conway, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659 at 1667.
[235]     In R. v. Conway, L'Heureux-Dubé J. described the
doctrine of abuse of process at p. 1667:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Under  the doctrine of abuse of process,  the
          unfair   or   oppressive  treatment   of   an
          appellant disentitles the crown to  carry  on
          with  the  prosecution of  the  charge.   The
          prosecution is set aside, not on  the  merits
          (see Jewitt, supra at p. 148), but because it
          is  tainted to such a degree that to allow it
          to proceed would tarnish the integrity of the
          court.  The doctrine is one of the safeguards
          designed  to  ensure &quot;that the repression  of
          crime through the conviction of the guilty is
          done  in a way which reflects our fundamental
          values of a society.&quot;  (Rothman v. The Queen,
          [1981]  1 S.C.R. 640, at  689, per Lamer  J).
          It  acknowledges that courts  must  have  the
          respect and support of the community in order
          that  the administration of criminal  justice
          may    properly    fulfil    its    function.
          Consequently, where the affront to fair  play
          and   decency  is  disproportionate  to   the
          societal    interest   in    the    effective
          prosecution  of  criminal  cases,  then   the
          administration of justice is best  served  by
          staying the proceedings.
</pre>
    <pre>[236]      In  R.  v. Keyowski, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 657, the  Supreme
Court  of  Canada  held that a third trial on a serious  criminal
case  does not, per se, result in an abuse of process. In  R.  v.
Conway,  supra, L'Heureux-Dubé J. also stated at p. 1668 that  &quot;&#133;
in  light of the comments in Keyowski with respect to the  number
of trials, little weight can attach to the fact that the Crown is
attempting to try the appellant a third time.&quot;
[237]     In R. v. Carosella, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80 at 110, Sopinka
J. discussed the standards of deference applicable to reviewing
the exercise of discretion of a trial judge as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  appropriate standard of  review  of  the
          exercise   of  a  discretionary   power   was
          addressed  by Gonthier J. in Elsom v.  Elsom,
          [1989]  1  S.C.R. 1367, at p. 1375.  Speaking
          for the Court Gonthier J. stated:
               </pre>
    <pre>               The  principles enumerated in the Harper
               case  [[1980] 1 S.C.R. 2] indicate  that
               an  appellate court will be justified in
               intervening in a trial judge's  exercise
               of  his  discretion only  if  the  trial
               judge  misdirects  himself  or  if   his
               decision  is  so  clearly  wrong  as  to
               amount to an injustice.</pre>
    <pre>[238]      In  the  present  appeal,  the  evidence  supports  no
suggestion  of  prosecutorial  misconduct  or  improper   motive.
Neither  the  length, nor the number of proceedings was,  in  any
way,  attributable to any impropriety on the part of  the  Crown.
While it cannot be denied that there may have been some prejudice
given  the number of trials in this case, the prejudice  was  not
disproportionate to the strong societal interest  in  the  proper
resolution of this matter by a unanimous verdict of a jury.
[239]     We are therefore unable to find any error in Watt J.'s
exercise of discretion in dismissing the appellant's application
for a stay of proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>THE OTHER GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[240]      The  appellant also advances a number  of  grounds  of
appeal  that  concern rulings made by Watt J. at the third  trial
and  alleged errors in his charge to the jury.  Counsel  for  the
appellant made no oral submissions with respect to some of  these
grounds of appeal; however, the appellant did not abandon any  of
them.   We will, therefore, address all of the remaining  grounds
of  appeal raised by the appellant, albeit in some cases briefly.
When  dealing  with issues on which the appellant  made  no  oral
submissions, we will assume that the appellant&#146;s extensive factum
reflects his position on those issues.
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   The failure to grant the appellant&#146;s motion for a
          directed verdict on first degree murder</pre>
    <pre>[241]      At  the  conclusion of the Crown&#146;s case the  appellant
moved  for a directed verdict on first degree murder.  The  trial
judge  dismissed  the motion without any detailed  reasons.   The
appellant  submits that the trial judge erred in  dismissing  his
motion  for  a  directed  verdict on first  degree  murder.   The
appellant  contends that at the conclusion of  the  Crown&#146;s  case
there was no evidence upon which a jury could return a verdict of
guilty  of  first  degree murder.  The appellant,  in  a  related
submission,  also contends that the jury&#146;s verdict of  guilty  of
first degree murder is unreasonable.
[242]     The appellant argues the directed verdict and
unreasonable verdict issues as if they were one issue.  The Crown
responds in a similar way.  Consistent with the positions taken
by both the appellant and the Crown, we will address the directed
verdict and unreasonable verdict issues together.
[243]     Whether the trial judge should have left first degree
murder with the jury is determined by the test set out in United
States v. Shephard, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1067 at 1080:
          whether  or  not there is any  evidence  upon
          which  a  reasonable jury properly instructed
          could return a verdict of guilty.34</pre>
    <pre>[244]      This  test  requires the Crown to  have  adduced  some
evidence  upon which the jury could reasonably conclude that  the
appellant  murdered the deceased and that the murder was  planned
and  deliberate.  In the circumstances of this case, as the trial
judge  made clear in his charge, there was no issue that  whoever
caused  the death of the deceased did so with the intent required
for  murder.  Put another way, it was common ground that  someone
murdered  the deceased.  Thus, there were two core trial  issues:
identity,  and  if  the appellant&#146;s identity as  the  person  who
murdered  the  deceased was established, whether the  murder  was
planned and deliberate, so as to be properly classified as  first
degree murder.
[245]     The Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that
where the evidence is circumstantial, &#147;[t]he question of whether
circumstantial evidence meets the requirement of the so-called
rule in Hodges&#146; Case ... is for the jury to determine&#148;:  See R.
v. Monteleone, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 154 at 161.  Thus, in
circumstantial evidence cases, the question whether there is a
rational explanation for circumstantial evidence other than the
accused&#146;s guilt is a matter for the jury.
[246]     As a matter of law and logic, the elements of planning
and deliberation must precede the murder.  Nonetheless, evidence
of conduct and statements made after the murder may be probative
of the issues of planning and deliberation.35
[247]     In our view, there was ample evidence that was capable,
in its cumulative effect, of supporting the trial judge&#146;s
decision to dismiss the motion for a directed verdict on first
degree murder, having regard to the test set out in Shephard,
supra.  Some of this evidence is set out below in summary form:
     ·    the  appellant&#146;s animus towards and obsession with  the
          deceased.   He became convinced that she was having an affair
          with Robert Fisher.  There is substantial evidence on these
     issues;
     ·    the appellant&#146;s statements to Ms. Fisher, shortly before the
          deceased&#146;s disappearance, that something &#147;very surprising and
          shocking&#148; was going to happen.   While the appellant provided an
          explanation for those statements,36 it was open to the jury to
          conclude from them, and all of the other evidence, that the
          appellant was referring in his two discussions with Ms. Fisher to
          the deceased&#146;s eventual fate.  This evidence on its own is
          clearly probative of planning and deliberation;
     ·    the appellant&#146;s letters to the deceased of February 13 and
          20, 1988.  He left both of those letters with Mrs. Chan who he
          knew would see that they were delivered to the deceased.  The
          jury could have concluded that these letters, which were quite
          different in their tenor, were intended to cause the deceased to
          contact the appellant and that they were part of the appellant&#146;s
          plan to meet and kill the deceased.  In addition, the appellant&#146;s
          letter of February 20, 1988 indirectly suggested that the
          deceased would have to die because she had betrayed him;
     ·    the five knives that the appellant threw into Lake Ontario
          in  May  1988.  These knives were all suitable for  the
          dismemberment of the deceased.   The knives came from a minimum
          of three different knife sets.  Furthermore, when the appellant
          threw the knives into the lake, he also disposed of the knife box
          inserts.  This evidence could support a conclusion that the
          knives were not knives that the appellant randomly selected from
          his kitchen supply, but rather were knives obtained in advance to
          effect the deceased&#146;s dismemberment.  In our view, it was open to
          the jury to infer from this evidence that the deceased&#146;s
          dismemberment was planned and that it was preceded by her murder
          which was also planned.  Moreover, the somewhat elaborate
          dismemberment and mutilation of the deceased, as well as the
          draining of blood from her limbs and the disposal of her body
          parts in various locations in Eastern Ontario could have been
          taken by the jury to support a conclusion that both the murder
          and  its aftermath were a single planned and deliberate
          enterprise;
     ·    the appellant&#146;s statement to his friends after the deceased
          was murdered that he &#147;had long since arranged things properly&#148;
          suggests planning on the appellant&#146;s part with respect to the
          deceased&#146;s murder.  Moreover, the evidence that the appellant
          said &#147;... even if there is premeditation they don&#146;t have direct
          evidence against me&#148;, could be taken to support a finding that
          the appellant planned the deceased&#146;s murder.</pre>
    <pre>[248]     In our opinion, when all of the circumstantial evidence
presented  by  the Crown is taken into account,  it  provides  an
ample  basis  upon which the jury could reasonably conclude  that
the  murder was planned and deliberate.  We therefore think  that
the  trial judge was correct in dismissing the appellant&#146;s motion
for a directed verdict.  Furthermore, upon a review of the entire
record  mandated by s. 686(1)(a)(i), we are of the view that  the
verdict  of guilty of first degree murder was a verdict that  the
jury,  acting judicially, could reasonably have rendered.37   The
verdict was not unreasonable, or a verdict that was not supported
by  the  evidence.   We would not give effect  to  these  related
grounds of appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   The ineffective assistance of counsel</pre>
    <pre>[249]      The  appellant  submits that he did  not  receive  the
effective assistance of counsel at his third trial.  In our view,
this  issue  is  directly connected with the appellant&#146;s  general
submission that his third trial constituted an abuse of  process.
The thrust of the appellant&#146;s submission on this issue is that no
defence counsel could have provided him with effective assistance
due  to  the tactical challenges inherent in a third  trial.   He
points  to  the  problems defence counsel encountered  in  cross-
examining  the  Crown&#146;s witnesses, particularly Mr.  Fisher,  Ms.
Fisher  and Sophia Shen, because they had the benefit  of  having
been examined and cross-examined at the first and second trials.
[250]     We accept that the appellant&#146;s counsel, an experienced
member of the criminal bar, may have faced some problems that
would not have existed since this was the appellant&#146;s third trial
for the deceased&#146;s murder.  These problems would not be exclusive
to the defence.  In any case, as we have earlier stated, defence
counsel&#146;s difficulties at the appellant&#146;s third trial represent
part of the appellant&#146;s position on the abuse of process issue.
The issue to address here is whether the representation that the
appellant actually received at his third trial was ineffective.
[251]     To establish the ineffective assistance of counsel, the
appellant must establish:
     ·    the factual foundation for his claim;
     ·    that trial counsel&#146;s conduct of the defence was ineffective
          when assessed against an objective standard of reasonableness;
          and
     ·    that his counsel&#146;s ineffectiveness prejudiced his defence to
          the extent that there was a reasonable probability that the
          verdict would have been different without his counsel&#146;s
          ineffectiveness.</pre>
    <pre>[252]     The evidentiary foundation for the appellant&#146;s position
on  the  ineffective assistance of counsel issue  comes  from  an
excerpt  from  an  affidavit  of the appellant&#146;s  trial  counsel.
Counsel&#146;s  affidavit  does no more than refer  to  some  tactical
difficulties and decisions that were made in connection with  the
cross-examination of four Crown witnesses.  It does  not  contain
any  suggestion that counsel felt that he had acted incompetently
in any respect at the appellant&#146;s third trial.
[253]     The appellant also compares the second and third trial
records and submits that his counsel did things differently at
the third trial than he did at his second trial.  We accept that
the approach taken by counsel at the third trial did not
replicate the approach he took in cross-examining witnesses at
the second trial.  That is hardly surprising.  It does not assist
in resolving the essential question whether the appellant
received the effective assistance of counsel at his third trial.
[254]     After reviewing the third trial record, we are
satisfied that there is absolutely nothing in it that would
support a conclusion that the appellant was denied his
constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel at
his third trial.  There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   The charge on reasonable doubt</pre>
    <pre>[255]      After  the  trial judge directed the  jury  about  the
presumption  of innocence and the burden of proof,  he  explained
the concept of reasonable doubt as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          What  is  meant by &#147;proof beyond a reasonable
          doubt&#148;?   It  has been said, members  of  the
          jury,  that the term explains itself.  It  is
          achieved  when you, as jurors, feel  sure  of
          the  guilt of the accused.  It is that degree
          of   proof  which  convinces  the  mind   and
          satisfies   the   conscience   so   you,   as
          conscientious jurors, feel bound or compelled
          to  act upon it.  You must be able to say  to
          yourself, &#147;He is really guilty.  Of that I am
          morally  certain.&#148;  I said  morally  certain,
          not mathematically certain, for it is not the
          obligation of the prosecution in this or  any
          criminal   case   to   prove   guilt   to   a
          mathematical certainty.
          </pre>
    <pre>          On  the other hand, should the evidence which
          you  have  heard leave you, as a  responsible
          juror,  with some lingering or nagging  doubt
          with  respect to the proof of some  essential
          element of the offence with which the accused
          is  charged or any offence which is  included
          in  it,  so  that you are unable  to  say  to
          yourself that the Crown has proven the  guilt
          of  the  accused in respect of  that  offence
          beyond  a reasonable doubt, as I have defined
          those  words, your duty is then to  find  the
          accused  not guilty in respect of the offence
          about which you have such reasonable doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  doubt, members of the jury, I emphasize,
          must  be reasonable.  It must be a reasonable
          doubt  based upon the evidence that you  have
          heard  in  this  case.   It  must  not  be  a
          speculative, fanciful, imaginary or  illusory
          doubt  conjured  up in the mind  of  a  timid
          juror so that he or she may avoid their plain
          duty or responsibility.  It must be, as well,
          with  regard to an essential element  of  the
          crime,  not  in  respect of some  unessential
          matter.   It  must  not be a  doubt  born  of
          sympathy  for or of prejudice against  either
          the  accused  or the deceased.   To  put  the
          matter  shortly, it must be reasonable  doubt
          founded  upon  the evidence adduced,  neither
          speculative,  fanciful  illusory,  imaginary,
          born  of sympathy, nor animated by prejudice.
          [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[256]     He repeated his charge on reasonable doubt, in much the
same  language, near the end of his charge.  No purpose  will  be
served in setting out what he said about reasonable doubt in that
part of the charge.
[257]     After he fairly and thoroughly reviewed the positions
of the Crown and the defence, the trial judge cautioned the jury
not to engage in an either/or analysis of the competing positions
advanced.  He said in his charge:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Members of the jury, the juxtaposition of the
          positions  of  counsel  may  tempt   you   to
          determine the matter simply on the basis of a
          comparison of those positions, a selection of
          the more favoured one, and the recording of a
          verdict  in accordance with it.  You are  not
          engaged   in   a  comparative   analysis   of
          competing positions.  To decide the  case  in
          such a way would do violence to your oath and
          pay  no heed to the placement of the onus and
          ignore  the  standard  of  proof.   [Emphasis
          added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[258]      In  addition,  the trial judge  charged  the  jury  in
accordance with the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s judgment in  R.  v.
W.  (D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397.  In that part of his charge,
he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Even  if you disbelieve every single syllable
          of  evidence uttered by the accused from  the
          witness box, the onus nonetheless rests  upon
          the Crown to prove the essential elements  of
          the offence beyond a reasonable doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[259]      The charge in this case was delivered long before  the
Supreme  Court of Canada&#146;s judgment in R. v. Lifchus (1997),  118
C.C.C.  (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  Thus, the trial judge did not have  the
benefit  of Cory J.&#146;s direction on the appropriate content  of  a
charge on reasonable doubt.
[260]     In Lifchus, the trial judge did not define reasonable
doubt.  Instead, he directed the jury that each of them knew what
the words &#147;doubt&#148; and &#147;reasonable&#148; meant.  On the Crown&#146;s appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada, Cory J., for a unanimous court,
held that the jury should be directed on the meaning of
reasonable doubt because the words &#147;reasonable doubt&#148; have &#147;a
specific meaning in the legal context.&#148;  He also said that the
jury should not be told that reasonable doubt is an &#147;ordinary&#148;
concept, or that it can be equated with the standard jurors would
apply to decisions that they might make in their daily lives,
even if those decisions were important.  He further stated that
equating proof beyond a reasonable doubt to proof to a &#147;moral
certainty&#148; was neither &#147;descriptive nor helpful.&#148;  He said, at p.
10, &#147;...I think that this expression [moral certainty], although
not necessarily fatal to a charge on reasonable doubt, should be
avoided.&#148;
[261]     Cory J. also expressed the view that qualifying &#147;doubt&#148;
with adjectives other than &#147;reasonable&#148; ought to be avoided, and
he rejected describing reasonable doubt as a doubt &#147;for which one
can give a reason&#148;, since some doubts are incapable of
articulation, but at the same time may be reasonable.
[262]     In this case, the trial judge did not tell the jury
that reasonable doubt explains itself, or that the words
&#147;reasonable doubt&#148;, as the trial judge put it and left it in
Lifchus, were &#147;ordinary, everyday words that I am sure you
understand.&#148; Although the trial judge did say that &#147;it has been
said&#148; that reasonable doubt explains itself, he did not stop
there.  Instead, he went on to extensively explain what
reasonable doubt means in the context of a criminal trial.  He
did not make the basic Lifchus error of failing to explain the
meaning of reasonable doubt.
[263]     There is no doubt that when the trial judge explained
what reasonable doubt was, he used some language that Cory J.
said in Lifchus should be avoided.  For example, he equated proof
beyond a reasonable doubt to proof to a &#147;moral certainty.&#148;  He
also told the jury that reasonable doubt is achieved &#147;... when
you as jurors feel sure of the guilt of the accused.&#148;  Further,
he used the adjectives &#147;lingering&#148; and &#147;nagging&#148; to qualify a
doubt as part of his explanation of what reasonable doubt meant.
[264]     Although the trial judge equated proof beyond a
reasonable doubt to proof to a moral certainty, he went on to
instruct the jury that reasonable doubt must be a doubt &#147;founded
upon the evidence.&#148;  Thus, Cory J.&#146;s concern in Lifchus that
&#147;moral certainty&#148; may not be equated with evidentiary certainty
does not exist in this case where the trial judge made it clear
that the jury in considering the standard of proof must look only
to the evidence.
[265]     The trial judge&#146;s use of words such as &#147;sure&#148; and
&#147;certain&#148; in the reasonable doubt charge must be considered in
the context of the entire charge on the meaning of reasonable
doubt.  The impugned words do not stand alone.  The instruction
on reasonable doubt, when read as a whole, would not have
confused the jury or led to any misapprehension about the burden
and standard of proof.
[266]     The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred
by using adjectives other than &#147;reasonable&#148; to qualify doubt.  In
our view, the qualifiers used (lingering and nagging) do not
lower the &#147;beyond a reasonable doubt&#148; standard of proof.  Indeed,
the use of this language would, if anything, have the effect of
elevating the burden placed upon the Crown.
[267]     We do not think that the trial judge erred in not
specifically distinguishing the criminal standard of proof
(beyond a reasonable doubt) from the civil standard (reasonable
balance of probability).  In explaining the standard of proof, he
emphasized what reasonable doubt was, not what it was not and, in
our view, he was correct in so doing.
[268]     In Lifchus, Cory J. emphasized that the purpose of the
reasonable doubt jury instruction in a criminal case is to direct
the jury on the standard of proof that must be met for the Crown
to secure a conviction.  He accepted that, &#147;any form&#148; of
instruction that correctly explained what the standard of proof
was would be acceptable.  In our view, the charge on reasonable
doubt was sufficient.  We would, therefore, not give effect to
this ground of appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     4.   The charge on circumstantial evidence</pre>
    <pre>[269]      The  appellant submits that the trial judge  erred  in
failing  to  instruct the jury that there was no direct  evidence
against  the appellant on any of the essential elements of  first
or  second  degree murder.  He also submits that the trial  judge
erred in not explaining the significance of the absence of direct
evidence to the jury.
[270]     This general ground of appeal can be dealt with
briefly.  In his charge, the trial judge, in a clear
understandable way, explained the difference between direct and
circumstantial evidence.  He then told the jury what they would
have already known from counsels&#146; addresses, that it was &#147;common
ground&#148; that the Crown&#146;s case was entirely circumstantial.  In
our opinion, the charge on circumstantial evidence was clear and
correct.  The trial judge told the jury what circumstantial
evidence was and directed the jury about the need to consider
alternative explanations for the appellant&#146;s conduct, and he
thoroughly reviewed the appellant&#146;s various explanations for
conduct that was capable of giving rise to an inference of
consciousness of guilt.
[271]     There is no obligation on a trial judge to provide the
jury with a formulaic instruction on inferences that may arise
from circumstantial evidence.  It is sufficient for the trial
judge to charge the jury in the language of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.  In R. v. Fleet (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457,
this court said at p. 465:
          </pre>
    <pre>          However, so long as the trial judge&#146;s  charge
          when read as a whole is clear on the issue of
          reasonable doubt, no particular form of words
          is  required  where  proof  of  one  or  more
          elements  of  the Crown&#146;s case  depends  upon
          circumstantial evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[272]      We  see  no  error  in any aspect  of  the  charge  on
circumstantial evidence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   Evidence of opportunity</pre>
    <pre>[273]      The appellant concedes that in some cases evidence  of
opportunity  may be considered by a jury.  However,  he  contends
that in view of the uncertainty about where and when the deceased
was  killed  and  the  fact  that  many  persons,  including  the
appellant,  had  an  opportunity to commit the offence,  evidence
about opportunity was of no probative value.  Thus, the appellant
submits that the charge on opportunity invited the jury to engage
in  speculation.  It is the appellant&#146;s position that since there
was  no evidentiary basis upon which the jury could find that the
appellant had the exclusive opportunity to kill the deceased, the
trial  judge  erred  in raising the issue of opportunity  in  his
charge at all.
[274]     We see no merit in this ground of appeal.  The trial
judge told the jury in clear language that non-exclusive
opportunity, without more, is not sufficient in law to convict.
He also told the jury that a failure to establish evidence of
opportunity supports innocence. He did not suggest to the jury
that there was evidence of exclusive opportunity and the jury
would not have understood that there was such evidence.
[275]     We see no error in the charge on opportunity.  It would
have been wrong in the circumstances of this case had the trial
judge not included that issue in the charge.
     </pre>
    <pre>     6.   The failure to charge in accordance with K.G.B. [R. v.
          K.G.B. (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (S.C.C.)]</pre>
    <pre>[276]       The   appellant  accepts  that  the   trial   judge&#146;s
instruction   on  the  use  to  be  made  of  prior  inconsistent
statements was correct when the trial judge delivered his charge.
However, the appellant submits that in light of the Supreme Court
of  Canada&#146;s  decision in K.G.B., which was  released  after  the
trial  judge charged the jury in this case, he should be able  to
rely  on  six  prior  inconsistent  statements  of  witnesses  as
substantive evidence, not just evidence going to the issue of the
witnesses&#146; credibility.
[277]     The appellant accepts that in R. v. Cameron (1995), 96
C.C.C. (3d) 346 (Ont. C.A.), this court held that the judgment in
K.G.B. represented an &#147;incremental development&#148; in the law, and
that characterization of the change militates against him raising
this issue on appeal. However, the appellant seeks to have this
court &#147;revisit&#148; its judgment in Cameron.  He relies on the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Brown (1993), 83
C.C.C. (3d) 129 in support of that submission. In Brown, the
Supreme Court allowed an appeal from conviction on the basis that
the appellant was entitled to raise an issue on appeal (the right
to silence) as it had developed after the appellant&#146;s trial.
[278]     There is no doubt that there is a discretion in
appellate courts to permit an appellant to rely on a change in
the law of evidence which came into effect between trial and
appeal.  It is, however, clear that this discretion will not be
exercised unless:
          (a)  the change is a fundamental restatement of the law and not
               an incremental development; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  there is a sufficient evidentiary foundation in the record
               to permit the issue to be properly determined on appeal.38
</pre>
    <pre>[279]      This  court&#146;s judgment in Cameron is  consistent  with
previous   decisions  of  this  court  on  the   issue   of   the
retrospective  effect  of changes in the law  of  evidence.   For
example,  in  R.  v. Bickford (1989), 51 C.C.C.  (3d)  181  (Ont.
C.A.), Robins J.A. said at p. 185:
          </pre>
    <pre>          [An  accused person&#146;s] right is to  be  tried
          according  to the law; that is, in accordance
          with  the  evidentiary rules  and  procedural
          requirements  in effect at the  time  of  his
          trial.39
</pre>
    <pre>[280]      In our view, the change in the law of evidence brought
about by K.G.B. is, as held in Cameron, incremental.  Indeed,  in
K.G.B.,   at  p.  281,  Lamer  C.J.C.  referred  to   the   prior
inconsistent  statements rule in K.G.B. as  &#147;...  a  natural  and
incremental progression in the development of the law of  hearsay
in Canada ...&#148;  [Emphasis added.]
[281]     In any case, the prior inconsistent statements in
issue, if admitted as substantive evidence under K.G.B., could
not have reasonably affected the verdict.  For example, one of
the prior inconsistent statements to which the appellant refers
is Sophia Shen&#146;s statement at the appellant&#146;s first trial that
the appellant was introduced to her as Mr. Li Ling.  At the
appellant&#146;s third trial, she said that the appellant was
introduced to her as Dr. Li Ling.  She explained that because the
Crown at the first trial had used the term Mr. when asking her
about the introduction, she used the same reference.
[282]     Even if Sophia&#146;s evidence at the first trial was
admissible for the proof of its contents, the real trial issue
was not whether the appellant was in fact a medical doctor but
rather whether he had sufficient knowledge and skill to dismember
the deceased.  How the appellant may have referred to himself on
one social occasion could not have had any real bearing on the
jury&#146;s determination of that issue.  There was considerable
evidence from other independent witnesses, and from the appellant
himself, that the appellant on occasion referred to himself as
&#147;doctor&#148;.  The substantive content of Sophia&#146;s allegedly
inconsistent evidence at the first trial could not realistically
have affected that other evidence.  We have the same view of the
other prior inconsistent statements when they are considered both
separately and cumulatively.
[283]     We see no merit in this ground of appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     7.   The trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence</pre>
    <pre>[284]      The  appellant submits that the trial  judge  did  not
accurately and fully summarize the appellant&#146;s evidence or  point
out  to  the jury important evidence that supported the case  for
the  defence.   The appellant also submits that the  trial  judge
failed  to  correct  some misstatements of the  evidence  in  the
Crown&#146;s jury address.
[285]     The trial judge told the jury, relatively early in his
charge, that he would review the &#147;significant features&#148; of the
evidence to assist them in refreshing their memories.  He
emphasized that it was the jury&#146;s obligation to consider all of
the evidence, not just that part of it that he would be reviewing
in the course of his charge.  He also instructed the jury that it
was their recollection of the evidence, not his or counsels&#146;,
that was determinative.
[286]      In R. v. Daly (1992), 57 O.A.C. 70 (C.A.), Doherty
J.A. expressed the view that trial judges must be given leeway in
determining how, and to what extent, to review the evidence.  He
said at pp. 73-74:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Generally  speaking, the trial  judge  has  a
          duty  to review the evidence so as to  assist
          the  jury in understanding the factual issues
          in  dispute, the competing positions  of  the
          parties,  and the evidence relied on  by  the
          parties in relation to the issues.  There  is
          no single formula which must be followed by a
          trial judge when reviewing the evidence.  The
          approach  to  be taken in a given  case  will
          depend on a myriad of factors, including  the
          number  and complexity of the issues  raised,
          the nature of the evidence, counsel&#146;s conduct
          of   the   case,   including  their   closing
          addresses,  and the trial judge&#146;s assessment,
          no   doubt   somewhat  subjective,   of   the
          particular   jury.   As  even  this   partial
          enumeration of the relevant factors  suggest,
          an  appellate court must give a  trial  judge
          leeway  in  determining  how,  and  to   what
          extent,   to   review  the  evidence   in   a
          particular case.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[287]      In  R. v. Jacquard (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.),
Lamer  C.J.C.,  after addressing the purpose of  a  jury  charge,
dealt  with  the issue of appellate review of jury  charges.   He
said at p. 11:
          </pre>
    <pre>          As  long  as an appellate court, when looking
          at the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury as  a
          whole, concludes that the jury was left  with
          a  sufficient understanding of the  facts  as
          they  relate  to  the  relevant  issues,  the
          charge is proper.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[288]      In our opinion, the trial judge expansively and  in  a
balanced way reviewed the positions of the Crown and the defence.
He  also  reviewed  the  evidence  that  was  relevant  to  those
positions and to the real issues in the trial.
[289]     There is no merit in this ground of appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     8.   The trial judge&#146;s ruling on the blackmail letters</pre>
    <pre>[290]      As  we noted in reviewing the evidence, the  appellant
held  a  press conference on May 19, 1988, during which  he  told
those  reporters present that both he and the deceased  had  been
blackmailed.  He said the blackmail was contained in a letter and
a   tape-recorded  telephone  call.   Manifestly,  the  appellant
suggested that those responsible for the blackmail might also  be
responsible for the deceased&#146;s murder.  The appellant  also  said
that  he gave the letter to the police. The Crown&#146;s evidence  was
that the police did not receive any such letter or tape from  the
appellant before his May 19th press conference.
[291]     During the appellant&#146;s examination-in-chief, his trial
counsel sought to adduce two documents, alleged to be copies of
two letters written by the deceased, one to her sister and the
other to her parents.  These two unsigned letters were undated,
however, the letter to the deceased&#146;s parents contained a return
address which suggested that it was written in about 1985.  Some
parts of the letters were scratched out and it was not known who
made these marks, or when they were made.
[292]     The trial judge ruled that the letters were &#147;at best of
tenuous relevance.&#148;  He concluded that, to the extent that the
defence sought to rely on them to establish that the deceased was
blackmailed or threatened by some third persons, the letters were
hearsay and thus inadmissible.  He therefore ruled that the
letters were not &#147;at present&#148; admissible.
[293]     In our view, the trial judge was correct in
characterizing the letters as inadmissible hearsay in respect of
the truth of their contents.  Moreover, if they were not
proffered for the truth of their content they were not capable of
supporting the interpretation that they referred to the deceased
having been threatened or blackmailed by some unknown third
person.  In any case, however the letters are characterized, they
were not letters that the appellant turned over to the police as
he said he had at his press conference.  Thus, the letters did
not rebut the Crown&#146;s contention that the appellant&#146;s statements
at the press conference about turning blackmail letters (and a
tape) over to the police were false.
[294]     In our view, the trial judge&#146;s ruling with respect to
the blackmail letters was correct.
     </pre>
    <pre>     9.   The re-examination of the appellant about his
          conversation with Constable Riddell</pre>
    <pre>[295]      The  appellant submits that the trial judge  erred  in
refusing  to  permit  him  to  be re-examined  on  an  audiotaped
conversation he had with Constable Riddell on June 2, 1988.   His
contention  is  that during that conversation, Constable  Riddell
acknowledged that the appellant told Constable Riddell in advance
of his plan to visit Mrs. Chan on May 17, 1988.
[296]     The transcript of the relevant telephone conversation
between the appellant and Constable Riddell was not made an
exhibit at trial, however, what was said, as reproduced in the
Crown&#146;s supplementary appeal book, in part, is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Pan:   a lot of thinks [sic] you know like eh
          like  eh  yesterday you ask eh my  friend  eh
          Wong right Peter WONG
          </pre>
    <pre>          Riddell:  Peter WONG
          </pre>
    <pre>          Pan:  yeh eh ah Peter yeh like eh Mrs. CHEN I
          told I remember I told before I went there  I
          told you
          </pre>
    <pre>          Riddell:  yeh
          </pre>
    <pre>          Pan:  and  after I went to there I  told  you
          next day
          </pre>
    <pre>          Riddell:  that&#146;s right
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[297]      In his evidence in-chief, Constable Riddell said  that
the  appellant  had not notified him in advance of  his  plan  to
visit  Mrs. Chan.  In his cross-examination of Constable Riddell,
the  appellant&#146;s  trial counsel asked him if  the  appellant  had
notified  him  in  advance  of  his  plan  to  visit  Mrs.  Chan.
Constable  Riddell repeated that the appellant had not  told  him
that he intended to meet with Mrs. Chan. Defence counsel did  not
put  the  transcript of the taped conversation between  Constable
Riddell and the appellant to Constable Riddell.  Indeed, he  made
no reference to that conversation.
[298]     The appellant submits that he should have been
permitted in re-examination to expand on his evidence that he had
told Constable Riddell about his plans to visit Mrs. Chan by
referring to the transcript of his conversation with Constable
Riddell.  The appellant&#146;s trial counsel sought to re-examine the
appellant on this issue, not to contradict Constable Riddell, but
to rehabilitate the appellant in response to an allegation of
recent fabrication.
[299]     In our view, the Crown did not suggest that the
appellant&#146;s story in relation to advising the police of his
intention to meet with Mrs. Chan was recently fabricated.  In
addition, the conversation with Constable Riddell referred to
above is ambiguous.
[300]     In any case, the defence adduced evidence from Andrew
Fang that, before the appellant&#146;s visit with Mrs. Chan, the
appellant announced his intention to call the police first to get
permission, and that Fang saw him make that call.  In light of
this evidence, this aspect of the June 2, 1988 conversation
between the appellant and Constable Riddell added very little, if
anything, to the evidence. Moreover, the trial judge told the
jury that there was no obligation on the appellant to tell
Constable Riddell of his plans to visit Mrs. Chan.  This is not
something that could reasonably have had any impact on the
verdict.  We see no merit in this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION OF THE APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[301]      Having  reviewed and found no merit  in  each  of  the
various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant, his appeal  is
dismissed.

</pre>
    <pre>RELEASED:  APR 13 1999             &#147;Roy R. McMurtry C.J.O.&#148;
          RRM                      &#147;C.A. Osborne J.A.&#148;
                                   &#147;J.M. Labrosse J.A.&#148;
                                   &#147;Louise Charron J.A.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.: (concurring in the result)</pre>
    <pre>[302]      I  have read the reasons of majority of the  court  in
this  matter,  and while I concur in the ultimate disposition  of
the  appeal in that I too would dismiss it, I am unable to  agree
with the court&#146;s analysis of the constitutional issues.
[303]     The reasons of the court are in response to arguments
made in this case and two others that were argued at the same
time: R. v.  Sawyer &amp; Galbraith and R. v. Henderson. The
constitutionality of the common law jury secrecy rule, which I
will refer to as Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule, and of s. 649 of the
Criminal Code were raised directly in all three appeals and have
been dealt with by the court in two: Pan and Sawyer &amp; Galbraith.
In R. v. Henderson, we are all of the view that the appellant is
entitled to a new trial for other reasons.
[304]     The majority of this court in Pan and in Sawyer &amp;
Galbraith have decided that Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule should not be
changed and that s. 649 of the Code is not unconstitutional with
respect to the appellants.  The court reserves for another day a
consideration of the validity of s.649 with respect to individual
jurors who might be charged with violations of the section. For
my part, I think that the combined effect of Lord Mansfield&#146;s
rule and s.649 of the Code is to deprive the appellants in Pan
and in Sawyer &amp; Galbraith of the ability to establish an
evidentiary base for arguing that they were deprived of their
constitutional right to a trial by an impartial and independent
jury due to jury tampering or juror misconduct. However, in the
Pan appeal, I am not prepared to accept the fresh evidence
proffered because it does not address a constitutional challenge
to the integrity of the verdict under appeal.  It is directed to
the validity of a preliminary ruling made by the trial judge in
appeal.  In the case of R. v. Sawyer &amp; Galbraith, the argument
relating to the constitutional question did engage the validity
of the verdict in appeal.  For reasons I have delivered
separately, I think that it is necessary for this court to allow
that appeal and order a new trial.
[305]     Accordingly, since I do not agree with the analysis of
the constitutional issues that are common to the arguments in all
three appeals and since I rely upon my reasons for doing so in my
dissent in Sawyer &amp; Galbraith, I propose to deliver my own
analysis with respect to the constitutional issues in these
appeals.</pre>
    <pre>Overview
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  Position of the appellant</pre>
    <pre>[306]      It  is the position of the appellant Rui-Wen Pan  that
s.  649 of the Criminal Code violates his constitutional right to
a  fair  trial under the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms
(&#147;Charter&#148;).    In  addition, the appellant also  challenges  the
constitutionality  of  Lord  Mansfield&#146;s  rule,  insofar  as   it
prevents an appellant from impeaching a jury verdict on the basis
that  the  jury proceedings resulted in a miscarriage of justice.
While  his counsel referenced a number of Charter rights that  he
considered   relevant,  I  believe  that  realistically   he   is
restricted to s. 7, which guarantees him a fair trial pursuant to
the  principles of fundamental justice as particularized  by  his
rights  under s. 11(d) and s. 11(f) to a fair and public  hearing
by  an impartial tribunal, in this case, a court comprised  of  a
judge  and jury.  In the appellant&#146;s submission, s. 649 and  Lord
Mansfield&#146;s  rule  effectively undermine his  ability  to  access
evidence  which  was  both  relevant  and  essential  to  a  just
resolution  of  his  motion for a stay of  proceedings  based  on
events  which  resulted in a mistrial at the  conclusion  of  his
second  trial.   More specifically, the appellant  asserts  that,
before Watt J. at his third trial and in this appeal, he was  and
is denied the ability:
          (a)   to  establish  what infractions  and/or
          improprieties  actually  occurred  among  the
          jurors during the course of the second trial,
          including the jury deliberations; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)    to   fully  review  the  exercise   of
          discretion  in  declaring a mistrial  by  the
          trial judge presiding at the second trial.</pre>
    <pre>[307]      The  appellant submits that if either the  purpose  or
effect  of  legislation is to violate the Charter  rights  of  an
accused person, then that legislation is unconstitutional and  of
no  force  or  effect. Specifically, he maintains that  both  the
purpose  and effect of s. 649 of the Code is to erect an absolute
barrier  which  prevents  any  challenge  to  a  jury&#146;s  verdict,
including: an allegation that the accused has been denied a  fair
hearing in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice;
an  allegation that there has been a miscarriage of  justice;  an
allegation  of  juror  misconduct,  juror  tampering,  or   juror
incompetence;  or,  as in the case at bar, an allegation  that  a
verdict was reached by the jury, but was not duly recorded by the
court.
[308]     The appellant further submits that s. 649, on its face,
and as interpreted by Watt J. in the case in appeal, not only
prevented the appellant from presenting the evidence which was
essential in order to establish an abuse of process and/or a
breach of his Charter rights; it also prevented him from
establishing that O'Connell J., the trial judge at the second
trial of the appellant, erred in failing to make necessary
inquiries of the jury.  Those inquiries, the appellant submits,
would have revealed:  (a) that there was indeed a verdict of
acquittal; and/or (b) that juror number one had engaged in such
serious misconduct during the course of the trial that she was
not fit to continue and had to be discharged, with the inevitable
result that the eleven remaining jurors would have delivered an
unanimous verdict of acquittal.  In the event of either (a) or
(b), there was clear and compelling evidence available to the
appellant, which would have established that he was entitled to
an acquittal at the second trial, with the result that the third
trial was unnecessary, and indeed a nullity.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Position of the Crown</pre>
    <pre>[309]     For its part, the Crown is opposed to any relaxation of
the jury secrecy rules, and seeks to uphold the constitutionality
of  Lord  Mansfield's rule and s. 649 of the Code.    It  submits
that  the  jury  secrecy rules, which operate within  Canada  and
other common law jurisdictions, are steeped in a rich common  law
history.  The courts have, for centuries, recognized the sanctity
of  jury  deliberations and the need to ensure  that  discussions
within  the  jury  room remain confidential.  Courts  in  various
jurisdictions have consistently refused to examine  the  internal
workings of juries engaged in the deliberative process.  This  is
not  a  product  of  blind  adherence to tradition,  but  rather,
reflects  a  continued  recognition  that  the  secrecy  of  jury
deliberations  is  necessary to ensure the proper  and  effective
operation  of the jury trial system.  Specifically, and  I  quote
from  the  Crown&#146;s Factum on the Constitutional Validity  of  the
&#145;Jury Secrecy&#146; Rules:
          &#133;  the jury secrecy rules, imposed by statute
          and  common law, are entirely in accord  with
          the  principles of fundamental justice.  Jury
          secrecy   is,   itself,   a   principle    of
          fundamental justice, necessary to ensure  the
          proper   function  of  the  criminal  justice
          system. [Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[310]     The Crown further submits that the modern Canadian rule
consists of two discrete, yet related, components, both of  which
are  rooted  in common law tradition.  These are: 1) a  statutory
prohibition against the disclosure of jury deliberations; and  2)
an exclusionary rule, which operates at common law, and prohibits
appellate  courts  from receiving evidence of jury  deliberations
for the purpose of impeaching a verdict.</pre>
    <pre>          i)   Statutory prohibition</pre>
    <pre>[311]     The statutory prohibition is contained in s. 649 of the
Code and provides that every member of a jury who &quot;discloses  any
information relating to the proceedings of the jury when  it  was
absent from the courtroom that was not subsequently disclosed  in
open  court  is  guilty  of  an  offence  punishable  on  summary
conviction&quot;.   The provision permits of one broad exception.   No
offence  is committed where the disclosure is made in the context
of an investigation into, or criminal proceedings relating to, an
alleged  offence  under  s.  139(2)  (obstructing  justice).   In
enacting  this  provision,  the  Crown  submits,  Parliament  was
clearly   concerned  with  maintaining  the  integrity   of   the
administration of justice.
[312]     In the further submission of the Crown, the effect of
s. 649 is to codify a long standing rule of practice.  The courts
have insisted that what passes in the jury room during the
discussion by the jury of what their verdict should be is treated
as private and confidential.  Historically, this principle was
sometimes described as a &quot;rule of conduct&quot;, rather than a &quot;rule
of law&quot;.  Nonetheless, breaches of jury secrecy would invariably
attract strong judicial condemnation.  Such conduct was seen as
&quot;improper, deplorable and dangerous.&quot;  Moreover, while s. 649
(previously s. 576.2) was not enacted until 1972, the Crown
submits that it was generally accepted prior to that time that a
juror who disclosed the content of deliberations could be
prosecuted for contempt of court.  The Crown cites Ellis v.
Deheer, [1922] 2 K.B. 113 (C.A.); R. v. Dyson (1971), 5 C.C.C.
(2d) 401 (Ont. H.C.J.); R. v. Papineau (1980), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 72
(Que. S.C.); Hegherty v. National Mutual Life Association (1892),
8 W.N. (N.S.W.) 122 at 123; and R. v. Armstrong, [1922] 2 K.B.
555; [1922] All E.R. 153 (C.C.A.) at K.B. 569.</pre>
    <pre>          ii)  Exclusionary rule</pre>
    <pre>[313]      It is common ground that the origin of the common  law
exclusionary rule was the judgment of Lord Mansfield in Vaise  v.
Delaval  (1785), 1 Term. Rep. 11, 99 E.R. 944 (K.B.) in which  he
ruled that the court cannot receive an affidavit from a juror  as
to  the  nature  of a jury&#146;s deliberation.  The  reason  for  its
rejection  was  the policy consideration that the juror  who  had
himself engaged in wrongful conduct during the jury deliberations
was  untrustworthy.  In that case, the members of  the  jury  had
decided the case by tossing a coin.  However, Lord Mansfield  did
leave  open  the ability of the person impeaching the verdict  to
lead  evidence  from a person who had derived his knowledge  from
some other source, such as one who saw the proceedings through  a
window.   In  this jurisdiction the rule has, if  anything,  been
narrowed to prohibit the receipt of any evidence relative to jury
deliberations.
[314]     The Crown submits that s. 649 of the Code, whatever its
immediate origins, was a codification of Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule of
exclusion for purposes of jury impeachment. I have a great deal
of difficulty in accepting this proposition.  Accordingly, before
determining whether either provision is consistent with the
principles of fundamental justice, I propose to examine in detail
what little has been said about the rationale for the creation of
this discrete criminal offence so late in our judicial history.
In order to do so I must first outline the origin of and the
rationale for Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule.
     </pre>
    <pre>     The Jury Secrecy Rules
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  The development of the common law jury secrecy rule</pre>
    <pre>[315]     The requirement that juries conduct their deliberations
in  secret  is as old as the jury itself.  Although  the  precise
origins  of the jury are unknown, it probably began as a form  of
inquest after the Norman Conquest in 1066 and soon came to occupy
a  central  role  in  the administration  of  justice.  From  the
beginning,  secrecy  was  an  essential  aspect  of  the   jury&#146;s
function.  As early as the 13th century, jurors were required  to
swear  an  oath  requiring, inter alia, that they  deliberate  in
secret.   A  juror found guilty of violating his  oath  could  be
stripped of his property, jailed for a year and deprived  of  the
benefit  of the terrae legem.  There was, however, no requirement
that  this secrecy be maintained after the completion of the jury
deliberations: R. v. Sherratt (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 202-3
(S.C.C.);  R. v. Papineau (1980), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 72 at  78  (Que.
S.C.);  Holdsworthy, History of the English Law (Boston:  Little,
Brown &amp; Co., 1926), Vols. I, IV and IX.
[316]     As its use evolved, the jury came to be employed as an
alternative to the traditional modes of proof by ordeal or battle
and represented the beginnings of a system of reasoned inquiry.
However, attempts to corrupt or influence juries, by all parties,
became commonplace.  The Crown responded in 1487 by granting
formal control of juries to the Court of Criminal Equity, also
known as the Star Chamber. This allowed for the punishment of
anyone interfering with juries, and the fining and imprisonment
of jurors who violated their oaths.  See Pro Camera Stellata, 3
Henry VII, c. 1.
[317]     With the dissolution of the Star Chamber by 16 Car. I,
c. 10, the power to enforce the jurors&#146; oath returned to the
courts of common law.  It was considered violative of the oath to
communicate with others during the course of deliberations, to
receive inducement or payment from a party, to consider evidence
not tendered during the course of proceedings, and to settle the
verdict by vote or by chance: see R. v. Lord Fitz-Water (1687), 2
Lev. 139, 83 E.R. 487; Philips v. Fowler (1735), Barnes 441, 94
E.R. 994; Fry v. Hordy (1689), 2 Jon. 83, 84 E.R. 1158.  When
such circumstances arose, the aggrieved party could make an
application to the court to have the verdict reversed or
nullified.  Affidavits sworn by members of the jury were
generally admissible in such proceedings.  Verdicts could be
successfully impeached and the responsible jurors punished: see
Dent v. Hertford (1696), 91 E.R. 546 (K.B.).
[318]     The development in the eighteenth century of a
prohibition against self-impeaching testimony effectively ended
this procedure.  In Vaise v. Delaval, supra, Lord Mansfield held
that because the violation of their oath was a ?high
misdemeanour?, the affidavits of the jurors themselves were
inadmissible, as they were self-incriminatory.  Following Vaise
v. Delaval, a verdict could still be successfully challenged if
the evidence of juror misconduct came from a non-juror: see R. v.
Dyson (1971), 5 C.C.C. (2d) 401 (Ont. H.C.J.).
     
</pre>
    <pre>[319]     Although  the restrictions on self-impeachment have all
but  disappeared, the rule in Vaise v. Delaval has had a  lasting
effect.   Over  the course of the 19th and early 20th  centuries,
various rationales for its continuation have been offered.   Some
of  the more common justifications advanced include the desire to
preserve  the finality of the verdict, the belief that  the  rule
serves to protect the candour required in the jury room, the need
to  avoid providing an incentive for jurors or parties to seek to
violate  the secrecy rule, the preservation of public  confidence
in  the  system,  the  protection of jurors from  undue  external
influence,  and  the  prevention of undue influence  upon  future
juries:  see  Straker v. Graham (1839), 4 M. &amp;  W.  721  (Exch.);
Quinlane  v.  Murname  (1885), 18 L.R. Ir. 53  (C.A.);  Ellis  v.
Deheer,  [1922] 2 K.B. 113 (C.A.); R. v. Thompson, [1962]  1  All
E.R.  65  (C.C.A.);  R. v. Hood, [1968] 2  All  E.R.  56  (C.A.);
Attorney-General  v.  New  Statesman,  [1980]  1  All  E.R.   644
(Q.B.D.); R. v. Wilson (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 568 (Man. C.A.).

    <pre>     (b)  Section 649 and its origins</pre>
    <pre>[320]      As indicated above, it is the Crown&#146;s contention  that
the  provisions  of  the Criminal Code are simply  the  statutory
enactment of the common law rule.  The Code provides as follows:
          649. Every  member of a jury who, except  for
               the purposes of
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  an  investigation of an alleged  offence
               under subsection 139(2) in relation to a
               juror, or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  giving  evidence in criminal proceedings
               in relation to such an offence,
          </pre>
    <pre>          discloses  any  information relating  to  the
          proceedings  of the jury when it  was  absent
          from  the courtroom that was not subsequently
          disclosed  in  open court  is  guilty  of  an
          offence punishable on summary conviction.
          </pre>
    <pre>          139. (2)  Every one who wilfully attempts  in
          any  manner other than a manner described  in
          subsection (1) to obstruct, pervert or defeat
          the  course  of  justice  is  guilty  of   an
          indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
          for a term not exceeding ten years.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (3)   Without  restricting the generality  of
          subsection  (2),  every one shall  be  deemed
          wilfully  to attempt to obstruct, pervert  or
          defeat  the  course  of  justice  who  in   a
          judicial proceeding, existing or proposed,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  dissuades  or  attempts  to  dissuade  a
               person  by  threats,  bribes  or   other
               corrupt means from giving evidence;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  influences  or attempts to influence  by
               threats, bribes or other corrupt means a
               person in his conduct as a juror; or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  accepts or obtains, agrees to accept  or
               attempts  to  obtain a  bribe  or  other
               corrupt  consideration to  abstain  from
               giving  evidence, or to  do  or  refrain
               from doing anything as a juror.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[321]     Subsection (1) of s. 139 relates to sureties and is not
relevant  to  this  discussion.   I  should  also  add  that  the
amendment enacted by S.C. 1998, c. 9, s. 7 and not yet  in  force
does not affect the analysis herein.  That amendment would expand
the operation of s. 649 from jurors alone so as to include &#147;every
person  providing  technical, personal, interpretative  or  other
support services to a juror with a physical disability.&#148;
[322]     Any attempt to understand the origins and aims of s.
649 is hindered by the paucity of information available.  A
review of Hansard discloses little of the policy goals behind the
amendment to the Code creating this offence.  Although the Law
Reform Commission of Canada did consider the section on at least
three occasions, its discussions were brief, and as will be seen
below, not particularly helpful.  Finally, much of the case law
and secondary literature does little more than repeat
uncritically the conventional justification that the Code
amendment is but the statutory codification of the common law
rule against the introduction of evidence of jury deliberations
to impeach a verdict.
[323]     However, as is apparent both in the facta and oral
arguments in the present appeals, s. 649 cannot be said to be
simply a codification of the common law rule, assuming that there
is one:  the former makes disclosure by jurors an offence,
whereas the latter is a rule regarding the admissibility of
evidence.  A close reading of several Canadian cases relied on by
the Crown reveals this distinction, as well as the confusion the
failure to recognize this distinction has created in analyzing
the putative goals of the section and the common law rule.
Notwithstanding some assertions to the contrary, the s. 649
offence knows no previous common law precedent, as prosecutions
for contempt of court are rare. Accordingly, it is difficult to
sustain the proposition that the policy goals in favour of the
common law rule, such as finality and protection of jurors, are
those which underlie the statutory enactment.  Rather, what
little evidence there is suggests that the aim of the provision
was to prevent the disclosure of jury deliberations to the press,
rather than creating an impediment to impeaching a jury&#146;s
verdict.</pre>
    <pre>          i)   Hansard</pre>
    <pre>[324]      The  &#147;jury  secrecy&#148; amendment was  but  one  of  many
amendments  made  to  the  Criminal  Code  by  the  Criminal  Law
Amendment  Act, 1972 (Bill C-2).  It was enacted as s.  576.2  of
the  Criminal Code.  Very little debate occurred on the  aims  or
genesis  of  this provision. Upon introduction of the  Bill,  the
Honourable Otto Lang, Solicitor-General,  stated:
          We  also propose to impose a clear duty under
          the  criminal law upon jurors to hold  secret
          the  content  of  their deliberations.   Such
          disclosure    by   jurors   has    in    some
          jurisdictions &#150; far less in ours   -  brought
          the  system  into  serious  question  and  we
          propose to move against it in this fashion.</pre>
    <pre>See: House of Commons Debates (April 27, 1972) at p. 1700.</pre>
    <pre>[325]       During  the  debate  on  second  reading,  only   one
opposition   speaker,   Robert  McCleave  (Halifax-East   Hants),
commented on this provision:
          Clause  49  deals  with  disclosure  of  jury
          proceedings.  I welcome it in the sense  that
          it  prevents jurors from being asked  by  the
          press  during or after the trial to  disclose
          what  is  going  on  in  what  should  be   a
          confidential forum, the jury room.  I  wonder
          whether  this provision does not go too  far.
          Perhaps  there should be a limit that  within
          five or ten years of a trial a juror could be
          allowed to report a reminiscence of what took
          place.   For  historical purposes perhaps  it
          would  be  useful not to impose any  penalty,
          but  the  imposition of a  time  limit  would
          remove   any  difficulties  which  might   be
          created by press sensationalism.</pre>
    <pre>See: House of Common Debates, (April 27, 1972) at p. 1702.</pre>
    <pre>[326]      Similarly,  the  provision  attracted  the  barest  of
comment  upon  its  being  voted upon,  unanimously  and  without
amendment, during its consideration by the Standing Committee  on
Justice  and Legal Affairs.  Appearing before the committee,  the
Solicitor General described the provision as follows:
          [The  amendments] also make it an offence  to
          publish  proceedings within a  jury  so  that
          those  matters remain a secret for the better
          functioning of jurors. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>See:  Minutes of Proceedings and Evidence of the Standing
Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs, (May 11, 1972) at 7:26.</pre>
    <pre>[327]      A member of the opposition who served on the Committee
questioned the Solicitor General as follows:
          Mr.  Gibson:   Proposed  section  576.2&#133;deals
          with  disclosure.   This is  a  question  for
          clarification.   Is there  a  time  limit  on
          this? I am thinking of somebody reviewing  it
          some years later.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Mr. Lang: No there is no time limit as the
          proposed section now stands.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Mr. Gibson: Should we not have a time limit of
          some kind?
          </pre>
    <pre>          Mr. Lang: We have given consideration to that.
          The problem really is that it makes it sound as
          though at a certain point in time there is a
          licence to make it public and I can see jurors
          just waiting for that time to do their memoirs.  I
          am not sure that there is any time at which it
          become desirable.</pre>
    <pre>See: Ibid., at 7:27.</pre>
    <pre>[328]      In  the  end  result, Hansard  does  not  serve  as  a
particularly useful interpretative or historical tool.  No  sense
is  given of the policy goals or political pressures that led  to
the  enactment.  At best, the Minister&#146;s remarks may be taken  as
suggesting   that  the  intention  is  to  somehow  protect   the
reputation  of  the  administration of justice  by  ensuring  the
secrecy  of  jurors&#146; deliberations.  In addition, the  Minister&#146;s
remarks before the Standing Committee suggest that preventing the
publishing of jurors&#146; deliberations is a goal of the legislation,
despite  the  fact that the amendment does not apply  to  persons
other  than  jurors  and  does not in fact  prevent  publication.
Nothing in the Minister&#146;s remarks or responses suggests that  the
rule  is a codification of the common law rule, or that the  goal
is  to foster the finality of jury verdicts or the protection  of
jurors, as is often contended. No mention at all is made  of  the
possibility  that  such  an  absolute  rule  might  prevent   the
rectification of a miscarriage of justice.  Outside of the  brief
and  unhelpful reference by the Solicitor General to  disclosures
in  other jurisdictions, there is no attempt to justify  the  new
offence  on  the  basis  of present need. Finally,  there  is  no
acknowledgement  of the more political origins suggested  by  the
Law Reform Commission, infra.</pre>
    <pre>          ii)  Law Reform Commission of Canada</pre>
    <pre>[329]      The Law Reform Commission (&#147;LRC&#148;) considered s.  576.2
on  at  least  three  occasions during its studies  of  the  jury
system.   The LRC&#146;s first discussion of this section is found  in
Andrew Doob, &#147;Canadian Jurors&#146; View of the Criminal Jury Trial: A
Report to the Law Reform Commission of Canada&#148;, in Studies on the
Jury (Ottawa: Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1979).  In aid  of
its  efforts  to make recommendations regarding the  jury  system
generally, the LRC commissioned a series of statistical  surveys,
one  of  which proposed to survey prospective and past jurors  on
their  opinions  and  experiences of the jury  system.  Prior  to
conducting the survey, the researchers sought an opinion from the
Department of Justice as to whether such research would run afoul
of s. 576.2; they were told that it did not contravene the spirit
of the section. The report described the section at p. 37:
          The  section was introduced into the Code  in
          1972  in response to a general concern  which
          was triggered by a particular incident in the
          Province of Quebec.  On August 10, 1969,  the
          jury  in R. v. Gagnon [unreported], after  67
          hours of deliberation informed the court that
          it   could  not  reach  a  verdict  and   was
          discharged.  Thirteen days later and ten days
          before  the date set for selection of  a  new
          jury,  an article appeared in La Presse.   It
          was  based on interviews with one or more  of
          the  jurors and hinted that political motives
          had    been    involved   in    the    jury&#146;s
          deliberations.   As  a  consequence  of   the
          resulting  furor,  the  Department   of   the
          Attorney-General  of Quebec  asked  that  the
          general  problem highlighted  by  the  Gagnon
          incident be considered by the next meeting of
          the  Uniformity Conference (a regular  annual
          meeting  of  the Federal Deputy  Minister  of
          Justice and his provincial counterparts).  At
          that  meeting the Commissioners approved  the
          following resolution:  &#147;That jurors should be
          prohibited  from discussing what went  on  in
          the  jury room during the course of a trial.&#148;
          This recommendation became law as s. 576.2 of
          the   Criminal  Code  in  the  Criminal   Law
          Amendment Act, 1972, c. 13.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Both the origin of section 576.2 and the
          previous   common  law  on  jury   disclosure
          indicated  that the object of the section  is
          to   maintain  the  high  repute  and  public
          confidence  in  jury  trials.   Its   further
          object  is to maintain the efficiency of  the
          jury  by  assuring  each  juror  of  absolute
          privilege  and strict confidence in  relation
          to  statements and decisions made  about  the
          case  at hand in the jury room.  This it does
          by  preventing public revelation of  specific
          grounds  and  reasons for  reaching  (or  not
          reaching)  a  decision in a particular  case.
          It clearly was not intended to interfere with
          collection   of  the  general  opinions   and
          impressions   of  jurors  on  jury   service.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[330]     No authority is cited for the opinions expressed above.
Taken at face value, the report would certainly suggest that  the
impetus  for the provision was the desire to limit press coverage
of jury deliberations, rather than the usual goals put forward in
support  of  the common law rule.  However, the portions  I  have
emphasized are totally inconsistent with the language of s. 576.2
which  makes  no  reference to &#147;public  revelations  of  specific
grounds  and  reasons&#148;.   If the impugned  section  of  the  Code
contained such restrictions to the actus reus of the offence,  it
would be less vulnerable to constitutional scrutiny.
[331]     In 1980, one year after the publication of the above,
the LRC published its working paper The Jury in Criminal Trials
(Working Paper 27), (Ottawa: Law Reform Commission of Canada,
1980), which was intended to serve as a discussion paper in aid
of refining its final recommendations on the jury system. Two of
its proposed recommendations touched directly on the 1972
amendment.  Recommendation 23, &#147;Secrecy of Jury Deliberations&#148;,
proposed that the 1972 provision remain in place, with two new
exceptions added.  The first would have allowed certain limited
researches to be conducted.  The second applied when &#147;the
information was disclosed for the purpose of &#133; inquiring into the
validity of a verdict provided for in [Recommendation 27]
(Impeachment of the Verdict)&#148;; ibid., at pp. 142-3.
[332]     Recommendation 27 arose from the acknowledgement that
the operation of s. 576.2 might work an injustice against an
accused. The LRC  proposed at p. 149 that the Code be amended by
the addition of the following provisions:
          27.1     The validity of a verdict may not be
          inquired  into except upon an application  to
          the Minister of Justice.
          </pre>
    <pre>          27.2      The Minster of Justice may, upon an
          application by or on behalf of a  person  who
          has  been  convicted by a jury, order  a  new
          trial,  if  after inquiring he  is  satisfied
          that some irregularity or misconduct occurred
          during the jury deliberations which indicates
          that the verdict did not reflect the judgment
          of all the jurors.
          </pre>
    <pre>          27.3     Upon an inquiry into the validity of
          a  verdict,  a  juror may not  give  evidence
          concerning the effect of anything upon his or
          any   other  juror&#146;s  mind  or  emotions   as
          influencing him to assent or dissent from the
          verdict,  or concerning his mental  processes
          in   connection  therewith.   Nor   may   his
          affidavit or evidence of any statement by him
          indicating an effect of this kind be received
          for these purposes.</pre>
    <pre>[333]      It  bears  noting  that the  scope  of  this  proposed
exception is quite narrow.  Although its drafters indicated  that
it  was put forward in the spirit of the Federal Rule of Evidence
606(b)  in the United States (of which more is said later),  this
suggested Canadian exception only operates where the &#147;verdict did
not  reflect  the  judgment of all the jurors&#148;. Unlike  its  U.S.
counterpart,  it would not operate where there was an  allegation
of   either  &#147;extraneous  prejudicial  information&#148;  or  &#147;outside
influence&#148;.  In addition, the commentary does not recognize  that
the  U.S.  rule  is  an  evidentiary provision,  not  an  offence
creating  provision.    Finally,  unlike  the  U.S.  rule,   this
recommendation  requires  the  intervention  of  the  Crown;  the
evidence appears to be admissible only for the purposes  of  this
ministerial inquiry.
[334]     The commentary following Recommendation 27 states at p.
149 that Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule &#147;now has legislative sanction in
Canada&#148; as a result of s. 576.2. It goes on to state that the
provision protects two important interests: the finality of jury
verdicts and the protection of jurors from harassment.  With
respect to this second goal, it says at p. 150:
          Jurors, having given their verdict, should be
          able  to  resume their day-to-day  activities
          free from the anxiety and other concerns that
          would  be  caused  if they  were  pursued  by
          persistent investigators out to discover some
          error  in  the  manner in which they  reached
          their verdict.</pre>
    <pre>[335]      However,  the  LRC  provides no  authority  for  these
statements.   As  pointed out above, it is  hard  to  accept  the
contention  that  the  Code sanction flows from  the  common  law
provision  when  the  common  law provision  did  not  create  an
offence.   Moreover, it is difficult to see  how  either  of  the
stated goals &#150; finality and juror protection &#150; is accomplished by
subjecting &#147;singing&#148; jurors to criminal sanction.  These are  the
goals  most  often  touted for the common law rule,  but  do  not
appear to be well served by s. 576.2.  Some other rationale  must
underlie this Code provision.
[336]     In any event, the 1980 &#147;Impeachment of the Verdict&#148;
recommendations of the LRC working paper did not survive the
consultation period.  In 1982, the LRC released its final
recommendations on criminal juries in its Report on the Jury
(Ottawa: Law Reform Commission of Canada, 1982). With respect to
s. 576.2, the Report actually recommended widening the scope of
the existing exception, not in order to provide opportunities to
impeach a jury verdict, but in order to more effectively
prosecute errant jurors.  As then (and currently) enacted, s.
576.2 excepted &#147;(a) an investigation of an alleged offence under
subsection 139(2) [obstructing justice]  in relation to a juror,
or (b) giving evidence in criminal proceedings in relation to
such an offence&#148;.  The 1982 proposal would have broadened this to
read &#147;(a) an investigation of an alleged offence under this Act
in relation to a juror acting in his capacity as juror, or (b)
giving evidence in criminal proceedings in relation to such an
offence&#148;: see p. 82.  No rationale was offered for this
recommendation.
[337]     As for the recommendation regarding the impeachment of
jury verdicts, it was simply dropped from the final 1982 report.
No policy or legal impediment was advanced by way of explanation.
Rather, the report simply stated at p. 2 that this and other
recommendations were deleted  &#147;since reforms or federal
legislative enactment did not seem urgent (or even necessary) in
these areas.&#148;
[338]     Taken together, these LRC reports do little to explain
the origins or aims of the statutory rule, other than providing
an anecdotal account of the events said to have led  to its
enactment. Although the 1980 working paper did, in a limited
fashion, attempt to address some of the inadequacies of the
section, none of the reports contain a satisfactory discussion of
why such a rule was required at all.  Rather, the LRC seems to
have taken for granted the argument that the Code provision is
simply the statutory enactment of the common law rule.</pre>
    <pre>          iii)      Relationship between the common law rule and
s. 649</pre>
    <pre>[339]      The  Crown  has urged upon this Court the  proposition
that  s.  649  is  a  clear affirmation  of  the  policy  grounds
underlying the common law rule and has been interpreted to expand
the common law. However, a review of a few cases, relied upon  by
the   Crown,  suffices  to  demonstrate  that  courts  have   not
critically  appraised the section or struggled  to  articulate  a
coherent policy for its existence.</pre>
    <pre>[340]      In  the early case of R. v. Perras (1974),  18  C.C.C.
(2d) 47 (Sask. C.A.), a jury had retired to consider a verdict in
a  murder  trial.  A sheriff&#146;s officer standing outside the  jury
room  heard  a  conversation between the jurors,  in  which  they
agreed  to  arrive  at  a verdict by majority  vote.   Some  five
minutes later, the jury rendered a verdict of guilty.  On appeal,
the  defendant attempted to admit the sheriff officer&#146;s affidavit
in order to impugn the verdict below.
[341]     The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal applied Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule, refused to consider the affidavit, and
dismissed the appeal.  At p. 50, Culliton C.J.S. stated that &#147;it
is a long-established rule of practice, based upon public policy,
that the Court should not inquire, by taking evidence either oral
or by affidavit, from a juror both with respect to what occurred
in the jury room or the jury-box while the jury were considering
the verdict&#148;.  To this point, the holding is not controversial.
But Culliton C.J.S. then goes on to state at pp. 50-51:
          If  there was ever any doubt of the principle
          that the Court should not accept the evidence
          of jurors of what transpired in the jury room
          or  in  the  jury box when considering  their
          verdict  in criminal cases, to impeach  their
          verdict,  that  doubt  was  removed  by   the
          enactment of s. 576.2 of the Criminal Code&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[342]      The court went on to hold that it is as impermissible,
under  both  the  common law rule and the  Code,  to  accept  the
evidence  of  a stranger &#150; such as this sheriff &#150;  as  it  is  to
accept the evidence of a member of a jury. More recently, similar
reasoning was applied in R v. Gumbly (1996), 112 C.C.C.  (3d)  61
at  72-74 (N.S. C.A.), and in the ruling on the mistrial by  Watt
J. in this appeal.
[343]     However, in so holding, the Court in Perras appears to
have confused the common law rule with the statutory provision.
Clearly the operation of the common law rule would preclude
receiving evidence from the jurors; it might even be extended to
cover the evidence of a stranger, as it did here, if the same
policy considerations applied.  But it is difficult to find
either justification or legislative sanction of this result in s.
649.  That provision does not, by its criminal sanction, do much,
if anything, to help guarantee finality or the protection of
jurors, the putative goals of the common law rule.  Moreover, the
section does not, on its face, operate to prevent the disclosure
of jury deliberations by third parties, as only jurors may be
penalized.    In its application of the common law rule, the
court simply assumed that the Code provision has the same goals.
[344]     Another example of the conceptual uncertainty regarding
the purpose of s. 649 is found in R. v. Papineau, supra.  There,
it was alleged that a lawyer in the employ of defence counsel
had, during the course of the trial, approached a member of the
jury.  Upon hearing of this incident, the trial judge discharged
that juror.  The lawyer approached the discharged juror a second
time, and asked her what she thought the opinion of the other
jurors might be; the juror declined to give an answer.  The
lawyer was then cited for contempt of court, and convicted for
his second, post-discharge, conversation with the juror.
[345]     In his reasons, Hugesson A.C.J.Q. reviewed the law of
contempt, and found that it was settled that any attempt to
influence a juror constituted contempt of court.  The fact that
the questioning took place after the juror had been discharged
did not avail the defendant, as the law of contempt was equally
clear that interference with a juror after a verdict had been
rendered could constitute contempt on the part of the interfering
party.  Without elaboration, Hugesson A.C.J.Q. then stated that
the common law rule of jury secrecy operated so as to prohibit
any disclosure of jury deliberations, and that this rule had been
codified by s. 576.2, now s. 649.
[346]     This merger of the law of contempt and the rules
regarding jury secrecy only further muddies the waters.  On the
facts here, the law of contempt sufficed to ground the lawyer&#146;s
conviction.  As stated by Hugesson A.C.J.Q. at p. 79, the aim of
the contempt powers is to protect the administration of justice
by preventing the interference with a juror by any person.  The
contemnor, not the juror, is to bear the penalty.  This is
altogether a different aim from that of s. 649 of the Code,
which, whatever its purpose might be, has the effect of
penalizing the talkative juror, rather than the recipient of the
juror&#146;s communication.  Given that, in the circumstances, the
juror did not convey any information to the lawyer, the reference
to s. 649 is unhelpful, particularly so, given that the case was
decided on the basis of the law of contempt.  This would suggest
caution in accepting the Crown&#146;s assertions that this case
illustrates the wide ambit of either Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule or s.
649.
[347]     R. v. Mercier (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 377 (Que. C.A.),
also relied upon by the Crown, did not turn on either the common
law rule or the provisions of the Code.  There, a new trial was
ordered after a Crown Attorney was found to have entered the jury
room and removed some words placed on a chalkboard by the jury
foreman.  The Crown asserts that Mercier illustrates the courts&#146;
routine exclusion of communications between the jury and third
parties pursuant to the operation of the common law.  However,
the holding turned on the fact that an officer of the Crown had
breached the Code jury sequestration provisions in an attempt to
influence the jury.
[348]     Finally, as in Perras, the decision in R. v. Wilson
(1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 568 (Man. C.A.), leave to appeal refused
(1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) vi (note) (S.C.C.) equates the purpose of
the common law with the Code provision, without engaging in any
discussion or observation of the differences between them.
There, the facts fell clearly within Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule: the
appellant sought to call the jury foreman in order to impugn the
verdict below, alleging that the jury had received information
from a police officer regarding the appellant&#146;s co-conspirator
and the appellant&#146;s right to a fair trial was thereby breached.
The court, after reviewing the common law rule, held the evidence
inadmissible and dismissed the appeal, but not before echoing at
p. 574 the assertion in Perras, supra, that the Code provision is
simply the codification of the common law rule.  As in the cases
cited above, there is no detailed examination of the provision&#146;s
origins or purpose.
[349]     The above-cited cases illustrate the uncertainty
surrounding the purpose of the Code provision.  What guidance, if
any, might be found in pre-1972 cases?  R. v. Dyson, supra,
provides a helpful summary of the various policy goals underlying
the common law evidentiary rule preventing a juror from
impeaching a verdict; these are said to include the finality of
verdicts; the protection of jurors&#146; privacy; and the assurance of
frankness during deliberations.  However, Haines J.&#146;s summary
also reveals a separate, but parallel common law rule: namely,
that jury deliberation is to remain secret, both during and after
trial.  After detailing the evolution and aims of the rule
against verdict impeachment at p. 407,  Haines J. explicitly
suggests that, independent of Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule, there is a
line of common law authority that jurors shall not divulge the
content of their deliberations:
          The  foregoing  indicates the  rationale  and
          wide  acceptance of the rule that  a  juror&#146;s
          evidence will not be accepted to impeach  his
          verdict.  It is clearly the policy of the law
          that  jury  deliberations should be conducted
          in  secret  and  should remain  secret.   The
          first  is  accomplished by  sequestering  the
          jury  in a private room and instructing  them
          directly  that  they are not to  discuss  the
          case with outsiders while deliberating.   The
          second  part,  however,  is  attempted   only
          indirectly  by  the  exclusionary  rules   of
          evidence.   By  providing  no  use  for   the
          information, it is hoped that the  temptation
          is    removed.    This   restriction,   while
          effective  in  Court,  is  of  no  value   in
          preventing  publicity through  the  press  or
          otherwise. Surely, if it is deemed  important
          that  the  internal processes of  a  jury  in
          arriving  at  a verdict be kept  secret,  the
          Court   should  instruct  them  so  directly&#133;
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[350]     Haines J. goes on to state that there is authority that
divulging  information  to the press may constitute  contempt  of
court.  At p. 410 he concludes:
          In my respectful opinion the Supreme Court of
          Ontario has the inherent power to protect its
          jury  system and the parties to a jury trial.
          Gross  breaches of the obligation to preserve
          secrecy might be treated as contempt of court
          especially if the Judge in a particular  case
          has  expressly  told the jury they  must  not
          make  disclosure.  In my view, this power  to
          punish  for contempt extends not only to  the
          jury,  but  also to the person who presses  a
          juror to make disclosure.</pre>
    <pre>[351]      Dyson  seems to indicate that there is  a  common  law
rule,  parallel to but distinct from Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule,  that
is analogous to the current Code provision.  However, despite the
conclusion  reached  by Haines J., it is not  certain  that  this
power was actively used.  At p. 408, after discussing the case R.
v.  Armstrong, [1922] 2 K.B. 555, in which a juror  had  divulged
details  of  the  jury  deliberations to  the  press,  Haines  J.
indicated  that  &#147;there do not seem to be any instances  where  a
juryman  has been found in contempt for such actions but  if  the
jury  is explicitly instructed by the Court not to discuss  their
deliberations,  there  seems no reason  why  this  would  not  be
applicable&#148;.
[352]     Accordingly, it is difficult to sustain the contention
that the Code is but the codification of this common law
sanction.   That there is no common law contempt power analogous
to this provision or its U.K. counterpart is the conclusion
reached by Enid Campbell in her article &#147;Jury Secrecy and
Impeachment of Jury Verdicts &#150; Part I&#148; (1985), 9 Crim. L. J. 132.
She indicates that in spite of Dyson, Armstrong, and a few other
similar holdings, the preponderance of U.K. and U.S. authority is
that this &#147;rule&#148; is a convention, or a rule of conduct, rather
than a rule of law. Indeed, &#147;the general rule seems to be that a
juror who voluntarily discloses information about what transpired
in the jury room cannot be adjudged guilty of criminal contempt
or any other offence, unless of course, such conduct has been
expressly prohibited by statute&#148; (p. 134).
[353]     A similar conclusion was reached by the Queen&#146;s Bench
Division in Attorney General v. New Statesman, [1980] 1 All E.R.
645.  There, a newspaper had published a report of two interviews
it had with a juror who had participated in a notorious trial
involving political personages.  The Attorney General applied for
an order that the newspaper was in contempt.  The court declined
to so find.  In reviewing the caselaw, Lord Widgery C.J.
concluded at p. 647 that
          </pre>
    <pre>          [a]lthough  the  publication  of  such  juror
          disclosures has in the past been deplored  by
          judges, no proceedings for contempt have ever
          been  taken  against them.   Accordingly,  if
          this court were to condemn the article in the
          New  Statesman as contempt, the effect  would
          be  to extend the law of contempt and thereby
          to  create  a new offence, which is something
          Parliament alone ought to do.</pre>
    <pre>[354]     At pp. 649-650, Lord Widgery C.J. went on to review the
1968 Tenth Report of the Criminal Law Revision Committee (Secrecy
of  the Jury Room), which advised the Home Secretary that it  was
neither necessary nor desirable to enact any statutory provisions
to  protect  the secrecy of the jury room.  In so  advising,  the
Committee did not take the view that there was already  a  common
law obligation to protect that secrecy.
[355]     Given the above, in my view, the 1972 enactment must be
taken as a new prohibition, unrelated to the evidentiary rule and
without a common law predecessor.  As to its purpose, the
evidence is scanty, but it would appear at least partially
motivated by the desire to limit press coverage of jury
deliberations.  As with the U.K. Contempt of Court Act, 1981, the
Canadian provision appears to have followed a notorious case
involving jury disclosures to the press.</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[356]      It  is  clear that the present state  of  the  law  is
against the admissibility of evidence impugning a jury&#146;s verdict,
such as is offered in this case and in the companion cases of  R.
v.  Henderson and R. v. Sawyer and Galbraith, argued at the  same
time.  Lord  Mansfield&#146;s rule alone would, if applied,  serve  to
absolutely prevent this court from reviewing any of the proffered
evidence.    Section  649  is  used  solely  to   buttress   Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule, even though in my opinion there is very  little
relationship  between the two.   However, unless we are  prepared
to  make a change in Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule and pay less deference
to  the  sanctity of the jury room, there is no  reason  in  this
appeal  to concern ourselves with whether s. 649 of the Code  can
withstand  constitutional scrutiny.  We can leave to another  day
the question of whether this statutory provision is a justifiable
intrusion  into the rights of individual jurors.   On  the  other
hand,  if  we  decide that the courts should, in the  appropriate
circumstances,  exercise  their discretion  to  receive  evidence
capable of challenging the integrity of a verdict, then we  would
be obliged to consider whether s. 649 interferes with the ability
of  a  convicted  person to obtain access to  such  evidence  for
submission to the court.  I propose to take the latter course.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  Should Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule be ameliorated?</pre>
    <pre>[357]      While  Lord  Mansfield&#146;s rule has resisted  change  in
Canada and in most jurisdictions within the Commonwealth, it  has
been  subject  to significant modification in the United  States.
The  appellant relies upon the more recent  developments  in  the
U.S.,  and suggests that a reasonable compromise has been reached
in  Rule 606(b) of the federal Rules of Evidence for U.S.  Courts
and  Magistrates,  Pub. L. 93-595, § 1, Jan. 2,  1975,  88  Stat.
1934;  Pub. L. 94-149, § 1(10), Dec 12, 1975, 89 Stat. 805;  Mar.
2, 1987, eff. Oct. 1, 1987, which provides as follows:
          (b)   Inquiry  into validity  of  verdict  or
          indictment.    Upon  an  inquiry   into   the
          validity of a verdict or indictment, a  juror
          may not testify as to any matter or statement
          occurring  during the course  of  the  jury's
          deliberations  or to the effect  of  anything
          upon  his  or  any  other  juror's  mind   or
          emotions as influencing him to assent  to  or
          dissent  from  the verdict or  indictment  or
          concerning his mental processes in connection
          therewith, except that a juror may testify on
          the  question whether extraneous  prejudicial
          information  was improperly  brought  to  the
          jury's   attention  or  whether  any  outside
          influence was brought to bear upon any juror.
          Nor  may  his  affidavit or evidence  of  any
          statement  by  him concerning a matter  about
          which  he  would be precluded from testifying
          be  received  for these purposes.   [Emphasis
          added].</pre>
    <pre>[358]      According   to the Senate Advisory  Committee  of  the
United   States  Senate,  the  rule  offered  a  balance  between
competing interests:
          The  familiar  rubric that a  juror  may  not
          impeach  his  own verdict is  a  gross  over-
          simplification.   The  values  sought  to  be
          promoted  by  excluding the evidence  include
          freedom   of   deliberation,  stability   and
          finality  of  verdicts,  and  protection   of
          jurors       against      annoyance       and
          embarrassment.[Citation  omitted]    On   the
          other  hand,  simply putting verdicts  beyond
          effective reach can only promote irregularity
          and   injustice.    The   rule   offers    an
          accommodation    between   these    competing
          considerations.</pre>

Evidence (St. Paul, Minn.:  West Publishing Co., 1990),  para.

    <pre>[359]      Substantially  similar or identical  rules  have  been
adopted  in Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Nebraska,
New  Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota,  Utah,
Wisconsin  and  Wyoming.   Although  other  states  have  adopted
different  rules, virtually all of them admit to some  exceptions
to  the general inadmissibility of a juror's evidence.  See  Paul
Quinlan, &#147;Secrecy of Jury Deliberations:  Is the Cost Too  High?&#148;
(1993), 22 C.R. (4th) 127 at 141, n. 57.
[360]     I do not think that it is necessary for this court to
propound such a rule of general application, as has the U.S.
Congress. Our courts have not hesitated to interfere with a jury
verdict where the court has received responsible information that
extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the
attention of the jury or outside influence was brought to bear
upon one or more members of the jury. Our present task is to
consider whether we should have access to the most direct source
of information, namely the testimony of the jurors themselves.
For myself, I think there must be some change in our blanket
refusal to entertain any evidence that emanates from individual
jurors.
[361]     Among the most basic tenets of our legal system is the
principle that an accused charged with an offence may be
convicted only on the basis of legally admissible, relevant and
probative evidence properly adduced before the trier of fact.
This requirement is based not on technical evidentiary rules but,
rather, derives from the basic requirements of simple fairness.
As observed by Doherty J.A., writing for this court in R. v.
Morrissey (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 221 (Ont. C.A.), a
verdict based on extraneous information is not a &#147;true verdict&#148;
and results in a miscarriage of justice.
[362]     The danger of juries making use of impermissible and
irrelevant considerations is well recognized.  Cory J., writing
for a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. G. (R.M.)
(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 26 at 34 (S.C.C.), noted that the jury
system, although having many benefits, is &#147;fragile&#148;.    Speaking
of the importance of a judge&#146;s instructions to a jury,  Cory J.
stated:
          If  the  process is subjected to  unwarranted
          pressures,  or  to unnecessary  distractions,
          the   delicate  reasoning  process   may   be
          thwarted.   The sole task of  a  jury  is  to
          reach  a  verdict  based exclusively  on  the
          evidence  presented.  The sturdy independence
          of  jurors  may  be  overcome  and  unanimity
          compelled   by  a  judge&#146;s  suggestion   that
          irrelevant factors be considered  or  by  the
          judge  exercising unwarranted  pressure.   In
          these  circumstances,  the  verdict  may   no
          longer be based on a reasoned approach to the
          evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[363]      In  my  opinion,  this warning is  equally  applicable
whenever there is an undue or improper influence upon a jury.
[364]     In R. v. Rowbotham (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 456-7
(S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the possibility
that juries may &#147;disobey&#148; trial judges&#146; instructions.   The
courts have recognized that the danger of some evidence being
misused by the jury is so great that not even a limiting
instruction from the trial judge will suffice to ensure that only
proper use is made of it.  Indeed, in R. v. Pascoe (1997), 113
C.C.C. (3d) 126 at 146 (Ont. C.A.), this court recently rejected
the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that a limiting instruction would be
sufficient to prevent a jury from improperly using evidence that
the accused, who was charged with sexual offences with respect to
children, was a homosexual paedophile. Similarly, the
jurisprudence respecting situations in which prospective jurors
may be challenged for cause recognizes that there is a real
possibility that jurors may make decisions on the basis of
improper considerations, such as pre-trial publicity or the race
of the accused:  see R. v. Sherratt, supra; R. v. Parks (1993),
84 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused (1994),
87 C.C.C. (3d) vi (S.C.C.); and R. v. Williams (1998), 124 C.C.C.
(3d) 481 (S.C.C.).
[365]     The danger of juries making use of improper
considerations is such that where some irregularity occurs during
the jury deliberations, the concern that the jury may have been
improperly influenced is usually sufficient to warrant a new
trial.  In R. v. Mayhew (1975), 29 C.R. (N.S.) 242 (Ont. C.A.), a
new trial was ordered because one or more members of the jury may
have overheard a conversation between two police officers
respecting the accused&#146;s criminal record. Also influencing the
court was the fact that two jury members had what the court found
to be &#147;harmless social discussions&#148; regarding &#147;purely personal
matters&#148; with a Crown witness known personally to them.  In R. v.
Ryan (1951), 13 C.R. 363 (B.C. C.A.), there was a new trial
because the jury had attended a movie during its deliberations,
had mingled with the crowd, and had spoken to non-jurors on the
telephone, although there was no evidence that the jurors had
discussed the case with any non-jurors.  To return to an earlier
case that I have discussed, we will recall that in R. v. Mercier,
supra, a new trial was ordered where the Crown Attorney had
entered the jury room.  It is to these dangers that the s. 647
jury sequestration provisions are directed.  Reference may also
be had to R. v. Hertrich, Stewart and Skinner (1982), 67 C.C.C.
(2d) 510 (Ont. C.A.), which outlines at p. 541 the procedure a
trial judge is to follow in order to ensure that a juror remains
unbiased after there has been an improper communication with that
juror during the course of a trial.
[366]     It seems to me that we have reached the stage where
Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule should be revisited and revised.  It made
considerable sense when it was first pronounced, but juries in
Lord Mansfield&#146;s day and for some time thereafter were
sequestered after they were empanelled and remained isolated
until they reached a verdict.  The trials were of necessity brief
and access to the jury was easily prevented. Today, juries are
empanelled for weeks and months.  The chances of jurors being
exposed to improper influences are much increased.  Accepting the
obvious that we will not countenance external pressures on jury
members directed to influencing their deliberations or the
receipt by them of extraneous prejudicial information, it seems
to me to follow rationally that we must be prepared to relax Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule to enable the court to receive evidence of such
improper influences. To me it makes considerable sense for the
court to have access to the best evidence where, in a particular
case, there has been a showing that evidence is available that
could justify setting aside the verdict of a jury.  I think that
the present unrestricted prohibition, at the trial and appellate
level, of the receipt of a juror&#146;s evidence concerning jury
misconduct can deprive an accused of the ability to demonstrate,
in the individual case, that he has been deprived of a fair trial
contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  As stated by
the U.S. Supreme Court in McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.S. 264 at 268-
269 (1915):  &#147;the argument in favour of receiving [juror]
evidence is not only very strong, but unanswerable &#150; when looked
at solely from the standpoint of the private party who has been
wronged by such misconduct&#133;[I]t would not be safe to lay down any
inflexible rule because there might be instances in which such
testimony of the juror could not be excluded without &#145;violating
the plainest principles of justice&#146; &#148;.
[367]     I emphasize that any change in Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule
would be a change by the court of a judge-made rule.  More
important, it would be restricted to a question of the
admissibility before the trial court or this court of evidence
that is directed to the impeachment of a verdict because of jury
tampering or misconduct by one or more jurors.  If changes in the
rule are made, the court can impose restrictions on the
publication of the evidence that is proffered and do whatever is
necessary to protect the sanctity of jury deliberations.  It can
protect jurors from harassment by the media or interested parties
by discouraging fishing expeditions and insisting upon a
threshold showing before impeachment will even be considered.  In
short, the court can look after itself in determining what
evidence it will receive and does not require the protection of
the Criminal Code.  The Code should be directed towards
preventing jurors from publishing details of jury deliberations
or otherwise violating jury secrecy traditions for purposes
unrelated to the fair trial of the accused.  Unlike the present
s. 649, it should protect the jurors from harassment and not
penalize them for being the victims of such conduct.  These
concerns have been addressed directly in other jurisdictions and
can serve as a useful precedent: see infra.
[368]     In holding that the time has come to modify Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule, this court would not be the first to
acknowledge that it may work injustice upon an accused.  As
pointed out by counsel, the rule is on its face absolute.
However, in rare and exceptional circumstances, courts have
circumvented the rule where failing to do so would have had the
effect of denying an accused his right to a fair trial by an
independent and impartial jury, acting free of extraneous or
improper influence.  In R. v. Zacharias (1987), 39 C.C.C. (3d)
280 (B.C. C.A.) an investigation conducted within the exception
provided for under s. 649(a) revealed that the jury had rendered
a verdict of guilty because it had failed to understand the
courses open to it.  The Court received this evidence and ordered
a new trial, in spite of Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule prohibiting its
receipt, holding that since the disclosures were attributable to
the Attorney-General&#146;s interrogation of the jurors during the
course of the investigation of an alleged obstruction of justice,
the Crown was in no position to say that the verdict should be
allowed to stand.
[369]     Although the court did state at p. 284 that the
&#147;peculiar circumstances of this case ought to strip it of any
precedent-setting value for probing a jury&#146;s deliberations in
other cases&#148;, to my mind the result it arrived at demonstrates
the virtues of a flexible case by case approach to the
admissibility of evidence that serves to impugn an improperly
arrived at jury verdict.  It will always be the &#147;peculiar&#148; or
difficult case that challenges rules of long-standing.  When
faced by such circumstances, it is incumbent on the court to do
more than maintain blind allegiance to a rule that may work an
injustice.  Rather, the court must attempt to fashion a remedy
that meets the demands of justice.  In the instant appeal,
justice requires us to modify Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule.
[370]     However, such a step does not in and of itself address
the appellant&#146;s case.  The present state of the law is made up of
the twin pillars of Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule and s. 649 of the Code.
The former renders inadmissible any disclosure from jurors as to
jury deliberations and the latter makes criminal such disclosure
on the part of the individual juror.  In combination, they
effectively deny the accused access to the most effective means
of submitting evidence to the court of conduct that could impeach
a jury verdict. Accordingly, when considering if the appellant
has been denied his right to a fair trial in accordance with the
principles of fundamental justice, it is necessary to look at the
two rules together.  Having found that it is desirable that this
court change Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule, I propose now to examine
whether s. 649 operates so as to deprive an appellant of his or
her rights under the Charter.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Does s. 649 violate the appellant&#146;s s. 7 Charter right?</pre>
    <pre>[371]      As  I stated at the outset, the appellant&#146;s  claim  is
properly  grounded  in  s.  7  of the Charter,  which  guarantees
everyone  &#147;the right to life, liberty and security of the  person
and  the  right  not to be deprived thereof except in  accordance
with  the  principles of fundamental justice&#148;.  It  goes  without
saying  that the appellant&#146;s liberty interest is at stake in  the
present  appeal.   I am also of the opinion that the  appellant&#146;s
inability to breach the barriers imposed by the common  law  rule
and  by  s. 649 effectively deprive the appellant of that liberty
interest.   Accordingly, what must be determined is whether  this
deprivation  is in accordance with the principles of  fundamental
justice.
[372]      The leading definition of the principles of
fundamental justice is in Reference Re S. 94(2) Motor Vehicle Act
(B.C.), [1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.  Lamer J., writing for Dickson C.J.,
Beetz, Chouinard and Ledain JJ., said at pp. 512-13:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  term &#145;principles of fundamental justice&#146;
          is  not a right, but a qualifier of the right
          not  to  be  deprived of  life,  liberty  and
          security  of the person; its function  is  to
          set the parameters of that right.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Sections    8   to   14   address    specific
          deprivations of the &#145;right&#146; to life, liberty,
          and  security of the person in breach of  the
          principles  of fundamental justice,  and,  as
          such, violations of s. 7.  They are therefore
          illustrative of the meaning, in  criminal  or
          penal  law,  of  &#145;principles  of  fundamental
          justice&#146;;  they  represent  principles  which
          have  been recognized by the common law,  the
          international  conventions and  by  the  very
          fact  of  entrenchment  of  the  Charter,  as
          essential  elements  of  a  system  for   the
          administration  of justice which  is  founded
          upon  the belief in the dignity and worth  of
          the human person and the rule of law.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          Consequently,  the principles of  fundamental
          justice  are to be found in the basis  tenets
          and  principles,  not only  of  our  judicial
          process, but also of the other components  of
          our legal system.
                             . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>          Whether any given principle may be said to be
          a principle of fundamental justice within the
          meaning  of  section  7  will  rest  upon  an
          analysis  of  the nature, sources,  rationale
          and  essential role of that principle  within
          the judicial process and in our legal system,
          as it evolves.   [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[373]      In  the  case in appeal, the liberty interest  engaged
under  the  rubric  of  s.  7 is the right  particularized  under
ss. 11 (d) and (f) to be presumed innocent until proved guilty in
a  fair  and  public hearing before an independent and  impartial
jury. A number of cases decided under s. 7 serve as authority for
the  proposition  that it is a principle of  fundamental  justice
that  the innocent not be imprisoned and that an accused  not  be
denied  a  fair trial.  It is an irresistible extension of  these
principles  to the similar or analogous principle that  where  an
accused  is  entitled  to a jury, a fair trial  must  include  an
independent and impartial jury.  In my opinion, where the accused
person&#146;s jury does not qualify as impartial or independent, there
can  be  no  argument that he or she has been denied  fundamental
justice.
[374]     I refer to R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525 for the
general proposition that, in the criminal context, a principle of
fundamental justice will be recognized only where the denial of
it will deprive the accused of the basics of a fair trial.  In
the Motor Vehicle Reference, supra, Lamer J. said at p. 513: &#147; It
has from time immemorial been part of our system of laws that the
innocent not be punished.  This principle has long been
recognized as an essential element of a system for the
administration of justice which is founded upon a belief in the
dignity and worth of the human person and on the rule of law&#133;&#148;.
Although speaking of a statute that created an absolute liability
offence that gave rise to penal consequences, Lamer J. may be
taken as having stated a bedrock principle of justice that is
applicable on our facts.
[375]     In R. v. Nguyen, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 906, all seven members
of the Court held that the Code provision, now repealed, creating
the offence of sexual intercourse with a female person under the
age of fourteen years violated s. 7, inasmuch as the removal of
the defence of honest belief was contrary to the principle of
fundamental justice that a morally innocent person not be
imprisoned.   A majority held that the violation could not be
justified under s. 1.
[376]     In R. v. Seaboyer; R. v. Gayme, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577
McLachlin J., writing for the majority, had the opportunity to
consider the so called &#147;rape-shield provision&#148; in light of the
right of the innocent not to be convicted.  At p. 606, having
made reference to the miscarriages of justice suffered by Donald
Marshall and the Birmingham Six, she cited Dickson J. in R. v.
Sault St. Marie, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299 at 1300:  &#147;There is a
generally held revulsion against punishment of the morally
innocent.&#148;  McLachlin J. then equated the unavailability of
evidence that assists the defence as a denial of the right to
full answer and defence.  She stated at p. 608:
          The right of the innocent not to be convicted
          is  dependent  on the right to  present  full
          answer  and defence.  This, in turn,  depends
          on  being able to call the evidence necessary
          to  establish a defence and to challenge  the
          evidence called by the prosecution.
          </pre>
    <pre>          As  one  writer  has put it  [David  Doherty,
          &#147;&#145;Sparing&#146;   the  Complainant  &#145;Spoils&#146;   the
          Trial&#148;  (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 55 at 67]:   &#147;If
          the  evidentiary  bricks needed  to  build  a
          defence are denied the accused, then for that
          accused  the  defence has been  abrogated  as
          surely  as it would be if the defence  itself
          was held to be unavailable to him.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>          In short, the denial of the right to call and
          challenge  evidence  is  tantamount  to   the
          denial  of the right to rely on a defence  to
          which  the  law  says one is  entitled.   The
          defence  which the law gives with  one  hand,
          may be taken away with the other.  Procedural
          limitations  make possible the conviction  of
          persons   who  the  criminal  law  says   are
          innocent. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[377]      I would observe that to the extent that s. 649 of  the
Code  prevents  a  convicted person  from  mounting  a  full  and
informed appeal in where the verdict is challenged as having been
tainted  by juror misconduct such that the jury was not impartial
or  independent,  the section may be said to  operate  so  as  to
prevent  that  person  from  making &#147;full  answer  and  defence&#148;.
Whether it is the refusal of the Crown to disclose information in
its  possession as in R. v. Stinchcombe, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 754,  or
the  operation of s. 649 of the Code, the result is the same: the
state  enjoys  an  unfair  and unjustifiable  advantage  over  an
individual  whose liberty interest is at stake.  The  same  would
apply  if the challenge were made before the trial judge when  he
was still seized of the case.
[378]     In Seaboyer, supra, McLachlin J. also held that the
pursuit of truth is a fundamental goal of our criminal law.  She
said at p. 609:
            It  is fundamental to our system of justice
          that  rules  of  evidence should  permit  the
          judge  and  jury  to get  at  the  truth  and
          properly  determine the issues. The  goal  is
          reflected  in  the basic tenet  of  relevance
          which  underlies all our rules  of  evidence:
          see Morris v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190,
          and  R.  v. Corbett, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670.  In
          general  nothing is to be received  which  is
          not   logically  probative  of  some   matter
          requiring  to be proved and everything  which
          is  probative should be received, unless  its
          exclusion  can  be justified  on  some  other
          ground.   A law which prevents the  trier  of
          fact  from  getting at the truth by excluding
          relevant evidence in the absence of  a  clear
          ground  of  policy  or  law  justifying   the
          exclusion   runs  afoul  of  our  fundamental
          conceptions of justice and what constitutes a
          fair trial. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[379]      There  is no apparent reason why the same  should  not
apply  to  the rights of a convicted person seeking to impeach  a
jury  verdict.  As with the impugned provisions in  Seaboyer,  s.
649   fails  to  achieve  the  appropriate  balance  between  the
probative  value  of the proffered evidence and  its  prejudicial
effect.  As McLachlin J. wrote at p. 625:
          In  achieving its purpose &#150; the abolition  of
          the  outmoded,  sexist-based  use  of  sexual
          conduct   evidence   -   [the   rape   shield
          provision]  overshoots the mark  and  renders
          inadmissible  evidence  which  may  well   be
          essential  to the presentation of  legitimate
          defences  and  hence to  a  fair  trial.   In
          exchange   for   the   elimination   of   the
          possibility that the judge and jury may  draw
          illegitimate inferences from the evidence, it
          exacts  as  a  price the real  risk  that  an
          innocent person may be convicted.  The  price
          is  too  great  in relation  to  the  benefit
          secured, and cannot be tolerated in a society
          that  does  not countenance in any  form  the
          conviction   of   the  innocent.    [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[380]      Following the Motor Vehicle Reference, supra, a number
of  decisions have given some direction as to how the  principles
of   fundamental  justice  are  to  be  determined.     Two   are
particularly  relevant  in addressing the Crown&#146;s  contention  in
this appeal that s. 649 and the common law rule serve to limit  a
liberty  right  in accordance with the principles of  fundamental
justice,  and  that  jury secrecy is a principle  of  fundamental
justice in its own right.  R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R.  151  is
of  importance in that it illustrates how these principles may go
beyond  well-established rules of long standing.  In articulating
the  existence of a s. 7 right to silence, a right  broader  than
that guaranteed either by ss. 10, 11(c) or 13 of the Charter,  or
the   common  law  rules  against  self-incrimination,   or   the
protections  provided by the Canada Evidence Act,  McLachlin  J.,
writing  for  a majority of the Supreme Court, gave clear  notice
that  the  principles  of  fundamental  justice  are  capable  of
continued evolution.  At p. 163 she explained why s. 7  could  be
expansively interpreted:
          [One  reason is that] a fundamental principle
          of  justice under s. 7 of the Charter may  be
          broader  and more general than the particular
          rules  which  exemplify it.  A second  reason
          why  a fundamental principle of justice under
          s.   7  may  be  broader  in  scope  than   a
          particular   legal   rule,   such   as    the
          confessions rule, is that it must be  capable
          of   embracing   more  than  one   rule   and
          reconciling diverse but related principles&#133; .
          </pre>
    <pre>          The   final   reason  why  a   principle   of
          fundamental justice under s. 7 may be broader
          than  a particular rule exemplifying it  lies
          in  considerations relating to the philosophy
          of   the  Charter  and  the  purpose  of  the
          fundamental   right  in  question   in   that
          context.    The   Charter  has  fundamentally
          changed  our legal landscape.  A  legal  rule
          relevant  to a fundamental right may  be  too
          narrow  to  be reconciled with the philosophy
          and  approach of the Charter and the  purpose
          of the Charter guarantee. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[381]       McLachlin  J. at p. 164 defined the  approach  to  be
taken  in elucidating a principle of fundamental justice, stating
that  one  must  first examine the related rules that  have  been
established  by  our legal system.  Then, one must  examine  &#147;the
general philosophy and purpose of the Charter, the purpose of the
right  in  question, and the need to reconcile  that  right  with
others  guaranteed by the Charter.&#148;  McLachlin J. next  undertook
an  extensive  review of both the common law and  statutory  rule
governing confessions, as well as the Charter recognition of  the
common  law  right  to  silence.  From the common  law  rule  she
distilled the &#147;essence of the right to silence&#148;, which  she  then
analyzed  in  light  of  the other relevant  Charter  provisions,
namely  ss.  10(b), 13, and 24(2).  Whereas the common  law  rule
comprehended  only  the narrow, negative  right  to  be  free  of
coercion induced by threats, promises, or violence, the ambit  of
the Charter right included a positive right to make a free choice
as  to  whether  to remain silent or speak with  the  authorities
(p.  177).   She then concluded at pp. 181 to 186 that a  broader
right  to silence than previously elucidated exists within s.  7.
As  the  impugned police action was not prescribed  by  law,  the
Crown  could  not rely on s. 1 of the Charter, and the  jailhouse
confession was ruled inadmissible under s. 24(2).
[382]     Further guidance is found in Rodriguez v. British
Columbia (Attorney General), [1993] 3 S.C.R. 519, where the
Supreme Court took the opportunity to elaborate on the proper
approach to s. 7, although, on the facts, it went on to find that
s. 241(b) of the Code (aiding or abetting suicide) was not
contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.  Writing for a
majority of five justices, Sopinka J. stated at pp. 589-90:
          On  the one hand, the Court must be conscious
          of its proper role in the constitutional make-
          up  of our form of democratic government  and
          not seek to make fundamental changes to long-
          standing  policy  on  the  basis  of  general
          constitutional principles and its own view of
          the  wisdom  of legislation.   On  the  other
          hand,  the  Court has not only the power  but
          the  duty  to deal with this question  if  it
          appears  that the Charter has been  violated.
          The  power to review legislation to determine
          whether it conforms to the Charter extends to
          not   only   procedural  matters   but   also
          substantive   issues.   The   principles   of
          fundamental  justice leave a  great  deal  of
          scope  for  personal judgment, and the  Court
          must   be   careful  that  they  not   become
          principles  which are of fundamental  justice
          in  the  eye of the beholder only.  [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[383]      Sopinka  J. went on to state at p. 590  that  &#147;a  mere
common  law  rule does not suffice to constitute a  principle  of
fundamental  justice&#148;. Only principles upon which there  is  some
consensus  that  they are vital or fundamental  to  our  societal
notion  of  justice  can  qualify as  principles  of  fundamental
justice.  Moreover, such principles must not be so broad  &#147;as  to
be  no  more  than vague generalizations about what  our  society
considers  ethical  or  moral.  They must  be  capable  of  being
identified  with  some precision and applied to situations  in  a
manner  which yields an understandable result.  They must also&#133;be
legal principles&#133;&#148; (p. 591).
[384]     In determining whether or not a provision conforms to
the principles of fundamental justice, it may be helpful to look
at the common law and the legislative history of the provision in
question. However, it is more critical to examine the purpose and
rationale of the provision, as the fact that a provision has been
in effect for a long time does not necessarily make it consistent
with the principles of fundamental justice.  At p. 591 Sopinka J.
wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is  not  sufficient, however,  merely  to
          conduct  a  historical  review&#133;  .  Such   an
          approach   would  be  problematic   for   two
          reasons.    First,   a  strictly   historical
          analysis  will always lead to the  conclusion
          in  a  case such as this that the deprivation
          is in accordance with fundamental justice, as
          the legislation will not have kept apace with
          advances in medical technology.  Second, such
          reasoning  is somewhat circular, in  that  it
          relies  on  the continuing existence  of  the
          prohibition    to   find   the    prohibition
          fundamentally just.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  way to resolve these problems is not  to
          avoid  the historical analysis, but  to  make
          sure  that  one is looking not  just  at  the
          existence  of the practice itself (i.e.,  the
          continued    criminalization   of    assisted
          suicide),  but at the rationale  behind  that
          practice  and  the principles which  underlie
          it. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[385]      Both Hebert and Rodriguez may be taken as endorsing  a
purposive  and  liberal  approach to the  interpretation  of  the
principles of fundamental justice found in s. 7.  On their  face,
they  would appear to seriously put into doubt the Crown&#146;s  claim
that  s.  649  of the Code is, in and of itself, a  principle  of
fundamental justice.  Hebert suggests that the rights  enumerated
in ss. 8 to 14 of the Charter may be expanded under the rubric of
fundamental  justice, thus opening the door to a  more  expansive
role  for the courts in investigating whether in fact a convicted
person  was  denied his rights to a fair jury  trial,  be  it  by
reason  of  the  misconduct of one or more  of  the  jurors,  the
improper interference of a third party, or the operation of  some
undue  or improper influence on the jury.  As for Rodriguez,  its
rejection  of  a  purely historical approach  in  s.  7  analysis
seriously  weakens  the  Crown&#146;s case, based  as  it  is  on  the
longevity  of what it claims is the common law antecedent  to  s.
649.   Even were I to accept the Crown&#146;s account of this history,
which I have not, I am still required by Rodriguez to examine the
rationale behind this provision.
[386]     Accordingly, given that it has been held that s. 7
comprises a right of the innocent not to be convicted and
imprisoned, as well as a right to make full answer and defence,
it must follow that the courts that try the accused must have the
ability to determine if such a right has been denied in the
particular case. Where as here, the appellant proffers evidence
that he maintains demonstrates that there has been conduct on the
part of a juror that raises an issue as to the integrity of his
verdict of guilt, he has a constitutional right to have that
evidence examined. Any rule of law or provision of the Code that
interferes with this right must be subjected to scrutiny to
determine its justification.
[387]     As I indicated earlier, I think that Lord Mansfield&#146;s
rule should be ameliorated to give the court at least some
flexibility as to what evidence it can receive where jury
impeachment is sought.  However, if the rule is changed to permit
the reception of evidence of jurors disclosing information
relating to the proceedings of the jury when it was absent from
the courtroom and that was not subsequently disclosed in open
court, it creates a conflict with s. 649 of the Code.
Accordingly, the next inquiry is whether s. 649 of the Code,
which deprives the appellant of his s. 7 right to make this
evidence available in proper form for the courts&#146; consideration,
is in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
[388]     It is evident that s. 649 does block access to relevant
evidence of juror misconduct or other acts leading to a
miscarriage of justice.  It is implicit in the Crown&#146;s position
that this is so.  The Crown has attempted justify the section as
supporting Lord Mansfield&#146;s rule.  In my opinion, it does not,
but even if it does, this justification fails if we change Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule.  Fundamentally, however, s. 649 does not
purport to address the issue of whether this court or any other
court should admit evidence from jurors as to jury misconduct. It
merely makes it very difficult for any party, particularly the
accused, to access jurors as a source of evidence that could lead
to the impeachment of a jury verdict. Therefore, the Crown must
justify s. 649 on its own merits as in some manner protecting the
integrity of the jury system.  Its choice was to characterize the
object of s. 649 as fostering the finality of verdicts and the
protection of jurors.  But that was the justification for Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule.  If finality of verdicts is not the court&#146;s
present concern, this justification falls as well. As to the
protection of jurors against unwanted questioning or harassment
by the parties or the media, I hardly think that criminalizing
disclosure by the juror and nobody else can be regarded as a
protection to the juror.  That said, I will now turn to examine
whether the deprivation of the accused&#146;s s. 7 right is in
accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (c)  Is s. 649 overbroad, and thus an unjustifiable
          interference with the appellant&#146;s ability to access
          evidence that is both relevant and essential to a
          determination of his right to a fair trial in
          accordance with the principles of fundamental justice?</pre>
    <pre>[389]      Shortly  put,  my answer is yes.  Whatever  legitimate
state interests may be at stake, the impugned section of the Code
is  an  exercise  in  overkill that is difficult  to  justify  in
opposition to a serious violation of an accused person&#146;s  Charter
right  to  a  fair  trial.   This  violation  is  all  the   more
unjustifiable  when  it is unclear what interests  the  state  is
attempting  to  protect.   Whatever Parliament  had  in  mind  in
enacting s. 649, we are only concerned with its incidental effect
on  the  admissibility  of evidence.  If Parliament  intended  to
mandate  the  exclusion of any evidence directed to impeaching  a
verdict, it could have done so in clear terms.
[390]     In justification of the impugned section of the Code,
the Crown places great reliance on the exception to s. 649 as
operating as a &#147;window of opportunity&#148; to the juror who has
information relating to improprieties in the jury room.  However,
this is simply not the case.  First of all, the section creating
the offence is not limited to the jury room and the formal
deliberations of the jury in reaching a verdict.  It embraces all
&#147;proceedings of the jury&#148; outside the courtroom.  In these days
of lengthy jury trials, the section embraces all circumstances
where the jury is together such as (a) when they are sent to the
jury room during the conduct of a voir dire or other occasions
where their presence is not required; (b) at lunch during sitting
weeks; or (c) in the hotel when the jury is sequestered.  More
important, the exception is very narrow.  It contemplates an
investigation or criminal proceeding that is in progress, not one
that follows a disclosure by a juror.  The investigation is
restricted to offences under s. 139(2) of the Code and does not
embrace every situation where the integrity of the verdict could
be called into question.  Furthermore, it is difficult to
envisage an investigation that is not initiated by the Crown or
the trial judge in the particular case.  I cannot read the
section so as to authorize an investigation by the defence, or
even the media, based on whatever evidence or suspicions might be
available to them.
[391]     The Crown insists that we can take the goodwill of the
Crown for granted and asks that we assume that if the defence has
evidence that might merit investigation, it should make it
available to the Crown and the Crown will, in a proper case,
initiate an investigation.  This would make the Crown the trustee
of the accused&#146;s Charter rights to a fair trial.  This is hardly
appropriate where these rights can only be asserted against the
Crown, the adversarial party in the very trial in which the
violation is said to have occurred: see Heywood, supra, at pp.
797-798, where Cory J. rejected the Crown&#146;s argument that the
availability of a pardon or the royal prerogative of mercy would
serve to save the impugned scheme.
[392]     I think it is obvious from what I have pointed out
above that the prohibition against disclosure is absolute with
respect to the juror who volunteers information.  He or she
commits an offence no matter how grateful the administration of
justice might be for the information in the particular case.  Any
juror who read the section (and we were advised that it is posted
in every jury room) would be most reluctant to come forward with
any disclosure of what took place in the jury room no matter how
outraged he or she might feel about its effect on reaching a
proper verdict.  A juror who reveals concerns about improprieties
in the jury room that is short of qualifying under the exception
certainly risks prosecution.  Even if the disclosure does fall
within the exception, a prosecution is still possible at the
instigation of a disgruntled party to the litigation, if the case
is civil, or by the accused or indeed any person who might want
to play the &#147;busybody&#148;.
[393]     Section 649 is over inclusive and goes far beyond what
is necessary to preserve the integrity of the jury system.  In
fact, it is scarcely directed to that object. The only &#147;scandals&#148;
that have occurred arising out of violations of the traditional
secrecy of jury deliberations (and even they have been few and
far between) have resulted from disclosures to the media.  It is
most unfair to have the juror alone suffer the full brunt of the
criminal law without any corresponding penalty falling upon
those who have actually published the disclosure.
[394]     Even assuming, without deciding, that there is a
legitimate state interest in preventing the publication of
information disclosed by jurors, and assuming that such a goal
could survive Charter scrutiny under s. 2(b),  a cursory review
of legislative developments elsewhere clearly demonstrates just
how blunt, crude, and ill-tailored an instrument s. 649 is.  As
discussed below, the equivalent U.K. legislation, as overbroad as
it may appear, makes at least some attempt to identify the kinds
of disclosures that are to be prevented.  Moreover, two
Australian states have legislated prohibitions on disclosure of
jury deliberations in a way that balance the various interests at
stake.  The Victoria Juries Act, 1967 provides, in s. 69, that it
is a contempt of court to publish information capable of
identifying a juror in a criminal case.  In December 1985, the
Parliament of Victoria enacted the Juries (Amendment) Act, 1985,
the purpose of which was &quot;to protect the confidentiality of the
deliberations of juries&quot; (s. 1).  As a result, a new provision,
s. 69A, was added to the Juries Act, 1967.  Section 69A provides,
in part, as follows:
          69A  (1)  A  person must not publish  to  the
          public    any   statements   made,   opinions
          expressed,  arguments advanced or votes  cast
          in the course of the deliberations of a jury.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)   A  person who solicits or  obtains  the
          disclosure by a person who is or has  been  a
          member of a jury of statements made, opinions
          expressed,  arguments advanced or votes  cast
          in  the course of the deliberations of a jury
          is guilty of an offence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (3)  A person who is or has been a member  of
          a jury must not disclose any statements made,
          opinions  expressed,  arguments  advanced  or
          votes cast in the course of the deliberations
          of  that  jury if that person has  reason  to
          believe  that  any  of  that  information  is
          likely  to  be  or will be published  to  the
          public.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[395]     Certain statutory exceptions are set out in subsections
(4) and (5).  Disclosure and publication are permitted if neither
the juror nor the legal proceeding is identified.  This exception
facilitates  scientific research into juries.  In  addition,  the
provision  permits  a  juror to disclose information  about  jury
deliberations to a judge or other justice officials  where  there
has  been  an  investigation  into a complaint  surrounding  jury
deliberations.
[396]     Similarly, s. 68 of the New South Wales Jury Act 1977
makes it an offence to publish, print, or otherwise broadcast
anything that would disclose the identity or address of a juror.
There is no penalty proscribed for a juror who discloses jury
deliberations.
[397]     Clearly, these schemes succeed where their Canadian
cousin fails.  The Victoria statute penalizes the wrong of
publication, assuming that it is such, without fettering the
ability of an appellant to lead evidence of jury proceedings in
accordance with the court&#146;s rules of evidence.  Although
subsection (2) would generally prevent the active solicitation of
information by an accused, it may be broadly enough worded that
an accused may seek out disclosure of information relating to a
miscarriage of justice.   Finally, the statute accomplishes its
aims without resorting to the blanket criminalization of jurors
who disclose relevant and necessary evidence of jury misconduct
or improper outside influence.
[398]     In my opinion, based on the historical review conducted
earlier in these reasons, it cannot be said that s. 649 is in any
meaningful way concerned with the preservation of the jury as an
institution.  Moreover, as seen above, its effect is to deprive
an accused of his rights under s. 7.  Looking at the section in
the most indulgent way, it appears that it is antithetical to any
rules that this court might seek to introduce with respect to
what evidence we would be prepared to hear on an appeal directed
towards the impeachment of a jury verdict.  The same observation
applies with even greater force to the trial division.
Accordingly, the section cannot be said to be justified as
consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.
[399]     In my constitutional analysis of the validity of s.
649, the balancing between the s. 7 right of an accused and the
state&#146;s legitimate interest will occur within s. 7, rather than
s. 1. While the Crown in its factum did segregate its s. 1
analysis from its submissions relating to a breach of the
Charter, as a practical matter the arguments before us by all
parties proceeded as an assessment of the state&#146;s interest in the
s. 7 analysis.  Although the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court
does not speak with one voice on this matter, I think this is the
proper way to proceed.   In Seaboyer, supra, I take McLachlin J.
as holding at p. 603, for the majority of the court, that s. 7
must be construed as having regard to the whole range of
interests comprising the principles of fundamental justice, from
the rights of the accused to broader social concerns, including
state interests. Notwithstanding her later dissent in Rodriguez,
supra, where she seemingly posited a flexible or context driven
approach that would sometimes require the state interest to be
considered in s. 1, it appears to me that her position in
Seaboyer best reflects the Court&#146;s position in this regard: see,
inter alia, R. v. Lyons, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 309 at 327 (La Forest J.
for Dickson C.J., Estey, MacIntyre, and LeDain JJ.); R. v. Beare,
[1988] 2 S.C.R. 387 at 402-3 (La Forest J. for Dickson C.J.,
Beetz, MacIntyre, Lamer, Wilson, and L&#146;Heureux-Dube JJ.); Thomson
Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and
Research), [1990] 1 S.C.R. 425 (per LaForest J. at 539 and
L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J. at 583); and Rodriguez, supra, reasons of
Sopinka J., at 592-595.  I also find support for this proposition
in an article by Mr. Justice LaForest, in &#147;The Balancing of
Interests Under the Charter&#148; (1991), 2 N.J.C.L. 133.
[400]     In any event, the resolution of this question is
essentially moot, in light of the fact that I find that s. 649 is
overbroad and therefore cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny
under either s. 7 or s. 1.  The concept of overbreadth was most
fully developed in R. v. Heywood, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761, which is
authority for the proposition that, assuming that a s. 7
violation has been established, only in the rarest of cases will
a breach of a principle of fundamental justice be found to be a
&#147;reasonable limit prescribed by law as can be demonstrably
justified in a free and democratic society&#148; in a s. 1 analysis.
In the result, it matters little whether the state&#146;s interest is
to be weighed under s. 7 or s. 1: in either case the provision is
unjustifiable.
[401]     In Heywood, the accused challenged s. 179(1)(b) of the
Criminal Code, which made it an offence for persons convicted of
certain specified offences to be &#147;found loitering in or near a
school ground, playground, public park or bathing area&#148;.    The
court found that the provision violated the principles of
fundamental justice in that it was overbroad; the means were too
sweeping in relation to the objective.  As Cory J. wrote for
Lamer C.J., Sopinka,  Iacobucci  and Major JJ. at p. 790:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It   applies  without  prior  notice  to  the
          accused,  to  too many places,  to  too  many
          people,  for  an  indefinite period  with  no
          possibility of review.  It restricts  liberty
          far  more than is necessary to accomplish its
          goal.</pre>
    <pre>[402]     Cory J. described the concept of overbreadth  under  s.
7 at pp. 792-3:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Overbreadth  analysis  looks  at  the   means
          chosen  by  the  state  in  relation  to  its
          purpose.     In   considering    whether    a
          legislative provision is overbroad,  a  court
          must   ask   a  question:  are  those   means
          necessary to achieve the State objective?  If
          the   State,   in   pursuing   a   legitimate
          objective, uses means which are broader  than
          is  necessary  to accomplish that  objective,
          the principles of fundamental justice will be
          violated because the individual&#146;s rights will
          have been violated for no reason.  The effect
          of  overbreadth is that in some  applications
          the law is arbitrary and disproportionate.</pre>
    <pre>[403]      Following the line of cases that hold state  interests
are  to  be  considered in s. 7, cited above, Cory J.  held  that
state  interests  were  to  be  balanced  against  those  of  the
individual in s. 7.  However, where the means chosen to achieve a
state  interest  go  beyond  what is  required  to  achieve  that
interest,  s.  7  will  be found to have been  violated,  as  the
individual&#146;s  rights will have been violated for no  reason.   At
pp.  794-802  Cory  J.  went on  consider the  operation  of  the
impugned  section,  and  found it  overbroad   in  the  following
respects:  (1) in its geographical ambit; (2) for its  life  time
prohibition  without a review process; (3) as to  the  people  to
whom the prohibition applies; and (4) in its absence of notice.
[404]     Having found that s. 7 was violated, the court
proceeded to conduct a s. 1 analysis.   Cory J.,  returning to
the principles established by Lamer J. in the Motor Vehicle
Reference, supra at 518, held  at p. 802  that the Court has
expressed doubt as to whether a violation  of s. 7 can ever be
justified under s. 1:
          </pre>
    <pre>          This  court has expressed doubt about whether
          a violation of the right to life, liberty, or
          the  security of the person which is  not  in
          accordance with the principles of fundamental
          justice can ever be justified, except perhaps
          in   national  emergencies:   Re  B.C.  Motor
          Vehicle  Act, supra, at p. 518.   In  a  case
          where  the  violation of  the  principles  of
          fundamental  justice  is  as  a   result   of
          overbreadth, it is even more difficult to see
          how  the  limit can be justified.   Overbroad
          legislation  which  infringes  s.  7  of  the
          Charter  would  appear  to  be  incapable  of
          passing the minimal impairment branch of  the
          s. 1 analysis.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>In the result, the provision could not be saved by section 1.</pre>
    <pre>[405]     By citing Lamer J. in the Motor Vehicle Reference, Cory
J. may be taken as having established an extremely high threshold
that  will  have  to  be met by the Crown in order  to  establish
justification  for a breach of an accused&#146;s s. 7 rights.   It  is
instructive to quote  Lamer J., ibid., at p. 518:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Administrative      expediency,      absolute
          liability&#146;s  main supportive  argument,  will
          undoubtedly   under  s.  1  be  invoked   and
          occasionally succeed.  Indeed, administrative
          expediency   certainly   has   a   place   in
          administrative law.  But where administrative
          law  chooses  to  call  in  aid  imprisonment
          through  penal law, indeed sometimes criminal
          law  and  the  added  stigma  attached  to  a
          conviction, exceptional, in my view, will  be
          the  case  where  the  liberty  or  even  the
          security of the person guaranteed under s.  7
          should   be   sacrificed  to   administrative
          expediency.   Section 1 may, for  reasons  of
          administrative expediency, successfully  come
          to the rescue of an otherwise violation of s.
          7,   but   only  in  cases  arising  out   of
          exceptional  conditions,  such   as   natural
          disasters,  the  outbreak of war,  epidemics,
          and the  like.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>As La Forest J. indicated in &#145;The Balancing of Interests&#146;, supra,
at p. 159, &#147;if a procedure or policy is such as to violate the
principles of fundamental justice, it would be a rare case indeed
that could find justification as a reasonable limit under s. 1&#133;&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[406]      In  my  opinion, the holding in Heywood, read  in  the
light  of  the  Motor Vehicle Reference, is dispositive  of  this
issue.   Section  649  is overbroad and  cannot  be  said  to  be
consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.   This  is
especially  so  given  the fact that the Crown  has  advanced  no
compelling justification for the fact that it operates to deny an
accused his s. 7  Charter right to be tried by an independent and
impartial  jury.   Indeed,  even were I  to  accept  the  Crown&#146;s
submissions as to the goal and purpose of the section,  these  do
not  justify  the  serious deprivation of an accused&#146;s  right  to
proffer evidence that raises an issue as to the integrity of  the
verdict of his guilt.
[407]     As discussed in Rodriguez, historical and comparative
analyses, while not determinative, may be of assistance in
considering whether an impugned provision is consistent with the
principles of fundamental justice.  The historical review
conducted above only shows that s. 649 is a recent creation.   It
does not codify any common law rule relating to jury secrecy.  In
fact there may not be a common law rule, only a convention or a
rule of conduct addressing the issue of jury secrecy.  We have
been referred to no precedent at common law for imposing a
criminal sanction on a juror who violates traditional jury
secrecy by making a casual disclosure of what took place in the
jury room to a friend or member of his or her family.
[408]     Rather, it would appear that, at common law, the
disclosure must be part and parcel of conduct that constitutes an
independent contempt of court.  This was essentially the finding
of the U.K. Queen&#146;s Bench Division in the New Statesman case,
discussed above.  That court&#146;s finding that there is no analogous
common law power led to the enactment of the Contempt of Court
Act, 1981 (U.K.).  Parliament there enlarged the definition of
contempt of court to encompass juror disclosure in certain
circumstances. In so doing it created a new offence hitherto
unknown to the law: see New Statesman, supra, at pp. 647 and 649-
650; Campell, &#147;Jury Secrecy and Impeachment of Jury Verdicts &#150;
Part I&#148;, supra, passim.  Section 8(1) of the Act declares it to
be:
          </pre>
    <pre>          a  contempt  of court to obtain, disclose  or
          solicit, any particulars of statements  made,
          opinions  expressed,  arguments  advanced  or
          votes cast by members of a jury in the course
          of   their   deliberations   in   any   legal
          proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>[409]      In  Canada,  however, aside from the narrow  exception
relating to  the obstruction of justice, s. 649 uses the broadest
language  to  make  it  an offence &#147;to disclose  any  information
relating  to the proceedings of the jury when it was absent  from
the courtroom that was not subsequently disclosed in open court&#148;.
The offence is the fact of disclosure.  Moreover, unlike the U.K.
provision, which specifically enumerates certain types of matters
that may not be obtained, disclosed, or solicited, s. 649 applies
to  any  and  all  information.  To use  the  language  of  s.  1
analysis,  the  provision  is not at all  well  tailored  to  the
putative state goals.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (d)  What is the appropriate remedy?</pre>
    <pre>[410]     Section 649 having been found overbroad, it remains  to
be  determined  what remedy should issue under s.  52(1)  of  the
Charter.  In Heywood, supra, Cory J. summarized at pp. 803-4  the
rule laid down in Schacter v. R., [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679:
          &#133;  reading  in or reading down will  only  be
          warranted where (i) the legislative objective
          is  obvious,  and reading in or reading  down
          would  constitute a lesser intrusion on  that
          objective    than    striking    down    that
          legislation; (ii) the choice of means used by
          the  legislature  is not so unequivocal  that
          reading in or reading down would unacceptably
          intrude  into  the  legislative  sphere;  and
          (iii)  reading in or reading down  would  not
          impact  on  budgetary decisions  to  such  an
          extent that it would change the nature of the
          legislation at issue.</pre>
    <pre>[411]      Clearly, this is not an appropriate case in  which  to
read  in  or  read  down.   I say this  on  the  basis  that  the
legislative objective is not at all obvious.  Moreover, it is not
clear how this court could fashion an alternative that would  not
unduly   interfere  with  Parliament&#146;s  task  of  balancing   the
competing interests at stake.  I am of the opinion that the  only
avenue open to this court is to declare s. 649 inoperative in its
entirety.  Section  649  of  the  Code  is  antithetical  to  the
implementation  of changes in the common law rules  that  I  have
proposed and is inconsistent with the provisions of s. 7  of  the
Charter.   Because  I  do not believe that it  can  be  saved  by
judicial amendment, I would grant a declaration under s.52(1)  of
the  Constitution  Act, 1982 that it is of no force  and  effect.
Since  Parliament should be given the opportunity to replace  the
section  with  more  appropriate  legislation  directed  to   the
preservation of the jury as an institution, I would suspend  this
declaration of invalidity for twelve months: see Re Eurig Estate,
[1998]  2 S.C.R. 565 (S.C.C.) and the reasons of Major J.  at  p.
586.
[412]     In addition to the above declaration of invalidity with
respect to s. 649 of the Code, I am also of the opinion that Lord
Mansfield&#146;s rule should be modified by the court to admit at the
trial, and failing that on appeal, evidence of a juror or any
other person that tends to establish that extraneous prejudicial
information was improperly brought to the attention of the jury
or that outside influence was brought to bear upon any juror. The
publication of a court made code is not necessary at this time.
The strength of the common law rests in its experimental and
inductive quality, moving from case to case in the development of
principle.  I think that the court should proceed to examine
particular cases within the parameter set out above and develop
its own jurisprudence.  Because of my proposed disposition of the
application for the admission of fresh evidence, I have no
specific suggestions to make at this time.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition of appeal</pre>
    <pre>[413]      Having  found  that Lord Mansfield&#146;s  rule  should  be
changed  and that s.649 of the Code  is unconstitutional,  I  can
find  no specific application of  a revised common law rule  that
has any application to this case.  There is no attack on the jury
process in the verdict under appeal.  There are objections to the
conduct  of  the  trial  but they have  been  dealt  with  by  my
colleagues. The proffered evidence of juror misconduct relates to
the  second trial presided over by O&#146;Connell J.  It was submitted
to  Watt J. in support of an application for a stay of the  third
trial  that  such  stay was warranted based  on  the  failure  of
O&#146;Connell  J. in the second trial to  discharge a specific  juror
for  alleged misconduct and enter a verdict of acquittal  on  the
basis  of fresh evidence that indicated that the remaining eleven
jurors  would  have acquitted the appellant. Watt J.  refused  to
grant such a stay, and once again this ruling has been dealt with
by  my  colleagues.  My only comment is that the  fresh  evidence
does  not address the integrity of the verdict under appeal.   To
the  extent that it purports to attack the validity of the ruling
of  Watt  J.  it  fails utterly.  It demonstrates that  the  jury
presided over by O&#146;Connell J. was irremediably stalemated  and  a
mistrial was the only conceivable ruling.  Accordingly,  I  would
dismiss  the  application  for  the  introduction  of  the  fresh
evidence  as  to  what  transpired before  and  during  the  jury
deliberations.
[414]     In the result, while I am in favour of ameliorating the
so-called common law rule enunciated by Lord Mansfield and I
would be prepared to issue a declaration of invalidity of s.649
of the Code in consequence thereof, I am not prepared to do it in
this case because the legal challenges to the verdict in appeal
do not merit such action.  I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>

referred to at trial, including this statement, were in Mandarin,

text of the letter.  The remainder of the quoted part of the
letter was written in Mandarin.
3     It  may  be  that the police did not retrieve  all  of  the
appellant&#146;s  February 20th letters to the deceased.  Mrs.  Chan&#146;s
evidence  was that the letter that she saw the deceased read  was
longer than the letter the appellant gave to the police.
4    Dr. Sepp explained that disarticulation is the separation of
one  body part from another through a joint.  In layman&#146;s  terms,
disarticulation is synonymous with dismemberment.
5    Section 647 allows a judge to give permission to a jury to
separate before it retires to consider its verdict. By necessary
implication, the jury must be sequestered after it retires to
consider its verdict.
6    One of the appellants also claimed that s.649 constituted an
infringement of the freedom of expression guaranteed under s.2(b)
of the Charter. This ground of appeal was abandoned at the
hearing. It is conceded that the appellants would have no
standing to bring an application under s. 2(b) of the Charter.
7    The Supreme Court of Canada established that the Charter
applies to the common law in RWDSU Loc. 580 v. Dolphin Delivery
Ltd., [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573.
8    The appellants have essentially adopted one another&#146;s
arguments on the constitutional issues. They will therefore be
referred to collectively unless the context requires otherwise.
We are not unmindful that the appellants&#146; respective positions
varied, even on common issues, according to the exigencies of
their individual case.
9    For example, should a juror challenge s.649 on the basis
that it violates his or her s.2(b) freedom of expression,
different considerations may be raised.
10    The notion of privilege as one of the bases for the rule was
propounded by Professor Wigmore, Wigmore on Evidence (Boston:
Little, Brown and Company, 1961) vol. 8 at p. 671. However, in
the numerous cases where it could have been argued that the
individual jurors had waived the privilege given their
affidavits, the courts have nonetheless rejected the affidavits.

12     (1973), 12 C.C.C. (2d) 377 (Que. C.A.).
13    The words of s.8 of the Contempt of Court Act of Great
Britain serve as a useful guide to define the deliberation
process for the purpose of the exclusionary rule. It provides
that &#147;it is a contempt of court to obtain, disclose, or solicit
any particulars of statements made, opinions expressed, arguments
advanced, or votes cast by members of a jury in the course of
their deliberations in any legal proceedings.&#148;
14    In Canada, R. v. Zacharias (1987), 39 C.C.C. (3d) (B.C.C.A.)
stands alone in admitting evidence from two jurors who indicated
that they had voted guilty simply because they didn&#146;t know that a
mistrial could be declared if the jury was unable to agree. The
court acknowledged that this kind of evidence is generally
inadmissible to impeach the verdict but stated  at p. 284 that
&quot;[t]he peculiar circumstances of this case ought to strip it of
any precedent-setting value for probing a jury's deliberations in
other cases.&quot;
15    See for example, R. v. Tavarivas, [1993] B.C.J. No. 2820
(B.C.S.C.).
16    See for example R. v. Thatcher (1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 449
(Sask. C.A.); affd. (1987), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.).
17    The importance of unanimity has long been recognized by the
courts. See, for example, R. v. Armstrong, [1922] 2 K.B. (C.A.)
555 at 568, where  Lord Chief Justice Hewart stated that the
&#147;inestimable value of [the jury&#146;s] verdict is created only by its
unanimity, and does not depend upon the process by which they
arrived at it.&#148;
18    See for example R. v. Sachs, [1991] O.J. No. 1645 (Ont. Gen.
Div.). For further examples in Australia and New Zealand
respectively, see   R. v. Challinger, [1989] 2 Qd. R. 352
(C.C.A.); R. v. Papadopoulos, [1979] 1 N.Z.L.R. 318 (C.A.). See
also In re Donovan&#146;s Application, [1957] V.R. 333 (Vic. Sup. Ct.)
where a trial judge, following the discharge of a jury who had
indicated that they could not agree upon a verdict, refused to
receive affidavit evidence from the foreman of the jury
indicating that the jury had in fact unanimously agreed that the
accused was not guilty of murder but that they could not agree on
the verdict of manslaughter.
19    See also R. v. Gough (1993), 97 Cr. App. R. (H.L.) for a
similar approach taken by the House of Lords.
20    A restrictive approach was also taken in a more recent
decision where the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal commented in
obiter dicta that an affidavit from a juror would be inadmissible
to show that a juror had discussed the case with a person outside
the jury: R. v. Gumbly (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 61 (N.S.C.A.).

where the court refused to receive evidence from the sheriff who
had overheard that the jury decided to arrive at a verdict by
majority vote. Similarly, in R. v. Bean (1991), C.L.R. 843 (Engl.
C.A.) a court official had overheard comments in the jury room
and those comments were sought to be introduced on appeal for
impeachment purposes. The comments were germane to the actual
voting on the verdict and the Court of Appeal refused to receive
the evidence.
