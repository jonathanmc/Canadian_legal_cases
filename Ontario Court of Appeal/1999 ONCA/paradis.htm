    <pre>HEARD:         April 1, 1999

    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Stong J. with a jury, dated July

    <pre>[1]  In our view, the charge to the jury concerning consciousness
of guilt is fatal to this conviction. At p. 410 of the
transcript, the trial judge said the following in his charge to
the jury:
          </pre>
    <pre>           You must remember that because you reject the accused's
     explanation does not mean that he is guilty. When the
     explanation, however, turns out to be a deliberate fabrication
     this may be evidence of consciousness of guilt. Where the accused
     has lied and his explanation is found to be deliberately false
     you may take the accused's evidence as an item of evidence
     tending to prove the accused's guilt.</pre>
    <pre>
[2]  Mr. Shandler fairly concedes that this is an error. The
instruction undermined the earlier, quite proper, directions as
to the application of R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742. The
fact that the appellant may have been found to have lied in his
testimony was not capable of constituting evidence of
consciousness of guilt: see R. v. Coutts and Middleton (1998), 40
O.R. (3d) 198 (C.A.).

[3]  Inasmuch as this instruction impinged on the burden and onus
of proof, this is not a proper case to apply the proviso in
s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code. In these circumstances,
we need not decide whether the cross-examination by Crown counsel
about the non-reporting of employment income was proper. However,
we agree with counsel for the appellant that before any cross-
examination such as that is permitted on the new trial, the trial
judge will have to consider whether the admission of such
evidence meets the test for admissibility of disreputable acts as
explained by the Supreme Court of Canada for example in R. v.
F.F.B, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 697.

[4]  Finally, we would make this comment for the assistance of
the trial judge. The charge concerning the elements of fraud was
overly complex given the issues raised, and much of that
instruction could have been left out of the charge to the jury.

[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction quashed,
and a new trial ordered.</pre></td>
