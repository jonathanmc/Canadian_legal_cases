    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On consent, time is extended to June 4, 1999 to file the
notice of appeal against the conviction and sentence for sexual
assault and forcible confinement.
[2]  As to the application for bail pending appeal, the Crown
concedes that there is an arguable ground of appeal concerning
the charge to the jury on the use to be made of defence counsel&#146;s
failure to cross-examine the complainant on the applicant&#146;s
version of the events.  The applicant, at present, makes no other
complaint about the conduct of the trial or the charge to the
jury.  The case against the applicant was not insubstantial.
There was circumstantial evidence not only identifying the
applicant as the perpetrator (which was conceded) but that the
acts were done without consent.  On the other hand, the applicant
testified and advanced the defence of consent.
[3]  The applicant has a lengthy criminal record for a relatively
young man.  Most disturbing is that he committed offences while
on bail for these offences and then in the jail after his bail
was revoked.  One of the offences committed while on bail was an
assault on his girlfriend.  To his credit, and that of his
parents who are the proposed sureties, once the applicant was
released on strict conditions he did not commit any further
offences.  He was then on bail for almost two years until his
sentencing in January of this year.
[4]  I am satisfied that the applicant will surrender into
custody if he is released.
[5]  I am also satisfied that his release is not contrary to the
public interest.  The principal issue at trial insofar as this
applicant is concerned was credibility.  The impugned direction
goes directly to the question of the applicant&#146;s credibility and,
if in error, might have unfairly undermined his credibility.  Mr.
Young argues that even if the direction were erroneous, this
court would apply the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code.  However, the burden would be on the Crown to
demonstrate that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice and without the complete transcript it is difficult to
make that determination.
[6]  I am informed that the transcript of the proceedings will
not be available for another three to four months.  Even if the
hearing of this appeal were expedited, the applicant could well
be eligible for release on parole before this appeal was heard.
Having regard to the applicant&#146;s conduct while under the
supervision of his parents in the two years prior to the trial, I
am satisfied that he will not commit other offences if I were to
order his release subject to appropriate conditions.  The
conditions suggested by Crown counsel and to which the applicant
is agreeable are very strict and not only require that the
applicant live at home, but that he be with one of his parents
when not at home.  He works with his father and has a good
reference from their employer.
[7]  Accordingly, the applicant will be released on bail pending
appeal in accordance with the draft terms suggested by the Crown.</pre></td>
