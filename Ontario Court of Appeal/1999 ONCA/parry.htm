    <pre>[1]   The trial judge misinterpreted the controlling case law and

misread s. 11(b) of the Charter as guaranteeing “a trial  at  the

earliest possible time.”
</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  charge was in the Provincial Court for 19 months.  The

parties  were not in a position to set a date for the preliminary

inquiry until 10 months had passed. This delay is attributable to

procedural  matters  which are part of any  criminal  proceeding,

e.g. obtaining disclosure, and to the respondent’s desire to have

certain unrelated matters resolved before the pre-trial on  these

charges was completed. This 10-month period should be regarded as

essentially neutral.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The parties were ready to proceed with a preliminary inquiry

on October 30, 1996. They estimated the preliminary would take  1

day and were given the date of April 29, 1997. This 6-month delay

can  be  characterized as institutional. On April 29th, the  case

was  preempted  by  a  custody matter. Although  the  preliminary</pre>
    <pre>inquiry could have been commenced on that day, it could not  have

been completed even though counsel had revised their estimate  of

the  time  needed to one-half day. Counsel cannot be faulted  for

taking the position that if the preliminary inquiry could not  be

completed  on that date, it should not be commenced  but  rather,

should be adjourned. The inquiry was adjourned to July 28,  1997.

This  3-month  period should be added to the institutional  delay

resulting in a total delay of 9 months.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The respondent was committed for trial on July 28th and  on

August  29th  a trial date of December 8th was set. This  3-month

period can be viewed as institutional delay.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]   The trial was adjourned from December 1997 to February 1998

at  the request of the respondent and this time period should  be

excluded  from  any  consideration of the respondent’s  s.  11(b)

claim.
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In assessing a s. 11(b) claim, the entire period between the

laying  of  the charge and the trial must be considered.  Section

11(b)  does not create a constitutional right to have  any  given

stage  of  criminal process completed within a  reasonable  time.

Here, the initial delay of 10 months was neutral. There was a  9-

month  institutional  delay in Provincial Court,  and  a  3-month

institutional  delay in the General Division. Some  institutional

delay is inevitable. A total institutional delay of 12 months  is

well  within the guidelines established by the Supreme  Court  of

Canada.  There  was  no  actual  prejudice  occasioned   to   the

respondent by the delay and these charges are relatively serious.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   Considering the total time period involved, the reasons for

the various delays, the nature of the charge, and the absence  of

any actual prejudice to the respondent, we are satisfied that the

trial  judge  erred  in law in holding that the  respondent’s  s.

11(b) rights had been violated.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The stay is set aside and it is directed that the matter  be

returned to the General Division for trial.</pre></td>
