    <pre>On appeal from the order of Hoilett J. dated December 11, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>AUSTIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The plaintiff appeals from the decision of the motions judge
dismissing the plaintiff&#146;s claim as not meeting the criteria  set
out in s.266 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8.
[2]  Those criteria, as interpreted by this court in Meyer v.
Bright (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.) require the plaintiff, on
a motion by the defendant, to tender evidence that his personal
injuries giving rise to the action involve permanent serious
impairment of an important bodily function caused by continuing
injury which is physical in nature.
[3]  Patterson was riding in, or on, a railway caboose when the
train of which it was a part was run into by a truck.  The truck
was overturned and the plaintiff fell on his back and side down
the steps of the caboose. He suffered injuries to his back and
hips.
[4]  Prior to the accident, the plaintiff was a yardman in the
employ of the CNR. As such, he worked in the railway yard at
Niagara Falls, Ontario assembling and disassembling trains. This
work involved a considerable amount of walking on ballast, that
is, rough and uneven ground, as well as some heavy lifting.
Engaging in that kind of activity now causes considerable pain.
[5]  The accident occurred in October 1991. Patterson was
physically not able to return to work, even on a trial basis,
until mid-1993. After about six months, it was concluded that he
was unable to continue in this employment because of these
injuries.
[6]  Orthopaedic reports in March 1994 concluded that he had pain
in the back and that &#147;he is coming to the end of the line as far
as his type of work is concerned&#148;. This doctor also stated that
&#147;heavy work that involves prolonged standing, walking or
prolonged sitting with heavy lifting is contraindicated &#150; is
probably a permanent contraindication &#150; I do suspect that his
working life is coming to an end&#148;. On April 28, 1994, his general
physician said that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It is my opinion that Mr. Patterson sustained
          a  disabling  injury  at  the   time  of  the
          accident&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Mr.  Patterson will not be able to return  to
          an  unconditional  employment  level  in  the
          future.  It is hoped that work can  be  found
          within the limitation of his injury.</pre>
    <pre>[7]    Subsequent  treatment  has  not  appreciably  altered  his
condition. He was covered by Workers&#146; Compensation at the time of
the  accident. In 1994, the Workers&#146; Compensation Board  informed
him that he had been awarded &#147;a 14% non-economic loss benefit  as
it  is  was determined [he had a permanent impairment] [for]  his
low  back&#148;. In August 1995, he was advised by the Board that  his
&#147;non-economic loss benefits [had] been recalculated to reflect  a
23% permanent impairment&#148;.
[8]  Fortunately, his employer, the CNR, was able to arrange
employment for the plaintiff which accommodated his disabilities.
As the trial judge described it: &#147;Ironically, the yard
supervisor&#146;s position, which the plaintiff has held for
approximately 3 ½ years now, represents an accelerated
advancement for him, it being commonly known that, in the
ordinary course of events, the plaintiff would have been
disentitled to that position based on [union] seniority. Be that
as it may, there is no evidence that the plaintiff&#146;s holding of
his present position is any way time limited&#148;. The new position
is indoors and involves a good deal of time at a computer.
[9]  It was conceded below that the plaintiff had sustained a
permanent impairment of a bodily function caused by a continuing
injury which is physical in nature. The issue was whether the
impairment was &#147;serious&#148; within the meaning of that word as used
in s.266.
[10] In concluding that the plaintiff had not established that
the impairment was serious, the motions judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Applying then the principles enunciated in Meyer v. Bright
          to the present circumstances, as I have indicated earlier in
          these reasons, fortuitously, the plaintiff has received a career
          advancement, and, as of the date of this hearing had been well
          established in his new position for approximately three and one
          half years. His sports life continued to be vigorous and varied
          and a three-hour drive was within his tolerance. I observe, in
          passing, that counsellors in defensive habits recommend breaks
          after driving for a period of approximately two hours.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Although, apparently, the plaintiff has
          had  a  career  change, it is one  of  career
          advancement  and not the &#147;career frustration&#148;
          spoken  of in Meyer v. Bright, supra. It  may
          be   said   that  that  &#147;career  frustration&#148;
          concept disadvantages those who have not  had
          the  advantage of a career derived from  long
          specialized  training,  but,  it  cannot   be
          gainsaid  that the plaintiff in  the  present
          action  does  not  fit  the  profile  of  the
          plaintiff in Lento v. Castaldo, supra.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 For  all  of  the  foregoing  reasons,
          therefore,  it  is  my conclusion,  that  the
          impairment of bodily function in the case  of
          this  specific  plaintiff  is  not  &#147;serious&#148;
          within the meaning of s.266 and judgment will
          be in accordance with paragraph (2) of Notice
          of Motion.</pre>
    <pre>[11]  The  case reported under the name Meyer v. Bright, actually
deals  with  three  cases, each giving rise  to  questions  under
s.266. One of the three was Lento v. Castaldo. Mr. Lento was a 28
year  old  licenced journeyman auto body mechanic.  His  injuries
were  continuing  and  physical and  they  involved  a  permanent
impairment of an important bodily function. The issue,  as  here,
was whether the impairment was serious.
[12] The trial judge found that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;Whatever path his future takes, the plaintiff will not
          likely re-enter the auto body repairman field except perhaps in a
          reduced capacity or in a supervisory role. The plaintiff has
          convinced me that his injuries and diminished physical abilities
          have frustrated his chosen career path and this is sufficient to
          lead to the conclusion that his injuries are &#147;serious&#148; within the
          meaning of s.266 of the Insurance Act.</pre>
    <pre>[13]  The Court of Appeal accepted this conclusion. It then  went
on to say, at p.258:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where, as here, permanent impairment of important bodily
          functions frustrates the chosen career path of an injured person
          we think the impairment is properly described as being a serious
          one for that person. In this case, Maloney J. found that the
          financial cost to Mr. Lento of his career frustration is
          substantial. He found that, after deducting accident benefits and
          short-term disability benefits, Mr. Lento&#146;s loss of income in the
          two years between the accident and the trial amount to $45,590.
          After finding that Mr. Lento would qualify for, and find
          employment in another occupation, Maloney J. nevertheless
          concluded that Mr. Lento would have future income loss of almost
          a quarter of a million dollars.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In this case, the financial impact upon
          the   life   of   the   injured   person   is
          substantial. But even if it were not, we  are
          of  the  opinion that the frustration  of  an
          injured person&#146;s chosen career path generally
          should  be considered to be a serious matter.
          One can contemplate a permanent impairment of
          an  important  bodily  function  which  might
          force  an injured person into a career  path,
          different  from  the chosen  one,  but  which
          turns    out   to   be   economically    more
          advantageous. It might not however, give  the
          same personal satisfaction. An artist may  be
          driven  by  an  injury to practice  law.  The
          question of the economic loss or the lack  of
          it  is  something which would bear  upon  the
          quantum  of damages to be assessed. Where  an
          injured person has invested years of  his  or
          her  life  in  study,  training  and  gaining
          experience  to  pursue a  chosen  career,  an
          impairment  of  an important bodily  function
          which  frustrates the pursuit of that career,
          regardless of the financial consequences,  is
          capable  of  being  found  to  be  a  serious
          impairment within the meaning of those  words
          as found in s.266(1)(b).
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  our  opinion Maloney J. was correct
          when   he   held  that  Mr.  Lento  sustained
          permanent  serious  impairment  of  important
          bodily   functions   caused   by   continuing
          injuries  which were physical in nature.  Mr.
          Lento  was therefore an injured person within
          the provisions of s.266(1)(b) and entitled to
          sue for loss or damage from personal injuries
          sustained  in  the  motor  vehicle  accident.
          (emphasis added)</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The instant case is not on all fours with Lento. It may  be
misleading to describe Mr. Patterson&#146;s former work as his &#147;chosen
path&#148;.  It was, however, work that he could do and work in  which
he had been actively engaged for many years. What is important is
that,  as a result of the injuries he sustained, he is no  longer
able to do that work or indeed any work requiring a good deal  of
walking on rough surfaces and some heavy lifting. Also important,
is  his  limited education (grade 11) and training and  the  fact
that  his  already limited field of employment has  been  further
shrunk  to an appreciable degree. His non-working life  has  also
been  affected. Previously, he hunted, fished, golfed and bowled.
He  is no longer able to golf. His bowling is limited and he will
wear a back brace for the rest of his life.
[15] In finding that the plaintiff did not meet the
qualifications of s.266, the motions judge appears to have relied
on his &#147;career advancement&#148; and the fact that Mr. Patterson did
not experience the &#147;career frustration&#148; of Mr. Lento. In my view,
the motions judge may have been misled by those factors. As to
the first, this court said in Meyer, supra, that even if the
financial impact on the life of the injured party were not
substantial &#147;the frustration of an injured person&#146;s chosen career
path generally should be considered a serious matter&#148;. As noted
earlier, Mr. Patterson may not have chosen to be a yardman, but
he was able to do that work and now, as a result of these
injuries, he is not able to do it. The economic consequences have
been positive rather than negative thus far, but there is no
guarantee that his position will remain available indefinitely.
If it does not, at his age (now 54) and with his education, the
consequences may indeed be quite serious.
[16] Putting it another way, although the economic consequences
of his injuries have to date been positive rather than negative,
the impact on his future life, both vocational and recreational,
by reason of the combination of his education, his age and his
new physical limitations, may well be serious.
[17] In my view, this is at least a borderline case and I would
give the plaintiff the benefit of any doubt. A decision in his
favour at this stage is not final. Under s. 266(4), the defendant
may at trial raise, as a defence, that the plaintiff&#146;s injuries
are not serious.
[18] I would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the order
below and dismiss the defendant&#146;s motion with costs in the cause.
I would award the plaintiff his costs of this appeal.
