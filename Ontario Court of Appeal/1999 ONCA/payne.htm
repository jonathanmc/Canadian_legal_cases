    <pre>On appeals from judgments of G.I. Thomson J. dated July 31, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>MORDEN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The two appeals before us involve the same issues which are,
as stated in the plaintiffs&#146; notice of motion under rule 21.01 in
each action:
      1.   Are there any limitations on non-pecuniary loss payable
    under s. 267.1 of the Insurance Act;
         </pre>
    <pre>      2.   Is loss of earning capacity a form of non-pecuniary loss for
    the purposes of s. 267.1 of the Insurance Act;
          
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Section 267.1 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8
(frequently referred to as Bill 164) was enacted by S.O. 1993, c.
10, s. 25 and applies to a proceeding for loss or damage arising
from the use or operation of an automobile between January 1,
1994 and October 31, 1996. The motions judge, Mr. Justice G. I.
Thomson, answered the questions as follows:
   
          1.   Yes, non-pecuniary damages are to be assessed in the
          same manner as any other proceeding without regard to the
          provisions of s. 267.1 of the Insurance Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   No.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The plaintiffs in each action appeal from this disposition.
Put briefly, their position on the first issue is that the limit
on the amount of non-pecuniary damages imposed by the Supreme
Court of Canada in the &#147;trilogy&#148; (Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy Alberta
Ltd., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 227, Thornton v. Prince George School
District No. 57, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 267, and Teno v. Arnold, [1978]
2 S.C.R. 287), as elaborated upon in Lindal v. Lindal, [1981] 2
S.C.R. 629, is not applicable to claims for non-pecuniary damages
under s. 267.1. With respect to the second issue, they submit
that loss of earning capacity is a form of non-pecuniary loss for
the purposes of s. 267.1. The motions judge gave extensive
reasons for his decision, which are reported at (1998), 72 O.T.C.
184 (Gen. Div.). Because I agree with his general approach and
his conclusions, I shall state my reasons relatively briefly.
[4]  In addressing the issues, it is not necessary to state the
alleged facts in each case in any detail beyond noting that in
each action damages for personal injuries incurred in a motor
vehicle accident are claimed (in the Payne action, the accident
occurred on November 5, 1994 and in the Hodgson action, it
occurred on May 11, 1996) and that in each action the claim
includes an allegation that the injured plaintiff  &#147;has suffered
a loss or diminution of her earning capacity.&#148;
[5]  The most material provisions in s. 267.1 of the Insurance
Act are:
               267.1     (1)  Despite any other Act and subject to
          subsections (2) and (6), the owner of an automobile, the
          occupants of an automobile and any person present at the incident
          are not liable in a proceeding in Ontario for loss or damage from
          bodily injury or death arising directly or indirectly from the
          use or operation of the automobile in Canada, the United States
          of America or any other country designated in the Statutory
          Accident Benefits Schedule.
               (2)  Subsection (1) does not relieve a
          person from liability for damages for non-
          pecuniary loss, including damages for non-
          pecuniary loss under clause 61(2)(e) of the
          Family Law Act, if as a result of the use or
          operation of the automobile the injured
          person has died or has sustained,
               (a)  serious disfigurement; or
               (b)  serious impairment of an important
               physical, mental or psychological
               function.
                               . . . .
               (6)  Subsection (1) does not relieve any
          person from liability other than the
          owner of the automobile, the occupants
          of the automobile and the person present
          at the incident.
               (7)  If, in the absence of subsection
          (1), the owner of an automobile, an occupant
          of an automobile or a person present at the
          incident would have been jointly and
          severally liable for damages for pecuniary
          loss with one or more other persons who are
          not relieved of liability by subsection (1),
          the other persons are liable for those
          damages only to the extent that they are at
          fault or negligent in respect of those
          damages.
               (8)  Subject to subsections (2) to (5),
          in a proceeding for loss or damage from
          bodily injury or death arising directly or
          indirectly from the use or operation of an
          automobile, the court shall determine the
          amount of damages for non-pecuniary loss to
          be awarded against the owner of the
          automobile, an occupant of the automobile or
          a person present at the incident in
          accordance with the following rules:
                    1.   The court shall first determine the
               amount of damages for non-pecuniary loss for
               which the owner of the automobile, the
               occupant of the automobile or the person
               present at the incident would be liable
               without regard to this Part.
                    2.   The determination under
               paragraph 1 shall be made in the same
               manner as a determination of the amount
               of damages for non-pecuniary loss in a
               proceeding to which this section does
               not apply and, in particular, without
               regard to,
                      i.   the statutory accident
                    benefits provided for under subsection
                    268(1),
                    ii.  the provisions of this section
                    that protect the owner of the
                    automobile, the occupants of the
                    automobile and the persons present
                    at the incident from liability for
                    damages for pecuniary loss, and
                    iii. the provisions of paragraph 3.
                  3.   The amount of damages for non-
               pecuniary loss to be awarded
               against the owner of the
               automobile, the occupant of the
               automobile or the person present at
               the incident shall be determined by
               reducing the amount determined
               under paragraph 1 by,
                      i.   in the case of damages for non-
                    pecuniary loss other than damages for
                    non-pecuniary loss under clause 61(2)(e)
                    of the Family Law Act,
                       A. $10,000, if the award of damages
                       is made in 1993 or 1994, or
                       B.     the non-pecuniary loss
                       deductible published under
                       clause 267.2(1)(a) for the year
                       in which the court makes the
                       award of damages, if the award
                       of damages is made in a year
                       after 1994, and
                      ii.  in the case of damages
                    for non-pecuniary loss under
                    clause 61(2)(e) of the Family
                    Law Act,
                       A. $5,000, if the award of damages
                       is made in 1993 or 1994, or
                       B. the Family Law Act
                       deductible published under
                       clause 267.2(1)(b) for the year
                       in which the court makes the
                       award of damages, if the award
                       of damages is made in a year
                       after 1994.
               (9)  Subsection (8) applies in 
          respect of each person who is
          entitled to damage for non-
          pecuniary loss.
               (10) If, in a proceeding for loss or
          damage from bodily injury or death arising
          directly or indirectly from the use or
          operation of an automobile, one or more
          persons other than the owner of the
          automobile, the occupants of the automobile
          and the persons present at the incident are
          found to be liable for damages for non-
          pecuniary loss,
               (a)  the other persons,
                    (i)  are jointly and severally liable
                    with the owner, occupants and persons
                    present at the incident for the damages
                    for which the owner, occupants and
                    persons present at the incident are
                    liable under subsection (8), and
                    (ii) are solely liable for any
                    amount by which the amount
                    mentioned in subclause (i) is less
                    than the amount that the other
                    persons would have been liable to
                    make contribution and indemnify the
                    owner, occupants and persons
                    present at the incident in respect
                    of non-pecuniary loss in the
                    absence of this section;
               (b)  the other persons are liable
               to make contribution and indemnify
               the owner, occupants and persons
               present at the incident in respect
               of non-pecuniary loss to the same
               extent as if this section did not
               apply, up to the amount for which
               the owner, occupants and persons
               present at the incident are liable
               under subsection (8); and
               (c)  the owner, occupants and persons
               present at the incident are liable to
               make contribution and indemnify the
               other persons for the amount that the
               owner, occupants and persons present at
               the incident are liable under subsection
               (8), reduced by the amount that the
               other persons are liable to make
               contribution and indemnify the owner,
               occupants and persons present at the
               incident under clause (b).
          
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In broad terms, it can be seen that s. 267.1(1) removes the
tort liability of the protected defendants referred to in it and
that s. 267.1(2) creates an exception to this general prohibition
which is confined to &#147;damages for non-pecuniary loss&#148;. The net
result is that the legislation removes tort liability for damages
for pecuniary loss. Compensation for pecuniary loss is provided
for in the form of statutory accident benefits on a no-fault,
first party basis, under s. 268 of the Act. The Statutory
Accidents Benefit Schedule is set forth in O. Reg. 776/93 as
amended by O. Reg. 781/94.
[7]  The limit on damages for non-pecuniary loss imposed by the
trilogy was $100,000. At the present time the limit is, as a
result of inflation (Lindal v. Lindal, supra, at pp. 640-41),
agreed to be about $260,000.
[8]  The answer to the first question turns on the proper meaning
of &#147;damages for non-pecuniary loss&#148;. The appellants point to one
part of the rationale in the trilogy for imposing the limit on
damages for non-pecuniary loss, namely &#150; that the plaintiff is to
receive full compensation for his or her pecuniary loss
(covering, where relevant, past and future loss of income and
past and future care expenses).  In Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy
Alberta Ltd., supra, at 262, Dickson J. set forth this rationale
for the limit on non-pecuniary damages:
                    If damages for non-pecuniary loss are viewed from a
          functional perspective, it is reasonable that large amounts
          should not be awarded once a person is properly provided for in
          terms of future care for his injuries and disabilities. The money
          for future care is to provide physical arrangements for
          assistance, equipment and facilities directly related to the
          injuries. Additional money to make life more endurable should
          then be seen as providing more general physical arrangements
          above and beyond those relating directly to the injuries. The
          result is a coordinated and interlocking basis for compensation,
          and a more rational justification for non-pecuniary loss
          compensation. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[9]  To the same effect, in Teno v. Arnold, supra, at 333, Spence
J. said:
                    I repeat my view expressed earlier that in these cases
          of very serious personal injuries the prime purpose in fixing an
          award of damages is the provision of adequate reasonable care for
          the plaintiff for the rest of the plaintiff&#146;s life. This I have
          attempted above by providing a fund from which may be drawn
          annually the necessary sum for care and attention and by an award
          for loss of future income from which she may supply the ordinary
          necessities of life. These two amounts I reach without regard for
          any social impact of the admittedly, and necessarily, large
          award. Indeed, the social burden may only be borne by a proper
          and reasonable assessment of the amounts. Under the present
          common law system of liability for fault, there can be no excuse
          for foisting on the public the burden of caring for the plaintiff
          or supplying her with the necessities of life. However, that
          accomplished, and I hope I have accomplished it, one may and
          should have regard for the social impact of very large and, as I
          have said, non-compensatory awards for non-pecuniary damages. The
          very real and serious social burden of these exorbitant awards
          has been illustrated graphically in the United States in cases
          concerning medical malpractice. We have a right to fear a
          situation where none but the very wealthy could own or drive
          automobiles because none but the very wealthy could afford to pay
          the enormous insurance premiums which would be required by
          insurers to meet such exorbitant awards. [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[10] Because injured parties are denied pecuniary damages under
s. 267.1, which damages would compensate them in full, the
appellants submit that there should no longer be a limit on the
non-pecuniary damages. For the purpose of addressing the issues
on this appeal, I am prepared to assume, generally, that the
statutory accident benefits do not amount to &#147;full compensation&#148;.
They are nonetheless, generous and, because they are paid on a no
fault basis, could exceed common law pecuniary damages in cases
where the plaintiff is at fault.
[11] I appreciate the logical nature of the appellants&#146;
submission but it does not persuade me that the term &#147;damages for
non-pecuniary loss&#148; means anything other than what it means at
common law under the trilogy. The liability for damages for non-
pecuniary loss is not created by the statute. It is created by
the common law and what s. 267.1(2) does is to remove, with
respect to damages for non-pecuniary loss, the general
prohibition in s. 267.1(1) against liability for all loss or
damage. Quite simply, if the Legislature intended that the
entitlement to damages for non-pecuniary loss was to mean
something different from what it meant when s. 267.1 was enacted,
it would have expressed this intention in some manner. There is a
presumption that legislation is not meant to change the common
law unless it does so clearly and unambiguously. See Ruth
Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, 3rd ed.
(1994), at pp. 298-99. It is, with respect, not sensible to
attribute to the Legislature an intention that the reader of the
statute is to &#147;go behind&#148; the clearly understood current rule
relating to the determination of damages for non-pecuniary loss
and re-interpret it in the light of its history. The Legislature
should not be assumed to express itself in such an obscure and
round about way.
[12] The foregoing is, I think, sufficient to determine the
answer to question 1. I mention, in addition, that this answer is
supported by the following more specific considerations.
[13] First, the provisions in s. 267.1(8), paras. 1 and 2 are to
the effect that the damages for non-pecuniary loss should be
determined generally without regard to the provisions of s.
267.1. I appreciate that this consideration could cut both ways.
In favour of the appellants, it could be argued that the amount
of damages for non-pecuniary loss could only be determined
&#147;without regard to this Part&#148;, etc., if one knew whether or not
the plaintiff is to receive full compensation for his or her
pecuniary loss. This argument, I think, begs the question. The
better view of s. 267.1(8) is that it is directed to the simple
common law rule respecting the assessment of damages for non-
pecuniary loss, which rule includes the limit imposed by the
trilogy. Specifically, s. 267.1(8), para. 2(ii) directs that the
determination of non-pecuniary damages is to be made without
regard to the fact that the defendant is protected from liability
for damages for pecuniary loss. This goes to the heart of the
appellants&#146; argument, as the statute is clear that a court cannot
take into account that the plaintiff is not recovering damages
for pecuniary loss.
[14] Second, in some cases the statutory accident benefits could
be greater than what a court would assess for pecuniary damages
at common law. I refer to cases where the plaintiff is partly at
fault, referred to above, and see, for example, the facts in
Sharpe v. Hall (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 24 (Gen. Div.). In such a
case would there, under the appellants&#146; argument, be grounds for
saying that there should be no limit on non-pecuniary damages? If
so, the resulting rules would be so unwieldy in practice and
unjustifiable from a policy point of view that it is difficult to
think that they could have been intended by the Legislature in
the absence of express language to this effect.
[15] Third, one would have to consider the inconsistencies and
complexities relating to the different amounts of damages for non-
pecuniary loss that would arise in a case in which non-protected
defendants (defendants not protected by s. 267.1) were involved
and if the protected defendants were liable for a larger amount.
The charge to the jury in such a case could be confusing and,
further, there could be unreasonable inconsistencies resulting
from working out issues of contribution and indemnity.
[16] Fourth, there is more to the rationale underlying the upper
limit in the trilogy than full compensation for pecuniary loss.
In Andrews, Dickson J. said at pp. 261-63:
               But the problem here [with non-pecuniary losses] is
          qualitatively different from that of pecuniary losses. There is
          no medium of exchange for happiness. There is no market for
          expectation of life. The monetary evaluation of non-pecuniary
          losses is a philosophical and policy exercise more than a legal
          or logical one. The award must be fair and reasonable, fairness
          being gauged by earlier decisions; but the award must also of
          necessity be arbitrary or conventional. No money can provide true
          restitution.
                               . . . .
               In particular, this is the area where
          the social burden of large awards deserves
          considerable weight. The sheer fact is that
          there is no objective yardstick for
          translating non-pecuniary losses, such as
          pain and suffering and loss of amenities,
          into monetary terms. This area is open to
          widely extravagant claims. It is in this area
          that awards in the United States have soared
          to dramatically high levels in recent years.
          Statistically, it is the area where the
          danger of excessive burden of expense is
          greatest.
                               . . . .
                    However one may view such awards in
          a theoretical perspective, the amounts are
          still largely arbitrary or conventional. As
          Denning L.J. said in Ward v. James, [1965] 1
          All E.R. 563, there is a great need in this
          area for accessibility, uniformity and
          predictability. In my opinion, this does not
          mean that the courts should not have regard
          to the individual situation of the victim. On
          the contrary, they must do so to determine
          what has been lost. For example, the loss of
          a finger would be a greater loss of amenities
          for an amateur pianist than for a person not
          engaged in such an activity. Greater
          compensation would be required to provide
          things and activities which would function to
          make up for this loss. But there should be
          guidelines for the translation into monetary
          terms of what has been lost. There must be an
          exchange rate, albeit conventional. [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[17] In Thornton, supra, at p. 284, Dickson J. said:
                    The award under non-economic related heads of damage
          should be a Canadian conventional award, adjusted to meet the
          specific circumstances of the individual case.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[18] It is a fact that there is no monetary exchange value
relating to pain and suffering, loss of amenities, and shortened
expectation of life. &#147;Full compensation in relation to non-
pecuniary losses is meaningless, and arguably, dangerous since
such losses by their nature cannot be fully restored.&#148; McLachlin,
&#147;What Price Disability? A Perspective on the Law of Damages for
Personal Injury&#148; (1991), 59 Can. Bar Rev. 1 at 7.
[19] Accordingly, there is no realistic basis for the appellants&#146;
submission that the injured plaintiff, free of the trilogy
limitation, &#147;ought to be fully compensated for every aspect of
her pain, suffering, loss of amenities and other general damages
not pecuniary in nature&#148;. The value of the trilogy limitation and
the scaling down effect in cases below the upper limit that it is
now recognized that it has (see Koukounakis v. Stainrod (1995),
23 O.R. (3d) 299 (C.A.) at 308) is that it removes the lottery
approach to the assessment of non-pecuniary damages and tends to
facilitate reasonable predictability and uniformity in awards for
these kinds of damages. &#147;The objectives of consistency,
predictability and fairness as between plaintiffs similarly
injured surely imply a &#145;rough upper limit&#146; of some sort, for the
appellate courts cannot achieve certainty or establish ranges
without indicating more or less explicitly what sort of award is
proper as a maximum in the most serious kinds of cases. This is
nothing more or less than a &#145;rough upper limit&#146;.&#148; Waddams,
&#147;Compensation for Non-pecuniary loss: Is there is a Case for
Legislative Intervention&#148;, (1985), 63 Can. Bar Rev. 734 at 735-
36.
[20] In conclusion, on the first issue, I do not think that, in
enacting s. 267.1, the Legislature would have intended to
jettison the values of consistency, predictability and fairness
between plaintiffs.
[21] The second issue  is whether loss of earning capacity is a
form of non-pecuniary loss for the purposes of s. 267.1. I
appreciate that the appellants are of the view that if loss of
earning capacity is considered to be part of damages for non-
pecuniary loss they may receive larger damages under this head,
but I have difficulty seeing how anything in s. 267.1 bears on
this question of classification. The appellants submit that the
word &#147;serious&#148; in s. 267.1(2) must contemplate occupational loss
as a component of non-pecuniary loss because under the
predecessor of s. 267.1 this court held that an injury is by
definition &#147;serious&#148; if it has occupational implications (Meyer
v. Bright (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.). As a matter of logic,
however, the fact that occupational implications indicate that an
injury may be serious does not mean that damages for loss of
earning capacity ought to be classified as non-pecuniary.
[22] The appellants&#146; basic argument, quite apart from the effect
of the wording of s. 267.1, is that there is a body of case law
that classifies loss of earning capacity under non-pecuniary
damages. See, for example, Donnelly v. Belanger (1991), 122
N.B.R. (2d) 48 (C.A.); LeClerc v. Sunbury Transport Ltd. (1996),
184 N.B.R .(2d) 1 (C.A.); and Reeves v. Arsenault (1998), 168
Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 251 (P.E.I. S.C. App. Div.).
[23] With respect, I think it is clear that regardless of the
label used &#150; &#147;loss of earnings&#148; or &#147;loss of [or diminution in]
working capacity&#148; &#150; this head of damages is to compensate for
pecuniary loss, no matter how difficult the determination in some
cases may be. &#147;The distinguishing feature of this head of damages
[&#147;Loss of Working Capacity&#148;] is that it embraces all the so-
called &#147;negative&#148; losses of a pecuniary character &#133; Since this
head of damages is pecuniary in character, the principle of full
compensation applies.&#148; [Emphasis added.] Cooper-Stephenson,
Personal Injury Damages in Canada, 2nd ed. (1996) at pp. 202-203.
[24] I do not exclude, as I do not think the motions judge
excluded, the consideration that for some injured persons the
inability to work, or do certain kinds of work, may be an aspect
of the diminution in the amenities of life. See Cooper-
Stephenson, op. cit. at pp. 211-12 and Munkman, Damages for
Personal Injuries and Death, 10th ed. (1996), at p. 73. If this
is so, then I think it could properly be taken into account under
this heading when non-pecuniary general damages are assessed.
When this is done, of course, the principle of &#147;full
compensation&#148; applicable in cases of financial loss and the kind
of calculation related to it would not be applicable.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[25] For these reasons, I would dismiss these appeals with costs.
