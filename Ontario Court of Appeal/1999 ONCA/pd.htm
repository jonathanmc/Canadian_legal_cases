    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Budzinski P.C.J. on
November 16, 1998</pre>
    <pre>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal against sentence. The appellant pleaded
guilty to two offences, sexual interference and invitation to
sexual touching, arising from the repeated and serious sexual
abuse of his daughter over the six year period during which she
was aged 6 to 12. Budzinski P.C.J. sentenced the appellant to a
custodial term of imprisonment of two years less one day to be
followed by a period of probation of three years.
[2]  The appellant argues that the sentencing judge erred in over-
emphasizing the need for denunciation and general deterrence and
by failing to impose a conditional rather than a custodial
sentence.
[3]  The sentencing judge&#146;s decision deserves deference from this
court. In my view, the emphasis he placed on the relevant
sentencing factors was reasonable as was his decision to impose a
custodial sentence. I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Until the disclosure of the events that gave rise to these
charges in December 1997 the appellant lived with his common-law
spouse, Ms. E., and their two daughters, the complainant, then
aged 12 and a younger sister aged 9. The appellant began having
sexual contact with the complainant when she was approximately 6
years old. Once started, the sexual contact occurred on an
ongoing basis. It began with the appellant fondling her chest and
the area of her vagina both over and underneath her clothing.
This led to digital penetration. The appellant gradually
escalated the seriousness of the abuse, inviting his daughter to
touch his penis and then rubbing his penis over her body
including the area of her vagina. On many occasions he performed
acts of cunnilingus on his daughter and had her perform fellatio
on him. On at least three occasions towards the end of the 6-year
period he had sexual intercourse with her. He was able to
penetrate to a depth of approximately one inch before he was
required to withdraw because of the discomfort he was causing to
her.
[5]  The complainant disclosed the abuse to her mother in
December 1997 because she thought she might be pregnant from
having sexual intercourse with the appellant. The Children&#146;s&#146; Aid
Society and the police were contacted. The appellant was
confronted and almost immediately gave a statement to the police
admitting the sexual involvement with his daughter.
[6]  The appellant has no previous criminal record. He was born
in 1955, the third of six children. He came from a difficult
family background. An older brother committed suicide at age 16,
his father drank heavily and both he and one of his sisters were
sexually abused by an uncle. The appellant and two of his sisters
were sexually active with one another.
[7]  The appellant was married in 1976, had three children and
separated in 1983. His excessive use of alcohol was a factor in
the breakdown of that marriage. The appellant began a common-law
relationship with Ms. E. in 1984. Over the years the appellant
drank excessively. However, he maintained steady employment and
was a good provider for his family. He has been employed with the
same employer since 1986 and as time passed he assumed positions
of increasing responsibility in its warehouse operations. At the
time of his sentencing in November 1998, he held a senior
position in the shipping and receiving department.
[8]  Shortly after his arrest on these charges the appellant was
released on bail. While on bail, he lived separately from Ms. E.
and the children but continued to support them financially on a
&#147;no strings attached&#148; basis. He did not initiate contact or
attempt to force a reconciliation. He made money available
through an account held jointly with Ms. E.
[9]  After his release the appellant immediately joined
Alcoholics Anonymous and has attended meetings on a regular
basis. He has not had any alcohol to drink since that time. The
appellant also sought counselling from Dr. Richard Berry, a
psychologist who specializes in treating victims and perpetrators
of sexual abuse. A report from Dr. Berry dated May 11, 1998 was
filed on the sentencing hearing. Dr. Berry expressed the opinion
that the appellant was suffering from acute depression. He said
that the appellant was a caring individual with a low sense of
self-esteem, who had a long-standing history of difficulty
establishing intimate personal relationships. Dr. Berry was of
the opinion that the appellant&#146;s sexual preference was for age
appropriate heterosexual relationships but that he was sexually
attracted to pubescent and teenage females. He was satisfied that
the appellant was generally remorseful, that he had empathetic
concerns for his spouse and daughters and had accepted
responsibility for his actions. In his report Dr. Berry expressed
the view that the prognosis was favourable that the appellant
would satisfactorily deal with the problems that resulted in
these offences.</pre>
    <pre>THE SENTENCING PROCEEDING</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant pleaded guilty on August 26, 1998. A pre-
sentence report was filed. It was favourable to the appellant
describing his positive attitude, his genuine remorse, his
successful efforts to stop drinking and his continued financial
support of the family. The defence filed letters of support
commenting favourably on the appellant&#146;s character and his
efforts to stop drinking after his arrest.
[11] The Crown filed victim impact statements from Ms. E. and the
complainant. In her statement Ms. E. said that she and her
daughters were handling the situation &#147;just fine&#148; and that they
were happy as a unit. She said she felt the appellant was doing
everything in his power to get his life back together and that
her main concern was that he receive the proper treatment rather
than go to jail. The complainant said she hated her father and
was glad not to see him anymore. She said she had received
counselling but had not continued with the counselling because
she was &#147;doing great.&#148;
[12] Dr. Berry was called as a witness in order to update his
report. Dr. Berry testified that the appellant had continued to
see him on a weekly basis and was responding very well to
treatment. He displayed greater understanding of the factors
underlying his sexual relationship with his daughter and
continued to accept responsibility for his actions. He had
benefited positively from his involvement in Alcoholics
Anonymous. The risk of the appellant re-offending, in Dr. Berry&#146;s
opinion, was significantly reduced.
[13] The Crown Attorney and defence counsel made submissions in
which they canvassed the appropriate sentencing factors and many
of the relevant cases. The Crown asked the court to impose a
penitentiary sentence of 3 to 4 years. The defence argued that
the trial judge should order a conditional sentence in the upper
reformatory range, 18 months to 2 years less one day.
[14] After completion of the submissions by counsel on August 26
the sentencing judge ordered a transcript of the proceedings and
adjourned the matter to November 9 for further submissions. On
November 9 the Crown Attorney told the sentencing judge that she
had spoken to Dr. Berry that morning and that he had indicated
that the appellant continued to be well motivated and was
continuing with Alcoholics Anonymous. After counsel made further
submissions, the sentencing judge adjourned the matter for one
week to consider his decision.
[15] On November 16 the sentencing judge imposed the sentence
under appeal. In his reasons he set out various factors that he
considered relevant to his consideration of the proper sentence.
In the appellant&#146;s favour, he took into account that the
appellant continued to be responsible in providing for his
family, admitted his guilt when confronted, pleaded guilty on an
early date, had received psychological counselling and had
successfully dealt with his alcohol problem. The sentencing judge
accepted that the appellant was generally remorseful and that he
would attempt to help his daughter in any way he could, including
financially, to recover from the damage he had done. He also
accepted that the appellant was no longer a danger to re-offend
and that there were satisfactory support systems in the community
to assist with his rehabilitation. The sentencing judge concluded
that the objectives of specific deterrence and rehabilitation had
been met. He considered the impact of a conditional sentence on the
appellant and particularly that it would be served without
eligibility for parole.
[16] The sentencing judge also considered the factors that
weighed against the appellant. He emphasized the seriousness of
the appellant&#146;s conduct, the breach of trust involved in a
natural father sexually abusing a child over a prolonged period
of time. He concluded that a sentence of two years less one day
to be followed by a period of probation of three years was
appropriate. He then addressed the issue whether the term of
imprisonment should be conditional or custodial. He expressed the
view that the facts of this case were more serious than those in
R. v. Wismayer (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.) and concluded that
a conditional sentence would not sufficiently satisfy the
principles of denunciation and general deterrence. In his view,
the punishment resulting from a conditional sentence would not be
proportionate to the appellant&#146;s responsibility and accordingly a
total deprivation of liberty was required. He therefore imposed a
custodial term of imprisonment of two years less one day.</pre>
    <pre>FRESH EVIDENCE</pre>
    <pre>[17] With the respondent&#146;s consent, the appellant filed fresh
evidence on this appeal. The fresh evidence discloses that since
his release on bail pending appeal, the appellant has maintained
his job and continued to support his family. He has attended bi-
weekly therapy sessions with Dr. Berry and has participated
regularly at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Dr. Berry filed a
report indicating that the appellant has progressed well and is a
lesser risk to re-offend than he had been six months before.
[18] Ms. E., in her affidavit, indicates that the appellant&#146;s
financial support of the family is very important and that
without this support she will be required to apply for social
assistance. She is satisfied that the appellant has done what he
can to address his illness and she can see no benefit resulting
from his incarceration. She also states that the complainant
appears to have successfully dealt with the sexual abuse issue.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[19] The imposition of sentence is a matter of discretion. The
sentencing court must balance the objectives and principles set
out in the Criminal Code with the mitigating and aggravating
factors and impose a sentence that appears to be fair and just.
[20] The discretion of a sentencing judge should not be
interfered with lightly. An appellate court will not interfere
with a sentence only because it would have imposed a different
sentence. The Supreme Court of Canada has described this
deferential standard for appellate review of sentences as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to
          consider a relevant factor, or an over-emphasis of the
          appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only intervene to
          vary a sentence imposed at trial if the sentence is demonstrably
          unfit. Parliament explicitly vested sentencing judges with a
          discretion to determine the appropriate degree and kind of
          punishment under the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>(R. v. M.(C.A.) (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327, at 374)</pre>
    <pre>[21] Appellate court deference recognizes the preferred position
of the sentencing judge in being able to assess the offender and
the impact of the offence on those directly affected. The
sentencing judge, who generally lives and resides in the
community or region where the offence was committed, is often
better able to reflect in the sentence the views and values of
that community about the seriousness of the offence and what may
be necessary to protect the community.
[22] A sentencing judge&#146;s decision to impose a custodial rather
than a conditional sentence is accorded the same deferential
standard of review found in M. (C.A.) as a decision about the
type of sentence or the duration of a term of imprisonment:  R.
v. Gagnon (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 194 (Que. C.A.).
[23] In this appeal, the appellant argues that this court should
set aside the custodial term of imprisonment because the
sentencing judge erred in over-emphasizing the objectives of
denunciation and general deterrence. In order for this court to
interfere, it is not enough that we disagree with the emphasis
placed by the sentencing judge on these factors but rather we
must be satisfied that the emphasis placed by the sentencing
judge was unreasonable in the context of all the factors relevant
to the case.
[24] The appellant submits that the only aggravating factors are
the actual circumstances of the offences. All of the other
factors, including the appellant&#146;s reformation and the best
interests of his family, would be better served by a conditional
rather than a custodial sentence. A custodial sentence, the
appellant submits, will be destructive for both  the appellant
and his family. The appellant relies on this court&#146;s decision in
Wismayer in submitting that a conditional sentence structured so
that the appellant would be confined to his residence except for
going to his job and attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous
and his counselling sessions would constitute serious punishment
and is capable of achieving the objectives of denunciation and
general deterrence.
[25] In Wismayer, this court did not go so far as to say that a
conditional sentence can always satisfy the need for denunciation
if all the other factors are neutral or weigh in favour of the
offender. Rather, the case stands for the more limited principle
that a conditional sentence is not automatically unavailable
where the paramount sentencing consideration is denunciation of
the offender&#146;s conduct. Wismayer involved the abuse of a child by
a person in a position of trust and this court concluded that a
conditional sentence was capable of fulfilling the need for
denunciation. Wismayer, however, is distinguishable from the
present case. The breach of trust was less serious in that it did
not involve the abuse of a child by a natural parent. Wismayer
was the 21-year-old son of the complainant&#146;s foster parents. The
sexual abuse in Wismayer was also less serious. It did not
involve oral sex or intercourse. Moreover, in Wismayer, the
original sentence had been imposed before the enactment of the
conditional sentencing provisions. Unlike this case, the court in
Wismayer was free to impose the sentence it thought appropriate
without the need to find the kind of error described in M.(C.A.).
[26] For these reasons, Wismayer, in my view, does not lead to
the conclusion that this court should interfere with the
sentencing judge&#146;s discretion in imposing a custodial sentence.
[27] The appellant also argues that if a conditional sentence is
not imposed in the circumstances of this case, this court would
be judicially creating a category of offence for which
conditional sentences are not available. This, it is argued, is
contrary to the intent of Parliament in making conditional
sentences available for all types of offences when the sentence
imposed is less than two years and the protection of the
community does not require incarceration.
[28] I disagree with this argument. Undoubtedly, the denunciatory
impact of a custodial sentence is greater than that of a
conditional sentence. Before imposing a conditional sentence, a
sentencing court must be satisfied that the sentence is
consistent with the sentencing objectives and principles set out
in s. 718, one of which is the need to denounce the offender&#146;s
conduct. The conduct giving rise to some offences will be so
serious that a court may reasonably conclude that adequate
denunciation can only be achieved through a custodial sentence
notwithstanding that the other relevant factors are neutral or
weigh in favour of a conditional sentence. The imposition of a
custodial sentence in these circumstances does not
constitute a judicial categorization of offences for which
conditional sentences are not available but rather is an
appropriate exercise of a sentencing judge&#146;s discretion in
weighing the various factors in the circumstances of a particular
case.
[29] In my view, the sentencing judge did not unreasonably
emphasize the requirements of denunciation and general
deterrence. He had the benefit of a very complete record. His
reasons for imposing a custodial sentence of two years less one
day reflect a thoughtful approach. He considered the appropriate
factors and properly instructed himself on the applicable legal
principles. The gravity of these offences, the regularity with
which the appellant abused his daughter, the seriousness of that
abuse and the prolonged period during which it occurred required
a strong denunciatory statement. Certainly a concern for
denunciation and general deterrence will not automatically
require a custodial sentence, and in fact there are questions
about the effectiveness of a custodial sentence to achieve
general deterrence. But, in this case, I am satisfied that it was
open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the requirements of
denunciation and general deterrence taken together required a
total deprivation of the liberty of the appellant. I am not
persuaded that this court should interfere on the basis of the
emphasis that he placed on these two factors.
[30] Moreover, the fresh evidence introduced by the appellant did
not significantly change the picture that was before the
sentencing judge. It confirmed, and perhaps brought into sharper
focus, some of the factors that were important to the appellant&#146;s
argument both in the court below and on this appeal. But, that
evidence does not change what I otherwise conclude to be the
proper result on this appeal.
[31] The conclusion I reach that this appeal should be dismissed
is consistent, in general terms, with the results in several
cases where this court has refused to set aside a custodial
sentence for offences involving sexual abuse of a child by a
person in a position of trust:  R. v. G.O., [1997] O.J. No. 1911;
R. v. W.R.N. [1999] O.J. No. 207; R. v. A.F. (1997), 101 O.A.C.
146.
[32] Accordingly, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the
appeal.
