    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong>

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Arnprior Ford Mercury Sales Ltd. (“Arnprior”), T. Booth</pre>
    <pre>Holdings Ltd. (“Holdings”) and Terry Booth (“Booth”) appeal from</pre>
    <pre>a judgment finding each liable to the plaintiff Peat Marwick</pre>
    <pre>Thorne Inc. for damages in the amount $127,191.00, exclusive of</pre>
    <pre>pre-judgment interest.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Arnprior’s appeal is restricted to the quantum of damages.</pre>
    <pre>Holdings and Booth appeal both liability and the quantum of</pre>
    <pre>damages.

</pre>
    <pre>ARNPRIOR

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The trial judge found as a fact that Arnprior purchased the</pre>
    <pre>assets of Brian Beattie Motors Limited (“Beattie Motors”) in</pre>
    <pre>February 1990 for an agreed upon price of $171,000. No appeal is</pre>
    <pre>taken from this finding.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge further found that as of the date of trial,</pre>
    <pre>the balance due and owing from Arnprior to Beattie Motors on the</pre>
    <pre>asset sale was $127,191. In our view, it was open to the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge to make this finding and we see no basis for interfering</pre>
    <pre>with it. In particular, we reject Arnprior’s submission that the</pre>
    <pre>trial judge should have found, based upon the evidence of Brian</pre>
    <pre>Beattie, that the $171,000 purchase price included the sum of</pre>
    <pre>$101,280 representing the price allocated by the parties for the</pre>
    <pre>used car inventory of Beattie Motors. Beattie’s evidence in this</pre>
    <pre>respect conflicted with the testimony of Booth and it did not</pre>
    <pre>accord with the terms of the written agreement between the</pre>
    <pre>parties. Although the trial judge held that the written agreement</pre>
    <pre>was unenforceable, she properly considered it as relevant</pre>
    <pre>evidence.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In these circumstances, it was open to the trial judge to</pre>
    <pre>find that Brian Beattie was simply mistaken in his recollection</pre>
    <pre>and that this aspect of his evidence should be afforded no</pre>
    <pre>weight.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Arnprior did not pursue the other grounds of appeal raised</pre>
    <pre>in its notice of appeal. Accordingly, Arnprior’s appeal is</pre>
    <pre>dismissed with costs.

</pre>
    <pre>T. BOOTH HOLDINGS LTD.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Holdings appeals from the finding of liability against it in</pre>
    <pre>respect of the $127,191 found to be due and owing from Arnprior</pre>
    <pre>to Beattie Motors. Holdings submits that there was no basis in</pre>
    <pre>the evidence to find it liable.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Holdings’ sole shareholder is Booth. Holdings is not</pre>
    <pre>otherwise connected to Arnprior. It was the purchaser of the real</pre>
    <pre>estate but, it is submitted that it was not connected to the</pre>
    <pre>asset purchase and cannot be held liable.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  With respect to Holdings, the trial judge found that</pre>
    <pre>Holdings was “enmeshed” in the asset transaction between Beattie</pre>
    <pre>Motors and Arnprior. The trial judge relied upon three factors to</pre>
    <pre>support this finding.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] First, she noted that the agreement of purchase and sale</pre>
    <pre>relating to the assets of Beattie Motors incorporated terms</pre>
    <pre>referable to the corollary real estate transaction between</pre>
    <pre>Holdings and Messrs. Beattie and Fitzsimmons. Second, she found</pre>
    <pre>it significant that part of the purchase price in the asset sale</pre>
    <pre>was for the cost of leasehold improvements to the building which</pre>
    <pre>Holdings was purchasing in the real estate transaction. From</pre>
    <pre>this, the trial judge concluded that Holdings was obtaining a</pre>
    <pre>benefit for which Arnprior was paying. Third, she noted that</pre>
    <pre>there was no evidence of a formal lease agreement between</pre>
    <pre>Arnprior and Holdings and she concluded that none existed.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] With respect, we are of the view that the trial judge erred</pre>
    <pre>in relying upon these factors to find that Holdings played an</pre>
    <pre>integral role in the asset transaction and that it was, in</pre>
    <pre>effect, a party to it.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] The fact that the asset agreement contained a simultaneous</pre>
    <pre>closing clause referable to the real estate transaction was</pre>
    <pre>wholly unremarkable. Much as the two transactions involved</pre>
    <pre>separate and distinct parties, they were clearly interrelated and</pre>
    <pre>it only made sense that there be simultaneous closings. To say</pre>
    <pre>from this that Holdings was enmeshed in the asset transaction</pre>
    <pre>simply does not follow.

</pre>
    <pre>[13] As for the leasehold improvements, Arnprior agreed to</pre>
    <pre>purchase these improvements as part of the asset deal and they</pre>
    <pre>were specifically excluded from the purchase price paid by</pre>
    <pre>Holdings in respect of the real estate transaction. Accordingly,</pre>
    <pre>it cannot be said that Holdings received an asset for which</pre>
    <pre>Arnprior paid and the trial judge erred in concluding otherwise.

</pre>
    <pre>[14] The trial judge also erred in finding that Holdings and</pre>
    <pre>Arnprior did not enter into a formal lease agreement. There was</pre>
    <pre>simply no evidence one way or the other on this subject and the</pre>
    <pre>trial judge’s finding amounted to speculation.

</pre>
    <pre>[15] Accordingly, we are of the view that the trial judge erred</pre>
    <pre>in finding that Holdings was enmeshed in the asset transaction.</pre>
    <pre>That being so, there was no justification for finding Holdings</pre>
    <pre>liable. Accordingly, the judgment against Holdings cannot stand.</pre>
    <pre>In its place, judgment is granted dismissing the plaintiff’s</pre>
    <pre>claim against Holdings.

</pre>
    <pre>TERRY BOOTH

</pre>
    <pre>[16] With respect to Booth, the trial judge placed considerable</pre>
    <pre>emphasis on the fact that he was a shareholder and the directing</pre>
    <pre>mind of the various corporate entities involved, including</pre>
    <pre>Arnprior, Holdings and Birchcliff Motors Limited. In her opinion,</pre>
    <pre>Booth treated these companies as extensions of himself and made</pre>
    <pre>decisions relating to them without any regard to corporate</pre>
    <pre>formalities.

</pre>
    <pre>[17] By way of example, the trial judge observed that shortly</pre>
    <pre>after the completion of the asset sale, Booth caused Arnprior to</pre>
    <pre>transfer to Birchcliff Motors some of the used car inventory and</pre>
    <pre>parts it had purchased from Beattie Motors. The trial judge took</pre>
    <pre>a dim view of these transactions, about which she had this to</pre>
    <pre>say:</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          There was no evidence of these two companies
          [Arnprior and Birchcliff] even pretending to
          deal at arm’s length on this issue. What was
          good for one was evidently good for the
          other.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[18] With respect, while the trial judge may have been correct in</pre>
    <pre>stating that what was good for one company was evidently good for</pre>
    <pre>the other, she was wrong in concluding that there was no evidence</pre>
    <pre>that the two companies even pretended to deal at arm’s length in</pre>
    <pre>their dealings. To the contrary, there was ample evidence that</pre>
    <pre>the transactions involving Birchcliff were at arm’s length and</pre>
    <pre>that Birchcliff paid valuable consideration for both the parts</pre>
    <pre>and used cars it received.

</pre>
    <pre>[19] Apart from this, we question the relevance of the example</pre>
    <pre>cited by the trial judge to support her conclusion that this was</pre>
    <pre>an appropriate case to pierce the corporate veil of Arnprior and</pre>
    <pre>find Booth personally liable.

</pre>
    <pre>[20] The trial judge found as a fact that it was Arnprior, not</pre>
    <pre>Booth, that purchased the assets of Beattie Motors. There can be</pre>
    <pre>no suggestion therefore, that Arnprior was an afterthought on</pre>
    <pre>Booth’s part to extricate himself from a deal gone sour. Nor can</pre>
    <pre>it be said that the asset transaction between Beattie Motors and</pre>
    <pre>Arnprior was anything other than a bona fide arm’s length</pre>
    <pre>transaction for valuable consideration.

</pre>
    <pre>[21] Once this is understood, it seems to us that Arnpior, albeit</pre>
    <pre>under the direction of Booth, was entitled to deal with the</pre>
    <pre>assets it had purchased from Beattie Motors as it saw fit. How,</pre>
    <pre>in these circumstances, the respondent can submit that Booth,</pre>
    <pre>through Arnprior, wrongfully converted assets it purchased from</pre>
    <pre>Beattie Motors to put them beyond the reach of Beattie Motor’s</pre>
    <pre>unsecured creditors escapes us. The fallacy of this submission</pre>
    <pre>becomes even more apparent when one considers that Beattie</pre>
    <pre>Motor’s bankruptcy occurred some 16 months after the asset deal</pre>
    <pre>had been completed.

</pre>
    <pre>[22] In short, we can find nothing in the evidence to show that</pre>
    <pre>Booth acted fraudulently or dishonestly or for that matter, that</pre>
    <pre>he engaged in any wrongdoing. Nor, as we have pointed out, can it</pre>
    <pre>be said that Arnprior was brought into the picture as an</pre>
    <pre>afterthought on his part to escape personal liability for a deal</pre>
    <pre>gone sour.

</pre>
    <pre>[23] While it is true that Booth acted as the directing mind of</pre>
    <pre>the various corporate entities he controlled, it does not follow</pre>
    <pre>that the corporations were, as the trial judge found, mere</pre>
    <pre>extensions of himself. If that were the case, the tests which</pre>
    <pre>must be met before the corporate veil can be lifted would be</pre>
    <pre>rendered meaningless.

</pre>
    <pre>[24] For these reasons, we are satisfied that the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>erred in lifting the corporate veil of Arnprior to find Booth</pre>
    <pre>personally liable. Accordingly, the judgment cannot stand. In its</pre>
    <pre>place, judgment is granted dismissing the plaintiff’s claim</pre>
    <pre>against him.

</pre>
    <pre>[25] Holdings and Booth are entitled to their costs at trial and</pre>
    <pre>on appeal.</pre></td>
