    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Applicant/Appellant)
               v. JEAN-JACQUES PELLETIER (Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, CHARRON and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Simon N. M. Young,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Todd Ducharme,

    <pre>HEARD:         October 4, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of the summary conviction appeal
court (Mr. Justice J. Bolan) on April 23, 1999</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Our jurisdiction on this appeal is a limited one.   We  are
restricted to questions of law.
[2]  In our view it was open to Bolan J. to find that the trial
judge misapprehended Constable Sward&#146;s evidence as to when the
biting occurred.  Sward&#146;s evidence in cross-examination
significantly qualified his evidence in chief and was consistent
with Constable Saya&#146;s evidence.  The Crown has not shown that
Bolan J. erred in law in the exercise of his appellate
jurisdiction.
[3]  If  so, then the biting occurred after the handcuffing.  The
trial judge obviously found that the officers were attempting to
arrest the respondent and that they did not tell him of the
reason for the arrest.  They were therefore not in the execution
of their duty.  On this record there is no basis for
distinguishing between the two officers who were both present at
the arrest.  This is therefore not a case like R. v. Biron
(1975), 23 C.C.C. (2d) 513 (S.C.C.), a decision relied upon by
the Crown.  However, we agree with the Crown that s. 41 of the
Criminal Code had potential application in this case.  It will be
for a trier of fact to determine whether the amount of force used
to remove the respondent was reasonable and if not, whether the
respondent used excessive force to resist the removal and so
deprived himself of the defence of self-defence.
[4]  Accordingly, we would allow the appeal in part, set aside
the judgment of Bolan J. and order a new trial on a charge of
simple assault.</pre></td>
