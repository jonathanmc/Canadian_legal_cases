</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]       On December 31, 1986 Ronald Clement, the respondent in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this appeal, was found unfit to stand trial on charges arising</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out of serious attacks on his father and mother. He was diagnosed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and has been detained</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">since then in the Oak Ridge maximum security facility at the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre. Eventually, in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">December 1997, he was found fit to stand trial and on March 3,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1998 he was found not criminally responsible on account of mental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">disorder.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]       As a consequence, on April 9, 1998 the Ontario Review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board held a hearing concerning Mr. Clement, as required by</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">s. 672.47(3) of the Criminal Code. The Review Board had before it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the report of the Administrator of the Mental Health Centre dated</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">November 24, 1997 together with an addendum dated April 1, 1998.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">It also heard evidence from Dr. Hector, Mr. Clement's attending</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">psychiatrist, and Ms. P. Moody, his programme director.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]       The Board rendered its decision on April 15, 1998,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ordering that Mr. Clement be transferred to medium security and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">determining that this should be done by moving him to the Whitby</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mental Health Centre. On May 22, 1998 the Board issued its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons for this decision. The essence of those reasons was set</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Having considered all the evidence
          adduced and submissions, the Board finds that
          after twelve years of not being a management
          problem, his risk could be equally managed in
          a medium security facility, however we
          recognize that his misidentification syndrome
          is a major risk to the public. Taking into
          consideration the need to protect the public
          from dangerous persons, the mental condition
          of the accused, and the other needs of the
          accused, the Board is of the unanimous view
          that the least onerous, least restrictive
          disposition is that the accused be
          transferred to a medium security facility in
          Whitby under a standard custodial order.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]       The Administrator, supported by the Attorney General</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">for Ontario, appeals from this decision. They raise two</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">arguments:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     
     1.   The decision to transfer Mr. Clement to medium security
     is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2.   The same is true of the direction that Mr. Clement be
     moved to the Whitby Mental Health Centre.
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     
[5]       For the reasons that follow I have concluded that the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">first argument is correct and that the appeal must therefore</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">succeed.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]       Two provisions of the Criminal Code are relevant to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this matter. The first, s. 672.54, sets out the criteria to be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">applied by the Review Board in making its decision. It reads as</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          672.54         Where a court or Review Board
          makes a disposition pursuant to subsection
          672.45(2) or section 672.47, it shall, taking
          into consideration the need to protect the
          public from dangerous persons, the mental
          condition of the accused, the reintegration
          of the accused into society and the other
          needs of the accused, make one of the
          following dispositions that is the least
          onerous and least restrictive to the accused:
          (a) where a verdict of not criminally
          responsible on account of mental disorder has
          been rendered in respect of the accused and,
          in the opinion of the court or Review Board,
          the accused is not a significant threat to
          the safety of the public, by order, direct
          that the accused be discharged absolutely;
          (b) by order, direct that the accused
          be discharged subject to such conditions as
          the court or Review Board considers
          appropriate; or
          (c) by order, direct that the accused
          be detained in custody in a hospital, subject
          to such conditions as the court or Review
          Board considers appropriate.

[7]       The second, s. 672.78, describes the powers of this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court on appeal from the Review Board. It reads as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          672.78  (1)  The court of appeal may allow an
          appeal against a disposition or placement
          decision and set aside an order made by the
          court or Review Board, where the court of
          appeal is of the opinion that
             (a) it is unreasonable or cannot
             be supported by the evidence;
             (b) it is based on a wrong
             decision on a question of law; or
             (c) there was a miscarriage of
             justice.
          (2)   The court of appeal may dismiss an
          appeal against a disposition or placement
          decision where the court is of the opinion
             (a) that paragraphs (1)(a), (b)
             and (c) do not apply; or
             (b) that paragraph (1)(b) may
             apply, but the court finds that no
             substantial wrong or miscarriage of
             justice has occurred.
          (3)   Where the court of appeal allows an
          appeal against a disposition or placement
          decision, it may
             (a) make any disposition under
             section 672.54 or any placement decision
             that the Review Board could have made;
             (b) refer the matter back to the
             court or Review Board for rehearing, in
             whole or in part, in accordance with any
             directions that the court of appeal
             considers appropriate; or
             (c) make any other order that
             justice requires.

[8]       Given its medical expertise, its specialized knowledge,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and its advantage in observing the witnesses, the Review Board</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">must be accorded curial deference on appeal. Within the broad</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">review parameters set by s. 672.78 the Review Board can and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should rely on its significant expertise to analyze and weigh the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence before it and to come to its decision. However, if this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">court concludes that the decision appealed from is unreasonable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and cannot be supported by the evidence, the Code requires that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the court intervene: see R. v. Peckham (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 766</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">(C.A.) at 777-78.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]       In this case, it is my view that, having appropriate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">regard for the expertise and advantageous position of the Review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board, its decision to move Mr. Clement to a medium security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facility is unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence. I say</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this for three reasons.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] First, the Review Board appears to have used the wrong test</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in reaching its decision. It ordered the transfer of Mr. Clement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a medium security facility because that constituted the least</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">restrictive disposition for him in light of the need to protect</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the public from dangerous persons, his mental condition, and his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">other needs. However, as this court said in R. v. Pinet (1995),</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">23 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.) at 102, these considerations should only</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be applied in choosing among the three alternative dispositions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in paras. (a), (b) and (c) of s. 672.54.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Here, the Review Board was deciding upon the conditions that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should attach to the detention of Mr. Clement in a hospital. In</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">doing so the Code requires the Board to apply the conditions that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">it considers appropriate. While this standard of appropriateness</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">may include consideration of the relative restrictiveness of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">conditions, it is not confined to that.
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] It is not necessary in this case to proceed on the basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the Review Board erred in law by using the wrong test.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Rather, by adopting the approach it did the Review Board focussed</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">only on the risk of escape to the exclusion of essentially all of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the expert evidence. This led it, in my view, to a decision that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">is unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[13] Second, because he had not been a management problem at Oak</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ridge, the Review Board concluded that the risk Mr. Clement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">presented could be managed just as well in a medium security</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facility. In my view, this conclusion does not automatically</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">follow. Indeed, the evidence concerning Mr. Clement was to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contrary. Both his attending psychiatrist and his programme</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">director gave evidence that a move to a medium security facility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">with a more open environment and a new staff unfamiliar to him</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would be traumatic for Mr. Clement and would result in his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">displaying more behaviour indicative of paranoia.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[14] Third and most important, all the expert evidence before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Review Board was to the effect that a move of Mr. Clement from</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Oak Ridge to a medium security facility would be inappropriate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">There was no evidence to the contrary. The decision to move</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Mr. Clement is simply unreasonable on the basis of this record.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[15] The most recent report of the administrator recommended that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">he remain at Oak Ridge. That report indicates that throughout his</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stay there he has allowed staff almost no access to his inner</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">feelings and thought processes. This report, tabled with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Review Board, concludes as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Until the Clinical Team is allowed enough
          access to Mr. Clement's inner psyche to allow
          for further assessment and treatment, the
          team believes that, in the absence of any
          evidence to the contrary, it must assume that
          the level of risk Mr. Clement posed at the
          time of the index offence remains unchanged.
          As such, it is the unanimous recommendation
          of the Clinical Team that Mr. Clement remain
          in Oak Ridge.


[16] The staff gave evidence that Mr. Clement has indicated that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">if he left Oak Ridge he would go off his medication.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[17] His psychiatrist testified that Mr. Clement believes that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">his parents are not his real parents and that this</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">misidentification syndrome remains a major risk factor for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">assault in the future.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[18] Finally, as I have said, the staff were unanimous that a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">move would be disruptive and traumatic for Mr. Clement and would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result in more behaviour indicative of paranoia.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[19] In summary, the decision to move Mr. Clement from Oak Ridge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to a medium security facility is unreasonable. It is not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">supported by the evidence. I would therefore allow the appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[20] Given that Mr. Clement will be subjected to an annual review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">within the next few months in any event, I would exercise the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction given to this court by s. 672.78(3)(a) and order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that Mr. Clement continue to be detained in the Oak Ridge</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Division of the Mental Health Centre at Penetanguishene.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[21] Having thus disposed of this appeal, it is unnecessary to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">deal with the appellants' second argument, namely that the Review</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Board erred in directing that Mr. Clement be moved to the medium</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">security unit of the Whitby Mental Health Centre. Suffice it to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">say that I do not view this as an issue of natural justice</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitling the Whitby Mental Health Centre to notice prior to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order being made. However, I think it is appropriate to reiterate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">what this court said in R. v. Pinet, supra, at p. 103:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The administrators agree in theory with the
          right of the Board to delegate authority to
          transfer, and they also agree in theory that
          the Board has the authority under
          s. 672.54(c) to name a specific hospital for
          detention of the accused. However, their
          counsel argues strongly that the Board, in
          naming a specific hospital, is now
          undertaking what was formerly an
          administrative decision, and that it should
          not do so without clear knowledge of the
          availability within that hospital of the
          required facilities necessary for housing,
          securing and treating the accused. Counsel
          for the administrators says that it may not
          have the appropriate facilities, and that the
          Board should order specific transfers only on
          the basis of clear information as to the
          appropriateness of such a transfer.
               The position of the administrators makes
          good sense. It would be of no assistance to
          anyone to have an accused arrive at a
          hospital where there was no room, inadequate
          security, and inappropriate treatment
          facilities to deal with him.


[22] Hence, it seems to me that a specific order like the order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">in this case requires either some evidence concerning the host</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facility or perhaps some showing by the Review Board in its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reasons of information concerning the facility of which it is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">able to take official notice.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">
[23] In the result, I would allow the appeal and substitute the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order I have indicated.
