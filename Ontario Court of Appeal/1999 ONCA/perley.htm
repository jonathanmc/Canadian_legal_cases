COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
      <pre>RE:            THE PERLEY HOSPITAL (Plantiff/Appellant) v. HER
               MAJESTY THE QUEEN IN RIGHT OF ONTARIO
               (Defendant/Respondent)</pre>
      <pre>BEFORE:        ABELLA, LASKIN and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
      <pre>COUNSEL:       John M. Connolly
               For the appellant</pre>
      <pre>               Leah Price
               For the respondent</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         September 17, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Manton J. dated February 12, 1999</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant submits there are 2 genuine issues for trial:
one relating to the existence of a collateral agreement and the
other to negligent misrepresentation.  In our view, there is no
evidence to support a collateral agreement.  Even if the May 1993
letters could be said to constitute such an agreement, the
interpretation of these letters urged upon us by the appellant
would contradict paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Transfer Agreement
and would therefore be unenforceable.  See Hawrish v. Bank of
Montreal (1969), 2 D.L.R. (3d) 600 at 605.
[2]  As for the negligent misrepresentation issue, we see no
merit in this submission.  Since there is no misrepresentation of
existing facts they do not change our view as to an enforceable
collateral agreement and finally, we would give effect to the
“Entire Agreement” clause in the Transfer Agreement.
[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  In the circumstances,
no costs.</pre></td>
