September 6, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

</pre>
    <pre>The Background
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following trial before O&#146;Driscoll J. and a jury, the
appellant was convicted of the second degree murder of Wayne
Scott and the attempted murder of Megan Sobers.  He was sentenced
to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 15 years
on the conviction for second degree murder and to 10 years
concurrent on the conviction for attempted murder.  He appeals
both conviction and the period of ineligibility for parole.
[2]  In broad overview, the evidence presented by the Crown at
trial was to the effect that the appellant had shot and killed
Scott to avenge a humiliating robbery and assault perpetrated on
the appellant by two of Scott&#146;s friends on the day of the
shootings.  The evidence further indicated that the appellant had
shot and wounded Sobers, a bystander who got in his way when he
was shooting at Scott.  Scott was shot eight times, six times in
the body and twice in the head.  Sobers was shot twice, once in
the arm and once in the thigh.
[3]  At the trial, the Crown called 22 witnesses.  The appellant
testified in his own defence.  He called no other witnesses.</pre>
    <pre>The Appeal Against Conviction</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant&#146;s factum raised six grounds in support of the
appeal against conviction.  We found it necessary to call upon
the respondent only in respect of two of those grounds.  This
endorsement is limited to those two grounds.
[5]  The first ground was that O&#146;Driscoll J., in his charge to
the jury, inadequately outlined the theory of the defence and
failed to relate the evidence to the defence theory.
[6]  The evidence of the Crown against the appellant was
substantial and compelling.  The defence theory was, in essence,
a denial of the Crown&#146;s proposition that the appellant was in
possession of a gun at the time Scott and Sobers were shot and
that he was the person who shot them.  The defence was not based
on any contradictory theory but rather on an attack on the weight
and cogency of the evidence supporting the Crown&#146;s case.  In
O&#146;Driscoll J.&#146;s charge, he reminded the jury a number of times of
the necessary elements of the offences and the requisite standard
of proof, and drew their attention to those aspects of the
evidence that were the subject of particular attack by the
appellant.
[7]  It is the duty of the trial judge to place the defence
before the jury and to refer the jury to the substantial evidence
bearing on the defence in a way that will ensure the jury&#146;s due
appreciation of the evidence.  It is the function of this court
to examine the charge to the jury as a whole to see whether the
jurors would adequately understand the issues involved, the law
relating to the charge the accused is facing, and the evidence
they should consider in resolving the issues.  In our view,
formed from a reading of the charge as a whole, the members of
the jury were presented with a fair picture of the position of
the defence in a manner that ensured their due appreciation of
the evidence that bore upon that position:  R. v. Mullins-Johnson
(1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 117 (Ont. C.A.). at 123; aff&#146;d. (1998),
124 C.C.C. (3d) 381 (S.C.C.).
[8]  The second ground related to certain out-of-court statements
made by Megan Sobers and by her mother, Eileen Sobers.  In the
appellant&#146;s submission, the trial judge erred in admitting these
statements into evidence for their truth, in permitting the
statements to be marked as exhibits and left with the jury during
their deliberations, and in instructing the jury with respect to
the use they could make of these statements.
[9]  Megan and Eileen Sobers were the key witnesses for the Crown
at the trial.  Within fifteen minutes of the shootings, Megan
made a statement to Cindy Taber, a paramedic in the ambulance
that took her to hospital.  On the day of the shootings and in
the days that followed, both Megan and Eileen Sobers made
statements to investigating police officers.  Between Megan and
Eileen, they made a total of seven statements, all of which were
admitted into evidence for the truth of the contents and all of
which, reduced to writing, were given to the jury as exhibits
during their deliberations in the jury room.
[10] As Crown counsel accurately noted, as the days passed, Megan
and Eileen&#146;s statements became progressively more vague and
contradictory as to the identity of the shooter and the
circumstances of the shootings.  In O&#146;Driscoll J.&#146;s ruling
admitting the statements into evidence, he described this
progression as &#147;a strain of feigned amnesia&#148; and the evidence of
these witnesses at trial as &#147;an attempt to annihilate their
earlier statements&#148;.  He found that some person or groups of
persons &#147;has &#145;persuaded&#146; Eileen or Megan Sobers that they should
not follow through in their August 8th, August 9th and August
25th evidence&#148;.
[11] A lengthy voir dire was held with respect to the statements
in question. At the end of the voir dire, O&#146;Driscoll J. analyzed
the statements and, after making reference to the leading hearsay
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada on the subject of
necessity and reliability, he concluded both of these
prerequisites had been established and granted the Crown&#146;s
application to admit them in evidence.  In our view, he correctly
applied the rules for the admissibility of these statements, and
we see no error in their admission into evidence.
[12] It was not by oversight that transcribed copies of the
statements were introduced as exhibits and left with the jury.
O&#146;Driscoll J. specifically dealt with that subject in a ruling at
the conclusion of the Crown&#146;s case.  Noting that he had a
discretion in the matter, he exercised it as he did because of
his concern about the conflicting nature of the contents of the
various statements.  He concluded that it was &#147;proper to place
before the jury all of the statements so that the jury will have
them before them, and they can decide what to accept or what to
reject&#148;.  We see no basis to interfere with the manner in which
he exercised his discretion.
[13] The appellant took issue with O&#146;Driscoll J.&#146;s instructions
to the jury regarding the use they could make of the statements.
In essence, his position was that O&#146;Driscoll J. effectively told
the jury to believe the earlier statements and not to believe the
evidence the witnesses gave in court.  In our view, this is not a
fair characterization of the charge respecting the statements.
O&#146;Driscoll J. cautioned the jury that the out of court statements
were not under oath. He reminded them that both Megan and Eileen
testified that they did not remember what they had said in the
statements or, if they did, they no longer believed that what
they had said was true.  He never expressed to the jury the view
that Megan and Eileen were lying in their testimony at trial.  He
made it clear that the jurors were the sole judges of the facts.
We are not persuaded that he made any error in the manner in
which he charged the jury regarding the use to which the
statements could be put.
[14] In addition to the statements, O&#146;Driscoll J. admitted into
evidence a record of a call to 911 shortly after the shootings,
in which an anonymous caller said that there were &#147;three or four
people outside my window picking up bullets or something in the
grassy area near where the deceased body was found&#148;.  The caller
did not indicate who the people were, and there was no suggestion
of any connection between them and the appellant.  The 911 call
was not admitted for the truth of its contents but simply as part
of the narrative of events as they unfolded on the night of the
shootings, and the content of the conversation did not implicate
the appellant in the shootings.  We see no error in the admission
into evidence of the 911 call.</pre>
    <pre>The Appeal Against the Period of Parole Ineligibility</pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellant was 19 years old at the time of the shootings.
He had a Youth Court record for robbery and use of a firearm in
the commission of an offence.  When the jury was asked for their
recommendation regarding parole ineligibility, 8 members
recommended a period of 10 years and 4 members made no
recommendation.  O&#146;Driscoll J. set the period of parole
ineligibility at 15 years.
[16] The shooting of Scott and Sobers took place outside an
apartment building plagued with an open air drug &#147;flea market&#148;.
A large number of people were present.  With repeated bursts from
a semi-automatic handgun, the appellant killed Scott, his
intended victim, and seriously wounded Sobers, an innocent
bystander.  He placed the lives and safety of many people in
danger.  In these circumstances, the 15-year period of
ineligibility imposed upon the appellant fell within the
acceptance range, reflected no error in principle and was not
clearly unreasonable.  We see no basis to reduce that period.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[17] The appeal against conviction and the appeal against the
period of parole ineligibility are dismissed.
