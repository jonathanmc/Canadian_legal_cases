    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Judge D. M. Nicholas on
September 4, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  Crown properly concedes that the trial judge erred  in
refusing  to give any credit for pre-trial custody by  reason  of
the  conditional sentence.  Pursuant to s. 742.7 of the  Criminal
Code,  the  appellant  will be required to  serve  the  unexpired
portion  of the conditional sentence while he is on parole.   The
trial judge also erred in principle in failing to give sufficient
credit  for  pre-trial  custody during the  time  taken  for  the
disposition of certain pre-trial motions.  The trial  judge  also
was  misinformed  that the appellant had made no  restitution  on
previous restitution orders.
[2]  Having regard to these errors, we are of the view that the
sentence should be reduced to a total of two years' imprisonment.
The appellant agreed that a period of probation including terms
that he seek treatment for his alcoholism and anger management
would be appropriate.  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is
granted, the appeal is allowed, and the sentence for arson is
reduced to one year's imprisonment and two years' probation.  In
addition to the statutory terms, it will be a term of probation
that the appellant report to a probation officer within five
working days of his release from custody and thereafter as
required by the probation officer and that he take treatment for
alcoholism and anger management as directed and approved by his
probation officer.
