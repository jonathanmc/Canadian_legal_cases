    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Douglas J. dated November 21, 1996.

</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant and the complainant Hai Pham are brothers.
They shared an apartment until the spring of 1995, at which time
they had a serious argument which led to the appellant moving
out.  InFrom the spring of 1995 to the night of November 12, 1995
and subsequently, they were engaged in an ongoing feud relating
to unpaid debts and family disputes.  Neither were on good
speaking terms with the other   They were not on good speaking
terms with each other, and some threats of violence were
allegedly exchanged between them.  InFrom July and to November
1995, the complainant&#146;s 1992 Honda Accord was vandalized on no
less than four occasions while it was parked at at his apartment
building, at his workplace, and in the parking lot at the
shopping plaza across from his apartment building.
[2]  Between the hours of midnight and 2:00 a.m. on November 13,
1995, the complainant&#146;s vehicle was vandalized while it was
parked in the parking lot of the shopping plaza across from his
apartment building.  All four tires were punctured with a sharp
object and white spray-paint was sprayed around the side of the
car and on its hood.  Because his car had been vandalized several
times before, the complainant had, earlier in the night of
November 12, 1995, mounted a video camcorder in the window of his
apartment that faced the parking lot and focussed the camera on
his car.  The camera successfully recorded the perpetrator
vandalizing his the complainant&#146;s car.  The complainant said that
on viewing the tape, he immediately recognised his brother, the
appellant, as the individual vandalizing the car.  The
complainant testified that the individual on the tape and the
appellant had similar running shoes, a similar walk, and a
similar shape of face and that this is how he was able to
identify the individual on the tape as the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Upon his arrest and subsequently at trial, the appellant
maintained that on the night of November 12, 1995 he was at the
apartment of his former girlfriend.  This apartment is located in
a building adjacent to the parking lot where the complainant&#146;s
car was vandalised.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On November 21, 1996, Douglas J. found the appellant guilty
on two counts of mischief and subsequently sentenced him to a
term of imprisonment of 90 days on each count, to be served
concurrently.  The appellant appealed his summary offence
conviction to the Ontario Court (General Division), and his
appeal was dismissed by Langdon J. on May 26, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The central evidence at trial against the appellant was the
videotape from the camcorder which clearly showed two episodes,:
the first of a person puncturing the tires of the Honda motor
vehicle; and the second showing his later return to further
vandalize the vehicle by spray-painting it.  The videotape was
played in open court at the trial and again in this court.  The
trial judge stated that with respect to this evidence:

               Now, that doesn&#146;t prove the Crown&#146;s case.  What are the
          indicia of identification here?  First of all, the brother says
          he grew up with his brother, that he spent time in a camp with
          him, a refugee camp, they came to Canada together, they lived
          together, and he swears that the person on the video is his
          brother.  You would think that a person would be able to
          recognize his own brother from the distance and from the view
          that he would&#146;ve had on this camera.    There are some features
          that are distinguishable he says when he looks at this person.
          First of all, he recognizes immediately, right away that it is
          his brother.  Secondly, he recognizes the shoes.  While the shoes
          are common type running shoes, they are high-tops and they do
          have, and it&#146;s obvious on the video that they have a
          distinctive, a different colour than the white high-top shoes.
          And he says he recognizes them because he saw those shoes four
          days before.  There is a way he walks he says, and a way he runs
          that is distinctive.  It is obvious in the video that the person
          walking and running has a loping aspect to the way he, he runs
          and the witness says that his brother has flat feet.  And in my
          view, it certainly is open to this witness to call that walk and
          that run a distinctive run, which he did.
          </pre>
    <pre>          This witness, and it wasn&#146;t even asked of Hai
          Pham when he testified, whether he had a long
          leather coat, but the person in the video
          obviously is wearing a long leather coat.
          And what do we find out from the accused and
          from Hong Le?  On the night in question, he
          was wearing a long leather coat.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The brother Hai Pham is certain that it is
          his brother and that of course, doesn&#146;t mean
          that he cannot be mistaken.  Of course, he
          can be mistaken, but there are indicia
          surrounding his evidence that confirm that it
          was his brother.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  With respect, the trial judge read a great deal more into
this videotape than did this court.  The recording is of
relatively poor quality, which makes it difficult to identify the
perpetrator shown vandalizing the complainant&#146;s car.  The figure
shown in the tape is wearing a hood, and his face is entirely
hidden from the camera because of the hood and the darkness in
the area.  His shoes are not evident at all and the court can
only conclude that the detailed description of the shoes given by
the complainant and repeated by the trial judge results from the
complainant&#146;s recollection of having seen the shoes on his
brother&#146;s feet on another occasion rather than it being a
description of what is shown on the tape itself.  The only
identifying feature is the so-called &#147;loping&#148; run, but I can not
comment upon how distinctive that is.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In addition to our concern about the frailty of the
identification evidence, the appellant tendered fresh evidence in
the form of an affidavit by Long Hoang Bui, who is about the same
size and build as the appellant.  HeMr. Bui had a motive to
vandalize the complainant&#146;s vehicle arising out of the
complainant&#146;s abusive treatment  of a girl friend of his by the
complainantof Mr. Bui&#146;s girlfriend.  He Mr. Bui knew the location
of the complainant&#146;s apartment and was familiar with his car.  In
fact, two weeks after the November 13, 1995 incident of
vandalism, Mr. Bui he later broke into the vehicle and stole the
radio, an offence for which he was convicted.  Mr. Bui states in
his affidavit that he did in, in fact, vandalise the
complainant&#146;s vehicle on the night in question.  His description
of how he carried out the offence is very detailed and it
conforms in many respects to what is seen on the videotape.  The
long coat and  the hood he says he was wearing are evident in the
video tape. There is no evidence that he saw the video tape
before swearing the affidavit and he categorically denies that he
has ever seen it. There are some inconsistencies in his evidence
as revealed in cross-examination, but we are satisfied on the
balance that his testimony meets the third criterion of R. v.
Palmer (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.) at p.205 for the
introduction of fresh evidence on appeal, namely that the
evidence is creditablecredible in the sense that it is reasonably
capable of belief.  The Crown concedes that the due diligence and
relevancy tests are met.  In view of our finding as to the
credibility of the evidence, it is clear that this evidence could
have affected the verdict.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set
aside and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
