</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant raised several grounds of appeal, which,  to
us,  appeared to have considerable merit. We think,  however,  we
need  deal  only with the new ground raised this morning  by  Mr.
Gold, because, in our view, it alone warrants a new trial.

[2]  The evidence of the five complainants was not treated as
similar fact evidence at trial. Therefore, it was important that
the jury be instructed it could only convict the appellant on
each count by applying the evidence relevant to that count alone.
See R. v. B.M. at paragraph 35.

[3]  The trial judge failed to give this instruction, and indeed,
in his charge, invited the jury to consider all the evidence
cumulatively on each count. Ms. Fairburn, with her usual candour,
acknowledged that the judge&#146;s charge fell far short of complying
with the reasons of Rosenberg J.A. in R. v. B.M. The trial
judge&#146;s failure to give a proper limiting instruction is fatal to
the convictions. It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the
other grounds of appeal. The appeal is allowed, the convictions
are quashed and a new trial is ordered.</pre></td>
