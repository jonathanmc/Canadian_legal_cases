    <pre>On appeal from the Orders of Lack J. dated September 15, 1998 and
September 21, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On a motion for summary judgment, Lack J. dismissed the
appellants&#146; action for the return of a real estate agent&#146;s
commission paid on the sale of a property by the appellants under
the power of sale in a mortgage because the appellants had been
paid in full for their mortgage debt.
[2]  In my view, she was correct.  I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellants held the only mortgage on a 96 acre property
fronting on Grandview Street North in Oshawa.  In 1978, the owner
and mortgagor, Operation I Inc. defaulted.  In 1982 the
appellants obtained a judgment on the covenant for the amount
owing, $1,236,114.86 plus interest.
[4]  Operation I held the property in trust for a unit of Del
Corporation Limited.  In 1986 the appellants sued Operation I,
Del and the principals of both alleging fraud  relating to the
mortgage. In 1988, with a large amount of the mortgage debt still
outstanding and interest accruing, the appellants exercised the
power of sale remedy under the mortgage.
[5]  The appellants did not list the property for sale with a
real estate agent.  Rather, they told the agents who inquired
about the property to bring offers with the best price they could
obtain.  The appellants conceded that they did not rely on the
advice of real estate agents to arrive at what they considered to
be the best price.
[6]  In July 1988, the appellants accepted an offer from Geltcorp
Corporation in the amount of $2,791,540.00.  Shortly afterwards,
Kenneth Kronis, a sales person employed by the respondent R.D.
Realty Limited, a licensed real estate broker, approached the
appellants and told them that he had a potential purchaser.  As
it turned out, Geltcorp was unable to complete the purchase.
After the agreement with Geltcorp was terminated, the appellant
James Phillips called Kronis and told him that the property was
again available.
[7]  In November 1988, Kronis presented an offer to the
appellants from Real Property Management Inc. in the amount of
$2,406,500.00.  The appellants signed the offer back to Real
Property increasing the purchase price to $3,000,000.00,
increasing the deposit from $25,000 to $100,00 and reducing the
term of the proposed vendor take-back mortgage from five to three
years.  Real Property accepted the signed back offer and
subsequently assigned its interest in the agreement to the
respondent Angel Camp Investments Limited.  The transaction
closed on January 30, 1989 with Angel Camp taking title.
[8]  At the time of the sale to Angel Camp the amount owing to
the appellants on the mortgage from Operation I for principal and
interest was $2,702,815.00.  As part of the purchase price the
appellants took back a first mortgage from Angel Camp in the
amount of $2,200,000.00.  After closing, Angel Camp paid the
interest on this mortgage to the appellants.  All of the
outstanding principal and interest was paid off in April 1990.
As a result, the appellants were paid in full for the debt owing
to them on the mortgage from Operation I under which they
exercised the power of sale.
[9]  When the property was sold by the appellants to Angel Camp
on January 30, 1989, R.D. Realty was paid a commission of
$120,000.00, four per cent of the sale price, as agent for the
vendors &#147;for procuring the offer.&#148;  The commission was
distributed to four employees of R.D. Realty, the respondents
Richard Drebin and Charles McGrath, Kronis and Raymond Floyd, all
of whom were registered real estate agents.  Drebin was also the
president and a director of R.D. Realty.
[10] Drebin, McGrath and Floyd, through holding companies, had
beneficial interests in the ultimate purchaser, Angel Camp, but
did not disclose that they were licensed agents receiving a part
of the commission and were at the same time purchasing the
property for their own account.
[11] The appellant James Phillips testified that when the offer
from Real Property was presented to him he asked about the
identity of the purchaser.  In response Kronis and Drebin only
told him that it was &#147;a big developer.&#148;  In April 1990, Angel
Camp sold the property to Kose Developments Inc. for
$6,238,895.00, realizing a profit of over $3,000,000.00.
[12] The appellants instituted this action in May 1990.  After
two sets of amendments to the statement of claim, the appellants
had named a total of 12 defendants. They alleged that those
defendants who acted as real estate agents on the sale to Angel
Camp breached fiduciary duties by failing to disclose that they
had interests in the company that purchased the property and by
acting in a conflict of interest.  They alleged that the other
defendants, all of whom benefited directly or indirectly from the
purchase, had conspired with the defendants who owed fiduciary
duties to induce the appellants to sell the property at less than
fair market value so that the property could be resold at a
substantial profit.  The appellants&#146; claims for damages included
a claim for disgorgement of the profit realized on the resale to
Kose and a claim for the repayment of the real estate agent&#146;s
commission in the amount of $120,000.00.
[13] The only other relevant fact is that the appellants settled
their fraud action against the mortgagor, Operation I and the
other defendants in October 1989 and exchanged mutual releases
relating to claims arising from the mortgage.</pre>
    <pre>MOTION BEFORE SHARPE J.</pre>
    <pre>[14] On September 20, 1995, two of the defendants, Richard
Rutherford and Kidkare Holdings Inc., moved before Sharpe J. for
summary judgment seeking to have the claims against them
dismissed.  Rutherford and Kidkare were not real estate agents
involved in the sale by the appellants to Angel Camp.   Their
role, the appellants alleged, was that they had a beneficial
interest in Angel Camp and shared in the profit on the resale.
[15] Sharpe J. allowed the motion and dismissed the claims
against Rutherford and Kidkare.  In his reasons, reported at
(1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 351 (Gen. Div.),  Sharpe J. made several
findings that resulted in the appellants narrowing their claims
against the remaining defendants.  He found that although R.D.
Realty was described as an agent in the Agreement of Purchase and
Sale, neither R.D. Realty nor the individual agents involved in
the transaction, who received a share of the commission, owed a
fiduciary duty to the appellants.  In reaching this conclusion,
he said, at p. 358:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The facts clearly indicate, however, that there was no
          reliance by the plaintiffs on the advice of R.D. Realty or the
          other defendants, that there was no relationship of trust and
          confidence between the plaintiffs and the defendants, and that
          the plaintiffs did not confer upon the defendants any power or
          discretion to be exercised on their behalf.  Moreover, there is
          no suggestion that the defendants took advantage of the
          plaintiffs.  They paid fair market value for the property.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[16] Sharpe J. also found that the appellants&#146; claims against
Rutherford and Kidkare would fail because they had been paid in
full for their mortgage debt.  They sold under a power of sale,
not a foreclosure.  Any surplus, he concluded, belonged to the
mortgagor, not the appellants. The appellants&#146; claims for damages
were not brought on behalf of the mortgagor but rather on their
own behalf.  The result, Sharpe J. found, was that the
appellants&#146; interest was limited to recovery of the mortgage debt
and that their claim for additional damages must fail.  He also
found that the release from Operation I, the mortgagor, and Del
executed in October 1989 was not an assignment of their
entitlement to any surplus on the sale to the appellants.  In
short, he concluded that even if the appellants were able to
establish a claim against any of the defendants in the action for
breach of fiduciary duty, their claims would still fail because
they could not establish any damages.
[17] In his reasons, Sharpe J. referred to s. 31(1) of the Real
Estate and Business Brokers Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.4, and
observed that the real estate agent defendants should have
disclosed their status to the appellants.  He left open the issue
whether this failure would have implications for the appellants&#146;
claim for the return of commission.
[18] This court dismissed the appellants&#146; appeal against the
decision of Sharpe J. reported at (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 158.
Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was denied: [1996]
S.C.C.A. No. 542 (Q.L.).</pre>
    <pre>MOTION BEFORE LACK J.</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellants sought to proceed with their action against
the remaining defendants.  However, in light of the findings of
Sharpe J., they limited their claim to the return of the real
estate commission.  For reasons not disclosed in the record, the
action was stayed or discontinued against all but five of the
remaining defendants.
[20] Three of the remaining defendants, R.D. Realty, Drebin and
Rough Rider Investments Inc., moved for summary judgment seeking
to have the action dismissed against themselves and the other two
remaining defendants, Angel Camp and McGrath.
[21] On September 15, 1998, Lack J. allowed the motion and
dismissed the claim against all five remaining defendants.  In
doing so, she relied on Sharpe J.&#146;s conclusion that the
plaintiffs had suffered no damage because they had been paid in
full for their mortgage debt. She concluded that the plaintiffs
were estopped from re-opening this issue.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[22] The appellants base their claim for the return of the real
estate commission on allegations of breach of contract and
conspiracy.  In my view, both of these causes of action must
necessarily fail.  It is an essential element of each cause of
action that parties seeking recovery must prove that they have
suffered damage.  Absent proof of actual damage the causes of
action will fail.  See, for example Canada Cement La Farge Ltd.
v. British Columbia Lightweight Aggregate Ltd., [1983] 1 S.C.R.
452 at pp. 471-72 (conspiracy); and Peterson v. Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce (1992), 27 R.P.R. (2d) 115 (Sask. C.A.) (breach
of contract).
[23] The only damage that is now claimed by the appellants is the
loss of $120,000 paid to R.D. Realty for the real estate
commission on the sale to Angel Camp.  The difficulty the
appellants face is that they did not incur this loss.  The
appellants sold the property as mortgagees under the power of
sale in the mortgage from Operation I.  The appellants&#146; recovery
from the proceeds of sale is limited to repayment of the mortgage
debt.
[24] Section 27 of the Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.40
provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               27.  The money arising from the sale shall be applied by the
          person receiving the same as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Firstly, in payment of all the expenses
          incident to the sale or incurred in any
          attempted sale;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Secondly, in discharge of all interest
          and costs then due in respect of the mortgage
          under which the sale was made;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Thirdly, in discharge of all the
          principal money then due in respect of the
          mortgage;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Fourthly, in payment of the amounts due
          to the subsequent encumbrancers according to
          their priorities;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Fifthly, in payment to the tenants of
          the mortgagor of the rent deposits paid under
          section 118 of the Tenant Protection Act,
          1977 where the rent deposit was not applied
          in payment for the last rent period,
          </pre>
    <pre>               and the residue shall be paid to the
          mortgagor.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[25] It is undisputed that the mortgage debt owing to the
appellants has been paid in full.  The commission, if it were
ordered to be repaid, would form part of the residue of money
arising from the sale, and would properly belong to the
mortgagor.  The appellants therefore have no entitlement to this
money.  They will not suffer any loss if the respondents retain
the commission.
[26] Moreover, I agree with the conclusion of Sharpe J. that the
release executed by the mortgagor, Operation I, and Del in
October 1989 does not constitute an assignment of any entitlement
or right that the mortgagor may have to the surplus realized on
the sale, including the return of the commission.  It is nothing
more than a release of claims the mortgagor may have against the
appellants, nothing more.
[27] The release contained the standard language found in many
releases.  The mortgagor, Operation I, Del and the other
defendants in the fraud action did &#147;&#133; remise, release and forever
discharge &#133; [the appellants] &#133; from any and all actions, causes
of action, suits, claims and demands &#133;&#148; arising out of the
mortgage to the appellants and arising out of the sale of the
land.
[28] There is a serious question whether the release could apply
to a claim for the return of the real estate commission given
that neither the mortgagor nor the appellants were aware of the
existence of this possible claim in October 1989 when the release
was signed.  In any event, the wording of the release is clear.
It protects the appellants against claims by the mortgagor.  It
does not transfer or assign any rights that the mortgagor may
have.  The release does not assist the appellants in their claim
for the real estate commission.
[29] Further, it is clear that the appellants do not make the
claim for the return of the commission on behalf of the
mortgagor.
[30] The appellants, as mortgagees selling under a power of sale,
owed duties to the mortgagor to act in good faith and to act in a
prudent and business like manner with a view to obtaining as high
a price as was fairly and reasonably available, in the
circumstances.  See Matthie v. Edwards (1847), 16 L.J. Ch. 405;
Re Sartis and Anderson (1984), 7 D.L.R. (4th) 227 at pp. 233-34
(Man. C.A.); and Hausman v. O&#146;Grady (1986), 61 O.R. (2d) 96 at
pp. 102-07 (H.C.J.), aff&#146;d (1989), 67 O.R. (2d) 735 (C.A.).  This
duty could, in some circumstances, require a mortgagee to
cooperate with the mortgagor in recovering money resulting from a
sale that accrues to the benefit of the mortgagor.  That,
however, is not this case.  The appellants take the position that
they are not suing on behalf of the mortgagor but rather on their
own behalf.  The mortgagor has made no claim against the
appellants for the return of the commission and indeed if it did
so the appellants would resist.  This is not an action that has
been brought by the appellants in order to fulfil their duties as
selling mortgagees to the mortgagor.
[31] In my view, the appellants have suffered no damage from the
alleged breach of contract and the alleged conspiracy and their
claims based on these causes of action were properly dismissed by
the motions judge.
[32] The only remaining claim is for exemplary or punitive
damages.  In view of the conclusions I have reached above, there
is no basis for this claim.
[33] The appellants argue that the motions judge erred in
dismissing the action against the two defendants, Angel Camp and
McGrath,  who were not moving parties on the motion for summary
judgment.  I see no merit in this argument.  The notice of motion
specifically sought judgment dismissing the claim against all of
the remaining defendants.  The motion was argued on that basis.
The reasons for allowing the motion to dismiss the claims against
the moving parties apply equally to Angel Camp and McGrath.  It
would make no sense in these circumstances to have the action
continue against any of the defendants.
[34] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre>
    <pre>CROSS-APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[35] The respondents cross-appeal against the order for costs
made by the motions judge.
[36] The motions judge ordered costs to the three respondents who
brought the motion for summary judgment in the amount of 50 per
cent of their party and party costs of the action and the motion.
She did not order costs for the respondents Angel Camp and
McGrath.
[37] The motions judge gave two reasons for reducing the amount
of costs that would have otherwise been awarded to a party
successfully moving for summary judgment.  She considered it
appropriate to send a message to the respondents that their lack
of disclosure was questionable and that it should not be
condoned.  She was also of the view that the respondents should
have moved for summary judgment when the earlier motion was
brought before Sharpe J. and that their failure to do so unduly
prolonged the proceedings.  She described the conduct of the
respondents as being &#147;less than exemplary.&#148;
[38] The respondents submit that the motions judge erred and that
she should have awarded them costs on a solicitor client basis.
The respondents argue that the appellants knew that they had been
paid in full as mortgagees, that they concealed this fact for a
considerable time during the course of the litigation, that they
made unfounded allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and
conspiracy, that they unnecessarily prolonged the action, that
they were not forthcoming in the disclosure required under the
rules of civil procedure, and that there was no reason for
departing from the normal rule that costs should follow the
event.
[39] Although the motions judge&#146;s reasons on the issue of costs
are brief, she did consider the appellants&#146; conduct of the action
and whether they should have proceeded after the decision of
Sharpe J.  The order for costs is discretionary.  In my view, it
was open to the motions judge to consider the conduct of the
respondents in failing to make disclosure of their interest in
the purchasing company as a factor that should weigh against them
in making the appropriate cost order. I think she was also
correct in considering the failure of the respondents to join in
the earlier summary judgment motion.  The issues were essentially
the same and the respondents&#146; failure to join in the earlier
motion caused unnecessary delay and expense.
[40] I see no basis to interfere with the motions judge&#146;s
exercise of her discretion with respect to the costs and would
dismiss the cross-appeal with costs to the appellants.  In
determining the amount of costs to be attributed to the appeal
and the cross-appeal respectively, I would do so on a basis of 80
per cent for the appeal and 20 per cent for the cross-appeal.
