    <pre>HEARD:         May 17, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of E.R. Browne J. dated August 18,
1997
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant&#146;s action based on the respondent&#146;s alleged
breach of the provisions of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act was
dismissed. In her appeal, the appellant submits that:
     </pre>
    <pre>1.   The trial process was unfair in that the trial judge was
biased or acted in such a way as to give rise to a reasonable
apprehension of bias.
2.   There was non-disclosure or late disclosure by the
respondent. The appellant contends that she is entitled to a new
trial on this ground.
3.   The trial judge misapprehended the evidence and made
findings that were not supported by the evidence. This ground of
appeal generally concerns the trial judge&#146;s finding that the
appellant was a credible, but not a reliable witness.
     </pre>
    <pre>     </pre>
    <pre>[2]  We have reviewed the trial record. The trial judge&#146;s
interventions were relatively benign and infrequent and, in our
view, did not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. The
trial judge&#146;s criticism of counsel for the appellant for speaking
to the appellant at a recess during her examination-in-chief was
unfortunate and wrong. However, this did not affect the findings
made by the trial judge or his conclusion on liability in any
way. Counsel for the appellant made it clear to the trial judge
that he spoke to the appellant during an adjournment about
evidence that she was yet to give, not evidence that she had
given. There was nothing wrong with counsel speaking to the
appellant as he did in the circumstances.
[3]  The appellant&#146;s real complaint in respect of disclosure is
about late disclosure rather than non-disclosure. In the face of
the late disclosure of certain witness statements, counsel for
the appellant asked for an adjournment and as it turned out the
trial did not proceed until the afternoon of the following day.
In that way the appellant obtained the adjournment that she
sought, although the trial judge did not explicitly grant the
adjournment request. We see no prejudice arising out of any
aspect of the late disclosure in the particular circumstances of
this case.
[4]  All of the trial judge&#146;s findings are supported by evidence
that the trial judge accepted. In reaching the conclusions that
he did, we are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended
any of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>     Conclusion:</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
