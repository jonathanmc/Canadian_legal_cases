    <pre>[1]  The complainant was in a position to identify the appellant
as the man that he ejected from his home earlier in the evening.
He was not in a position to identify his assailant, but the man
found shortly after the assault in his premises and under
suspicious circumstances was the same man that the complainant
said that he had earlier ejected.

[2]  The appellant gave an explanation for his presence in the
complainant&#146;s home that the trial judge rejected. The trial judge
was entitled to find the appellant guilty on this evidence. We
have not been persuaded that the trial judge relied upon hearsay
testimony in arriving at his verdict.

[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
