</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 4, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction on May 23, 1996, imposed by
Thompson J. sitting with a jury and from the sentence imposed by
Thompson J. on September 3, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant seeks to introduce fresh evidence concerning a
discussion between counsel and the trial judge. The discussion
took place in the judge&#146;s chambers at some point during the
trial, after the appellant had commenced her testimony.
[2]  Counsel for the appellant seeks to rely on this evidence in
further support of the allegation that the trial judge&#146;s conduct
during the course of the trial created an apprehension of bias or
gave the appearance of unfairness.  We did not call upon the
Crown to respond to this application.  In our view, the fresh
evidence should not be admitted.  At its highest, the trial
judge&#146;s remark consisted of a gratuitous comment to counsel as to
the observations he was making of the jury.  The evidence does
not support the appellant&#146;s contention that the trial judge
embarked on plea negotiations.
[3]  In any event, the trial judge was not the trier of fact.
The cases relied upon by the appellant, in our view, have no
application to the circumstances of this case and, further, the
proposed evidence, in our view, not give rise to any suggestion
of apprehension of bias.
[4]  We also find it worthy to note that no issue was raised with
respect to this chambers discussion, either at trial or at the
time the appeal was initiated.  The affidavits of counsel were
not obtained until some three years after the event.  They
attempt to reconstruct what constituted unrecorded proceedings at
trial.  Any allegation of bias is serious.  It would be unfair to
call upon the respondent to respond to this allegation long after
the event when the memories are bound have failed.  This delay in
obtaining the proposed fresh evidence also affects its
reliability.
[5]  In all the circumstances, we are of the view that it would
not be in the interest of justice to admit this evidence and the
application is denied.
[6]  The appellant appeals her conviction and sentence on three
counts of fraud.  Of the several grounds of appeal advanced on
conviction, we called upon the Crown only with respect to the
question of the appearance of bias.  In our opinion, although the
questions asked by the trial judge at the conclusion of the re-
examination of the appellant were better left unasked, the
appellant could not reasonably have considered that she had not
had a fair trial.  A reasonably-minded person who had been
present throughout the trial would consider that the appellant
had had a fair trial.  We would dismiss the appeal as to
conviction.
[7]  With respect to sentence, we agree that a custodial sentence
was an appropriate consideration in this case.  We note that, at
the time the appellant was sentenced, the provisions with respect
to conditional sentences had only just come into force and no
reference was made to them by anyone.  The appellant is a first
offender.  She is not a danger to the community.  Having regard
to the fresh evidence concerning her health problems, we are of
the opinion that it would be appropriate to grant leave to appeal
the sentence, set aside the sentence of ninety days imprisonment
to be served intermittently and order that the appellant serve
her sentence in the community by way of a conditional sentence of
ninety days.  The probation order of one year shall be reduced to
a period of six months.
