    <pre>On appeal from the judgments of Benotto J. of June 17 and 25,
1996
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Kenneth Arenson, a solicitor, appeals from decisions of
Benotto J. made June 17 and 25, 1996 respecting the assessment of
Arenson&#146;s solicitor and client account to his client, John
Plater.  Arenson acted on behalf of Plater and others against the
Canadian Red Cross and others with respect to damages suffered as
a result of the use of infected blood.
[2]  As a preliminary to the actual assessment, Plater brought an
application for an order that he was not liable for a pro rata
portion of the time docketed by Arenson to so-called &#147;general
files&#148;.  On June 17, 1996, Benotto J. granted a declaration to
that effect.  Benotto J. then assessed the value of the services
rendered on behalf of Plater at $4,260, excluding in the process,
evidence respecting those general files.  As Plater had already
paid $4,489.05, Arenson was ordered to refund the excess of
$225.05.
[3]  Arenson appeals from both the declaration and the
assessment.
[4]  His position is that in making the decision of June 17,
1996, Benotto J. concerned herself only with the documentary
evidence of retainer and disregarded or gave insufficient weight
to the oral evidence that tended to support the proposition that
Plater and others agreed to be responsible on a pro rata basis
for fees incurred not on any specific file or files but on behalf
of all clients or on behalf of particular classes of clients
generally.
[5]  In dealing with this argument, Benotto J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Solicitors&#146; Act and the common law are founded on the
          premise that the client should be protected.  It is also well
          settled law that when there is any doubt or ambiguity, it is to
          be resolved in favour of the client.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  issue of these &#147;general files&#148;  is
          fraught  with  doubt and  ambiguity  and  the
          doubt  must  be  resolved in  favour  of  the
          client.
          </pre>
    <pre>                While  I have no objection in principle
          to  keeping  one docket file for a  group  of
          clients, each client must agree in advance to
          be  responsible for a pro rata share of  that
          file if that is how the solicitor intends  to
          charge.   Otherwise, the solicitor must  show
          that  the  work  done  in  the  general  file
          relates to the client charged for the time.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Clients  know they will be  responsible
          for work done on their files.  If they are to
          be charged for work done on other files, they
          should be told in advance.  Mr. Arenson  took
          the  trouble  to create retainer  agreements,
          none   of  which  referred  to  the  clients&#146;
          obligations  regarding these  general  files.
          As  Master  Clark stated in Gardiner  Roberts
          and MacLean:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     There can be no doubt that because
               the  solicitor has more information, the
               solicitor has more obligation.
          </pre>
    <pre>                If  a client is to be charged for  work
          that  is  not  with respect  to  his  or  her
          own   file,   he  or  she  should   know   in
          advance.   The  client should  be  told  what
          work  would  be  docketed to that  file,  how
          it   would  benefit  him  or  her  and   what
          portion  of  the  fees would  be  charged  to
          him    or    her.    This   is   particularly
          crucial  in  a  complex  case  such  as  this
          where      different     issues      affected
          different  clients.   The  onus  to  do  this
          is on the solicitor.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  We agree with those statements.  In the present case, the
solicitor entered into a number of agreements in writing with the
client.  Each of these contained a paragraph to the effect that
since similar cases were being prosecuted by the solicitor &#147;and
one or more test cases will be prosecuted, I authorize the use of
funds held in trust for me to be applied against the
disbursements of the test cases, as well as for my own case&#148;.
There was no similar or parallel provision with respect to fees.
[7]  The Solicitors&#146; Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.S.15, s.16.(1) provides
for agreements in writing between solicitors and clients as to
compensation.  Section 23 of that Act provides that no action may
be brought upon such an agreement but questions respecting its
validity, effect or enforcement may be resolved by application to
the court.  It was pursuant to this section that Plater made his
application.
[8]  If a solicitor wishes to enforce an agreement respecting
compensation against a client, that agreement must be in writing.
If an oral agreement is made, the client may enforce it but the
solicitor may not.
[9]  In Cuttell v. Roberts (1974), 4 O.R. (2d) 649, this court
dealt with such a situation.  Cuttell, a solicitor, had acted for
Roberts over a period of years.  Accounts were rendered and some
payments were made, both sporadically.  Eventually, the parties
orally agreed to settle for a lump sum in a reduced amount.  The
amount was not paid.  Cuttell sued and the trial judge found that
there was consideration for the defendant&#146;s agreement and he
therefore gave judgment on a settled account for $14,630.50.
[10] This court, Jessup, Arnup and Estey JJ.A., after referring
to the above noted sections and the English practice regarding
same, set aside the judgment at trial and dismissed the action.
Reference was made to Fitch v. Fort Frances Pulp &amp; Paper Co. Ltd.
(1927), 61 O.L.R. 252, in which Middleton J.A. in giving the
unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division expressed the
court&#146;s view of the effect of the two leading English decisions
at p.254 as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               As we understand the decisions of the Court of Appeal in
          Clare v. Joseph, [1907] 2 K.B. 369, and in Gundry v. Sainsbury,
          [1910] 1 K.B. 645, it is now established that the provisions of
          the Solicitors Act in question were intended to confer upon a
          solicitor the right to make an agreement with his client if he
          complies with the terms of the Act and to invalidate as against
          the solicitor any agreement that does not comply with the
          provisions of the Act.  But the statute does not take from the
          client the right to rely upon any parol agreement which the
          solicitor may make.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Plater denied any oral agreement to be responsible for fees
earned on a &#147;general files&#148; basis.  It would appear from Fitch
and Cuttell that even had such an agreement been established, it
could not be enforced by the solicitor.
[12] On the argument of this matter, it was made clear that
whether or not the appeal respecting the declaration of June 17,
1996 was successful, no further proceedings would be taken as
against Plater.  There is, therefore, no need to deal with the
decision of Benotto J. of June 25, 1996.
[13] The appeals are therefore dismissed with costs as of one
appeal.
