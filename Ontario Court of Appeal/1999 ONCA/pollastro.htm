    <pre>ABELLA J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from an order requiring Reesa Pollastro to
return her child, Tyler Pollastro, to California. The order was
made as a result of an application by the child&#146;s father, John
Pollastro, pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects
of International Child Abduction, Can. T.S.1983 No. 35, which
requires the return of children wrongfully removed from their
habitual residence. The mother&#146;s defence to the application was
that she had fled from California to Canada with their 6-month-
old child because of the father&#146;s violence toward her, and that
to return to California with the child would result in the child
being exposed to an intolerable situation, thereby justifying the
application of the exception to a child&#146;s required return found
in Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention.</pre>
    <pre>[2]    The   two  Articles  of  the  Hague  Convention  generally
applicable  to this appeal are Articles 12 and 13. The particular
provision at issue is Article 13(b).
          </pre>
    <pre>               Article 12
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where a child has been wrongfully
          removed or retained in terms of Article 3
          and, at the date of commencement of the
          proceedings before the judicial or
          administrative authority of the Contracting
          State where the child is, a period of less
          than one year has elapsed from the date of
          the wrongful removal or retention, the
          authority concerned shall order the return of
          the child forthwith.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The judicial or administrative
          authority, even where the proceedings have
          been commenced after the expiration of the
          period of one year referred to in the
          preceding paragraph, shall also order the
          return of the child, unless it is
          demonstrated that the child is now settled in
          its new environment.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where the judicial or administrative
          authority in the requested State has reason
          to believe that the child has been taken to
          another State, it may stay the proceedings or
          dismiss the application for the return of the
          child.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Article 13
          </pre>
    <pre>               Notwithstanding the provisions of the
          preceding Article, the judicial or
          administrative authority of the requested
          State is not bound to order the return of the
          child if the person, institution or other
          body which opposed its return establishes
          that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the person, institution or other
               body having the care of the person of the
               child was not actually exercising the custody
               rights at the time of removal or retention,
               or had consented to or subsequently
               acquiesced in the removal or retention;  or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  there is a grave risk that his or
               her return would expose the child to
               physical or psychological harm or
               otherwise place the child in an
               intolerable situation. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               The judicial or administrative authority
          may also refuse to order the return of the
          child if it finds that the child objects to
          being returned and has attained an age and
          degree of maturity at which it is appropriate
          to take account of its views.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In considering the circumstances
          referred to in this Article, the judicial and
          administrative authorities shall take into
          account the information relating to the
          social background of the child provided by
          the Central Authority or other competent
          authority of the child&#146;s habitual residence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[3]  Under Article 12, a child who has been wrongfully removed
must be returned forthwith;  but under Article 13(b), children
need not be returned if the evidence establishes that the return
represents a &#147;grave risk&#148; to the children either of serious harm
or of an otherwise intolerable situation. The issue in this
appeal is whether Article 13(b) is available to resist a child&#146;s
return when the reason for the child&#146;s removal is because there
has been violence in the home directed primarily at the parent
who removed the child.</pre>
    <pre>     FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Reesa Obrant met her future husband John Pollastro in
Montreal in June, 1995. In October of the same year, she moved to
Syracuse to live with him. In April, 1996, they moved to
California where John&#146;s parents lived, and were married there in
August, 1996. John is an American citizen. Reesa has dual
Canadian and American citizenship.

[5]  Their child, Tyler Benjamin, was born on February 27, 1997.
It is clear from the evidence that even though she had full-time
paid employment as co-manager of a GAP store, Reesa was the
parent who took primary responsibility for the care of their son.
She was also the main breadwinner in the home, as John, a tow
truck driver, was employed only intermittently during the
marriage.

[6]  Considerable evidence was led about John&#146;s unreliability:
his disappearances for days without letting Reesa know where he
was;  his not picking his son up from the daycare facility as
anticipated;  his regularly being unavailable, without warning,
to take care of Tyler when Reesa could not, resulting either in
her leaving work early or getting emergency baby-sitting help
from a co-worker&#146;s mother, Diana Poe;  and his drug use,
including a guilty plea to a charge of possession of
methamphetamines on February 6, 1998. While this factual context
may be more germane to the ultimate determination of which parent
should have custody, it is also contextually relevant to the
assessment of whether Tyler&#146;s return to California puts him at
&#147;grave risk&#148; of being exposed to &#147;an intolerable situation&#148;
within the meaning of Article 13(b) of the Hague Convention.

[7]  At the heart of Reesa Pollastro&#146;s claim that she is entitled
to invoke the Article 13(b) exception to the otherwise
presumptive requirement to return the child, is the evidence of
the physical abuse to which she was increasingly subjected by her
husband. There was also evidence of his use of degrading language
to her, in private and in public. Co-workers gave evidence of
John calling the store and screaming so loudly at Reesa that they
could hear his epithets several feet away. His calls were not
only persistent, they were persistently abusive. From time to
time, including during the last weekend they were together, he
would disable Reesa&#146;s car so that she could not go anywhere.

[8]  The most obvious reflection of his irrational outbursts was
his physical violence toward his wife. John is 5&#146;9&#148; and weighs
175 pounds;  Reesa is 5&#146;5&#148; and weighs 105 pounds. Friends spoke
of their own and of Reesa&#146;s fear of John&#146;s behaviour. Her co-
workers gave evidence of bruises on her neck and arms. Diana Poe,
who eventually drove Reesa and her son to the airport to return
to Canada, saw Reesa when she was getting out of the shower the
morning of her departure. In her words:
          </pre>
    <pre>       I&#146;m certain that my face betrayed the horror of what I saw,
 a full grown adult woman, whose emaciated body was bruised front
 and back.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[9]  The incidents of violence escalated on September 4, 1997. On
that date, John assaulted Reesa when she came home from work,
ripping her T-shirt and causing her to bang her head against the
floor. He later locked her in the bedroom. The morning of
September 6, 1997, Reesa was scheduled to work for three hours.
John had another temper outburst, refused to look after Tyler,
and disabled Reesa&#146;s car. She was forced to walk the mile to work
carrying the baby, frightened because John followed her most of
the way. At work, she decided she had to leave John for her own
and for Tyler&#146;s safety. Diana Poe drove Reesa and Tyler home
after work so Reesa could collect clothing for herself and her
child. Her husband started assaulting her, but she escaped
through the bedroom window which was only two feet above the
ground. She ran to the waiting car, and ended up at Diana Poe&#146;s
home. When Reesa called her father to tell him what had happened,
he told her to take the next plane home to Canada. She returned
to Canada with Tyler on September 7.

[10] On September 10, Reesa went with Tyler to Dr. Alan Kassel
who documented not only the significance and extent of the
bruises on her neck, arms, back, shoulders and thighs, but noted
too the child&#146;s agitated state. A practising physician for almost
thirty years, Dr. Kassel made the following observations in an
affidavit dated August 10, 1998 about changes in Tyler&#146;s
condition over the next several months:
          </pre>
    <pre>          When I first examined Tyler on the 10th of September, 1997,
      I found him easily startled and somewhat agitated. Since that
      appointment I have seen various significant improvements in
      Tyler&#146;s disposition. Tyler seems to have calmed down and no
      longer behaves like a frightened infant.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[11] The evidence of others who saw Reesa on her return to Canada
confirmed her bruises, her fear for her own and for Tyler&#146;s
safety, and John&#146;s continuing threats through a pattern of
harassing telephone calls. In addition, her former co-workers at
the GAP in California complained to the police because of the
harassing and threatening telephone calls they were constantly
receiving at work and at home from John.

[12] John&#146;s menacing telephone calls to Canada were made to
Reesa, to her mother with whom she lives, to her father, and to
her cousin Cheryl Primerano. Many of the calls were vituperative
and irrational, and reflected John&#146;s violent temper:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.)  From the evidence of Cheryl Primerano:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               John became the person that I spoke to
          more than I spoke to anyone else for a period
          of about six to eight weeks. I woke up to his
          phone calls and I went to sleep to his phone
          calls. I did everything in my power to calm
          him and try to make some sort of peace
          between him and Reesa. For the most part, he
          was co-operative and willing to listen to
          what I had to say. There was another side to
          that coin however. There were many times that
          he threatened me and gave me terrifying
          messages to give to Reesa &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          These were his exact words on one occasion:
          &#147;Do not let Reesa come home. I can&#146;t promise
          that she will be safe&#148;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Over the next few weeks, his mood
          changed every time we spoke. One time he
          wanted my sympathy and support and told me
          that I was the only person that cared about
          him and that he loved me and needed me to
          help him and the next conversation he would
          be threatening me, threatening Reesa, Tyler
          and our whole family. He told me that if he
          could not have Tyler that nobody would.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               He also told me that he did not give a
          damn about Tyler he just wanted revenge on
          Reesa for humiliating him. He could always
          have another baby he told me but he wanted to
          punish Reesa and what better punishment than
          to take the one thing she loved more than
          life itself.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               He made death threats to Reesa and said
          he would not rest until she was in jail and
          would never see her son again. He promised to
          send Tyler&#146;s clothes and toys that were
          waiting for him in California and then said
          that his son did not deserve those beautiful
          things and that he was going to sell
          everything and get drunk with the money.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               During the time that we were getting
          along, he completely acknowledged his drug
          abuse to me. Most of our conversations were
          held with him having a major hangover and
          slurring his words. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               (B)  From the transcriptions of messages
          left on Reesa&#146;s parents&#146; phones:
          </pre>
    <pre>          So I am not harassing you guys.
          I  am just letting you guys know what&#146;s going
          on with me because someone is doing some very
          bad things to me mentally.
          I go to a doctor every day actually not every
          day I go to a therapist every other day I go
          to a doctor every three days and I think I am
          just about done playing the game and it is
          time to go through with all the things I had
          planned on doing because I did not get a
          confirmation letter from anybody.
          I was lied to.
          I was cheated.
          I was abused.
          If you guys bring harassment charges against
          me go ahead because your daughter will be in
          jail for kidnapping and child abduction. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               You&#146;ll be in jail and then I am going to
          file charges against you again for child
          concealment so if you want to play that game
          honey let&#146;s go because I got all the legal
          advice that I need to do whatever I need to
          do you to make you suffer and the State will
          take Poopy from you, from me, from your dad,
          from your mother no one will get him because
          to the day I die I am going to be with you
          and my son or I will have my son.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I&#146;ll get you Rees. Trust me.
          I&#146;ll hurt you.
          I&#146;ll hurt your family.
          I&#146;ll take you dad down because I have him  on
          tape. Okay.
          I love you.
          I  do not want to do any of this but you  are
          making me go there.
          You are doing this to yourself. Just remember
          that.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Send  Tyler  Benjamin Pollastro home  to  his
          father or Satan and the devil will be in your
          family for the rest of your life.
          Your  Jewish  religion  means  dog  shit   in
          Satan&#146;s world.

          Benjamin Pollastro home or the devil will  be
          by your death-bed.

          You know what Rees, if you were smart and you
          really fucking thought about what you were
          doing like your fucking committing adultery
          on me right now okay.
          We&#146;re still married.
          You got a boyfriend and you know what Rees
          you can take his fucking cock and stuff it up
          your ass as far as I&#146;m concerned because I&#146;ll
          never go near that _______ again never
          because you&#146;re never going to have Tyler
          again.
          Do you understand that.
          Me  and Tyler are going to grow up and we are
          going  to fucking teach him the right  things
          about life.

    <pre>[13] Reesa Pollastro applied for and received temporary custody
of Tyler from the Ontario Court (General Division) on September
12, 1997  (from O&#146;Connell J.) and on September 23 (from Benotto
J.). A final order was made by Benotto J. on October 28, 1997.
John Pollastro was served with notice of these proceedings but
did not respond, thinking he was under no obligation to do so.

[14] He brought an application in California for custody without
access, and for the return of his son on October 1, 1997. It is
clear from the California court order dated October 14, 1997
granting the relief sought, that in his viva voce evidence, John
Pollastro, who was unrepresented, did not tell the court of the
outstanding Ontario court orders for temporary custody in his
wife&#146;s favour. His evidence to the California court was that
Tyler was in danger because his mother was on speed. Reesa was
notified of the California proceedings, but it is unclear whether
a letter sent by her lawyer to the California court setting out
the chronology of legal proceedings in Ontario ever reached the
presiding judge.

[15] On December 1, 1997, John Pollastro applied in California
for the return of the child pursuant to the Hague Convention.
Several months elapsed before John realized he was required to
retain counsel in Canada, and it was not until March 6, 1998 that
notice of the Hague Convention application was given to the Local
Registrar of the Ontario Court (General Division) by the Central
Authority in the Reciprocity Office of the Ministry of the
Attorney General. The Hague Convention, the provisions of which
are set out in the Schedule to s. 46 of the Children&#146;s Law Reform
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12, has been in force in Ontario since
December 1, 1983. John Pollastro&#146;s application in Ontario for
Tyler&#146;s return to California under the Hague Convention was not
brought until July 2, 1998.

[16] The application was heard by Beaulieu J. on September 15,
1998. On October 16, 1998, he ordered that Reesa Pollastro return
Tyler Pollastro to his habitual residence in California, with the
right to retain custody of him for 30 days if she accompanies him
to California.
</pre>
    <pre>[17] The basis for Beaulieu J.&#146;s decision to order the return of
the child is stated in his reasons as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               The Applicant alleges, however, that the
          threat of physical abuse to a mother can
          cause psychological damage to the child. She
          argues that this is one of those exceptional
          situations in which the court is not bound by
          the requirement that the child be immediately
          returned to the habitual residence. A very
          forceful argument was made by the Applicant
          regarding the risks, both psychological and
          physical, to a child whose mother is living
          in an abusive situation. The material filed
          and the position taken by counsel for the
          Applicant was well-argued and insightful.
          However, even with judicial notice taken of
          the psychological harm to children of abused
          women, it is settled law that &#147;evidence of
          harm generally goes to the merits of a
          custody hearing&#148; and not a Hague Convention
          application &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          
               Given the alleged stormy relationship
          between the parties, and the less than
          flattering picture she paints of the father,
          her concerns related to the potential
          hostility and danger to her and the child may
          or may not be realistically founded. However,
          as a general rule, that issue must be
          addressed and seen from the perspective and
          within the context of the very nature of
          these proceedings. The tribunal of the
          jurisdiction in which the child habitually
          resided prior to the removal is the one that
          can more appropriately deal with such
          concerns. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>     ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[18] The preamble to the Hague Convention sets out its underlying
objectives as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The States signatory to the present Convention,
          </pre>
    <pre>               Firmly convinced that the interests of
          children are of paramount importance in
          matters relating to their custody,
          </pre>
    <pre>               Desiring to protect children
          internationally from the harmful effects of
          their wrongful removal or retention and to
          establish procedures to ensure their prompt
          return to the State of their habitual
          residence, as well as to secure protection
          for rights of access,
          </pre>
    <pre>                Have  resolved to conclude a Convention
          to this effect &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[19] As previously indicated, Article 13(b) sets out an exception
to the requirement that a child who is wrongfully removed from
his or her habitual residence be returned promptly. It states
that an order to return the child can be refused if:
          [T]here is a grave risk that his or her
          return would expose the child to physical or
          psychological harm or otherwise place the
          child in an intolerable situation.

</pre>
    <pre>[20] In Thomson v. Thomson, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 551, the Supreme
Court of Canada established the interpretative framework for
deciding cases under the Hague Convention generally and Article
13(b) in particular.

[21] In that case, the parent who removed the child from his home
was the mother. She had left Scotland with her 9-month-old son to
visit her parents on their farm in Manitoba. During this visit,
she decided to remain with her family in Manitoba. In resisting
the father&#146;s request under the Hague Convention for the return of
the child to Scotland, the mother invoked the exception in
Article 13(b), arguing that since she had been the child&#146;s
primary caretaker throughout her 13- month stay in Manitoba, her
separation from him would cause the child to suffer a grave risk
of physical or psychological harm.

[22] La Forest J. concluded at p. 596 that the facts did not meet
the threshold of harm contemplated by s. 13(b), namely, the
requirement that the harm be &#147;to a degree that also amounts to an
intolerable situation&#148;.

[23] It must be a &#147;weighty&#148; risk of &#147;substantial&#148; psychological
harm, &#147;something greater than would normally be expected on
taking a child away from one parent and passing him to another&#148;
(at p. 597, quoting with approval RE A (a minor) (abduction),
[1998] 1 F.L.R. 365 (C.A.)). Both the risk and the harm must be
substantial.

[24] La Forest J. also stated that the source of the harm was not
material, that is, it does not matter whether the risk flows from
removing the child from his present caregiver, or from returning
the child to the other parent. As La Forest J. said, citing the
child-centred perspective in Young v. Young, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 3:
&#147;harm is harm.&#148;

[25] Thomson held that the determinative rule for interpreting
the Hague Convention was in accordance with the ordinary meaning
of the treaty&#146;s terms &#147;in their context and in the light of [the
treaty&#146;s] object and purpose &#133; including its preamble&#148;:  see:
Art. 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Can.
T.S. 1980 No. 37, Thomson at p. 577. Using this approach, La
Forest J. made the preliminary finding that the preamble&#146;s clause
stating that &#147;&#133; the interests of children are of paramount
importance in matters relating to their custody&#148; means the
&#147;interests of children&#148; generally, not of the particular child
before the court.

[26] This observation, combined with the requirement in Article
16 of the Hague Convention that the state being asked to return a
child &#147;shall not decide on the merits of rights of custody&#148; until
a determination is made that the child should not be returned,
resulted in La Forest J.&#146;s conclusion that in deciding whether to
return a child, the court should not consider the child&#146;s &#147;best
interests&#148; in the same way as in a custody case.

[27] In my view, what is meant by La Forest J&#146;s comments is that
the decision whether to return a child pursuant to Article 12
should not be based on who should have custody. That explains why
the &#147;best interests&#148; test is not applied at this stage. The
presumptive interests which do apply in deciding whether to
return a child promptly are those set out in the preamble, namely
the interests of children generally in not being wrongfully
removed from their habitual residence.

[28]  La Forest J. does not, however, state that the interests of
the particular child before the court are irrelevant for all
purposes under the Hague Convention, including Article 13(b).
Indeed, it is difficult to see how the assessment required under
Article 13(b) of risk, or harm, or of whether a situation is
intolerable, can be made without reference to the interests and
circumstances of the particular child involved in the
proceedings.

[29] In this case, Beaulieu J. ignored the evidence with respect
to the particular child before the court, and in doing so, he
erred. By saying that &#147;evidence of harm generally goes to the
merits of a custody hearing&#148;, Beaulieu J. appears to be saying
that evidence of harm is not relevant in deciding whether the
criteria under Article 13(b) have been satisfied. This
conclusion, with respect, misconstrues Thomson. Justice La Forest
said that &#147;the merits of rights of custody&#148; should not be decided
until a determination is made that the child should not be
returned; he did not say that evidence of harm was irrelevant to
an Article 13(b) analysis. By disregarding the evidence of harm,
Beaulieu J. disregarded evidence relevant to the assessment he
was obliged to undertake pursuant to Article 13(b).

[30] Since this provision refers explicitly to the risk of harm,
evidence of such harm is clearly relevant to assessing whether
returning a child to his or her habitual residence would likely
result in serious harm or an otherwise intolerable situation. One
cannot be expected to satisfy the onus that a child not be
returned because of a grave risk of physical or psychological
harm unless evidence of such harm can be presented and considered
by the court deciding whether the s. 13(b) threshold has been
met.

[31] The evidence must, of course, be credible and must in
addition meet the high threshold of &#147;grave risk&#148; set out in
Thomson. This is very different from Beaulieu J.&#146;s conclusion
that evidence of harm is admissible only as part of a custody
hearing. Such an interpretation essentially deprives s. 13(b) of
its content.

[32] While many of the facts and allegations in this case are
disputed, the following facts supporting Reesa Pollastro&#146;s
allegations about her husband have been established:
     a)   He has been verbally abusive and threatening to his
wife, family and friends;
     b)   He has been violent towards her, causing physical harm;
     c)   He has behaved irrationally and irresponsibly, both
          during and after their cohabitation;
     d)   He has a drug and/or alcohol problem;
     e)   He has been unpredictable and unreliable when he has
          been responsible for Tyler&#146;s care;
     f)   His temper is difficult for him to control;  and
     g)   His hostility towards his wife is palpable.</pre>
    <pre>[33] Although every case depends on its own facts and the onus
remains on the person resisting the child&#146;s return, it seems to
me as a matter of common sense that returning a child to a
violent environment places that child in an inherently
intolerable situation, as well as exposing him or her to a
serious risk of psychological and physical harm.

[34] On the facts of this case, the threatening phone calls
reflect a continuing inability on the father&#146;s part to control
his temper or hostility. This means that the mother, who would
inevitably accompany the child if he is ordered to return to
California, would be returning to a dangerous situation. Since
the mother is the only parent who has demonstrated any reliable
capacity for responsible parenting, Tyler&#146;s interests are
inextricably tied to her psychological and physical security. It
is therefore relevant in considering whether the return to
California places the child to an intolerable situation, to take
into account the serious possibility of physical or psychological
harm coming to the parent on whom the child is totally dependent.

[35]  There is also evidence that returning Tyler to California
represents a grave risk of exposure to serious harm to him
personally. The father&#146;s hostility, irresponsibility and
irrational behaviour are ongoing. Although John Pollastro has not
been overtly physically violent to his son, he has been violent
and had temper outbursts when his wife has been with the child.
On one occasion, for example, he threw hot coffee at her,
narrowly missing their 7-day-old son whom she was holding.

[36] Tyler is barely two years old. His safety is seriously at
risk if he is forced to return to the very volatility which
caused his mother to leave with him in the first place. He and
his mother would be removed from the sanctuary of her family in
Canada, and forced to return to California where the potential
for violence is overwhelming. This exposes the child to the
serious possibility of substantial psychological and/or physical
harm and, in addition, creates a grave risk that he would be
placed in an intolerable situation.

[37] I am satisfied that Reesa Pollastro has satisfied the onus
under Article 13(b) and that the child should therefore not be
returned to California.

[38] I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision of Beaulieu
J., and dismiss John Pollastro&#146;s application with costs.
