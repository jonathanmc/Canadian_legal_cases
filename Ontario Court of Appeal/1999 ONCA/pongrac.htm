COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
      <pre>RE:            CHARLES PONGRAC and KATHERINE PONGRAC
               (Plaintiffs/Respondents) and H. VYN CONSTRUCTION
               LIMITED and  HANK VYN (Defendants/Appellants) and
               MACKAY, MACKAY &amp; PETERS LIMITED (Third Party)</pre>
      <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, BORINS AND SHARPE JJ.A.</pre>
      <pre>COUNSEL:       Louis Frapporti and Michele Ballagh, for the appellant, H. Vyn
               Construction Limited</pre>
      <pre>               Anthony Wellenreiter, for the respondents</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         October 15, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On  appeal from the judgment of Festeryga J. dated September  29,
1998.</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
      <pre>[1]   The  appellant has not contested the trial judge’s  finding
that it was in breach of contract.  However, it submits that  the
trial judge erred as follows:
          </pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>1.   In failing to find the respondent, Mr. Pongrac,
contributorily negligent in failing to have the surveyor approve
he elevation before the appellant poured the foundation.
2.   In failing to deduct approximately $24,800 from the amount
of damages awarded because this amount was effectively “saved” by
the respondent in constructing the house with the higher
elevation.
3.   In finding that the increased grade of the driveway
justified the heating of the entire driveway at a cost of
approximately $74,500.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[2]  We find no merit in the first two grounds of appeal.  We  do
not feel that the plaintiff was responsible for the fact that the
appellant  went  ahead and constructed the house  notwithstanding
that  its  elevation was six feet higher than called for  by  the
surveyor.  Even if it was the plaintiff’s responsibility to  call
in  the surveyor and he did not do so, the trial judge found  the
appellant  nevertheless went ahead and poured the  foundation  in
the  absence of the approval of the surveyor, as well as  in  the
absence  of  the  approval of the Township,  whose  approval  was
required if there was to be a change in the elevation.
[3]   As for the second ground, we find no reason why the
appellant should receive any credit for the notional amount of
$24,800 saved.  The appellant was not required by the contract to
build the rear retaining wall that he did not build.
[4]  However, we find that in awarding the respondents
approximately $74,800 to install and maintain a heated driveway,
the trial judge awarded damages which are disproportionate to the
problems caused by the fact that the slope of the driveway was
higher than called for by the survey.  As well, the respondents
would end up with a much superior driveway than contemplated by
the contract.
[5]  In these circumstances, we feel that the proper measure of
damages is the diminishment, if any, in the value of the home
resulting from the fact that the grade of the driveway was
steeper than it should have been.  However, there was no evidence
before the trial judge in respect to the value of the house with
and without a properly constructed driveway.
[6]   Whatever the grade of the driveway, the respondent would
have to remove ice and snow from it.  It is reasonable to assume,
in this regard, that because of the steeper grade more salt and
sand would be required than if the grade had been lower.  In this
regard, the appellant concedes that an allowance of $4,400.00
would be reasonable.  The record also indicates that a different
surface would improve the driveway in slippery conditions.
[7]  It is unfortunate that the record is not clear on this
issue.  However, in the interest of terminating these proceedings
we would allow the respondents a total of $10,000 for resurfacing
and maintaining the driveway.
[8]   In  the result, the appeal is allowed in part and  the  sum
awarded  by  the trial judge for the installation and maintenance
of  the  heated driveway is set aside and in its place  we  would
award  the respondents $10,000 in damages.  In all other respects
the  appeal  is dismissed, the appellant being entitled  to  one-
third of its costs of the appeal.</pre>
