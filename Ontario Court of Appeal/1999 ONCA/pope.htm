    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Mr. Pope appeals the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice
W.A. Jenkins dated February 12, 1997. By that judgment, he was
ordered to pay $1,400 per month indexed spousal support and an
equalization payment of $55,776.76, of which $6,500 was paid
before trial. Thus, the net equalization payment was $49,276.76.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">OVERVIEW</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Mr. Pope contends that the trial judge erred in not finding
that an equal division of the difference between the parties’ net
family properties was unconscionable. He relies, in particular,
on s. 5(6)(e) of the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, which
provides that a court may order an unequal division of net family
property if the court is of the opinion that equalization would
be unconscionable, having regard to the fact that a spouse would
otherwise receive an equalization payment that is
“disproportionately large in relation to a period of cohabitation
that is less than five years.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  There is no doubt that Mr. and Mrs. Pope cohabited for less
than five years after their marriage. If “cohabitation”, as
referred to in s. 5(6)(e) limits cohabitation to post-marriage
cohabitation, as Mr. Pope submits it does, that subsection is
engaged and should be considered in determining if an equal
division of the net family properties is unconscionable. If,
however, cohabitation in s. 5(6)(e) includes cohabitation before
marriage, s. 5(6)(e) would not provide a basis upon which to
conclude that an equalization payment representing one-half the
difference between Mr. and Mrs. Pope’s net family properties is
unconscionable, since Mr. and Mrs. Pope cohabited for many years
before they married.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  There are conflicting trial judgments dealing with the
interpretation of s. 5(6)(e) of the Family Law Act. Although I
think that, in the circumstances, the trial judge was correct in
concluding that there was no basis upon which to find
unconscionability, I propose, nonetheless, to consider the
meaning to be given to “cohabitation” as it appears in s. 5(6)(e)
of the Family Law Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Mr. Pope also contends that the trial judge erred in making
the spousal support order that he did. He seeks to vary the
$1,400 a month spousal support order by substituting one of the
following spousal support orders, one of which he contends should
replace the spousal support order made by the trial judge:
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (a)  $750 per month, not time limited;
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (b)  lump sum spousal support of $36,000; or
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (c)  a time limited spousal support, with spousal support to
          end in November 2000.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE EVIDENCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Mr. and Mrs. Pope began to live together in 1978 when Mr.
Pope was 26 and Mrs. Pope 32 years of age. They had one child
together, Adam, born September 15, 1979. They married on November
6, 1992 after almost 14 years of pre-marital cohabitation. They
separated on September 18, 1994.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Both Mr. and Mrs. Pope have one child from previous
relationships. Mr. Pope’s daughter, Lisa, was born on September
30, 1972. She was not dependent on either Mr. or Mrs. Pope at the
time of trial. Mrs. Pope’s daughter, Tara, was born on January 3,
1974 and was also not a dependent child at the time of trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Mr. and Mrs. Pope’s son, Adam, lived with Mrs. Pope
following the parties’ separation in September, 1994. Before
trial, he was convicted of assaulting Mrs. Pope and possession of
narcotics and at the time of trial, he resided with Mr. Pope.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  When the parties commenced cohabitation in 1978, Mr. Pope
was employed with his family company as a plumber. That
employment continued to the time of trial. Mrs. Pope was employed
at the Federal Business Development Bank as a receptionist when
she and Mr. Pope commenced cohabitation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Mr. and Mrs. Pope chose to provide their children with full-
time home care with the result that it was agreed that Mrs. Pope
would not return to work outside the home after Adam was born.
When the parties separated in 1994, she had no income or assets.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] At the time of separation Mr. Pope owned the matrimonial
home having a net value of $100,000. He purchased the matrimonial
home in 1978, before he and Mrs. Pope began to live together. He
had savings and investments of about $50,000 and he was free of
debt.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] Throughout the relationship, Mrs. Pope suffered from a
mental illness. I see no need to consider Mrs. Pope’s medical
problems in any detail. Her psychiatrist, Dr. Mountain, diagnosed
her condition as a “major affective disorder.”  Her symptoms
impaired all of her life skills. Dr. Mountain stated that it was
not possible to provide a prognosis as to when she might recover
from her illness. Mr. Pope admitted at trial that he did not
expect that Mrs. Pope would be able to work in the future.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The trial judge found that Mrs. Pope helped manage and
operate four income properties that Mr. Pope owned. The work
included cleaning, painting, garden maintenance, collecting
cheques and keeping financial records. Mr. Pope claimed in his
testimony that he was responsible for collecting the rents 90% of
the time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] In 1985, Mr. Pope established Lambeth Sports, a small
sporting goods business. Mrs. Pope assisted him in the operation
of Lambeth Sports for about three and one-half years. She assumed
managerial responsibilities at Lambeth Sports after the existing
manager quit suddenly. She earned about $250 a week. That money
was spent on the family.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Mrs. Pope also assisted her husband in a business, C.A.F.
Marketing Inc., which he started in about 1993. She testified
that she helped Mr. Pope run the business by planning his trips
and meetings, doing billings and answering the telephone.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] After the parties separated in September, 1994 Mrs. Pope had
to apply for welfare which she received in December 1994. In
January 1995, Browne J. made an interim child support order of
$500 a month and an interim spousal support order in the same
amount. He also gave Mrs. Pope interim custody of Adam. In May
1995, Flinn J. varied the interim child and spousal support
orders to $1,500 a month. That figure covered both interim child
and spousal support. The $1,500 a month interim child and spousal
support order was reduced to $1,000 a month in January 1996 when
Adam left Mrs. Pope and began to live with Mr. Pope. In his
judgment, the trial judge expunged $5,500 of accumulated interim
support arrears. Mrs. Pope has not appealed from that part of the
trial judgment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] At the time of trial, Mr. Pope was a 45-year-old plumber who
worked in his family plumbing business, R.W. Pope and Sons
Plumbing. His average income over the seven years preceding the
trial was about $50,000 per year. I see no need to review the
evidence concerning Mr. Pope’s income since the trial judge’s
finding that he was earning about $50,000 a year is supported by
the evidence and no issue is taken with it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] At trial, Mrs. Pope filed a financial statement which
included a monthly budget of $1,925. She sought spousal support
of $1,700 a month on the premise that she would purchase a modest
condominium with her equalization payment. Her list of expenses
totalled $1,368 a month. This included medication of $260 per
month. In the end, as I have said, she was awarded spousal
support of $1,400 a month.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] After assessing the entirety of the relationship of both Mr.
and Mrs. Pope, the trial judge concluded that Mrs. Pope made
significant contributions to the “family endeavours.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE EQUALIZATION PAYMENT</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Mr. Pope submits that the trial judge was wrong in not
making an unequal division of the difference between the value of
his net family property and that of Mrs. Pope. He submits that an
equal division is unconscionable in the circumstances of their
relationship. As I have said, he relies in particular on s.
5(6)(e) of the Family Law Act as the basis of his unequal
division position. On the broader issue of unconscionability, in
addition to the short duration of the marriage,  he emphasizes
that he purchased the matrimonial home before he married Mrs.
Pope; indeed, he purchased the matrimonial home before he and
Mrs. Pope began to live together.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The relevant parts of s. 5 of the Family Law Act are:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          5. (1) When a divorce is granted or a

          cohabitation, the spouse whose net family
          property is the lesser of the two net family
          properties is entitled to one-half the
          difference between them.

          net family properties would be

          acquisition, disposition, preservation,

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] Mr. Pope contends that he and Mrs. Pope “cohabited” for less
than five years if cohabitation is measured from the date of the
marriage (November 6, 1992) to the date of separation (September
18, 1994). Thus, he submits that s. 5(6)(e) of the Family Law Act
is engaged and the less-than-two-year period of cohabitation
should be taken into account in considering whether an equal
division of the difference between the parties’ net family
properties is unconscionable. He relies upon the judgment of
Fleury J. in Stewart v. Stewart (1990), 39 R.F.L. (3d) 88 (Ont.
Gen. Div.) in support of his interpretation of s. 5(6)(e) of the
Family Law Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Mrs. Pope contends that the interpretation of s. 5(6)(e)
suggested by Mr. Pope is too narrow and that “cohabitation” as
referred to in s. 5(6)(e) should be interpreted in a manner
consistent with the Family Law Act definition of “cohabit”.
Section 1(1), the general definition section of the Family Law
Act, defines “cohabit” in this way:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1. (1) In this Act,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          “cohabit” means to live together in a
          conjugal relationship, whether within or
          outside marriage;</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Mrs. Pope submits that if “cohabitation” in s. 5(6)(e)
covers that period during which Mrs. Pope lived together in a
conjugal relationship, s. 5(6)(e) is not engaged since the
relevant period of cohabitation would include the 14-year period
before the parties married in 1992.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] There are conflicting trial decisions on the issue whether
“cohabitation” for the purposes of s. 5(6)(e), includes
cohabitation before the marriage. As I noted earlier, Mr. Pope
relies upon the decision of Fleury J. in Stewart v. Stewart. In
Stewart, Fleury J. noted that the division of the value of net
family properties established by Part I of the Family Law Act is
only relevant to spouses as defined in the Family Law Act.
Section 1(1) of the Family Law Act defines “spouse” in this way:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          “spouse” means either of a man and woman who,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (a) are married to each other, or
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (b) have together entered into a marriage
          that is voidable or void, in good faith on
          the part of the person asserting a right
          under this Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] He relied on this eligibility provision in holding that only
cohabitation after marriage counts for purposes of the
calculation required by s. 5(6)(e).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Feldman J. reached a different conclusion in Reeson v.
Kowalik (1991), 36 R.F.L. (3d) 396 (Ont. Gen. Div.). After she
resolved conflicting evidence about the date when the parties
began to cohabit, Feldman J. concluded that “cohabitation”
included the period during which the parties cohabited before
they married. Although she found that s. 5(6)(e) applied as the
period of cohabitation (including pre-marital cohabitation) was
less than five years, Feldman J. looked at the parties’ “entire
relationship” in concluding that an equal division of the
difference in the parties’ property was not unconscionable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] In Kessel v. Kessel (1993) 1 R.F.L. (4th) 324 (Ont. Gen.
Div.), Dilks J. found no reason to disagree with Fleury J.’s
analysis in Stewart of the meaning to be given to “cohabitation”
in s. 5(6)(e). However, when he went on to consider the broader
issue of unconscionability he adopted Feldman J.’s approach in
Reeson v. Kowalik (at pp. 336-337):
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I am much indebted to Fleury J. for his
          careful analysis of the matter in Stewart v.
          Stewart [cite] and I am unable to disagree
          with his conclusion that cohabitation in s.
          5(6)(e) refers to cohabitation within the
          marriage.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...When one reflects that no resort, however,
          could have been had to the subsection [s.
          5(6)(e)] if the cohabitation in this case had
          lasted for another five and a third months,
          it is not easy to conclude that an
          equalization payment of slightly more than
          $30,000 to the wife would be disproportionate
          to the length of cohabitation. Even if it
          were, the division could not be characterized
          as unconscionable when one takes into
          account, as well, the period of cohabitation
          before marriage (see Reeson v. Kowalik [cite]
          where the cohabitation within, as well as
          prior to, marriage was still less than five
          years, but where Feldman J. took into account
          the parties’ prior non-cohabitational
          relationship in deciding that an equalization
          payment of over $100,000 was not
          unconscionable). [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] For the reasons that follow, I disagree with Fleury J.’s
conclusion in Stewart, and find that “cohabitation” for the
purposes of s. 5(6)(e) includes cohabitation prior to marriage. I
agree with Fleury J.’s observation that the statutory definition
of “spouse” requires the parties to be married before either of
them can obtain an equalization payment under s. 5 of the Family
Law Act. I do not, however, think that this eligibility factor is
determinative of the meaning to be given to “cohabitation” in s.
5(6)(e). I see no reason not to import the statutory definition
(s. 1(1)) of “cohabit” into s. 5(6)(e). If that is done,
cohabitation in s. 5(6)(e) would include cohabitation “within or
outside marriage.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] I do not think that that part of the statutory definition of
cohabit – “within or outside marriage” – is mere surplusage, as
Fleury J. held in Stewart. It is a fundamental principle of
statutory interpretation that where possible meaning should be
attributed to all of the words that the legislature has chosen to
use. In Ruth Sullivan, Driedger on the Construction of Statutes,
3rd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths 1994), the author sets out the
principle in this way, under the title, “The Presumption Against
Tautology” (at p. 159):
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is presumed that the legislature avoids
          superfluous or meaningless words, that it
          does not pointlessly repeat itself or speak
          in vain. Every word in a statute is presumed
          to make sense and to have a specific role to
          play in advancing the legislative purpose.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] Estey J. in Morguard Properties Ltd. v. City of Winnipeg
(1983), 3 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.) made the same point. He said at
p. 9:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Some meaning must be attributed to the word
          ... as otherwise it is mere surplusage, and
          courts in the application of the principles
          of statutory construction endeavour, where
          possible, to attribute meaning to each word
          employed by the Legislature in the statute.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] There is, in my view, no reason to ascribe a meaning to the
noun “cohabitation” as it appears in s. 5(6)(e), that differs
from the definition of the verb “cohabit” as set out in the
general definition section of the Family Law Act. The legislature
chose to define “cohabit” to include that period of cohabitation
(living together in a conjugal relationship), before the
marriage. I would not interpret the word “cohabitation” in s.
5(6)(e) more narrowly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] Although not determinative of the issue, I note that s.
4(4)(b) of the Family Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 152, which
provided for the unequal division of family assets, specifically
referred to “the duration of the period of cohabitation under the
marriage.” [Emphasis added.]  It seems to me that had the
legislature, in drafting the Family Law Act, intended that
cohabitation be limited to cohabitation under the marriage, or
within marriage to use Family Law Act terminology, the
legislature would have said so, as it did in s. 4(4)(b) of the
Family Law Reform Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] I should add that, in my opinion, the fact that Mr. Pope
owned the matrimonial home as of the date of the marriage cannot
reasonably be relied upon in determining whether an equal
division of the net family property difference is unconscionable
unless one were to conclude that the provision of the Family Law
Act that requires Mr. Pope to include the value of the
matrimonial home in his net family property is itself
unconscionable. Again, the interpretation of the Family Law Act
put forward by Mr. Pope appears to contradict the intention of
the Legislature, as expressed in the terms of the Act.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In any case, I see no basis in the evidence to conclude that
equal division of the difference between the parties’ net family
properties would be “unconscionable” when all of the
circumstances, including the lengthy period of cohabitation, are
taken into account. I therefore see no merit in this ground of
appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">SPOUSAL SUPPORT</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] Mr. Pope appeals the trial judge’s spousal support order,
which required him to pay $1,400 a month to Mrs. Pope. He does so
on a number of grounds. I see no merit in any of them.  As I have
said, he takes no issue with his obligation to pay support.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] It has been frequently said that this court will not revisit
the quantum of spousal support where the spousal support order
comes within “the generous ambit within which reasonable
disagreement is possible.”  See Silver v. Silver (1985), 49
R.F.L. (2d) 148 (Ont. C.A.); Campbell v. Campbell (1996), 21
R.F.L. (4th) 283 (Ont. C.A.). In my opinion, the $1,400 per month
spousal support order comes within the ambit of reasonableness
having regard to those factors set out in s. 33(9) of the Family
Law Act. Mrs. Pope was economically disadvantaged as a result of
her marriage and the extensive period of cohabitation that
preceded it. See Moge v. Moge (1992), 3 S.C.R. 813 (S.C.C.). The
trial judge’s finding that Mrs. Pope’s capacity to secure and
maintain meaningful employment is limited is supported by the
evidence. I see no basis upon which to reduce spousal support to
$750 per month. Nor do I see a basis upon which to make a lump
sum spousal support order of $36,000, as requested by the
appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] There remains to be considered whether the trial judge erred
in not making a time limited spousal support order. Again, I find
there was no such error. Mrs. Pope worked in the home during most
of her relationship with Mr. Pope.  Her career options are now
manifestly restricted by both her age and her impaired health.
Indeed, Mr. Pope acknowledged her entitlement to support so that
the only issues before the trial judge were how much support and
in what form. This court held in Krauss v. Krauss (1991), 33
R.F.L. (3d) 233 that the following factors militated against
making a time limited spousal support order:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    a long marriage;
·    during most of the marriage the wife devoted most of her
time to child care and household management and was therefore
unable to work outside the home;
·    the age of the parties;
·    the wife’s health which in the circumstances compromised her
ability to obtain gainful employment;
·    limited employment opportunities.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] All of the Krauss factors apply in this case, if, for
purposes of determining appropriate support, the entire period of
the parties cohabitation (1978 to 1994) is taken into account.
Over this lengthy period, Mrs. Pope devoted most of her time to
child care and household management. She was in her 50’s as of
the time of trial and in precarious health. By any reasonable
assessment of the evidence her capacity to obtain employment is
limited. There is no reasonably identifiable time by which one
might conclude that she will be self-sufficient, or for that
matter earning income that would even reduce her need for spousal
support. The trial judge was, in my view, entirely correct in
making a spousal support order that was not time limited.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">COSTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] In his notice of appeal and factum, Mr. Pope contended that
the trial judge erred in ordering him to pay costs fixed at
$22,261.19. He submits that in the circumstances, the parties
should pay their own costs. This issue was not pressed in oral
argument. In any case, I see no merit in Mr. Pope’s submission on
this issue. As the trial judge noted when he dealt with costs,
after receiving submissions from both sides, Mrs. Pope was
successful at trial. In my view, it was open to the trial judge
to deal with costs as he did. I would not grant leave to appeal
costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
