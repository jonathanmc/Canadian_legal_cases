    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Honourable Madam Justice Greer
dated January 21, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  This is a complex commercial case.  The respondent numbered
companies are defendants by counterclaim.  They sought summary
judgment on a discrete part of a much larger dispute between the
appellants and another company controlled by the same persons who
controlled the respondent numbered companies.
[2]  The motion judge misapprehended the evidence when she said
&#147;there is no documented evidence that the $15,000,000.00 mortgage
formed part of the security for the Barbadian loan.&#148;  There is a
commitment letter of August 1, 1991 prepared by the appellants
and signed by one of the principals of the respondents, albeit in
a different capacity, which specifically indicates that the
$15,000,000.00 mortgage stands in first place as security for
part of the American loan.  The commitment letter indicates that
the $15,000,000.00 mortgage secures the $5,500,000.00 U.S. letter
of credit provided by the appellant on behalf of the respondents
as part of the Barbadian transaction.
[3]  The $7,000,000.00 second mortgage referred to in the August
1st commitment letter was executed by the respondents.  That
mortgage specifically refers to the August 1, 1991 commitment
letter and the security described in that commitment letter.
[4]  In our view, this issue must go to trial with the rest of
the case.  The parties&#146; recollections of the complex transactions
are very different.  The documents are open to different
interpretations and some appear to be in conflict with others.
The question of whether the $15,000,000.00 mortgage secured all
or part of the U.S. loans raised a triable issue.
[5]  It is unnecessary to consider the appellants&#146; motion to
admit fresh evidence on the appeal.
[6]  The appeal is allowed and the order of the motion judge is
set aside.  The appellant is entitled to costs here and below.</pre></td>
