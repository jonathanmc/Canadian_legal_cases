    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (Southey,
Chilcott and Pardu JJ.), dated February 23, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BROOKE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  discrete  issue in this appeal is  whether  the  court
sitting  in  Judicial  Review, pursuant to  the  Judicial  Review
Procedure  Act,  R.S.O.  1990, c.J.1, has  jurisdiction,  in  the
absence of specific statutory authority, to make an order  as  to
the  costs of the proceedings before the tribunal whose  decision
is under review.
[2]  Pursuant to leave granted, The Ontario Racing Commission
(the &#147;Commission&#148;) appeals from the order of the Divisional Court
that it pay the costs of the respondent before the Commission and
before the Race Track Judges. There is no appeal from the order
of the Divisional Court quashing the order of the Commission.
[3]  The formal order of the Divisional Court provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Whereas this Court heard the Applicant&#146;s Application for
          Judicial Review at Osgoode Hall, Toronto on February 12, 1998,
          including reading the factums and application records
          respectively filed by the Applicant and the Respondent, and
          hearing oral submissions by the Applicant&#146;s and the Respondent&#146;s
          respective counsel;
          </pre>
    <pre>                And  whereas this Court delivered  oral
          judgement  on  February 12,  1998,  and  then
          entertained  submissions on costs,  including
          reading  the  factum on costs  filed  by  the
          Applicant,  and  hearing oral submissions  on
          costs by the Applicant&#146;s and the Respondent&#146;s
          respective counsel;
          </pre>
    <pre>          And whereas this Court reserved judgement  on
          costs,   delivering  written   judgement   on
          February   23,  1998  which  superseded   the
          Court&#146;s oral judgement of February 12, 199;
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   THIS COURT ORDERS that the decision
          of  the  Ontario  Racing  Commission  be  and
          hereby is quashed.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 2.     THIS  COURT  ORDERS  that   the
          Respondent pay the Applicant&#146;s assessed costs
          on  a party-and-party basis in respect of the
          [sic] each of the following:
             </pre>
    <pre>(a)   this Application for Judicial Review;
(b)   the hearing before O&#146;Leary J.;
(c)   the hearing before the Ontario Racing Commission; and
(d)   the hearing before the Judges at Greenwood Raceway.</pre>
    <pre>The Facts</pre>
    <pre>[4]   Poulton was the trainer of a racehorse that tested positive
for  a  prohibited substance.  Although there was  no  suggestion
that  Poulton administered the substance, he was charged that  he
failed to properly protect the horse.
[5]  A hearing commenced before the Track Judges.  Poulton asked
that the urine sample be made available for testing by an
independent laboratory, but was told the sample would only be
produced if he had it tested by the same laboratory as gave the
positive result.  Poulton commenced an application for judicial
review of the Track Judges&#146; refusal to produce the urine sample.
The Track Judges then produced the sample and the application was
dismissed.
[6]  Poulton had the sample tested and the result was negative.
Nonetheless, the Track Judges found Poulton to be in violation
due to the other positive test for prohibited drugs.  He appealed
and the Commission upheld the decision of the Track Judges.
Poulton then sought judicial review from the Divisional Court.
[7]  The Divisional Court allowed the application and quashed the
decision of the Commission.  In doing so, the Divisional Court
also awarded Poulton the costs of the application, an earlier
motion, the hearing before the Track Judges, and the hearing
before the Commission.</pre>
    <pre>The Jurisdiction to Award Costs of the Proceedings before the
Commission</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellant submits that the jurisdiction of the courts to
award  costs is not inherent and dependent entirely on  statutory
authority.
[9]  On the other hand, the respondent relies on a number of
cases in which such an order has, or appears to have been made.
[10] I agree with the appellant. The jurisdiction to award costs
is provided and proscribed by s.131(1) of the Courts of Justice
Act. That section provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               131. (1) Subject to the provisions of an Act or rules of
          court, the costs of and incidental to a proceeding or a step in a
          proceeding are in the discretion of the court, and the court may
          determine by whom and to what extent the costs shall be paid.</pre>
    <pre>[11]   Rule  1.03  of  the  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure   defines
&#147;proceedings&#148; as &#147;an action or application&#148;.
[12] It is conceded that neither the hearing before the Track
Judges and or before the Commission is a proceeding within the
meaning of the rules. It is also conceded that there is nothing
in the Racing Commission Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.R.2, or any other
statute that provides authority for an award of costs in this
case.
[13] The respondent relies on a number of cases in which it
appears that a court has awarded costs in respect of proceeding
before a tribunal where there was no statutory authority to do
so.
[14] In Winnipeg et al v. Winnipeg Elec. Co. [1935], 4 D.L.R.
657, on appeal from the Supreme Court of Canada, Lord Blanesburgh
noted at p. 665 that the Supreme Court of Canada had &#147;directed
the cities to pay the company&#146;s costs before all three
tribunals&#148;, the three tribunals being that court, the Manitoba
Court of Appeal and the Utility Board. However, the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Canada said only &#147;the boards order must be
set aside and the appeal allowed with costs. (See [1934] S.C.R.
173 at 185). With respect, nothing in that judgment, or in the
opinion, dealt with the jurisdiction to award costs of the
proceedings before the Utility Board. The question did not arise.
The Judicial Committee interpreted the submissions of the parties
as requesting that there be no order as to costs as each was to
pay its own costs. (See also at p. 665).
[15] Similarly, in Re Radulesc and Canadian Human Rights
Commission (1984), 14 D.L.R. (4th) 78 and 2747-3174 Québec (Régie
des permis d&#146;alcool) (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 577, there is
nothing in either judgment where the jurisdiction under
consideration here is considered.
[16] However, in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Mehr v. The Law Society of Upper Canada [1955] S.C.R. 344 at p.
352, the appellant Mehr was found to be &#147;entitled to his costs
through out&#148;.  The formal order left no doubt as to what was
intended and provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>               AND THIS COURT DID FURTHER ORDER AND ADJUDGE that the said
          respondent should and do pay to the said appellant the costs
          incurred by the said appellant throughout including the costs
          incurred by the said appellant in the trial and hearing before
          the Discipline Committee and the Benchers and the motion before
          the Chief Justice of the High Court and in the Court of Appeal
          for Ontario and in this Court&#133;  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[17] Nowhere in the judgment does it appear that the jurisdiction
to  make the order was considered. The Court made no reference to
any legislation conferring jurisdiction to award costs before the
Committee.  In  my respectful opinion, the case is not  authority
for the order in question here.
[18] The respondent relies on my judgment in Re Sawyer and
Ontario Racing Commission (1979), 24 O.R. (2d) 673 (C.A.). In
that case, the Divisional Court awarded the applicant the cost of
the application. No mention was made of costs before the
Commission. At p. 678, I said: &#147;The appellant will have his costs
throughout&#148;. The formal order of the court said: &#147;AND THIS COURT
DID FURTHER ORDER that the respondent is to pay to the applicant
his costs of all proceedings, including this appeal forthwith
after taxation&#148;.
[19] As stated above, a hearing before a tribunal is not a
proceeding within the meaning of s.131 (1) of Courts of Justice
Act. Nor was it a proceeding with in the meaning of its
predecessor, the Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1970 c.288 s.82. The
order in Re Sawyer, supra, should not be interpreted as authority
for awarding costs of proceedings before the Commission.
[20] Reference was made to the judgment of Quinn J. in Koch (Re)
(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 71.  In allowing an appeal from a decision
of the Consent and Capacity Board, the jurisdiction to make an
award of costs before the tribunal was considered. Quinn J. held
that, in the absence of statutory authority to the contrary,
costs could be awarded. In my respectful opinion, for the reason
stated he was in error.
[21] The respondent contends that, in fairness, the Commission
should be accountable for his costs of having to go through all
of the proceeding before it and the Track Judges only to have to
resort to the courts. Perhaps, but that is a matter for the
legislature. The Commission had no power to award him costs if
successful there, and it would be an &#147;unfortunate anomaly&#148; that
having lost there he should be better off by succeeding in
judicial review. (See Department of Health and Social Security v.
Envoy Farmers Ltd. [1976], 2 All E.R 173 at 176.)
[22] I would allow the appeal with respect to the award of costs
before the Track Judges and the Commission. The Divisional Court
had no jurisdiction to make that order. Accordingly, paragraphs
2(c) and (d) of the formal order are deleted, but otherwise the
order stands.
[23] There will be no order as to costs in this court.
