      <pre>On appeal from the endorsement made by the Honourable Mr. Justice

      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

      <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault on
the grounds that it was unreasonable for the trial judge to
conclude that the appellant knew that the complainant was
intoxicated and had no capacity to consent.  It was the
appellant’s submission that he thought the complainant was awake,
aware of what was going on, and consenting to it.
[2]  The appellant relies particularly on the complainant’s
ability to recall aspects of her physical surroundings and of
some of the activities of the people in the house before she fell
asleep.
[3]  He also relied on the trial judge’s error in his
apprehension of the evidence of the owner of the house in which
the party took place.  In particular, the trial judge erred in
stating that the owner urged the appellant not to enter the room
in which the complainant was sleeping.  In fact, the owner did
not suggest that it was a bad idea to enter the room, but rather
that it was a bad idea to join the complainant on the futon.
[4]  In our view, this error in the apprehension of the owner’s
evidence is minor and irrelevant.  What is relevant is what
occurred in the room after the appellant entered it.
[5]  The complainant woke up and found herself undressed, with
the appellant touching and kissing her.  It was her evidence,
which the trial judge accepted, that she had had over 10 drinks
in the hours preceding her being at the house party, and that she
had passed out on the bed.  She awoke slowly from her deep
intoxicated sleep to find the appellant acting in a sexual way.
[6]  Her evidence, and the evidence of others who were with her
that evening confirmed that she was highly inebriated.  Anyone
who was in her presence that evening would have known from some
of her bizarre behaviour, unsteady walking and slurred speech,
that she was intoxicated.  It was, therefore, open to the trial
judge to accept her evidence that she was so intoxicated that she
had no capacity to consent.
[7]  The verdict in this case is one which a properly instructed
jury, acting judicially, could reasonably render.  It was open to
the trial judge to conclude that the complainant did not consent
to sexual activity with the appellant and that she was not
capable of rendering such consent.  Moreover, his finding that
the appellant was aware of her incapacity is supported by the
evidence, including the evidence of the complainant and others at
the party.  Given this finding, there is no room either for the
defence of actual consent or the defence of honest but mistaken
belief.
[8]  We see no error in the decision of the summary conviction
appeal judge in dismissing the appeal from the trial judge.  The
appeal is accordingly dismissed.</pre></td>
