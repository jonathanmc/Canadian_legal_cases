    <pre>On appeal from his conviction on November 8, 1998 by Mr. Justice
Arthur C. Whealy, sitting with a jury, and from the sentence
imposed on November 18, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Following  his  trial before Whealy  J.  and  a  jury,  the
appellant  was convicted of  sexual assault causing bodily  harm,
unlawful confinement, uttering a death threat and break and enter
into  a  dwelling  house and was sentenced to  a  total  term  of
imprisonment of four years in addition to fifteen months of  pre-
trial  custody. He appeals against conviction and seeks leave  to
appeal his sentence.
[2]  All offences arose out of a series of events occurring on
the evening of August 16, 1997. The complainant testified that
she knew the appellant as a panhandler whom she had seen a few
times on the street during the previous two weeks and with whom
she had had some casual friendly conversations. On the evening in
question, she spent a few hours with him drinking a few beers and
smoking marijuana. She testified that the appellant then started
to talk about how he found her attractive and how he would like
her to be his girlfriend. He also asked her to show him her
breasts. She testified that the turn in the conversation made her
uncomfortable and she therefore decided to leave. She left the
appellant outside her apartment, went inside and went to bed.
[3]  Some time later, the complainant woke up and saw the naked
appellant coming out of her closet. She testified that the
appellant jumped on her and forcibly committed acts of fellatio
and intercourse against her will. She further testified that she
eventually freed herself, went to the kitchen, retrieved a meat
cleaver and, in an effort to scare the appellant away, threatened
him with it. A struggle ensued, the appellant bit her left arm
and the weapon dropped to the floor. The complainant then ran
into the street, naked and screaming that the appellant was going
to kill her. The appellant immediately left the apartment, went
to a friend&#146;s place, shaved off his beard and cut his hair in an
attempt to change his appearance. The police eventually attended
at the complainant&#146;s apartment. Some evidence of forcible entry
to the door was noted.  The appellant was arrested and charged
later that night.
[4]  The appellant testified. His version of the events was
similar in many respects to that of the complainant except that
he testified that all sexual acts between them were consensual.
He explained that the complainant then, suddenly and without
apparent reason, ran to the kitchen, got a meat cleaver and tried
to attack him with it. He explained that he bit her arm to defend
himself from this attack.
[5]  The appellant raised numerous grounds of appeal against
conviction in his factum. Three of the grounds were abandoned at
the hearing and some of the remaining grounds were somewhat
modified in oral argument. In essence, the appellant advances
four grounds. First, he contends that the trial judge&#146;s charge to
the jury on reasonable doubt was incomplete in that it made no
reference to the fact that a reasonable doubt could arise from &#147;a
lack of evidence&#148;. Second, the appellant submits that the trial
judge erred in failing to put the defence of intoxication to the
jury in relation to the charge of uttering a death threat. Third,
he contends that the trial judge effectively placed a burden on
the appellant by raising consent as a defence rather than
referring to the lack of consent as a necessary element of the
offence of sexual assault. Fourth, the appellant argues that the
trial judge erred in failing to define self-defence for the jury.
Instruction on reasonable doubt
[6]  Counsel for the appellant relies on the suggested wording in
R.  v.  Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) in support  of
his argument that the instruction to the jury on reasonable doubt
was  incomplete. He argues that the importance in  this  case  of
telling the jury that a reasonable doubt could arise from &#147;a lack
of  evidence&#148;  is  evidenced by the fact that the  jury  asked  a
number of questions during the course of their deliberations.
[7]  We see no merit to this argument. It is not mandatory to use
the exact formulation in Lifchus. It is the overall effect of the
charge which matters. In our view, the trial judge&#146;s instructions
to the jury on reasonable doubt adequately conveyed the necessary
principles which were to govern the jury in its deliberations.
The instructions would not have misled the jury into believing
that a reasonable doubt could not arise from a lack of evidence.</pre>
    <pre>Defence of intoxication</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The  appellant submits that the evidence gave rise  to  the
defence of intoxication in relation to the offence of uttering  a
death  threat and that, consequently, it was incumbent  upon  the
trial judge to instruct the jury accordingly.
[9]  We do not agree. While there was evidence that the appellant
had consumed alcohol and smoked some marijuana, the evidence of
intoxication consisted of a single conclusory statement by the
complainant in her evidence that the appellant was &#147;very drunk&#148;.
No other evidence of intoxication was advanced and the issue was
not pursued. The defence of intoxication was not raised by
counsel at trial and no objection was made to the charge on this
point.
[10] In all the circumstances, we are of the view that there was
no air of reality to this defence. Therefore, it was not
incumbent upon the trial judge to instruct the jury on the
defence of intoxication.</pre>
    <pre>Instruction on consent
</pre>
    <pre>[11]  In our view, the reference in the charge to consent  &#147;as  a
defence&#148;  did not place any burden on the appellant as contended.
The  reference  must  be  viewed  in  context.  The  trial  judge
correctly instructed the jury that the burden was on the Crown to
prove  all of the essential elements of the offence, one of which
was  the  lack  of consent by the complainant. The  reference  to
consent &#147;as a defence&#148; to the included offences of &#147;assault&#148;  and
&#147;sexual  assault&#148; simply reiterated the fact that the failure  to
prove  lack  of  consent would result in an  acquittal  on  those
offences.
[12] The trial judge was also correct in further instructing the
jury that consent was not a relevant consideration in so far as
the infliction of bodily harm was concerned. However, the manner
in which he gave this further instruction was confusing. He told
the jury that consent was a defence to the included offences of
assault and sexual assault, and added &#147;but if you find that there
was a sexual assault which caused bodily harm, for the whole
offence, consent is not a defence&#148;. The trial judge handed a
verdict sheet to each member of the jury to assist them in
sorting out the various offences and available verdicts. The
verdict sheet was not produced on appeal however, it would appear
from the transcript that the trial judge was referring to the
handout when he gave those instructions.  Defence counsel at
trial objected to this portion of the charge. He submitted that
both the instruction and the verdict sheet were confusing to the
jury in that they may have left them with the impression that if
they were satisfied that the appellant had intentionally
inflicted bodily harm to the complainant (the bite on the arm),
consent was no longer available as a defence to the sexual
assault.
[13] We agree with the appellant&#146;s submission. The charge on this
point was incorrect on its face and, on the whole, confusing. The
problem was exacerbated by the trial judge&#146;s failure to relate
the facts to the issues. Even though the facts were relatively
simple, the application of the law to those facts was somewhat
complex given that the sexual acts in the bedroom, at least on
one version, could be viewed as entirely separate from the
subsequent infliction of the bodily harm. The jury had to sort
out all those facts in their consideration of the single offence
of sexual assault causing bodily harm. This was not an easy task.
It is clear from counsel&#146;s objection that the confusion was
apparent to those present in the courtroom. The trial judge
himself conceded that his instructions were confusing but he did
not want to bring back the jury and &#147;confuse them further.&#148;
[14] In our view, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to
recharge the jury on the issue of consent. In all the
circumstances, it would be unsafe to conclude that the jury would
have understood that lack of consent was a necessary element of
the underlying offence of sexual assault regardless of their
conclusions with respect to the incident with the meat cleaver
and the biting.
[15] Consequently, we would give effect to this ground of appeal
and quash the conviction with respect to the offence of sexual
assault causing bodily harm. In light of this result, it is not
necessary to deal with the ground of appeal relating to the
instruction on self-defence other than to comment that the
instructions on this issue were also confusing. Again here, in
addition to defining self-defence, it would have been important
to relate the facts that were relevant to this issue so as to
make it clear to the jury that self-defence arose only in
relation to the bite to the arm and had no relevance to the
underlying offence of sexual assault.</pre>
    <pre>Appeal against sentence
</pre>
    <pre>[16]  The  trial  judge imposed a total sentence of  four  years&#146;
imprisonment as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>(a)   sexual assault causing bodily harm: 4 years
(b)   forcible confinement: 2 years concurrent
(c)   uttering a death threat: 1 year concurrent; and
(d)   break and enter and commit an indictable offence: 4 years
      concurrent.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  It  would  appear from this sentence that the  trial  judge
imposed a sentence of 4 years in relation to the offence of break
and  enter  based  on the jury&#146;s finding that the  appellant  had
committed the offence of sexual assault causing bodily  harm.  In
keeping  with the result of this appeal, it is our view that  the
sentence on that offence should be reduced to 2 years concurrent.
[18] Otherwise, we see no reason to interfere with the sentence.
The trial judge considered all relevant factors, more
particularly the gravity of the offences, the accused&#146;s
background and lengthy criminal record and the principles of
sentencing. He made no error in principle and, in all the
circumstances, it cannot be said that the sentence on the
remaining charges is excessive.
[19] The appeal against the conviction on the offence of sexual
assault causing bodily harm is allowed, the conviction is quashed
and a new trial is ordered. The appeal against conviction is
otherwise dismissed. In light of this result, it is not necessary
to deal with the sentence appeal on the charge of sexual assault
causing bodily harm. Leave to appeal against sentence on the
other offences is granted, the appeal is allowed in relation to
the offence of break and enter and the sentence on that offence
is reduced to two years imprisonment to be served concurrently.
The appeal against sentence is otherwise dismissed.</pre>
