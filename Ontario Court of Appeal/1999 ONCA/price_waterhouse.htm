      <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:       PRICE WATERHOUSE LIMITED, a Receiver and Manager
          of PACIFIC NATIONAL LEASING CORPORATION (Plaintiff /
          Appellant) and MARINA TRAVEL AGENCY LIMITED 
          (Defendant / Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:   FINLAYSON, OSBORNE and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:  Ben Frydenberg, for the appellant
          Jacqueline Dais-Visca, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>DATE:     February 9, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The defence in this matter was a denial by the corporate
respondent that the son of the principals of the respondent
corporation had either the actual or ostensible authority to
enter into the contracts for the lease of computer equipment that
are at issue in this action. The respondent also denied receipt
of the equipment.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The matter proceeded to trial and the trial judge, having
heard all of the evidence, gave very full reasons before
dismissing the action. He found that the son had no authority to
enter into the contracts and that he was not held out by the
corporation as having such authority.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  After having considered all of the matters in argument
before us, we are not prepared to interfere with these findings.
Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
