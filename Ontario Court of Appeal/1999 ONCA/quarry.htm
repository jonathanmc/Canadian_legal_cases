    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial in this action was largely concerned with the
issue of liability. The defendant has appealed from the trial
judge&#146;s assessment of damages and raised several issues which
were not raised or developed at any length at trial. In general
terms, the appellant must show us that the trial judge&#146;s findings
are not reasonably supportable on the evidence. In approaching
the issues raised before us, it is appropriate for us to review
the trial judge&#146;s conclusions bearing in mind the case presented
to her by the parties.

[2]  In our view, giving the evidence the interpretation most
favourable to the respondent, some of the trial judge&#146;s
conclusions are not reasonably supportable on the evidence or are
based on a misapprehension of the evidence.

[3]  In her assessment, the trial judge accepted the respondent&#146;s
submission that the lost profit on the breach was $2,400,000.
This was based on a gross sales revenue of $5,455,000 and direct
costs of $3,055,763. With respect, we do not think that the
evidence is reasonably capable of supporting either of these
amounts.

[4]  The sales revenue, as found by the trial judge, appears to
be based, ultimately, on the evidence of the respondent&#146;s witness
Berkhout. He testified that at the relevant time the lots in the
subject property had a value closer to those in Fonthill than to
those in Welland. The top value for lots in Fonthill was at the
rate of $1,100 a front foot. This appears to be the basis of the
sale price of the lots for $55,000 in the submission made by the
respondent which the trial judge accepted. In accepting this
submission she went beyond the evidence which was not that the
lots in the subject property had the same value as those in
Fonthill but, rather, were closer in value to those lots than
lots in Welland.

[5]  The appellant submits that the appropriate figure set forth
in an appraisal report of Ridley &amp; Associates was $30,000 per lot
based on 60 foot frontages.

[6]  In our view, giving substantial weight to the evidence which
underlay the trial judge&#146;s conclusions but not exceeding the
scope of this evidence, it would be appropriate to assess the
sales income at $4,500,000.

[7]  On the expense side of the calculation, in the determination
of damages, the trial judge misapprehended some of the evidence
and in doing so understated the costs involved in the
development. She failed to take into account the evidence of the
respondent&#146;s expert, Russell. His total costs (services) was
$2,295,903.50. From this should be deducted the City of Welland
impost fees of $211,804 (agreed to by the appellant) and the 10
per cent contingency of $208,718 (dealt with later). The
resulting amount is $1,875,381. To this amount, the amounts in
Mr. Schertzing&#146;s evidence of $254,000 (O.M.B. Legals, Office, and
Realty) must be added, for a total of $2,129,381. Adding the cost
of the land of $1,300,000 to this amount gives a total cost, in
determining the damages, of $3,429,381, which we round off to
$3,430,000.

[8]  In the result, the gross profit ($3,430,000 from $4,500,000)
is $1,070,000.

[9]  From the $1,070,000 must be deducted $200,000 for the cost
of dedicated land and $200,000 for the cost of financing delay,
both set out in the trial judge&#146;s reasons. The result is $670,000
from which must be deducted the 10% contingency ($67,000). The
net profit is $603,000.

[10] The conclusion of the trial judge respecting the 60% chance
of success with respect to the development is reasonably
supportable on the evidence.

[11] In the result, it is our conclusion that the evidence
reasonably sustains a finding of $361,800 (60% of $603,000) as
the damages flowing from the appellant&#146;s breach.

[12] Accordingly, we allow the appeal, with costs, and vary the
judgment of the trial judge from $1,000,000 to $361,800. The
respondent is entitled to the costs of the trial, subject to the
effect of any relevant offer of settlement.</pre>
