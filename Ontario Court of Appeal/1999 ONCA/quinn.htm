    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  It is conceded that the appellant drove his motor vehicle
while his ability was impaired. The trial judge found that the
consumption of alcohol was a major cause of his impairment. There
was ample evidence that at the time the appellant entered his car
to drive that he knew or ought to have known that his ability was
impaired. Over the previous 10 hours he had taken six Dimetapp
tablets. He then drank at least two beers, on his evidence. He
testified that before he entered his car he felt funny and queasy
and that while he was driving he felt strange. He continued to
drive.

[2]  In our view, this case at his highest, raises a question of
mixed fact and law. Therefore, we would refuse leave to appeal.</pre></td>
