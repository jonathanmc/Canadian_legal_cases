    <pre>[1]  Following a seven-day trial before Edythe MacDonald J. and a
jury, the appellant was convicted of one count of indecent
assault and one count of incest committed  between 1978 and 1980
against his daughter, who was then a young teenager. The jury
acquitted the appellant of a third count of sexual assault
against another young woman who was the girl friend of the
appellant's son. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for
32 months concurrent on each count. He appeals against his
convictions and against sentence.
[2]  The difficulties with which the trial of these charges
confronted the jury were compounded by the fact that the
appellant was appearing on his own behalf. Such was his
unfamiliarity with the rules of evidence that, in cross-
examination of his ex-wife within minutes of the opening of the
trial, he opened the door by questions he asked that were
suggestive of the complainant's recent fabrication to a
substantial body of evidence of prior consistent statements that
the Crown subsequently adduced from other witnesses.  The
appellant also put his own character in issue.
[3]  By the time the trial ended, the jury was required to
consider in its deliberations not only conflicting evidence
respecting the acts alleged in the indictment but also evidence
of previous complaints, of similar acts, of good and bad
character and of the  record of a witness. In sifting through
this evidence and assigning to it its proper role in their
deliberations, the jurors were entitled to receive from the trial
judge helpful, clear instructions  regarding the evidence that
had been led at the trial and the manner in which they might use
that evidence and, equally important, the use to which they could
put it. In our view, they did not receive such instructions.
[4]   The charge to the jury began, conventionally, with a
statement of the introductory &quot;boilerplate&quot; by which such charges
have come to be marked, and no complaint is made by the appellant
with respect to that introductory portion.
[5]  As the trial judge moved from the general to the particular,
however, she began to stray from the clear focus to which the
jury was entitled to look for assistance in rendering its
verdict. In speaking of sexual abuse, she referred to recent news
stories about abuse by hockey coaches of young hockey players and
to an article in a local newspaper about a local teacher accused
of molesting his elementary school students. In dealing with
evidence of contemporaneous complaints and evidence, which she
had refused to admit, of other sexual activity on the part of the
complainant in the past, she treated the jury to a historical
review of the law and to amendments to the Criminal Code that had
sought to address those subjects. In comments that were quite
unconnected to the jury's task, she referred to the O.J. Simpson
case and to another case that she had recently tried. She read
passages to the jury from the headnotes and reasons for judgment
in three decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada. She gave the
jury the law report citations of those cases and, in one 
instance, quoted not only from the reasons of the court but also
from a text to which the reasons referred. She attempted to
explain the law as to the admissibility of similar fact evidence
and told the jury that it was their exclusive right to decide
whether evidence she had admitted was in fact similar evidence
and, if so, &quot;to determine what the effect of that finding is&quot;.
This extraneous and irrelevant material should not have been
included in the charge to the jury.
[6]  The trial judge's charge to the jury was very lengthy and we
do not intend, by these comments, to suggest that it was
universally unhelpful or confusing to the jury. However, we are
of the view that, on a reading of the charge in its totality, the
jury could not help but be confused with respect to the manner in
which it was to make findings on  the evidence that had been led
during the course of the trial and the use it was to make of the
findings that it reached. We are unable to say that the verdict
would necessarily have been the same if the jury had had the
benefit of direct, focused instructions from the trial judge and,
with considerable reluctance, we see no alternative to ordering a
new trial.
[7]  We therefore allow the appeal against conviction, set aside
the appellant's convictions and direct a new trial on the charges
of which the appellant was convicted.</pre></td>
