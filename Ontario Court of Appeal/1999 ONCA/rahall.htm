      <pre>HEARD:      October 20, 1999
</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice McNeely dated February 5, 1999.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  McNeely J. stayed the appellant’s (plaintiff’s) action on
the basis that Alberta was the appropriate forum.  He did so
because, in his view, there was “an overwhelming connection
between this case and Alberta.”
[2]  The appellant appeals.  The respondents, Her Majesty the
Queen in Right of Alberta and the Superintendent of Financial
Institutions support the conclusion reached by McNeely J.  They
also challenge the appellant’s right to bring the action on other
grounds.  These were raised before McNeely J. but were not dealt
with by him.
[3]  We agree with the conclusion of McNeely J. and, like him, do
not find it necessary to deal with any issue other than the
question of whether Ontario was the appropriate forum.
[4]  The appellant claims that he was denied natural justice by
the manner in which the proceedings were conducted in the motion
court.  He claimed that he should have been granted an
adjournment.  In so far as McNeely J. refers to the evidence that
the appellant would have adduced had he been granted an
adjournment, we agree with McNeely J.’s conclusion that it was
not necessary to adjourn the proceedings to allow that evidence
to be tendered.  The appellant has not placed any material before
this court by way of fresh evidence to suggest what additional
evidence he would have placed before McNeely J. had he been
granted an adjournment.  The appellant has also not placed any
material before this court to demonstrate how he was prejudiced
by the refusal of the adjournment especially on the question of
whether Ontario was an appropriate forum in which to try this
matter.  This ground of appeal must fail.
[5]  The approach to be taken where it is alleged that the forum
chosen for trial by the plaintiff is not an appropriate forum is
set out in Amchem Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers’
Compensation Board), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897 at 912.  In determining
the appropriate forum, the court looks first for a “real and
substantial connection” to the jurisdiction selected by the
plaintiff.  If that connection does not exist, the forum is not
an appropriate forum.  If that connection exists, the party
choosing that forum may rely on juridical advantages existing in
that forum to resist an application to stay the proceedings on
the basis that some other forum with a real and substantial
connection is the appropriate forum:  Amchem Products Inc.,
supra, at p. 920.
[6]  We find virtually no connection between the substance of the
claim advanced in this action, or its factual matrix and Ontario.
However, the connection with Alberta is, as McNeely J. said,
overwhelming.  The claim attacks the constitutionality of Alberta
legislation, the actions of Alberta government officials, relates
to the activity of Alberta financial institutions, involves
events which occurred in Alberta and may well be affected by
bankruptcy proceedings extant in Alberta.  A clearer case for
holding that Alberta is the appropriate forum is difficult to
imagine.
[7]  Nor are we persuaded that the possibility that the
appellant’s trustee in bankruptcy could discontinue the action if
it were commenced in Alberta constitutes a juridical advantage to
proceeding in Ontario.  The Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C.
1985, c.B-3 applies across Canada and, as counsel for the
appellant acknowledged, the trustee could take the same step if
the matter proceeded in Ontario.
[8]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
