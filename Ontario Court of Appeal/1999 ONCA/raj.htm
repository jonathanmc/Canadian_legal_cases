</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice W. J. Festeryga dated
March 12, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns competing claims to an interest in 14
Fielding Court in Ajax, Ontario, a property to which the Land
Titles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L-5 applies.  The relevant facts are
as follows.
[2]  By way of a transfer of charge registered on title on
June 28, 1990 R. A. &amp; J. Family Investment Corporation (R.A.&amp; J.)
acquired an interest in the mortgage registered against the title
to this property.
[3]  On August 13, 1990 a cessation of charge was registered
discharging this mortgage and releasing the interest of R. A. &amp;
J. in the property.  This document was prepared and registered
without the knowledge or approval of R. A. &amp; J.  The execution of
the document on behalf of R. A. &amp; J. was a forgery.
[4]  On December 10, 1990 a charge was registered on title
granting a mortgage to the Royal Bank.  The Royal Bank
subsequently commenced power of sale proceedings under this
mortgage.  It issued and served its notice of sale on October 22,
1993.  Because of the registered cessation of charge, the Bank
did not serve R. A. &amp; J.
[5]  Then, on October 25, 1993, R. A. &amp; J., having learned of the
forgery, registered a certificate of pending litigation on title
giving notice of litigation in which it claimed a mortgage
interest in the property despite the forged cessation of charge.
[6]  On April 7, 1994 R. A. &amp; J. concluded an agreement in which
it agreed to assign to the trustee in a related bankruptcy any
interest it had in any mortgage.
[7]  The sale by the Royal Bank was concluded on April 14, 1994
by the registration of a transfer to Hermitage North Holdings
Ltd.  On the same date a charge was registered on title
reflecting the mortgage which Hermitage placed on the property in
favour of Hurontario Capital Corporation.
[8]  Almost a year later, on March 9, 1995, a charge was
registered on title reflecting a mortgage given by Hermitage to
Scotia Mortgage Corporation.  Immediately afterwards on the same
day, a postponement of charge was registered by which Hurontario
postponed its charge to the Scotia charge.  This postponement was
also a forgery.
[9]  Shortly thereafter the owner of the property borrowed
$300,000 from Canada Trust.  These funds were used to discharge
the Scotia mortgage.  Canada Trust was to receive a first
mortgage against the property but its solicitor failed to obtain
and register such a mortgage.
[10] Finally, in August 1996, on consent, the property was sold
and the net proceeds of $104, 422.14 were paid into court pending
the outcome of this litigation.
[11] These proceedings consist of motions and cross-motions
brought by each of the four claimants to these funds.  None of
the claimants are in any way responsible for the acts of forgery
and neglect that have caused this situation.  The four are as
follows:
     a)   R. A. &amp; J., which asserts its mortgage interest despite the
          forged cessation of charge;
          </pre>
    <pre>     b)   the trustee in bankruptcy, who asserts that if R. A. &amp; J.
          has a valid mortgage interest, he was assigned that interest by
          the agreement of April 7, 1994;
          </pre>
    <pre>     c)   Hurontario, which argues that R. A. &amp; J. is defeated by the
          registration of the cessation of charge and that its own claim
          prevails since Canada Trust cannot subrogate to the position of
          the Scotia mortgage which in any event ranks behind its own
          mortgage; and
          </pre>
    <pre>     d)   Canada Trust, which supports the Hurontario attack on the R.
          A. &amp; J. claim but argues that it ranks ahead of Hurontario
          because of the registered postponement of charge coupled with its
          own right of subrogation to the position of Scotia.</pre>
    <pre>[12] At first instance, Festeryga J. determined that the forged
cessation of the R. A. &amp; J. charge was a nullity at common law
and therefore void.  He went on to find that since the claims of
Hurontario and Canada Trust arose after the registration of the
certificate of pending litigation they are both subject to the
claim of R. A. &amp; J.  Finally, he concluded that as between R. A.
&amp; J. and the trustee, the assignment provided for in the
agreement of April 7, 1994 entitles the trustee to succeed and to
receive the funds in court.
[13] For the reasons that follow, I disagree with this result. I
conclude first, that the claim of R. A. &amp; J. cannot prevail over
those of Hurontario and Canada Trust and second, that as between
these two, Canada Trust must succeed.  Hence, it is entitled to
the funds in court.
[14] In evaluating the claim of R. A. &amp; J. the first matter to be
addressed is the effect of the registration of the cessation of
charge, given that this document was a forgery and therefore
fraudulent.
[15] R. A. &amp; J. concedes, correctly, that despite being a forgery
the registered cessation of charge means that the subsequent
mortgage given by the Royal Bank was registered without notice of
the claim of R. A. &amp; J. and is unaffected by it.  The Land Titles
Act embodies the principle that the register is a mirror of the
state of the title.  An instrument, once registered, is deemed to
be effective according to its nature and intent.  See
particularly s. 78(4) of the Act.  Hence when a cessation of
charge is registered, the charge ceases and is deleted from the
register.
[16] The Act also modifies the common-law rule that a forged
document is a nullity and is void.  Section 155 expressly
provides that this rule is subject to the provisions of the Act
with respect to registered dispositions for valuable
consideration.
[17] Here, the registered Royal Bank charge was for valuable
consideration.  It was registered after the registration of the
cessation of charge.  Hence, with respect to the Royal Bank
charge, the cessation of the R. A. &amp; J. charge, though a forgery,
is deemed by the Act to mean what it says and to be effective in
discharging the mortgage in which R. A. &amp; J. had an interest.
The Royal Bank interest in the property is therefore unaffected
by any claim by R. A. &amp; J.  Nor can R. A. &amp; J. rely on the
forgery to prevail over Hurontario and Canada Trust since their
claims derive from the Royal Bank charge, and are therefore
equally unaffected by any claim by R. A. &amp; J.
[18] This conclusion, of course, can have no adverse effect on
any rights which R. A. &amp; J. may have against the original
borrower or against the Land Titles Assurance Fund because of the
forgery.
[19] R. A. &amp; J. sought to uphold its claim on the basis of the
certificate of pending litigation which it registered.  It
concedes that when the Royal Bank sold the property to Hermitage
under power of sale, Hermitage derived title other than through
the registered owner and because of s. 71(2) of the Act was
therefore unaffected by the certificate of pending litigation.
It argues, however, that any interest in the property acquired by
Hurontario or Canada Trust arose after the certificate was
registered and is therefore subject to the R. A. &amp; J. claim set
out in that certificate.
[20] I do not agree.  Section 71(2) of the Act reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (2)  Where a notice, caution, inhibition or restriction
          is registered, every registered owner of the land and every
          person deriving title through the registered owner, excepting
          owners of encumbrances registered prior to the registration of
          such notice, caution, inhibition or restriction, shall be deemed
          to be affected with notice of any unregistered estate, right,
          interest or equity referred to therein.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Neither Hurontario nor Canada Trust derived its interest in
the property through the registered owner at the time the
certificate of pending litigation was registered.  Like
Hermitage, they each acquired their interest through the Royal
Bank, the owner of an encumbrance registered prior to the
registration of the certificate of pending litigation.  They are
therefore unaffected by that certificate.  Since the title passed
by the Royal Bank to Hermitage is untouched by the claim
contained in the certificate, Hermitage is able to grant an
interest in that title by way of a subsequent charge that is
equally unaffected by the claim of R. A. &amp; J. set out in that
certificate.
[22] Hence, R. A. &amp; J. can rely on neither the forgery of the
cessation of charge nor the certificate of pending litigation to
prevail over Hurontario and Canada Trust.  Accordingly, its claim
to the funds in court must fail.
[23] In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with
the trustee's claim since that claim would arise only if R. A. &amp;
J. were successful as against Hurontario and Canada Trust.
[24] It remains to be determined which of Hurontario or Canada
Trust has the better claim to the funds in court.  This requires
that two questions be answered.  First, does the forgery of the
postponement of charge remove the priority which the Scotia
charge would otherwise have over the Hurontario charge.  If not,
the second question is whether Canada Trust has a right of
subrogation to the position of Scotia.
[25] In my view, the fact that the registered postponement was
forged and therefore fraudulent does not negate the conclusion
that the Scotia charge has priority over the Hurontario charge.
Section 78(6) of the Land Titles Act expressly contemplates that
the rights of a prior registered charge holder may be postponed
to those of a subsequently registered charge holder by means of a
registered postponement instrument.  Section 78(4) deems such a
document to be effective according to its nature and intent.
Section 155 provides that such a document, although fraudulent
and void at common law, is subject to the provisions of the Act
with respect to registered dispositions for valuable
consideration.
[26] Here, the Scotia mortgage was a registered disposition for
valuable consideration.  The conclusion dictated by the Act is
that the registered postponement of charge is effective to give
the Scotia charge priority over the Hurontario charge.  This
conclusion does not affect any rights which Hurontario may have
against the Land Titles Assurance Fund.
[27] Finally, Hurontario argues that Canada Trust has no right of
subrogation to the Scotia position because this would require an
unjust enrichment for which subrogation could provide the remedy
and there is no unjust enrichment of Hurontario in this case.
[28] I disagree.  In my opinion, when Canada Trust advances funds
which are used to discharge the Scotia mortgage where it is
intended that Canada Trust be secured by a first mortgage then
Canada Trust has a right of subrogation to the Scotia position.
The Canada Trust claim thus has priority over the Hurontario
charge just as the Scotia charge did.
[29] This use of the doctrine of subrogation is well established
in our law.  For example, in Coupland Acceptance Ltd. v. Walsh
(1954), 2 D.L.R. 129 at 130, the Supreme Court of Canada quoted
with approval the following statement of law by Parker J. in
Crosbie-Hill v. Sayer, [1908] 1 Ch. 866 at 877:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Further I think that, where a third party at the request of
          a mortgagor pays off a first mortgage with a view to becoming
          himself a first mortgagee of the property, he becomes, in default
          of evidence of intention to the contrary, entitled in equity to
          stand, as against the property, in the shoes of the first
          mortgagee.</pre>
    <pre>[30] As Austin J.A. said in  Mutual Trust Co. v. Creditview
Estate Homes Ltd. (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 583 at 587, the
fundamental principle underlying the doctrine of subrogation is
one of fairness.  If the remedy of subrogation were not available
to Canada Trust, Hurontario would indeed be unjustly enriched in
the sense that the equity in the property available to satisfy
the Hurontario charge would be increased by the value of the
funds advanced by Canada Trust to discharge the prior Scotia
mortgage.  In these circumstances, it is only consistent with the
principles of fairness that Canada Trust have a right of
subrogation to the position of Scotia.  Hence, its claim must
prevail over that of Hurontario.
[31] In the result, the appeal is allowed.  The order below is
set aside and in its place there will be an order that Canada
Trust is entitled to the monies standing in court together with
accrued interest thereon.  The other motions are dismissed.
Canada Trust is entitled to its costs here and below for which R.
A. &amp; J., the trustee, and Hurontario are jointly and severally
responsible.
