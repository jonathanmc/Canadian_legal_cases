    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  These appeals (C29309 and C29310) must be dismissed.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The plaintiffs commenced separate actions in 1993 for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">alleged medical malpractice.  The actions were conducted by a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">solicitor until April 1996 and have been conducted by the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">plaintiffs personally since that time.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  They have, however, repeatedly refused to produce medical</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">information and to sign releases or directions to facilitate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">discovery.  This, despite orders to do so.  Instead, they have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">consistently blamed others for the fact that the action has</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">stalled:  first their lawyer, then the defendant’s lawyers and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">now the courts.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  Although they have been granted extensions for some years,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they have failed to comply with the Rules or orders</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">notwithstanding the imposition of ultimata since July 5, 1996.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  The appellants are correct when they say that the defendant</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">moved quickly when the reasons of Boland J. were released,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refusing leave to appeal from the order of Cumming J. of December</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">22, 1997.  They cannot complain in that regard nor suggest that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they were taken by surprise.  They were told in unmistakable</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terms that when those reasons were released, if leave was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">refused, the defendant would move immediately.  In any event,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they had ample opportunity to comply with the requirement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">specified by Cumming J. long before those reasons were released.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  There is nothing to be gained by repeating what has already</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been said, particularly by Cumming J. in his reasons of December</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">22, 1997.  Each of his findings is soundly based upon the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">evidence before the court.  Even today, there is no indication on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the part of the appellants that they have any intention of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">complying with the requirements of the Rules.  Instead, they wish</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to set aside the orders of Cumming J., Boland J. and Master</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Garfield, the latter having been made some years ago.
