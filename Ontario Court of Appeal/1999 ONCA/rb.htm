    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by His Honour Judge Brownstone on
September 9, 1997</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant young offender appeals his conviction for
touching for a sexual purpose.1  The appellant was 17 years of
age at the time that he allegedly assaulted the six year old
complainant.  The appellant&#146;s mother baby-sat the complainant in
her home.  The appellant defended the case on three bases.  He
denied touching the complainant and relied upon frailties and
inconsistencies in her evidence.  He also claimed that he had no
opportunity  to commit  the offence  because he was   never
alone with  the  complainant.
</pre>
    <pre>Finally,   the  appellant  relied  upon  an  alibi,   in  that
on  the  day  that  the offence was allegedly committed he was at
a sports practice and did not come home until after the
complainant had returned to her home.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  While the appellant raised a number of grounds of appeal, I
find it necessary only to deal with two related grounds.  The
trial judge&#146;s complete failure to deal with the appellant&#146;s
testimony and his misapprehension of evidence concerning the
alibi.  For the reasons that follow I would allow the appeal and
order a new trial.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant&#146;s mother, Mrs. B., was the regular babysitter
for the six-year old complainant, L. R., and her baby brother.
The B. and R. homes were across the street from each other.
After school, the complainant would stay with Mrs. B. until she
was picked up by her mother.  While she was waiting for her
mother, she would sometimes play games with the appellant and
other children.  The complainant testified that on one occasion
when she went to the washroom the appellant pulled down her pants
and pushed his thumb back and forth on her vagina.  The
complainant provided a number of details of the assault.  She
also testified that the appellant made her promise not to tell
her mother.  During cross-examination, the complainant indicated
that she knew the appellant used his thumb because he had done
this to her before and used his thumb on that occasion.  The
complainant could provide no details about this earlier incident.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The complainant disclosed this touching when she was being
bathed by her mother on September 19th.  She told her mother that
her vagina was hurting.  Her mother asked if anybody was touching
it and she said  [the appellant's first name].  The complainant&#146;s
mother saw a red spot about the size of a pencil eraser between
her vagina and anus.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  That night, the 19th, Mrs. R. spoke to Mrs. B. and disclosed
her daughter&#146;s allegation.  The complainant was taken to a doctor
the following day, September 20th, but the mark was no longer
visible.  There was no other physical evidence of sexual abuse.
After the visit to the doctor, Mrs. R. contacted the Children&#146;s
Aid Society and the police.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The testimony as to when the disclosure occurred in relation
to the time of the offence was important but confusing. The
complainant&#146;s mother testified as follows:

               I asked her, &#147;Was it today?&#148;  And she said, &#147;No.&#148;  And I
          asked her, &#147;Yesterday?&#148;  And she say [sic], &#147;Yes. No. I don&#146;t
          want to talk about it any more.&#148;  That was what she said.  So I
          say, &#147;Fine.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The complainant was examined by Crown counsel about the
timing of disclosure as follows:

               Q.   Did you ever tell your mom about it?
               A.   Yes.
               Q.   Okay.  When did you tell her about it?
               A.   The day that I told her about it.
               THE COURT:     What's that, when did you
          tell her about it?
               A.   The day I told her about it.
               THE COURT:     You told your mom the day
          you told her about it?
               A.   Yes.
               THE COURT:     Well, what she&#146;s asking
          you is what day was that?
               A.   The day when R.B.  told me, &#147;You
          promise not to tell my mom.&#148;
               THE COURT:     So the same day that that happened.
               A.   Yes.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The trial took place about a year after the incident.  The
information alleged that the sexual touching took place between
September 1, 1995 and September 20, 1996.  At the opening of the
trial, Crown counsel indicated that she was only relying upon the
incident that led to the involvement of the police.  This was
referred to as the incident on September 19, 1996, the date that
the disclosure was made to the complainant&#146;s mother.  September
19, 1996 was a Thursday.  The appellant was on his school
volleyball team and he had practices on Monday, Wednesday and
Friday.  On those days, he would not get home until between 7:00
and 7:15 p.m.  By that time, the complainant had gone home.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  When the appellant gave his evidence about the volleyball
practices the trial judge intervened to ask about its relevance.
The transcript discloses the following:

               DEFENCE COUNSEL:  Because you have evidence, Your Honour,
          that the complainant told her mother on one occasion that it
          happened yesterday.  Yesterday was the 18th.
               THE COURT:     That&#146;s not the evidence.
               --- Discussion between the Court and
          counsel.
               THE COURT:     The evidence that I have
          is that the mother, she was giving her child
          a bath on September the 20th and the
          information is on or about.  In any event,
          it&#146;s not particularly crucial but the
          evidence I have is that this occurred on the
          19th.
               DEFENCE COUNSEL:    All right.
               THE COURT:     That&#146;s what the mother&#146;s
          evidence is that I noted numerous times, so,
          in any event, you were talking about the 18th
          of September?  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[10] At the conclusion of the appellant&#146;s evidence in chief, the
trial judge then intervened again as follows:
               THE COURT:     Just before you&#151;just to&#151;in case you wanted to
          cover anything else I was just reviewing my notes again.  The
          evidence of the mother was that the bath was on the 20th and that
          she asked the child was it today, the answer was no.  Question,
          yesterday?  Answer, yes&#151;no.  I don&#146;t want talk to about it, so
          it's not clear and, in any event, the information covers the span
          of just over a year but if you did with to pursue the 18th, I
          didn&#146;t mean to stop you from doing that?
               DEFENCE COUNSEL:  Well, in any event,
          he&#146;s given his evidence that on the 18th he
          was &#150;
               THE COURT:     He wasn&#146;t home until
          7:15.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Finally, at the end of the appellant&#146;s testimony and before
the appellant&#146;s mother was called, defence counsel raised the
issue of the date and the following dialogue occurred:
               DEFENCE COUNSEL:  Just before we get on with Mrs. B., I have
          shown the willstate of Mrs. R. to my friend for the crown
          regarding the date of the 19th and the willstate confirms my
          recollection about what the evidence was that it was on the 19th
          and I can show you the willstate, if you wish?
               THE COURT Well, sir, I have to go by the
          evidence that I heard and as I&#146;ve explained
          to you the time period in this information
          spans just over a year.  I have written down
          word-for-word what the evidence was pretty
          much on this point.  It&#146;s not particularly
          significant given the time you have alleged
          and whether it was the 18th or the 19th or
          the 20th is not particularly going to make a
          whole lot of difference given the way the
          evidence has come up so I don&#146;t need to see
          the willstate.  I&#146;d like to hear the rest of
          the evidence?</pre>
    <pre>[12] At least at this point in the trial, the trial judge has
misapprehended the evidence and the importance of the timing
issue.  The complainant&#146;s mother clearly testified that the
disclosure was on the 19th, a Thursday.  If the assault occurred
&#147;yesterday&#148; and the appellant was believed, he could not have
committed the offence since he was at volleyball practice.  On
this issue, the appellant&#146;s evidence was not seriously challenged
and it was supported by the testimony of his mother.  In
addition, Mrs. B. testified that when the complainant&#146;s mother
came to see her the evening of the 19th, Mrs. B. asked her when
it happened.  The complainant&#146;s mother said &#147;yesterday&#148;.  Mrs. B.
told her that was impossible.  She later confirmed this by
checking the days that the appellant had practices.</pre>
    <pre>THE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</pre>
    <pre>[13] While the trial judge reviewed much of the evidence in his
reasons for judgment, he made no mention of the appellant&#146;s
evidence.  As counsel for the appellant put it in oral argument,
one would never know from reading the reasons that the appellant
had testified.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The trial judge made the following references to the timing
of the offence:
               I found the child complainant, L. R. to be very credible,
          although she was unable to provide details with respect to some
          minor matters.  Her testimony with respect to the assault that
          occurred on or about September 20th, 1996 was very convincing,
          sincere, forthright and unshakeable on cross-examination.
               &#133;
               Regarding the discrepancies in the
          testimony regarding the date, they are not
          important.  The time is in the span of just
          over a year.  It is clear from Mrs. R. that
          the assault occurred either on September 18th
          or 19th and it is also clear from the
          evidence, which I do accept, that the
          complainant had been sexually assaulted by
          the accused, even prior to that time.  The
          disclosure indicated the 19th.  The child
          told the mother that it happened either that
          day or the day before and she said she did
          not want to talk about it.  The child
          testified she told her mother the same day it
          happened.  I find on the facts that the Crown
          has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the
          assault occurred on or about the 19th of
          September of 1996.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[15] The failure to give reasons in a criminal case does not
itself constitute reversible error.  This was made clear in
several recent cases.  However, in those same cases the Supreme
Court has indicated the circumstances in which failure to give
reasons may require appellate intervention.  In R. v. Barrett
(1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 319 (S.C.C.) at 320, Iacobucci J. held as
follows:
               While it is clearly preferable to give reasons and although
          there may be some cases where reasons may be necessary, by
          itself, the absence of reasons of a trial judge cannot be a
          ground for appellate review when the finding is otherwise
          supportable on the evidence or where the basis of the finding is
          apparent from the circumstances. The issue is the reasonableness
          of the finding not an absence or insufficiency of reasons.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[16] Similarly, in R. v. Burns (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 193
(S.C.C.) at 199-200, McLachlin J. held as follows:
               The judge is not required to demonstrate that he or she
          knows the law and has considered all aspects of the evidence. Nor
          is the judge required to explain why he or she does not entertain
          a reasonable doubt as to the accused's guilt. Failure to do any
          of these things does not, in itself, permit a court of appeal to
          set aside the verdict.
               This rule makes good sense. To require
          trial judges charged with heavy case-loads of
          criminal cases to deal in their reasons with
          every aspect of every case would slow the
          system of justice immeasurably. Trial judges
          are presumed to know the law with which they
          work day in and day out. If they state their
          conclusions in brief compass, and these
          conclusions are supported by the evidence,
          the verdict should not be overturned merely
          because they fail to discuss collateral
          aspects of the case.
               The Court of Appeal relied on the
          following passage from R. v Harper (1982), 65
          C.C.C. (2d) 193 at p. 210, 133 D.L.R. (3d)
          546, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 2, where this court
          stated:
                         Where the record, including the
               reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of
               appreciation of relevant evidence and more
               particularly the complete disregard of such
               evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing
               tribunal to intercede.
               This statement should not be read
          as placing on trial judges a positive
          duty to demonstrate in their reasons
          that they have completely appreciated
          each aspect of relevant evidence. The
          statement does not refer to the case
          where the trial judge has failed to
          allude to difficulties in the evidence,
          but rather to the case where the trial
          judge's reasons demonstrate that he or
          she has failed to grasp an important
          point or has chosen to disregard it,
          leading to the conclusion that the
          verdict was not one which the trier of
          fact could reasonably have reached.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[17] In my view, it is apparent from the record as a whole that
the trial judge failed to appreciate relevant evidence and his
reasons indicate that he failed to grasp an important point upon
which the accused&#146;s defence depended.  That point was the time
when the offence occurred.  If the touching occurred on the day
before the disclosure to the complainant&#146;s mother, the appellant
had a potential alibi which had to be dealt with by the trial
judge.</pre>
    <pre>[18] In a case of sexual assault, especially an assault on a
young child, time is usually not an essential aspect of the case.
It can be so, however, in some circumstances.  Wilson J.
explained those circumstances in R. v. B. (G.) (1990), 56 C.C.C.
(3d) 200 (S.C.C.) at 218, where she set out four principles, only
two of which are germane to this appeal:
               3.   If there is conflicting evidence regarding the time of
          the offence, or the date of the offence cannot be established
          with precision, the information need not be quashed and a
          conviction may result, provided that time is not an essential
          element of the offence or crucial to the defence.
               4.   If the time of the offence cannot
          be determined and time is an essential
          element of the offence or crucial to the
          defence, a conviction cannot be sustained.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[19] She then concluded as follows:
               Accordingly, when a court is faced with circumstances in
          which the time of the offence cannot be determined with precision
          or the information conflicts with the evidence, the first
          question that must be asked is whether time is either an
          essential element of the offence or crucial to the defence. It
          will only be in cases where this first question is answered
          affirmatively that the trier of fact must then determine whether
          the time of the offence has been proven beyond a reasonable
          doubt. If the answer to the first question is in the negative, a
          conviction may result even although the time of the offence is
          not proven, provided that the rest of the Crown's case is proven
          beyond a reasonable doubt.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[20] The time of the offence was crucial to the defence within
the meaning of these principles.  It was therefore incumbent on
the trial judge to deal with that issue.  He was in error in
stating that the discrepancies regarding date were not important
or that the appellant&#146;s evidence about his whereabouts on
September 18th was not relevant.</pre>
    <pre>[21] In R. v. P. (M.B.) (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at
297, Lamer C.J.C. gave further consideration to the question of
proof of the date of the offence in cases of sexual assault of
children:
               In this regard, I would simply note that courts, including
          this one, have accepted that, in cases involving offences and
          particularly sexual offences against young children, absolute
          precision with respect to the timing of an alleged offence will
          often be unrealistic and unnecessary: B. (G.), supra, at p. 218;
          also see R. v. W. (R.) (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 134 at pp. 142-4,
          [1992] 2 S.C.R. 122, 13 C.R. (4th) 257, and R. v. C. (R.I.)
          (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 399 at p. 403, 17 W.C.B. 370 (Ont. C.A.).
               The fact that an accused may have an
          alibi for the period (or part of the period)
          described in an indictment does not
          necessarily or automatically &quot;freeze&quot; the
          dates specified in that indictment. That is
          to say, there is no vested right to a given
          alibi. Alibi evidence must respond to the
          case as presented by the Crown, and not the
          other way around.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[22] Again, these principles were directly applicable to this
case.  &#147;Often&#148; precision with respect to the timing of the
alleged offence will be unrealistic and unnecessary.  This,
however, was one of those rare cases where precision could not
only be expected but it was necessary.  The time of the alleged
offence could be pinpointed with considerable precision because
of the almost contemporaneous disclosure.  The appellant led
alibi evidence to respond to this case as presented by the Crown.
It was incumbent on the trial judge to resolve this issue.  He
failed to do so.  It was not sufficient for the trial judge to
find that the assault occurred &#147;on or about&#148; the 19th day of
September of 1996.  If the complainant was referring to events on
the 18th, and the appellant and his mother were believed or if
their evidence raised a reasonable doubt that he was at practice
on that date, the appellant could not have committed the offence.
Particularly when this portion of the trial judge&#146;s reasons is
read with the earlier discussions in the course of the trial, it
is apparent in my view that this case falls within the principles
set out in Burns and Barrett.  To paraphrase McLachlin J. in
Burns, this is a case where the trial judge&#146;s reasons demonstrate
that he has failed to grasp an important point or at least has
chosen to disregard it.</pre>
    <pre>[23] There are other problems with the trial judge&#146;s reasons.
Throughout the trial and in the reasons, the trial judge appears
to have misapprehended the complainant&#146;s mother&#146;s evidence as to
the date when the disclosure took place.  This was a crucial
issue for the defence for the reasons already explained.  Of
particular concern is this portion of the reasons:
               It is clear from Mrs. R. that the assault occurred either on
          September 18th or 19th and it is also clear from the evidence,
          which I do accept, that the complainant had been sexually
          assaulted by the accused, even prior to that time.  The
          disclosure indicated the 19th. The child told the mother that it
          happened either that day or the day before and she said she did
          not want to talk about it.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge&#146;s reference to an earlier assault is
puzzling in this context.  The Crown had bound itself to proving
that the offence charged was the offence reported to the police.
This was the offence disclosed by the complainant on the 19th.
The appellant was entitled to defend the case on that basis.  See
R. v. Tarnovsky (1995), 98 C.C.C. (3d) 168 (Ont. C.A.) leave to
appeal to S.C.C. refused 100 C.C.C. (3d) vi.  In any event,
counsel for the Crown at trial never resiled from the position
she took at the beginning of the case.</pre>
    <pre>[25] The reference to the &#147;disclosure indicated the 19th&#148; is also
of concern.  If the trial judge is referring to the disclosure by
the complainant to her mother, this is simply not an accurate
statement.  The child&#146;s disclosure did not show that the offence
was committed on the 19th.  If the trial judge is referring to
the Crown disclosure to the defence in the form of the mother&#146;s
Swillstate&#148;, this too is not accurate.  In the first place, the
willstate was never placed in evidence2 and it was not proof of
anything.  Second, it appears from defence counsel&#146;s reference to
the willstate, that it merely indicated that the child disclosed
the offence to the mother on the 19th.  It certainly could not
establish that the offence was committed on the 19th.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Further, the reference to the mother&#146;s evidence is not
accurate.  The trial judge summarized that evidence as, &#147;The
child told the mother that it happened either that day or the day
before&#148;.  I have set out the mother&#146;s evidence above.  According
to her, the complainant denied that it happened on the same day
as the disclosure.  When she suggested to the child that it
occurred &#147;yesterday&#148;, the child said, &#147;Yes. No. I don&#146;t want to
talk about it any more.&#148;  There is nothing in this evidence  from
which it could be assumed that the child told her mother that it
happened either that day or the day before.  At best, the child
agreed that it happened &#147;yesterday&#148; or some other day.  Finally,
if the appellant&#146;s mother&#146;s evidence is accepted, it is apparent
that Mrs. R. believed that her daughter had told her that it
happened the day before, i.e. September 18th.</pre>
    <pre>[27] The trial judge&#146;s misapprehension of evidence related to
crucial points of the defence and, in my view, in light of these
errors the verdict cannot stand.  This is particularly the case
in light of the trial judge&#146;s failure to deal with the
appellant&#146;s evidence which, if believed, entitled him to an
acquittal.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[28] As there is evidence to support a finding of guilt this is
not a proper case to enter an acquittal.  Accordingly, I would
allow the appeal, quash the conviction for sexual touching, lift
the conditional stay on the charge of sexual assault, and order a
new trial on both charges.  The disposition imposed at trial was
two years' probation.  A year has already elapsed since that
disposition was made.  The Crown may wish to consider whether in
all the circumstances it is in the public interest to proceed
with a new trial.

conviction for that offence was provisionally stayed.
