      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Philp J. dated July 16, 1998
(reasons dated April 16, May 12 and July 16, 1998)</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
      <pre>[1]   On April 12, 1998, Philp J. ordered that the removal of the
child, Natalie Alexandra Kendell-Rechsteiner, from Switzerland to
Ontario  was  wrongful within the meaning of  Article  3  of  the
Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction,
(the Hague Convention).  He granted the appellant interim custody
of the child and further ordered that the appellant take steps to
enable  her return to Switzerland, with the child, within fifteen
days.   Philp J. further ordered the appellant to submit  to  the
jurisdiction  of  the Guardianship Department of  Reinach  for  a
determination of custody.  In addition, he ordered the  appellant
to pay costs fixed at $34,636.75.
[2]  The child and the mother returned to Switzerland on May 15,
1998.
[3]  Notwithstanding her departure, the mother appealed the order
of Philp J.  After the Registrar dismissed the appeal for delay
on December 22, 1998, an application to set aside the order of
the Registrar and for an extension of time within which to
perfect the appeal was brought and granted on February 26, 1999.
A further extension of time was sought and obtained to April 20,
1999. The delay has not been satisfactorily explained.  The child
and the mother have been back in Switzerland for more than
seventeen months.  No fresh evidence was submitted to advise of
the present status of the custody proceedings.
[4]  The determination of Philp J. that
          </pre>
      <pre>     (a) the child had been wrongfully removed from Switzerland;
          
     (b) that the child was  habitually resident in  Switzerland
         within the meaning of the Hague Convention; and

     (c) that the child should be returned to Switzerland</pre>
      <pre>were essentially questions of fact.  Philp J. did not
misapprehend the evidence and there was ample evidence to support
his conclusions.
[5]   The appellant also appeals the cost order made against her.
Philp  J.  found that solicitor-and-client costs were appropriate
to  show  the  court's  disapproval of the  appellant's  wrongful
conduct.  In our view, costs should not have been awarded in this
case.
[6]  In his reasons Philp J. found that neither the mother nor
the father had custody of the child at the time of her removal
from Switzerland.  Custody had been with the Swiss Guardianship
Department.  This was an important factor to consider on the
issue of costs.  See Thompson v. Thompson (1994), 6 R.F.L. (4th)
290 (S.C.C.) where in similar circumstances the Supreme Court
made no order as to costs although the child had been wrongfully
removed from Scotland by the mother.
[7]  Furthermore, in the present case the father's application
for the return of the child to Switzerland contained misleading
information.  The father swore that, during the week, the child
slept at his home after she attended the daycare centre and that
he was her primary caregiver prior to her removal to Canada.
Contrary to this assertion, Philp J. found that after the child
attended the daycare centre she was taken by her father to her
mother with whom she spent the evenings.
[8]  On the basis of these factors, this was not a proper case to
award costs against the mother.
[9]  Accordingly, the costs order is set aside. In all other
respects the appeal is dismissed.  We make no order as to costs
of the appeal.
