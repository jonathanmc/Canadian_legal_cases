    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants (Bourne) appeal from the judgment of Feldman
J. construing and enforcing an agreement made June 30, 1984
between Redwood Music Ltd. (Redwood) and seven publishers
including Bourne Co. The facts are contained in the reasons of
Feldman J. which are reported at (1995), 63 C.P.R. (3d) 380
(Ont.Ct. (Gen.Div.)) and we will not repeat them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The focus of the dispute between Bourne and Redwood was the
ownership of the German, Austrian and Swiss copyright in certain
songs, the most significant of which was A Are You Lonesome
Tonight?@ written in 1926 and popularized by Elvis Presley. (The
particular focus at the trial was on the German copyright , but
the parties and the expert witnesses agreed that the Austrian and
Swiss laws were similar to the German law, subject to their
effective dates.)  Under the correct interpretation of German
law, the ownership of the copyright in the songs in issue belongs
to Bourne. Under the agreement the parties entered into, however,
the parties made a mutual mistake as to the effect of German law
and wrongly thought that the copyright belonged to Redwood.
Although Feldman J. found that parties made a mutual mistake she
refused to grant Bourne the remedy of rectification because she
found that Bourne assumed the risk of mistake as to the effect of
the German law in its agreement with Redwood. Bourne submits that
Feldman J. erred in law when she refused to grant Bourne the
remedy of rectification. Alternatively Bourne submits that the
trial judge erred in her construction of the agreement and the
manner of implementation of that Agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We agree that Feldman J. was correct in refusing to grant
the remedy of rectification. The stated purpose of the agreement
was to settle all of Redwood=s claims, as to reversionary and
substituted copyright in any country in the world, with the aim
of avoiding litigation regarding the actual existence, extent and
application of substituted and reversionary interests in multiple
jurisdictions. In the agreement clause 1(a) states:
                    Redwood represents to Publishers
          that it owns, free from any claim known to
          it, the reversionary and substituted
          copyright in respect of the interests in all
          songs listed in Schedule A for the full terms
          of said reversionary and substituted interest
          in all the countries listed in Schedule C;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    Publishers agree that they do not,
          and will not, dispute Redwood=s claim in all
          Schedule C countries to the copyright as
          claimed in Schedule A. Y [Emphasis added.]
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant submits that the agreement could be rectified
by amending Schedule C to delete Germany, Switzerland and Austria
from the list of countries in the schedule. We do not agree that
the agreement could be rectified without an amendment to the
second paragraph of clause 1(a). In order to rectify the
agreement it would be necessary to add a phrase saying that
Bourne will not dispute Redwood=s claim, Aexcept where Redwood
has no rights@. This is not what the agreement says. The omission
of wording suggesting that Bourne had a right to challenge the
agreement if in fact Redwood did not own the copyright was not a
mere drafting error. Rectification is not appropriate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  In view of our conclusion on this point, it is unnecessary
for us to consider the appellant=s second submission as to the
interpretation of the agreement further.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent.</font></pre></td>
