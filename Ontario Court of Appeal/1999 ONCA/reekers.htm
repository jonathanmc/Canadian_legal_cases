    <pre>HEARD:         August 20, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice K. Ouellette,
sitting with a jury, on October 25, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our opinion, it would have been preferable if the trial
judge had directed the jury more clearly in accordance with the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in  R. v. W. (R.) (1992),
74 C.C.C. (3d) 134 which explains some of the statements made by
Wilson J. in R. v. B. (G.) (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 200 and which
were tracked by the trial judge in his charge.  Nonetheless,
after consideration of all the directions concerning the
assessment of the complainant's credibility, we are satisfied
that the appellant was not prejudiced.  We note in this regard
that there was no objection to the charge.
[2]  With respect to the impugned re-examination of the
complainant and cross-examination of the accused by Crown
counsel, we are satisfied that no prejudice was occasioned.
Objection was taken to only two questions.  Assuming the
questions were improper, they did not occasion any miscarriage of
justice.
[3]  We see no prejudice to the appellant in the directions
concerning the appellant's prior testimony.  The prior testimony
related to a peripheral matter and there is no possibility that
the jury would have used that evidence for any purpose other than
for credibility.
[4]  The charge to the jury with respect to reasonable doubt was
in accordance with the standard charge used in this province
prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.
Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1.  In our view the directions
were sufficient to adequately convey the meaning of reasonable
doubt to the jury.  There was no reversible error.
[5]  Similarly, the slight deviation from the suggested charge in
R. v. W. (D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 did not constitute
reversible error.  As Cory J. said at p. 409:
          </pre>
    <pre>               ... [T]he failure to use such language is not fatal if the
          charge, when read as a whole, makes it clear that the jury could
          not have been under any misapprehension as to the correct burden
          and standard of proof to apply.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.
[7]  With respect to sentence, the appellant has served the
custodial portion of the sentence and the only issue on the
appeal is whether the term of probation, including the community
service order, was excessive.  In our view, having regard to the
appellant's record and that he was on probation at the time this
offence was committed, we think the sentence was appropriate.
[8]  Accordingly, while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
appeal from sentence is dismissed.</pre></td>
