COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Appellant) and CLINTON
               ANTHONY REID (Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        BROOKE, FINLAYSON and O&#146;CONNOR JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Brad Reitz, for the appellant
               Clinton Anthony Reid, the respondent, in person</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         March 18, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge erred in ignoring the joint submission of
the Crown and defence counsel and substituting a conditional
sentence for that agreed upon without hearing the submissions
that the Crown was prepared to advance as to why a conditional
sentence was not appropriate. Those reasons included that the
narcotic involved was crack cocaine; the charge was possession
for the purpose of trafficking; the appellant had a criminal
record for an earlier conviction for possession for the purpose
of trafficking; and that he was on parole at the time of this
offence.

[2]  The conditional sentence is not a fit sentence in these
circumstances. A custodial term is required. Having regard to the
joint submissions made at trial of two years less a day and the
fact that the respondent has served four months of the
conditional sentence, we are all of the view that a fit sentence
now would be 12 months in custody.

[3]  We cannot leave this case without commenting that the
respondent has become the victim of the justice system because
the trial judge failed to follow appropriate sentencing
procedures. The appellant did not ask for a conditional sentence,
indeed he was prepared to agree to a custodial term of some
severity. He has filed material demonstrating that he has
faithfully performed the conditions of his conditional sentence
and now finds himself, months later, having to face the prospect
of incarceration.

[4]  Leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is allowed and the
sentence is varied to one of twelve months in the reformatory.
