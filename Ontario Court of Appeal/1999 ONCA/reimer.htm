    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of G.I. Thomson J., based upon
answers of the jury dated September 23, 1994.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a personal injury action in which liability was
admitted.  The plaintiffs appeal from the decision of a jury
presided over by the Honourable Mr. Justice G.I. Thomson at
Simcoe to award no damages.

[2]  The facts briefly are that the appellant Carole Reimer, then
44 years of age, drove her motor vehicle on a green light into
the intersection of Highway 3 and Highway 19 near Tillsonburg.
The respondent, under the influence of alcohol, ran a red light
and crashed his vehicle into the side of the appellant&#146;s vehicle.
The appellant suffered soft tissue injuries and bruising.  Her
treating physician also diagnosed a post-traumatic stress
disorder that included symptoms of severe anxiety/panic attacks
that limited the appellant&#146;s ability to earn an income.

[3]  Liability was conceded, and the defence was directed to
challenging the damages alleged.  In short, the respondent took
the position that the appellant Carole Reimer had a long and
complicated pre-accident health history that largely explained
her present symptomology and that any problems she had with
employment pre-existed her accident. The appellant at first
denied any pre-existing physical or medical problems and her
medical records were put to her at trial to impeach her
credibility.  One of the issues before this court relates to the
manner in which this was done.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1.  Was the verdict of the jury perverse?</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2.  Did the trial judge err in his ruling with respect
to the manner in which the medical records were treated at trial?</pre>
    <pre>Analysis
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The first issue can be dealt with quickly.  There were no
errors alleged on the part of the trial judge with respect to the
manner in which the jury was instructed.  Accordingly, to
establish that a verdict is perverse, the appellants must show
that it is a dishonest verdict.  In other words, the appellants
must show that the jury did not appreciate their duty or acted
wilfully in violation of it: see St. John Gas Light Co. v.
Hatfield (1894), 23 S.C.R. 164 at 169, quoted with approval in
Graham v. Hodgkinson (1983), 40 O.R. (2d) 697 at 700 (Ont. C.A.).

[5]  The issue before the jury in appeal was strictly one of
credibility and  the appellant obviously lost this contest.  The
jury was given a list of six questions to answer, each requesting
that they quantify her several claims to damages and those of her
husband.  It answered all questions with &#147;None&#148;. These answers
were available to the jury on the evidence.  The jury may well
have concluded that either the appellant Carole Reimer was
exaggerating her injuries and the post traumatic stress disorder
of which she complained or that both were substantially a
continuation of her pre-accident condition.  I would not give
effect to this ground of appeal.

[6]  The second issue is more complex and requires some
examination of the proceedings below.  The defendant served a
Notice of Intention pursuant to s.52(2) of the Evidence Act,
R.S.O. 1990, chap. E.23, on November 23, 1993, and Supplementary
Notices of Intention on November 26, 1993 and February 9, 1994.
The three Notices listed all medical records of the plaintiff pre-
and post-accident and stated that defence counsel intended to
introduce these reports as evidence at trial.  These reports  had
been produced by the appellants during the examinations for
discovery.

[7]  At trial, and specifically just before his cross-examination
of the appellant Carole Reimer, defence counsel told the court
that he wanted the pre-accident reports in the file of Dr.
Haswell entered into evidence as an exhibit.  Dr. Haswell was the
plaintiff Carole Reimer&#146;s family doctor and she had prepared a
report on the appellant&#146;s present condition for the plaintiffs in
which she had expressed the opinion that the appellant suffered
from post traumatic stress disorder. She was to be called as a
witness for the plaintiffs. Defence counsel&#146;s theory for
introducing the reports was that since Dr. Haswell had these pre-
accident reports before her when making her report, the reports
must have contributed somewhat to her report, and therefore the
reports should be entered as evidence as part of the plaintiff&#146;s
case.

[8]  Plaintiff&#146;s counsel responded that his duty was to produce
the reports, which he had done, that he had no duty to file the
reports as evidence, and that defence counsel was free to enter
the reports as evidence as part of the defence case, but that the
plaintiff should then have a right to cross-examine the author(s)
of the reports.

[9]  The trial judge initially expressed skepticism at the
position of plaintiff&#146;s counsel, but deferred making a ruling
until he had consulted the Evidence Act. During a discussion out
of the presence of the jury in the middle of the cross-
examination of Dr. Haswell, the trial judge ruled that everything
in the reports that the doctor &#147;utilized&#148; when she made her own
reportin forming her opinion and producing her report were to be
filed as evidence as part of the plaintiff&#146;s case because Dr.
Haswell was the plaintiffs&#146; witness and it was the plaintiffs who
were relying on her opinion.  The trial judge also ruled that the
plaintiff&#146;s counsel had no right to cross-examine the author of
the report.  The trial judge made the same ruling as to the pre-
accident reports used by Dr. MacDonald, another of the
plaintiff&#146;s medical witnesses.

[10] The defence did not call any evidence.  In his closing
address to the jury, defence counsel used the pre-accident
reports in two ways:  to challenge the plaintiff&#146;s credibility on
the issue of her statements as to her medical history; and to
suggest that the plaintiff had pre-existing conditions which were
actually responsible for any pain from which she was suffering.

[11] Section 52(2) of the Evidence Act provides as follows:</pre>
    <table border="0" width="74%">
      <tr>
        <td width="11%"><font size="3"></font></td>
        <td width="89%"><font size="3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A report

        court and after at least ten days notice has been given to all<br>
        other parties, admissible in evidence in the action.</font></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <pre>[12] As stated in Kapulica v. Dumancic, [1968] 2 O.R. 438 (Ont.
C.A.), when one party tenders a medical report under the
provisions of the Evidence Act, that party tenders the author of
the report as his witness as fully as if the author had
testified, and therefore the author is subject to cross-
examination by opposing counsel.  Kapulica is different from the
present case in that it involved a report filed by the
plaintiff&#146;s counsel as part of the plaintiff&#146;s case and it was
defence counsel that sought to cross-examine.  In the present
case, the report was filed as part of the plaintiff&#146;s case
(according to the trial judge), but it was actually filed at the
request of defence counsel and it was defence counsel who served
the notice of intention to use the evidence under s.52 of the
Act.  The court in Kapulica stated that &#147;the doctor signing the
report became a witness of the party on whose behalf the reports
was tendered&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The question in this case, then, is whether the trial judge
was correct in ruling that the reports in question were tendered
on behalf of the plaintiffs.  Based on the fact that defence
counsel filed a Notice of Intention to introduce the reports as
evidence (thereby making the authors of the reports witnesses of
the defence) and on the use of these reports by defence counsel,
the ruling cannot be sustained.  The reports were tendered on
behalf of the defence and in the ordinary course the authors of
the reports should have been available for cross-examination by
counsel for the plaintiffs.

[14] In Foster v. Hoerle (1973), 34 D.L.R. (3d) 648 (H.C.J.), the
defendant had arranged for a medical examination of the plaintiff
and had served notice of his intention to introduce the reports
flowing from that examination under s.52 of the Act.  At trial,
however, it was the plaintiff who sought to file the reports
pursuant to s.52.  The defendant objected on the grounds that he
had had no notice and that no arrangements had been made for the
doctor to attend to be cross-examined.  Zuber J. held that, while
this point had been &#147;rather weakly put&#148;, he would certainly have
allowed &#147;sufficient time for the defendant to arrange for the
attendance of the doctor to be cross-examined&#148;.  Therefore,
despite the fact that the defendant had had the report prepared
and had originally intended to file it, he could still cross-
examine the doctor because the report had ultimately been filed
and used by the plaintiff.

[15] In my view, the position advanced by counsel for the defence
at trial illustrates a fundamental misconception of the use of s.
52 of the Evidence Act as it relates to medical witnesses.  Dr.
Haswell was called as an expert witness on behalf of the
plaintiffs.  During the course of her examination in chief she
gave her opinion of the nature and extent of the plaintiff&#146;s
physical injuries based on her examination of the plaintiff on a
number of occasions and the complaints that she received from her
patient.  She referred the plaintiff to two specialists and
received reports from them.  Based on these reports and her
personal observations she expressed the opinion that the
plaintiff suffered from post traumatic stress disorder.  In
testifying in the manner that she did (and I stress that it was
perfectly proper for her to have done so) she exposed her opinion
and the sources she relied upon to cross-examination.
Additionally, since she had acted in the same capacity for her
patient before the accident, counsel for the defence was entitled
to question her on the plaintiff&#146;s pre-accident medical history
and elicit the opinion of Dr. Haswell as to the nature of her pre-
accident condition including if she had previously been diagnosed
as having post traumatic stress disorder.  Following up on this
proper line of questions, the defence was entitled to put to her
the reports from consultants in Dr. Haswell&#146;s file which informed
the opinion she had as to the plaintiff&#146;s pre-accident condition.
These reports pre-accident had precisely the same status as the
post accident reports and it was open to the trial judge, in the
exercise of his discretion, to have them marked as exhibits.  All
of this is without reference to s. 52 of the Evidence Act.

[16] My point is that where doctors rely upon reports or
laboratory tests in support of their medical opinions, those
reports and tests results may be produced and marked as exhibits
in order to make the testimony of the doctors more intelligible
and to assist the jury in assessing the weight to be ascribed to
the doctors&#146; evidence.  This may require some editing, but in the
last analysis it will be up to the trial judge to determine just
how helpful the additional material would be. What is important
is that whatever is produced in this way is not admissible for
its truth per se, but is admissible as having being accepted as
true by the doctors.  Accordingly, where as in this case, the pre-
accident reports of consultants that were produced from Dr.
Haswell&#146;s files are identified by Dr. Haswell, they can be marked
as exhibits without an undertaking by either party that they will
call the authors of the reports.  In this particular case, the
reports not only assist the jury in determining what weight to
accord the opinion of Dr. Haswell, the fact of their existence
can be used to impeach the credibility of the appellant who had
testified that the symptoms of which she now complains did not
exist prior to the accident.

[17] The mistake counsel for the defence made in this case was in
serving a notice under s.52 of the Evidence Act.  Since he had
obtained the reports from the plaintiffs through the discovery
process, he did not have to give notice that he might make use of
them in cross-examination or otherwise.  The plaintiffs knew he
had them. The only reason for serving the notice under s.52,
assuming counsel put his mind to it, was to have them introduced
as evidence for the proof of their contents.  Once he did that,
based on the authorities referred to above, it is my opinion that
the reports were tendered by the defence, that the authors became
de facto defence witnesses, and that therefore the trial judge
erred in not allowing plaintiff&#146;s counsel to cross-examine the
authors of the reports.

[18] However, despite my opinion that the trial judge&#146;s ruling
was in error, I do not think that there was any substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice occasioned by the ruling. Accordingly,
the relief requested by the appellants, namely a new trial, is
not available to them: see Courts of Justice Act R.S.O. 1990,
Chap. C.43, s.134(6). The reports were used by defence counsel
substantially in the manner that they could have been used
without resort to s.52.  There was no issue as to the truth of
the contents of the pre-accident reports. Their only significance
was the fact of their existence.  As such they were capable of
testing the credibility of the plaintiff Carole Reimer&#146;s claim
that the condition of which she complained resulted from the
accident for which the respondent was liable. Indeed, counsel for
the appellants stated that he did not challenge the accuracy of
these pre-accident reports, he wanted to cross-examine the
authors of the reports on their present opinions based on
hypothetical questions he would pose to them respecting the
plaintiff Carole Reimer&#146;s post-accident condition. If plaintiffs&#146;
counsel wanted to examine the authors of these reports on matters
not contained in their reports, he would have to call them as his
own witnesses.

[19] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
