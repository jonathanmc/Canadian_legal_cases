</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Her Honour Judge Morneau on
June 7, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant was convicted of carrying  a  weapon  for  a
purpose  dangerous  to the public peace.   He  was  acquitted  on
charges  of  causing  a disturbance and assault  with  a  weapon,
arising out of the same incident.  The trial judge must therefore
have  found  that  Mr.  Vanstone was the aggressor  and  on  this
record,  the  only reasonable interpretation of her  findings  is
that  the appellant, who was on his own property, acted in  self-
defence in response to a sudden attack by Mr. Vanstone.
[2]  In light of these findings and in the circumstances of this
case, the charge of carrying a weapon for a purpose dangerous to
the public peace was not made out.  The trial judge erred in
appearing to place an onus on the appellant to prove that he had
a lawful excuse for carrying the knife.  To the contrary, the
onus was on the Crown to prove that the knife was a weapon and to
prove the dangerous purpose.  In our view, particularly in light
of the acquittal on the assault charge, that purpose was not made
out.  The appellant has now served the sentence imposed for this
offence.
[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction set
aside, and an acquittal entered.
