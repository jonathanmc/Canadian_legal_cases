    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Tobias J. dated February 13, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by the plaintiffs from the judgment of
Tobias J. dismissing their claims for damages against the
Corporation of the Township of Strong (the &#147;Township&#148;).  The
primary plaintiff is Beverly Restoule, who was injured when she
slipped and fell on ice which was on a road maintained by the
Township.  Her claim is based on the alleged failure of the
Township to perform its statutory duty to keep the road in repair
as it was required to do at the relevant time by s.284(1) of the
Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.45, which was subsequently
repealed and replaced by S.O. 1996, c.32, s.54(1).  The claims of
the other plaintiffs are asserted pursuant to the Family Law Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3.
[2]  As I am of the opinion that there should be a new trial, it
is appropriate that the facts be reviewed only to the extent that
it is necessary to explain why a new trial must be ordered.
[3]  On March 10, 1991, Ms. Restoule was visiting family members
who lived in a small housing community.  Evergreen Lane, which
was owned and maintained by the Township, was one of two roads in
the community. There were no sidewalks, with the result that
pedestrians were required to walk on the roads to go from one
house to another.  There was ice and snow on both of the roads.
While walking on Evergreen Lane from the house of her son, Bernie
Haggart, to the house of her former husband, Archie Haggart, Ms.
Restoule slipped and fell on some ice and sustained serious
injuries.  It was dark at the time of the accident, the nearest
illumination being some distance away.
[4]  Ms. Restoule claimed that Evergreen Lane either had not been
sanded, or that whatever sand had been applied to the road had
melted into the ice and snow and had become covered with more
ice, rendering the sand ineffective.  She claimed that she was
required to walk on the road surface as there were no sidewalks.
The critical issue at trial was whether the Township had failed
to comply with its statutory duty to keep Evergreen Lane in
repair.
[5]  The evidence indicated that due to a lack of resources the
Township seldom sanded all of the roads in the township, with
full sanding occurring only when rain was expected and
temperatures might cause it to freeze.  To save on paying
overtime to its employees, the Township did not sand or inspect
its roads on weekends, except in emergencies.  This accident took
place on a Sunday evening.  There was evidence suggesting that
Bernard Crescent, the only other public road in the community,
had been sanded on Friday, March 8, 1991.  However, those who
lived in the community testified that it was very rare for
Bernard Crescent and Evergreen Lane to receive any sanding or
salting.
[6]  The weather records disclosed that there had been rain
turning to snow in the middle of the week before the accident,
followed by more than a week of clear and sunny weather, which
would tend to melt the ice and snow during the day.  However, the
ice and snow would freeze again at night when the temperature
fell below freezing.  These conditions would cause any sand that
had been spread on the roads to sink into the existing ice and
snow on them, and to be rendered ineffective when they froze over
at night.  However, all sanding and inspections over the weekend
of March 9 &#150; 10, 1991 had been discontinued.
[7]  On Monday, March 11, 1991 a resident of Bernard Crescent
reported that she had twice slipped and fallen on ice on Bernard
Crescent.  This resulted in the Township sanding Bernard Crescent
and Evergreen Lane on March 11, 12 and 13, 1991.
[8]  It is helpful to reproduce s.284(1) of the Municipal Act as
it read at the time of the accident:
          </pre>
    <pre>               284.(1)  Every highway and every bridge shall be kept in
          repair by the corporation the council of which has jurisdiction
          over it or upon which the duty of repairing it is imposed by this
          Act and, in case of default, the corporation, subject to the
          Negligence Act, is liable for all damages sustained by any person
          by reason of such default.</pre>
    <pre>This provision not only imposes a duty on municipal corporations
to keep its highways in repair, it also imposes civil liability
on a municipal corporation whose default in its duty results in
damages to an individual.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In dismissing the plaintiffs&#146; claims, Tobias J. based his
analysis on a line of cases decided by the Supreme Court of
Canada in which a legislature had conferred a statutory power,
rather than a statutory duty, on a government body or agency:
Brown v. British Columbia (Minister of Transportation and
Highways), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 420; Just v. British Columbia, [1989]
2 S.C.R. 1228; Swinamer v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General), [1994]
1 S.C.R. 445.  This resulted in his application of a
policy/operational analysis, as discussed in those cases, to the
manner in which the Township kept its roads in repair during the
winter and early spring of 1991. He also applied the standard of
non-repair adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Coté
(1974), 51 D.L.R. (3d) 244.  Applying a policy/operational
analysis, the trial judge concluded that the Township &#147;satisfied
its obligation to act reasonably to ensure that the roads in
question were in good repair&#148;.  In particular, he found that,
given the Township&#146;s limited resources, its policies of
inspection, repair and maintenance were reasonable.
[10] In a perfunctory manner, the trial judge assessed Ms.
Restoule&#146;s non-pecuniary damages at $25,000 and her pecuniary
damages at $10,332.  He assessed the damages of the Family Law
Act plaintiffs as &#147;nil&#148;.
[11] It is unclear from the trial judge&#146;s reasons whether he
considered contributory negligence on the part of Ms. Restoule.
Given his conclusion in respect to the Township&#146;s liability,
perhaps it was not necessary to do so.  However, toward the end
of his reasons he made a finding that the accident was caused by
&#147;her own inattention and negligence&#148;.  I mention this because on
the record before us, should it be found that the Township failed
in its statutory duty to keep Evergreen Lane in good repair,
there is evidence capable of supporting a finding of contributory
negligence on the part of Ms. Restoule.
[12] In my view, there are three reasons why the result of the
trial is unsatisfactory:
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    the failure     of the trial judge to apply correct legal
       principles in determining whether the Township failed in its
       statutory duty to keep Evergreen Lane in good repair.
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    a number of findings of fact made by the trial judge were
       not supported by the evidence, or appear to be problematic.
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    the trial judge&#146;s perfunctory assessment of Ms. Restoule&#146;s
       damages and his failure to award any damages to the Family Law
       Act plaintiffs.</pre>
    <pre>[13] In respect to the first reason, this court has held in
Kennedy v. Waterloo County Board of Education, [1999] O.J. No.
2273 at para. [26], that &#147;the policy/operational dichotomy and
the exempting effect of a policy decision, are not applicable
where a duty of care is imposed by statute rather than arising at
common law&#148;.
[14] In Kennedy, it was the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act, R.S.O.
1990, c.O. 2, s.3(1) that imposed a statutory duty and civil
liability for breach of that duty.  In this appeal, it is
s.284(1) of the Municipal Act that does so.  It places a duty on
a municipality to keep its highways &#147;in repair&#148; and provides that
a municipality which is in default of its duty is civilly liable
&#147;for all damages sustained by any person by reason of such
default&#148;.  Thus, as this court held in Kennedy, the only issue is
whether the respondent breached the duty which it owed the
appellant under s.284(1).  It follows that it was unnecessary for
Tobias J. to enter upon the policy/operational analysis in
respect to the liability of the township as it was under a
statutory duty to keep the highway in good repair.  Accordingly,
Tobias J. erred in exempting the township from liability on the
basis of this analysis.
[15] Although it may be appropriate for the court to consider the
financial resources of the township in determining whether it
failed to keep the highway in repair as it was required to by
s.284(1) of the Municipal Act, as Kennedy holds, the township
could not make a policy decision which would allow it to avoid
compliance with its statutory obligation.  Therefore, if the
failure of the township to maintain a reasonable inspection
system of the relevant area, together with its decision to work a
five day week, constituted a breach of its statutory duty, it
would be no defence for the township to say that it made a policy
decision to exempt itself from that duty.  See, also, Regina v.
East Sussex County Council, Ex parte Tandy, [1998] A.C. 714
(H.L.).
[16] This is particularly true in the circumstances of this
appeal where there were no sidewalks in the housing development.
If a municipality does not provide sidewalks, and, therefore,
knows pedestrians will necessarily have to use the roads to walk
from place to place, it has a significant duty to ensure that
they can do so in safety using reasonable care:  Gartlan v.
Toronto, [1942] 3 D.L.R. 523 (Ont. C.A.); Griffin v. Arnprior,
[1953] 2 D.L.R. 321 (Ont. H.C.), aff&#146;d [1954] 1 D.L.R. 176 (Ont.
C.A.); Bleau v. Nepean (City), (1983), 21 M.P.L.R. 217 (Ont.
H.C.), aff&#146;d [1984] O.J. No. 139 (C.A.).  In this regard, Tobias
J. did not consider the state of repair required in situations
where pedestrians are required to use the road because of the
absence of sidewalks.  Indeed, it is difficult to ascertain what
standard of non-repair the trial judge ultimately applied in this
case.
[17] Although these errors are sufficient to allow the appeal and
order that there be a new trial, there are other aspects of the
trial judge&#146;s reasons which are of concern.  Although the
authorities seem clear that financial constraints represent a
factor to be considered by the court in determining liability for
non-repair of a highway, they represent only one of many factors
to be considered.  In my view, the trial judge placed undue
emphasis on financial and resource limits, to the exclusion of
other relevant factors.  No doubt the trial judge&#146;s overemphasis
of these factors was the result of his erroneous reliance on the
policy/operational distinction applied in Brown v. British
Columbia, which was one of several similar cases this court
analyzed in Kennedy.</pre>
    <pre>[18] As for the second reason, there are a number of factual
findings which, based on the record, are problematic.  These
include the trial judge&#146;s findings that sand had been applied to
the intersection of Evergreen Lane and Bernard Crescent, that
sand was lying on the surface of the road, that 25% of the
intersection was ice covered and that a pedestrian could walk
from Bernard Crescent to Evergreen Lane without walking on ice.
These conclusions were based on the trial judge&#146;s assessment of
what is portrayed by several photographs.  However, there was
considerable evidence, including evidence introduced by the
Township, which supports the appellant&#146;s position that the brown
patches visible in the photographs indicate sand which had melted
into, and become frozen in, the ice on the road surface.
[19] In addition, I find troubling the trial judge&#146;s findings
that the Township &#147;adhered to a reasonable schedule of
inspections&#148; and &#147;attempted continually to inspect its road
system&#148;.  There does not appear to be any evidence in the
testimony of the Township&#146;s employees, William Kent and Clark
Preston, to support these findings.
[20] As for the third reason, the trial judge&#146;s assessment of Ms.
Restoule&#146;s damages is also problematic.  She sustained serious
injuries.  As I have indicated, his assessment was perfunctory.
As a result, we do not have the benefit of a proper analysis and,
consequently, it is impossible to say whether the assessment was
adequate.  In addition, the trial judge gave no reasons why he
felt the Family Law Act plaintiffs were not entitled to any
damages.
[21] Because the result of the trial was based on a combination
of the application of incorrect legal principles and problematic
findings of fact, I do not feel that this is an appeal in which
this court is capable of giving the decision that ought to or
could have been made by Tobias J.  As well, this is not a case in
which it would be appropriate for this court to make an
assessment of damages or a determination of contributory
negligence.  Nor, of course, would it be appropriate to express
any opinion with respect to the outcome of the new trial.
[22] There is a further issue raised by counsel for the
appellants which requires our attention.  After counsel for the
Township completed his closing argument, the trial judge called a
brief recess.  When the court resumed, Tobias J. rendered his
decision without permitting the appellants&#146; counsel an
opportunity to make submissions in reply.  When counsel objected,
the trial judge said it was then too late to do so, explaining
that if counsel had intended to reply he should have said so
before the recess.
[23] Unlike jury trials, the Rules of Civil Procedure are silent
in respect to the order of presentation in non-jury trials.  It
appears, therefore, that it is in the discretion of the trial
judge to permit, or preclude, a plaintiff from making submissions
in reply to those made by a defendant.  In my experience, a
plaintiff is invariably permitted to reply to new matters raised
by a defendant in closing argument.  In my view, the right to
reply was important in this case as the policy/operational
dichotomy was raised for the first time in the defendant&#146;s
closing argument.  The plaintiffs were denied an opportunity to
make submissions that the dichotomy had no application to the
circumstances of this case.  It follows that the trial judge
should have exercised his discretion to permit the plaintiff the
opportunity to reply to the defendant&#146;s closing argument
respecting this issue.
[24] As the trial was unsatisfactory, the plaintiffs are entitled
to a new trial with respect to liability and damages.
Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of Tobias J. is
set aside and an order will issue directing that there be a new
trial before a different judge.  The plaintiffs are entitled to
their costs of the appeal.  The costs of the trial before Tobias
J. will be in the discretion of the trial judge.</pre>
