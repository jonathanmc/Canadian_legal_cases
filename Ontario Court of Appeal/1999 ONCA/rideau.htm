    <pre>On Appeal from judgment of G. Morin J. dated July 2, 1997</pre>
    <p>BY THE COURT: </p>
    <p>[1] The defendant appeals from the judgment of Morin J. granting the plaintiff
    compensation for the damage caused to its electrical generating station by two major
    flooding incidents, one in 1992 and the other in 1996. The flooding of the generating
    station was caused by the actions of the defendant in controlling the Rideau River and its
    ice build-up at the end of each winter in order to protect the upstream residents on the
    river from flooding. The trial judge found liability on two bases, interference with the
    riparian rights of the plaintiff, and nuisance. He dismissed the action on the basis of
    negligence. </p>
    <p>[2] The defendant appeals the finding of liability and the plaintiff cross-appeals the
    dismissal of the action framed in negligence and the quantum of damages. </p>
    <p>FACTS </p>
    <p>[3] The plaintiff is the owner and operator of an electrical power generating station
    located at the Rideau Falls. The plaintiff leases from the Government of Canada the land
    upon which the plant is situated and from which it extends out over the water. The Rideau
    River flows through the City of Ottawa and into the Ottawa River at the Falls. In the
    spring it is prone to flooding upstream from the Falls. Each spring since 1887, the
    defendant has implemented an ice management program to remove significant amounts of ice
    from the river prior to the spring freshet by cutting and dynamiting the ice, then
    flushing it over the Falls. The trial judge described the overall purpose of the ice
    removal program: &#147;to avoid the natural sequence of breakup and ice jamming at problem
    points in the river such as at the rapids and at bridge abutments&#148;. This is to
    prevent the flooding of nine hundred residents&#146; properties lying in the flood plain
    upstream from the Falls. </p>
    <p>[4] However, the consequence in 1992 and in 1996 was that the ice built up at the foot
    of the Falls and formed a very large ice dam as high as the Falls itself and extending to
    the front of the generating plant. The water in the Ottawa River then rose behind the ice
    wall flooding the plant and causing significant damage to the plant and to its equipment. </p>
    <p>[5] The trial judge made the following findings in connection with these events: 1. The
    annual spring ice flushing program of the defendant is a &#147;necessary and critical
    program to avoid extremely serious damage to utility lines, bridge structures, homes and
    buildings across and along the banks of the Rideau River up river from the Rideau
    Falls&#148;. 2. The ice flushing program conducted by the defendant caused the flooding of
    the plaintiff&#146;s plant in 1992 and in 1996 by creating an unnatural accumulation of
    ice at the bottom of the Rideau Falls. </p>
    <p>3. It is likely that but for the defendant&#146;s ice flushing program, there would not
    have been such an accumulation of ice at the bottom of the Falls in either of those years
    and there would not have been any flooding of the plaintiff&#146;s plant. </p>
    <p>Riparian Rights </p>
    <p>4. The plaintiff has riparian rights in respect of the land it leases from the
    government. 5. Those rights include the right to the natural flow of water from upstream.
    6. That right was breached by the actions of the defendant in the ice flushing program,
    which although reasonable for the upstream residents was unreasonable for the plaintiff. </p>
    <p>Nuisance </p>
    <p>7. The flooding of the plaintiff&#146;s plant in 1992 and 1996 constituted a nuisance.
    The defendant deliberately set about a course of conduct which altered the state of nature
    and resulted in the flooding, which was exceptional. 8. There was a substantial and
    unreasonable interference with the plaintiff&#146;s enjoyment of its property. 9. In the
    overall scheme of things the defendant did not act unreasonably initiating and maintaining
    the ice flushing program for the greater good of the upstream owners and occupiers of
    land. 10. The defence of statutory authority did not succeed. The defendant fell &#147;far
    short of establishing that it was practically impossible to avoid the nuisance.&#148; </p>
    <p>Negligence </p>
    <p>11. Although some suggested procedures could have been implemented by the defendant,
    such as to break up the ice at the bottom of the falls, to protect the plaintiff&#146;s
    plant with a concrete structure, to dredge the foot of the falls or to create a path
    downstream for the ice to flow away, the plaintiff did not establish on a balance of
    probabilities that had the defendant done any of these things, the flooding would not have
    occurred. 12. The plaintiff did not therefore satisfy its onus to prove negligence. </p>
    <p>ANALYSIS </p>
    <p>[6] The trial judge correctly cited the test for nuisance as set out by La Forest J. in
    the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Tock v. St. John&#146;s Metropolitan Area Board,
    [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1181 at 1191. In particular, the question to be determined is
    &#147;whether in the circumstances it is reasonable to deny compensation to the aggrieved
    party&#148;, on the basis that &#147;In effect, the law would only intervene to shield
    persons from interferences to their enjoyment of property that were unreasonable in the
    light of all the circumstances&#148;. The trial judge also set out the factors identified
    in that case to be weighed in defining the ambit of the tort in any situation including
    the severity of harm, the character of the neighbourhood, the utility of the
    defendant&#146;s conduct and whether the plaintiff displayed abnormal sensitivity, and
    noted that La Forest J. had emphasized material physical damage as a significant factor. </p>
    <p>[7] In applying this law to the facts, Morin J. concluded that the defendant&#146;s
    deliberate conduct caused significant physical damage to the plaintiff&#146;s property and
    a substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiff&#146;s enjoyment of its
    property. Furthermore, even though the defendant did not act unreasonably for the good of
    the upstream owners &#147;a reasonable view of the circumstances of this case must dictate
    that the plaintiff be compensated for the damages suffered in consequence of the
    defendant&#146;s program which was designed to protect others. The plaintiff should not be
    put in the position of having its rights sacrificed for the benefit of other upstream
    interests in Ottawa&#133;&#148; </p>
    <p>[8] We find no error in the trial judge&#146;s findings. We also find no error in his
    rejection of the defence of statutory authority. The appellant relied on the recent
    decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ryan v. Victoria (City) [1999] S.C.J. No. 7,
    where the court clarified that although in Tock some of the judges had stated different
    formulations of the scope of the defence, the rule was properly stated by Sopinka J., that
    &#147;the defendant must negative that there are alternate methods of carrying out the
    work&#148;. It is therefore insufficient for the defendant to negative negligence. </p>
    <p>[9] The appellant suggested that Morin J. was more influenced by the other formulations
    of the rule by Wilson J. and La Forest J. in Tock. We disagree. Morin J. dealt with each
    version of the test and specifically made the finding that the defendant had not met the
    test as set out by Sopinka J. in that the defendant had &#147;fallen far short of
    establishing that it was practically impossible to avoid the nuisance&#148;.</p>
    <p>[10] The defendant also suggested that this finding was in effect inconsistent with the
    trial judge&#146;s subsequent conclusion that the defendant was not negligent. This very
    concern was addressed by the Supreme Court in Ryan. Here, the trial judge correctly
    considered and applied the respective onuses of proof in coming to his determinations. For
    the defence of statutory authority, the onus was on the defendant to prove the nuisance
    was unavoidable, whereas for the claim in negligence, the plaintiff had to establish that
    the defendant breached its duty of care and that the breach caused the damage. Although
    the distinction may appear to be subtle in its result, we would not interfere with the
    evidentiary findings of the trial judge. </p>
    <p>[11] The appeal is therefore dismissed on the issue of nuisance and the cross-appeal is
    dismissed on the issue of negligence. As a result of upholding the plaintiff&#146;s claim
    as framed in nuisance, it is neither necessary nor desirable to deal with the claim as an
    interference with the respondent&#146;s riparian rights. The existence and extent of the
    riparian rights that the respondent obtained under its lease or otherwise involves an
    examination of the terms of the respondent&#146;s lease with the federal government and
    the government is not a party to these proceedings. <br>
    <br>
    [12] The cross-appeal on the issue of quantum of damages is also dismissed. The trial
    judge was entitled to assess the evidence of the plaintiff&#146;s expert and to partially
    reject that evidence even though the defendant did not call an expert on the issue. </p>
    <p>RESULT </p>
    <p>[13] The appeal and the cross-appeal are each dismissed with costs. </p>
