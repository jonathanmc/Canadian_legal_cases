    <pre>HEARD:         September 28, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice
Chilcott dated January 29, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We see no basis for interfering with Chilcott J.&#146;s
conclusion that this was an extension not a renewal.
[2]  It was reasonable for Chilcott J. to conclude that the July
21, 1997 letter represented an extension prior to the expiration
of the mortgage, but not to take effect until after the mortgage
expired. There was no evidence of a new contract entered into
after the mortgage expired.
[3]  In our view, the use of the word &#147;renewal&#148; in the July 21,
1997 letter is not determinative of the legal question whether a
new contract had been entered into.  To succeed, the guarantor
must show that such a new contract was in fact entered into.
Chilcott J. correctly found that it was not.
[4]  The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs.
