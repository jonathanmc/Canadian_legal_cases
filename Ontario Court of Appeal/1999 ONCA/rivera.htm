    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Madame Justice Corbett, sitting
with a jury, on March 16, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]       The appellant appeals against his conviction for sexual
assault on the ground that the Crown failed to prove the identity
of the assailant and that, consequently, the trial judge erred in
failing to direct a verdict of acquittal.
[2]  It is our view that the identification evidence provided by
the complainant, when considered in the context of the entire
proceedings, was sufficient to support the jury&#146;s verdict.
[3]  It is important to note that the appellant was well known to
the 15 year old complainant. He was a friend of the family with
whom she and her family had lived for some time and who had
continued to regularly visit after he had moved out. During the
course of her testimony, the complainant repeatedly referred to
her assailant by name, Luis, or Mr. Vasquez-Rivera. Both Crown
and defence counsel also repeatedly referred to the perpetrator
by name.
[4]  No issue was raised with respect to the identification of
the perpetrator at any time during the course of the
complainant&#146;s testimony. It is apparent from the cross-
examination of the complainant that the theory of the defence was
that the victim disliked and resented Mr. Vasquez-Rivera and that
she had fabricated the allegations of sexual abuse. No suggestion
was ever made during the course of the complainant&#146;s testimony
that the person in court may not have been the &#147;Mr. Vasquez-
Rivera&#148; being referred to in the evidence.
[5]  At the conclusion of the complainant&#146;s testimony, and before
the Crown closed its case, the following exchange took place
between counsel and the court:
          </pre>
    <pre>               MR. ENGEL:     To the best of my note-taking capabilities I
          don't believe at any time that Miss P. identified the accused
          as being the person who committed the sexual assault and that is
          as far as my notes are concerned and as far as my independent
          recollection is concerned.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:     The fact that she &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               MR. JENNINGS:  My recollection, on more
          than one occasion I referred her to the
          gentleman before the court and the gentleman
          as the man in the box, she referred to him as
          Luis Vasquez to confirm that he is the
          accused before the court, I referred to him
          several times as the gentleman before the
          court, the gentleman in the box.
          </pre>
    <pre>               MR. ENGEL:     The reason I am doing it
          &#150; and I know my friend has the habit, usually
          does that at the beginning, 'is this the
          gentleman in the box'?  Thereafter I was
          careful to make notes whenever referred to
          the gentleman in the box or accused gentleman
          and I don't believe that was ever done.
          </pre>
    <pre>            THE COURT:     It was not done in the usual way but there was 
	    a reference to him.
          </pre>
    <pre>            MR. ENGEL:     If Your Honour has that recollection, I don't.
          </pre>
    <pre>            THE COURT:     Ready for the jury?
          </pre>
    <pre>            Jury enters courtroom &#150; 11:47 a.m.
          </pre>
    <pre>            MR. JENNINGS:  That's the case for the Crown, Your Honour.
          </pre>
    <pre>            MR. ENGEL:     If I may call Detective Ward, please.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  As this excerpt reveals, defence counsel did not move for a
directed verdict. It would appear that he abandoned his argument
since he simply proceeded to call his witnesses and the question
of identification was never raised again during the trial. The
trial judge charged the jury in accordance with the theory of the
defence that had been advanced and no objection was made to the
charge. It would have been clear to the members of the jury from
the instructions that they had to be convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant had committed the offence
before they could return a guilty verdict.
[7]  In these circumstances, we see no reason to doubt the
correctness of the trial judge&#146;s finding that, although not done
in the usual way, there had been some evidence of identification
by the complainant. Although counsel for the appellant is correct
in stating that the transcript does not reveal any express
reference in words to the &#147;gentleman in the court&#148;, the
transcript is entirely consistent with the trial judge&#146;s finding
that some identification had been made in a manner other than the
usual way, by gesture or otherwise pointing out of the accused.
Had defence counsel at trial pursued his argument, the Crown
could easily have called further evidence on this issue or moved
to recall the complainant since the case was not yet closed.
[8]  In these circumstances, the jury was entitled to conclude
that identification had been proven on the basis of the
uncontradicted evidence of the complainant, the manner in which
it was given and the context of the entire proceedings.
[9]  The appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
