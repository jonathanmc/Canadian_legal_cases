    <pre><b><font face="Courier New" size="3">AUSTIN J.A. (IN CHAMBERS):</font></b></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  These reasons are given after hearings on the above dates
with respect to what began as a motion for directions respecting
the production of a trial transcript for appeal purposes.

[2]  The underlying action was a claim for damages for personal
injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident.  The action was
tried by O’Brien J. and resulted in a judgment awarding several
million dollars to the plaintiff, Penny Roberts.  The trial,
including proceedings regarding structuring, costs and interest,
took about 50 days.  The defendants appealed.  According to the
material of the plaintiff, the trial transcript was ordered on
August 22, 1997.  According to the material of Her Majesty The
Queen in Right of the Province of Ontario, the transcript was
ordered on September 10, 1997.

[3]  On October 5, 1998, Abella J.A. heard a motion for a partial
lifting of the stay of judgment imposed automatically by the
Rules and for an order expediting the appeal.  Abella J.A. lifted
the stay to permit payment to the plaintiff of a lump sum of
$400,000 for the purchase of a condominium and for related costs
and any other expenses the plaintiff might have pending the
appeal, $100,000 for legal fees and $10,000 monthly pending the
hearing of the appeal.

[4]  Some concern was expressed on behalf of the plaintiff on
that motion about delivery of the transcript. The reporter was
present in court together with her supervisor.  Although it does
not appear in the endorsement, the reporter was directed by
Abella J.A. to provide the volumes of evidence as they became
available.  The reporter was also directed to have the transcript
completed by the end of January, 1999 or to provide an
explanation as to why it had not been completed.  The order to
expedite was not made.

[5]  Counsel for the plaintiff contacted the reporter on November
10, 1998 to enquire as to progress.  He was advised amongst other
matters that nothing had yet been certified, that she had
criminal appeals which had priority and that as the transcript
had not been ordered by the plaintiff, she was not under any
obligation to provide any further information.

[6]  Subsequent calls went unanswered.  The end of January, 1999
came and went but the transcript did not, nor was any information
forthcoming from any source.  Counsel for the appellant, Her
Majesty The Queen in Right of the Province of Ontario advised
that he was in the same position.

[7]  The failure to produce the transcript or to provide any
information about it precipitated this motion on behalf of the
plaintiff for directions.  That motion was returnable on February
8.  On its return, I raised the suggestion that since the problem
lay within the area of responsibility of the Attorney General for
Ontario and the party found primarily liable at trial was the
Province of Ontario, the appropriate relief might be to lift the
stay completely.  In those circumstances, notice should be given
to all of the parties found liable at trial as well as to the
Province.  The motion was accordingly put over to February 11.

[8]  On that date, the reporter appeared as well as counsel for
all parties found liable at trial, in addition to counsel on
behalf for the Attorney General for Ontario.  In the interim,
counsel for the plaintiff launched yet another motion, returnable
on February 11, asking that the stay be lifted entirely and that
the transcribing be removed from the reporter and turned over to
a private organization on an expedited basis at the expense of
the Attorney General.

[9]  Counsel on behalf of the Attorney General asked for an
adjournment to provide an opportunity to explore alternatives.
After hearing from all counsel and the reporter, the matter was
adjourned to February 23.  Counsel for the Attorney General was
expressly directed to keep counsel for the plaintiff fully
informed of his enquiries.

[10] On February 23, counsel for the Attorney General reported
that arrangements could be made to have the reporter work on this
transcript with two other reporters, with a view to producing the
completed transcripts by the week of May 3, 1999.  Counsel
produced a schedule setting out this arrangement.  His
information was to the effect that the private reporting service
suggested by counsel for the plaintiff had been consulted and was
not able to produce the transcript any more quickly.

[11] Counsel for the plaintiff complained that despite my
direction of February 11 he had not been kept advised of the
Attorney General’s enquiries.  He had heard nothing whatever
until 5:30 p.m. on February 22.  He had consulted with the
private service on the morning of February 23 and reported that
it had either been misadvised or not advised as to what was
required.  In the result the matter was put over again to
February 25 to provide some opportunity for plaintiff’s counsel
and his reporting service to fully inform themselves as to what
in fact is required and whether there is any alternative to the
suggestion of counsel for the Attorney General.

[12] On February 25, counsel for the defendants/appellants again
argued, as they had on February 11, that a complete lifting of
the stay should not be ordered.  To do so would be to punish
parties who had no control whatever over the transcript process.
In any event, it had been conceded by plaintiff’s counsel that
Ms. Roberts was in no immediate need of further funds.

[13] Counsel for the Attorney General argued that the schedule
tendered on February 23 was the best that could be achieved and
that it should be accepted and proceeded with.

[14] Counsel for the plaintiff again expressed his frustration
but conceded that it appeared that the transcript could not now
be produced any more quickly than indicated in the schedule
tendered on February 23.  He argued strongly, however, that this
court should maintain control of the process and be prepared to
step in any moment, if so requested, to see that the schedule was
adhered to.

[15] The real question as I see it is – what are the
alternatives?  As noted earlier, the transcript was ordered
either in August or September 1997.  The projected cost was
$26,250 and half of this sum was sent to the reporter on November
20, 1997.  On April 23, 1998, seven or eight months after
ordering, the Attorney General enquired when the transcript might
be ready.  On the same day, the reporter replied that she had set
a target date of one year from that date, that is, either 19 or
20 months from the date of ordering.

[16] There is no evidence as to the Attorney General’s response,
if any, to the receipt of this information.  In my view, that
schedule, assuming it would be met, was and is a disgrace.  This
is particularly so when, according to one of the uncontradicted
affidavits filed on these proceedings, the transcript “was
recorded on a computerized short-hand reporting unit so that
there is in existence a computer disk which contains the entire,
albeit unedited, transcript of the proceedings”.

[17] This is not the first difficulty with the timely production
of transcripts.  I have been sitting in Chambers in this court on
a regular basis since mid-1992 and such problems can be predicted
to turn up virtually every week and sometimes several times a
week.  As such, they cause litigants expense and delay.
Transcript delays also bring about motions to lift stays as in
this case.  In addition, motions are frequently brought to extend
the time for perfecting appeals because the transcript is not
ready.

[18] Transcript delays also have an improper influence on bail
applications.  Crown counsel resisting bail applications deny any
influence over or responsibility for the production of
transcripts.  One is more inclined to grant bail if one of the
reasons for the delay in the hearing of an appeal is the
unavailability of a transcript.  Spending time in prison waiting
for the delivery of transcript is not consistent with the proper
or due administration of justice.  It is not only frustrating and
expensive, it is unjust.

[19] One cannot always blame the reporter; frequently, the delay
is not the reporter’s responsibility or fault.  Criminal
transcripts do have priority and by and large reporters are not
“protected” in the sense of being given time to produce
transcripts in a timely fashion.  The proposal put forward by
counsel for the Attorney General on February 23 that this
reporter be so “protected” until this transcript is finished, is
an exception and a rare one, to the usual practice.  Ordinarily,
reporters are expected to be in court daily and to produce
transcripts in their spare time, during evenings and weekends.

[20] It should be noted that in this case, this reporter has been
“protected” since March, 1998.  One has to wonder, in the light
of her reply to the enquiry of April 23, 1998, whether there was
any follow-up, and if not, why not.

[21] It appears that in the final analysis the problem comes down
to cost.  Instead of money being invested in increasing the
number of reporters and improving their equipment, the cost of
failing to do so is borne by litigants by way of  delays and the
cost of motions to try to speed up the process.  There is also a
cost to the public in the time taken by this court to deal with
these proceedings.  These costs are not insignificant, either to
individual litigants or to the public.

[22] This failure cannot be laid exclusively at the feet of the
present provincial government.  I have been involved in the
problems of transcript production since 1952.  Various panaceas
have been proposed from time to time.  My experience, however,
has been that the system, if it can be called that, has been
growing unsteadily worse throughout that period.

[23] The administration of justice is a provincial responsibility
under what used to be called the British North America Act.  In
this particular respect, the Province of Ontario is delivering
very poor service and at the direct cost of the litigants
involved and of the public.  We are all concerned about the cost
of litigation and the length of time it takes.  Totally
inadequate transcript service is a substantial contributor to
both aspects.

[24] Turning from the general to the specific, there does not
appear, on the material before me, to be any alternative but to
proceed with the proposal made on behalf of the Attorney General
on February 23.  This calls for volumes 1 and 2 to be delivered
during the week commencing February 22, 1999.  The court was
advised that those two volumes are in fact available although not
yet certified.  They are to be certified forthwith and turned
over to counsel forthwith.  Thereafter, volumes are to be
produced at the rate of either five or six per week with the last
three being delivered during the week of May 3, 1999.  As many
assistants to the reporter are to be supplied as may be necessary
to produce a completed and certified transcript by the week of
May 3, 1999 or sooner.  Counsel will be at liberty to apply to me
or to other members of this court for directions or, if so
advised, to lift the stay either partially or completely.

[25] Proceedings such as these should be unnecessary.  They are
required in this case by reason of the lack of an efficient
system for the producing of transcripts and by the failure to
monitor production.  The time and money of the plaintiff and of
counsel for the plaintiff has been wasted.  Counsel for the
plaintiff are entitled to the costs of these proceedings
(February 8, 11, 23 and 25, 1999) on a solicitor and client
basis, payable forthwith by the Attorney General for Ontario.</font></pre></td>
