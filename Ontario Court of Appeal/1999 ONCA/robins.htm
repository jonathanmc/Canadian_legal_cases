    <pre>HEARD:         May 6, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction on December 15, 1997, imposed by
Nichols J., with a jury, and from the sentence imposed by Nichols
J. on December 15, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The complainant had gone out to celebrate her birthday and
met the appellant, whom she knew, in an after hours bar run by
bikers. After having some drinks, she became sleepy and asked the
bartender if she could sleep on a couch in a back room.  She fell
asleep on the couch and awoke to find that the appellant was
rubbing or scratching her bare back. She testified that the
appellant then had sexual intercourse with her without her
consent.
[2]  The appellant did not testify but the conduct of the defence
made clear that sexual intercourse had taken place but it was on
consent.
[3]  A number of objections were taken with the trial judge&#146;s
charge to the jury. However, given that in the last analysis the
issue left with the jury was a narrow one, consent, we are not
persuaded that the objections are of any substance.
[4]  There was also an objection to the refusal of the trial
judge to investigate the contents of an envelope that was
delivered to him in the course of the trial by a police officer.
No one at trial seemed to have any clear notion of what was in
the envelope or why it was delivered to the trial judge.
However, it appears that it may have contained information of an
earlier allegation of a sexual assault by the complainant that
had been withdrawn. Given the limited information that was given
to the trial judge about the issue, it is hardly surprising that
he exercised his discretion and refrained from accepting the
envelope and permitting the appellant to engage in a fishing
expedition with respect to its contents. That said, it is
unfortunate that the trial judge did not accede to the defence&#146;s
request that he mark the envelope for identification. In that
event, we would have been able to examine it ourselves and see if
it had any significance. On the other hand, appellant&#146;s counsel
has taken no steps to ensure that we receive this envelope and as
a consequence we are in no better position than the trial judge
to speculate on its contents or significance.
[5]  A further complaint related to the conduct of the
complainant in destroying a diary she kept. This diary was said
to have contained damaging statements against interest on her
part. However, this issue was fully explored before the jury and
a witness was called who testified as to excerpts that she had
read in the diary. The trial judge further reviewed this evidence
before the jury in relating the theory of the defence. In all the
circumstances, it was not incumbent upon him to give any further
caution as to the effect of the complainant&#146;s conduct.
[6]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.  We
are advised that the appeal against sentence is not being
pursued.
