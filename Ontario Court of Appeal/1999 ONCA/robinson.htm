    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Jennings J. with jury, dated

</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants (Gloria Delorese Thomas-Robinson is referred
to as &#147;the appellant&#148;) appeal the judgment in an action tried by
Jennings J. and a jury, dismissing their claim for damages for
injuries sustained in a motor vehicle accident.  Numerous grounds
of appeal are raised including issues relating to jury selection,
improper exclusion and admission of evidence, errors made by the
trial judge in his charge to the jury, perverse verdict and the
dismissal of the action pursuant to subsection 266(3) of the
Insurance Act (the &#147;Act&#148;).
[2]  The liability for the accident was admitted by the defence.
By agreement of the parties, the threshold issue (&#147;the threshold
motion&#148;) under subsection 266(3) was not argued until the
conclusion of the evidence and the decision of the trial judge
was rendered after the jury verdict.  The verdict awarded the
appellant $30,000 in general damages, $35,000 for loss of income
and nothing for loss of future income and cost of future care.
[3]  We see no merit in the grounds of appeal relating to
exclusion and admission of evidence.  In our view, the threshold
issue is determinative of this appeal.
[4]  In arriving at his decision on the threshold motion, the
trial judge applied the proper test (Meyer v. Bright (1993), 15
O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.).  He carefully considered the evidence of
the parties relating to the nature of the accident and the
evidence of the appellant on the issue of damages.  He made a
detailed review of the conflicting medical evidence adduced on
behalf of the parties.   He also considered the verdict of the
jury but he made it clear that it was his sole responsibility to
decide the threshold issue.
[5]  The trial judge stated in his reasons that the evidence was
almost overwhelming that the appellant had not sustained a head
injury and that the weight of the evidence indicated that the
appellant&#146;s present condition was caused by other factors.  He
concluded that the appellant had not sustained &#147;permanent serious
impairment of an important bodily function caused by continuing
injury which is physical in nature&#148;.   Consequently, the trial
judge dismissed the action.
[6]  The trial judge saw and heard the parties and the witnesses
called on their behalf.  He was in a unique position to determine
this issue and we see no basis to interfere.  We see no error in
the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the appellant did not meet the
exception to immunity provided in subsection 266(3) of the Act.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal must be dismissed.
[8]  In light of these conclusions, it is not necessary to deal
with the other grounds of appeal, including the jury selection
issue, referred to as the &quot;Parks Motion&quot;.  The trial judge found
that the evidence was almost overwhelming that the appellant had
not sustained a head injury.  In our view, the result of the
threshold motion would have been the same even if the trial judge
had not taken the jury verdict into consideration.
[9]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
