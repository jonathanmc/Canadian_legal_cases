               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         February 16, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  At the opening of this appeal, counsel for the respondent
raised the issue of the court&#146;s jurisdiction. After reviewing the
matter and counsel&#146;s submissions with respect to that issue, we
were satisfied that we did have jurisdiction. We thus heard
argument on the appeal.

[2]  The appellant raised three grounds of appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.        Unreasonable Verdict</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, there was ample evidence to support all of the
trial judge&#146;s findings including his assessment of damages. The
record does not reveal palpable or overriding error. Further, we
think that the trial judge&#146;s reasons are sufficient. They reveal
that he was alert to the central trial issues and to the
positions taken by the parties.
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.        The Unwarranted Interference by the Trial Judge</pre>
    <pre>[4]  We have reviewed all of the trial judge&#146;s interventions as
set out in the appellant&#146;s factum and Ms. Balaban&#146;s oral argument
with respect to this issue. We see absolutely no merit in this
ground of appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.        Costs</pre>
    <pre>[5]  We think that in the circumstances, particularly having
regard to the plaintiff&#146;s settlement offer, it was open to the
trial judge to order the appellant to pay solicitor and client
costs from the date on which the trial commenced.

[6]  For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
