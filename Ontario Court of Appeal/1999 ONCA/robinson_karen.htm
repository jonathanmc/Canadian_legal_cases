    <pre>                     ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>The Admissibility of Dr. Richards' Opinion Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[1]  There is no general rule that a specialist cannot offer an
opinion as to the applicable standard of care governing medical
treatment provided by a general practitioner, or that the
specialist cannot offer an opinion as to whether the general
practitioner met the applicable standard.  The admissibility of
the specialist's opinion depends on the subject matter on which
that opinion is offered and the specialist's training and
experience.  Surely, there are treatments and procedures which
are common to the practices of general practitioners and
specialists alike.  We see nothing in the reasons of Anderson J.
in Wilkinson Estate v. Shannon (1986), 37 C.C.L.T. 181 (Ont.
H.C.) which would exclude opinion evidence merely because the
expert was a specialist and the opinion addressed the standard
applicable to a general practitioner.  Indeed, in that case the
evidence of the specialist was admitted although Anderson J. gave
it little weight.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The admissibility of Dr. Richards' opinion evidence has to
be determined on the evidence adduced on the voir dire.  Dr.
Richards was the only witness called on the voir dire.  While he
acknowledged that he was an orthopaedic specialist and had never
worked in the hospital emergency unit in a community hospital, he
further testified that he regularly worked in the emergency unit
at St. Michael's Hospital as a consulting specialist.  In the
course of that work he treated cases involving lacerations like
that suffered by the respondent, although the patients he saw
also had other more serious injuries.  Dr. Richards did not
suggest in his evidence that his view as to the appropriate
treatment of a person in the situation of the respondent was in
any way the product of his specialized training in orthopaedics.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Dr. Richards' training and experience qualified him to give
evidence as to the appropriate standard of medical care
applicable in the circumstances of this case.  His specialization
in orthopaedics and the different hospital milieu in which he
operated did not disqualify him from advancing an opinion as to
the applicable standard of care and whether the applicant met
that standard.  The differences between the expertise and the
work experience of Dr. Richards and the appellant were relevant
considerations when determining the weight to be given to Dr.
Richards' opinion.</pre>
    <pre>Did the trial judge act unreasonably in accepting the evidence of
Dr. Richards?</pre>
    <pre>[4]  When the trial judge ruled that Dr. Richards' opinion
evidence was admissible he indicated he would determine the
weight to be given to that evidence after he had heard all of the
other evidence.  In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge
accepted the evidence of Dr. Richards over conflicting evidence
offered by four defence experts.  The assessment of conflicting
evidence is at the core of the trial judge's function.  We can
interfere with findings of fact based on that assessment only if
they are unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to
appreciate that Dr. Richards' opinion was undermined in cross-
examination when he conceded that he did not know exactly how far
from the laceration the piece of glass was embedded in the
respondent's arm.  We cannot give this part of the cross-
examination the weight urged by the appellant.  Dr. Richards'
concession in cross-examination had relevance to the weight to be
assigned to his opinion but, in our view, did not destroy that
opinion.  It was for the trial judge to decide the effect of that
cross-examination.  Nothing in his reasons suggests that he
failed to consider the entirety of Dr. Richards' evidence or that
he misapprehended any part of that evidence.  His failure to
specifically advert to a part of the cross-examination cannot be
equated with a failure to consider that part of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Counsel for the appellant carefully took us through the
expert evidence offered by the appellant in detail.  That
evidence was formidable.  It contradicted Dr. Richards' opinion
both as to whether the appellant met the applicable standard and
as to whether there was any causal connection between the
appellant's suturing of the wound before x-raying the wound and
the transection of the ulnar nerve during manipulation associated
with the taking of the x-ray.  Certainly, a trial judge could
have concluded that the evidence of the defence experts, two of
whom were general practitioners with experience like that of the
appellant, was such as to compel the conclusion that the
respondent had failed to prove her case.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  It is not, however, our function to reassess that evidence
or to substitute our opinion for that of the trial judge.  He
heard all of the witnesses and ultimately concluded that he
preferred Dr. Richards' opinion on the crucial issues over that
of the other experts.  That opinion provided a basis for a
finding that the suturing of the wound before x-raying it had put
added pressure on the glass embedded in the respondent's arm, and
for the finding that the added pressure materially contributed to
the movement of the glass and the transection of the ulnar nerve
during the taking of the x-ray.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  We think it was open to the trial judge to conclude, given
the nature of the medical problem faced by the appellant, that
Dr. Richards' different work experience and his specialized
training did not affect the weight to be given to his opinion.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellant's further submission that the trial judge's
failure to specifically advert to parts of the evidence of the
defence experts should be equated with a failure to consider that
evidence cannot be sustained.  While the trial judge's reasons
could have been more detailed, we see nothing in those reasons to
support the contention that he failed to consider the entirety of
the expert evidence offered on behalf of the appellant.  There is
no basis upon which we can interfere with the trial judgment.</pre>
    <pre>[10] As indicated at the conclusion of oral argument, the appeal
is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
