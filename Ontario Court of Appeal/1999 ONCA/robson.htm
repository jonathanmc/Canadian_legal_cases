    <pre>HEARD:         March 26, 1999</pre>
    <pre>               On appeal from an order of Doherty J.A. 
               dated February 18, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a motion to set aside the order of Doherty J.A.
dismissing Wallace Robson's motions for an order extending the
time for filing notices of appeal in two actions that had been
tried together with a third action.

[2]  At the outset, we are of the view that the fresh evidence
relating to the merits of the motion should be refused.  It was
available and could have been obtained prior to the motions
before Doherty J.A. and, in any event, it would not affect the
end result.

[3]  The issue on this appeal is whether Doherty J.A. was correct
in dismissing these motions.  In our view, he was correct.  The
requisite test for an extension of time for filing a notice of
appeal has not been met.

[4]  On balance, the evidence establishes that Mr. Robson knew of
the judgment of September 1996, given that he initiated his own
cross-appeal in the third action.  The delay of some sixteen
months before he purported to file a notice of appeal can only
lead to the inference that he did not have a bona fide intention
to appeal in the two actions.  Both this delay and the further
delay of almost one year before he took any other step are
inordinate and no reasonable explanation has been offered.

[5]  It is beyond dispute that there would be prejudice to the
other parties if a new trial had to take place as the key witness
has recently died.

[6]  Finally, we see little merit in the proposed appeal.  It
seems to be an attempt to re-litigate the subject-matter of a
criminal conviction.

[7]  The motion to set aside the order of Doherty J.A. is hereby
dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
