    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>     Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In April, 1994, following a fitness hearing before Chadwick
J. and a jury, the appellant was found fit to stand trial on a
number of charges alleging various sexual offences against
members of his family committed between 1963 and 1991.
[2]  In October, 1994, following trial on these charges before
Soublière J. and a jury, the appellant was convicted of six
counts relating to offences against his daughter and two
granddaughters. Soublière J. sentenced him to serve a total of
seven years imprisoment and ordered that he serve at least half
of his sentence before he became eligible for parole.
[3]  In November, 1994, following trial before Mercier J.,
sitting without a jury, the    appellant was convicted of five
counts relating to offences against his niece and nephew. Mercier
J. sentenced him to serve a total of three years imprisonment,
consecutive to his seven-year sentence, and &quot;recommended&quot; that he
serve at least half of his sentence before he became eligible for
parole.
[4]  He appeals his convictions and the parole ineligibility
periods in respect of the sentences imposed upon him.
[5]  We deal below with the grounds in support of his appeal
raised by Ms. Paine on his behalf.</pre>
    <pre>     The fitness hearing before Chadwick J.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Ms. Paine submitted that Chadwick J. failed to instruct the
jury properly with respect to the evidence adduced at the fitness
hearing. She further submitted that the verdict of fitness to
stand trial was unreasonable in the face of the evidence of
experts called on behalf of the appellant and what she described
as the &quot;marginal relevance&quot; of surveillance and arrest evidence
called by the Crown.
[7]  In our view, the jury was correctly instructed by Chadwick
J. The onus was on the appellant to demonstrate on a balance of
probabilities his lack of fitness to stand trial, and it cannot
be said that the jury&#146;s verdict was unreasonable.
[8]  We note in this connection that the evidence given by the
appellant at the trial before Soublière J. demonstrated that the
appellant was capable of communicating with counsel and of
conducting his defence.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial before Soublière J.: failure to fairly review the
evidence</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Ms. Paine submitted that Soublière J. erred in failing, in
his charge to the jury, to fairly review the evidence at trial
and, in particular, to review the frailties and inconsistencies
in the evidence of the complainants.
[10] In our view, the trial judge&#146;s references to the evidence in
his charge were adequate in the circumstances of this case. It
was not inappropriate for the trial judge to essentially adopt
the addresses in his review of the evidence. The trial judge
commended the addresses of both counsel to the jury, for having
accurately reviewed the evidence and issues in great detail.
Neither counsel at trial complained about the adequacy of the
trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial before Soublière J.: unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[11] Ms. Paine submitted that the convictions registered against
the appellant in respect of all three of the complainants were
unreasonable and should be quashed.
[12] In our view, the convictions rendered at trial were
reasonable and supported by the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial before Soublière J.: parole ineligibility period</pre>
    <pre>[13] Ms. Paine submitted that Soublière J. had no jurisdiction to
order that the appellant serve half of his sentence before
becoming eligible for parole because the offences occurred prior
to November 1st, 1992, the date on which s. 743.6 of the Criminal
Code came into force.
[14] Mr. Siebenmorgen, on behalf of the Crown, conceded the
correctness of Ms. Paine's submission. We agree. The parole
ineligibility portion of the appellant's sentence should be set
aside.</pre>
    <pre>The trial before Mercier J.: failure to direct a fitness hearing</pre>
    <pre>[15] Ms. Paine submitted that Mercier J. erred in dismissing an
application made by counsel for the appellant at trial for a
further hearing into the issue of the appellant's fitness to be
tried.  In particular, she argued that Mercier J. applied an
incorrect legal test to the question whether there were
reasonable grounds to believe that the appellant was unfit to
stand trial and that he placed undue reliance upon the prior
determination of that issue in the earlier fitness hearing before
Chadwick J.
[16] Section 672.23(2) of the Criminal Code provides that &#147;where
the court has reasonable grounds &#133; to believe that the accused is
unfit to stand trial, the court may direct &#133; that the issue of
the fitness of the accused be tried.&#148;
[17] The appellant had been found fit to stand trial by a jury
seven months earlier and it was appropriate for the trial judge
to inquire as to the existence of more current information as to
the appellant&#146;s mental condition and capacity. There was no
evidence adduced before the trial judge that the appellant had
deteriorated since the time of the last declaration of fitness.
The appellant gave evidence at his previous trial and his counsel
before Mercier J. conceded that the nature of the appellant&#146;s
evidence could &#147;cut both ways&#148; on the issue of his fitness. It
was not suggested by counsel that he was unable to obtain
instructions from the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial before Mercier J.: similar fact evidence</pre>
    <pre>[18] Ms. Paine submitted that Mercier J. erred in admitting
alleged similar fact evidence led by the Crown.  She further
submitted that the improper admission of that evidence tainted
the appellant's subsequent convictions even though it was not
referred to by Mercier J. in his reasons for judgment.</pre>
    <pre>[19] The similar fact evidence does not appear to have been
formally admitted by the trial judge. The evidence of Nancy R.S.
was heard for the purpose of assessing its admissibility later.
The issue of admissibility was not raised again at the trial. In
any event, the evidence of Nancy R.S. could not have influenced
the convictions as her allegation was of a very minor nature in
comparison with the other allegations related to the counts in
the indictment. This evidence cannot reasonably be seen to affect
the result.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial before Mercier J.: approach to credibility</pre>
    <pre>[20] Ms. Paine submitted that Mercier J. erred in his approach to
the issue of the complainants' credibility and that his finding
that they were credible should be set aside as unreasonable. We
are not persuaded that the trial judge&#146;s findings were
unreasonable. He was clearly aware of the issues affecting the
credibility of the complainants who were describing events that
occurred when they were children. In our view, the assessment of
the complainant&#146;s credibility was not unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial before Mercier J.: unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[21] Ms. Paine submitted that the convictions registered against
the appellant were, by reason of the frailties and inherent
unreliability of both complainants' evidence, unreasonable and
should be quashed.
[22] We do not agree. There is nothing to indicate that the trial
judge failed to consider relevant evidence or misapprehended the
evidence. We see no reason to interfere.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial before Mercier J.: parole ineligibility period</pre>
    <pre>[23] Ms. Paine submitted that Mercier J. erred in law in making a
recommendation, after referring to s. 743.6 of the Criminal Code,
that the appellant serve half of his sentence before becoming
eligible for parole.  While, in theory, a recommendation may be
viewed as having less effect than an order, we are of the view
that, for the reason indicated with respect to the sentence
imposed by Soublière J., which applies equally to the
circumstances in this appeal, the parole ineligibility portion of
the appellant's sentence should be set aside.</pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[24] The appellant's appeals against conviction are dismissed.
Leave is granted to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him
and the appeals against sentence are allowed to the extent that
the provisions for parole ineligibility are set aside.  The
sentences are otherwise confirmed.</pre>
