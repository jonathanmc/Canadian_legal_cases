</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Hill J. dated January 6, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>Overview:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In 1990, the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General
published the Report of the Task Force on Paralegals.  The report
recognized public acceptance of a wide range of paralegal
services and recommended legislative action to establish
educational standards and other controls over the activities of
paralegals.  No legislation has been passed in response to the
report.
[2]  The absence of any regulatory control over paralegals has
become particularly problematic in the criminal courts.  In
Ontario, paralegals and other non-lawyers represent persons
charged with crimes that are prosecuted by way of summary
conviction proceedings.  Historically, charges prosecuted in that
manner were relatively minor.  However, since 1990, the Criminal
Code has been amended to create new hybrid offences which may, at
the option of the Crown, be prosecuted in summary proceedings.
These hybrid offences include some very serious crimes such as
assault with a weapon, forcible confinement, sexual assault,
breaking and entering, uttering threats and forgery.  Some of
these crimes (eg. sexual assault) are punishable by up to 18
months imprisonment and significant terms of incarceration are
not unusual following conviction.  Furthermore, prosecution of
some of these crimes will routinely involve complex evidentiary
and procedural issues.  Finally, all signs suggest that
Parliament will continue to expand the number of hybrid offences
and increase the penalties for some offences punishable by
summary proceedings (eg. drinking and driving offences).
[3]  The obvious concerns associated with untrained and
unregulated paralegals representing accused charged with serious
crimes have not moved the province or the federal government to
exercise any control over the appearance of paralegals in summary
proceedings.  These concerns have, however, precipitated the
intervention of the Canadian Bar Association and the Criminal
Lawyers&#146; Association in this appeal.1  The intervenors ask the
court to fill the void created by the legislative inactivity and
to declare that paralegals cannot represent persons charged with
criminal offences, even when those offences are prosecuted by way
of summary proceedings.  Alternatively, the intervenors submit
that the court should assume the de facto role of regulator and
control the appearance of paralegals in criminal courts on a case-
by-case basis.
[4]  There are five issues raised in this appeal:</pre>
    <pre>*    Assuming Part XXVII of the Criminal Code and specifically
  ss. 800 and 802 permit representation in criminal proceedings by
  an agent who is not a lawyer, are those provisions within the
  legislative competence of Parliament?</pre>
    <pre>*    Assuming the legislation is intra vires Parliament, does it
  permit agents who are not lawyers to represent persons on
  criminal offences prosecuted by way of summary proceedings?</pre>
    <pre>*    Is there a constitutional right to effective representation
  where an accused is represented by an agent who is not a lawyer?</pre>
    <pre>*    What duties, if any, are imposed on a trial judge where an
  accused is represented by an agent who is not a lawyer in
  proceedings governed by Part XXVII of the Criminal Code.  In
  particular, is the trial judge required to inquire into the
  competence of the agent?</pre>
    <pre>*    Does a trial judge have the authority to refuse to permit an
  agent who is not a lawyer to represent an accused person in a
  summary proceeding governed by Part XXVII of the Code?</pre>
    <pre>The Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant drove his car into the rear of a vehicle
driven by an off-duty police officer.  The officer put in a call
for on-duty police and then spoke briefly with the appellant,
telling him not to leave the scene.  She believed the appellant
was impaired.  In some ensuing confusion she lost track of the
appellant.  However, another witness saw him walk away from the
scene about 30 minutes after the accident &#147;at a quick, fairly
quick, pace&#148;.  The witnesses who testified did not see the
appellant give his name and address to anyone at the scene.  The
police could not find him at his home, but five days later the
appellant surrendered and admitted being the driver in the
accident.  He was charged with failing to remain at the scene of
an accident contrary to s. 252(1)(b).  &#147;Fail to remain&#148; is a
hybrid offence and the Crown elected to proceed summarily.  If
convicted, the appellant faced a possible maximum jail term of 6
months and an automatic suspension of his driving licence.
[6]  At the outset of the proceedings, Mr. L. Carter appeared and
indicated that he had been retained to represent the appellant.
Mr. Carter is not a lawyer.  The trial judge questioned the
accused about his use of an agent and eventually satisfied
himself that the accused understood Mr. Carter&#146;s status and the
consequence of being represented by an agent who is not a lawyer.
The trial proceeded.
[7]  The agent cross-examined witnesses and obtained admissions
that they could not know for certain whether the accused had left
his name and address with someone else at the scene.  He did not
call the accused or introduce evidence of intoxication but argued
that the police officer&#146;s evidence in that respect was sufficient
to rebut the presumption of intent to leave the scene.  The
accused was found guilty and appealed, retaining counsel for that
purpose.</pre>
    <pre>The appeal before Hill J.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  On the summary conviction appeal (R. v. Romanowicz (1998),
14 C.R. (5th) 100 (Ont. Gen. Div.)) it was argued that intent to
escape civil or criminal liability had not been established, that
the agent should not have been permitted to appear in the absence
of proper assurance of his competency and that, on the basis of
fresh evidence and a review of the trial transcript, the
appellant had been denied competent representation.
[9]  Hill J. concluded on the appeal that there was evidence to
support the finding of intent to leave the scene and thus no
grounds for appellate interference.  That conclusion has not been
challenged on the appeal to this court.
[10] The &#147;fresh evidence&#148; introduced before Hill J. consisted of
the appellant&#146;s affidavit and certain telephone records allegedly
showing attempts to contact the police to report the accident.
Hill J. was not satisfied that this evidence could affect the
verdict or that it demonstrated Mr. Carter&#146;s incompetence.
[11] Hill J. framed the issue involving the trial judge&#146;s
obligation to inquire into the competence of the agent in these
terms at p. 107:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The appellant submits that the trial judge committed an
          error of jurisdictional dimension in permitting the chosen agent
          to appear in the absence of a proper assurance of the competency
          of the agent to defend the criminal charge.  No constitutional
          arguments have been advanced to suggest that a defendant cannot
          be represented by an agent in summary conviction trial
          proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>[12] He then went on to summarize the trial judge&#146;s opening
inquiry in these terms at pp. 107-08:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Some five or six pages of the transcript record of the trial
          date relate to the issue of Mr. Carter&#146;s status or authority to
          appear to defend the case.  In summary, the following matters
          were canvassed on the record in the presence of the appellant
          before the trial commenced:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  The agent was not a lawyer or a member of the Law
               Society.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The agent was not accountable to the Law
               Society and the client would not be in a position to
               sue the agent as he would a lawyer.
         </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  The agent had a letter of
               understanding from his client indicating
               the client&#146;s understanding that he held
               the status of an agent.
         </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  The appellant understood he was
               facing a serious charge with potential
               jeopardy to liberty and the suspension
               of his driver&#146;s licence upon conviction.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (5)  The agent had previously appeared
               as agent before summary conviction trial
               courts.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (6)  The appellant wanted the agent to
               represent him at trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               With scrupulous care, the trial judge
          addressed many of these issues directly
          with Mr. Romanowicz.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellant argued that the trial judge was obligated to
conduct a mini-test of the agent&#146;s legal understanding of the
elements of the offence and of his previous experience.
[14] Hill J., at p. 110, reviewed the authorities and concluded
that where an accused elects to appear by an agent, the court&#146;s
discretion to question the soundness of that choice is limited.
It should be exercised  &#147;&#133;consistent with the ordered control of
its own process and the constitutional obligation to ensure that
an accused, unrepresented by counsel, receives a fair trial.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1:  The vires of the Criminal Code provisions</pre>
    <pre>[15] Upon notice to the Attorney General of Canada, the appellant
and the intervenors raise the following constitutional issue:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Are sections 800(2) and 802(2) ultra vires the authority of
          the federal government to enact, as the provincial legislature
          has exclusive jurisdiction to enact legislation relating to the
          persons entitled to appear in the criminal courts in the role of
          counsel to the party litigants?</pre>
    <pre>[16] The vires of the relevant provisions was addressed by Wein
J. in R. v. Lemonides (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 611 (Gen. Div.).  That
was an appeal from a conviction for dangerous driving where the
Crown proceeded summarily and the accused was represented by an
agent.  The Ontario Criminal Lawyers&#146; Association intervened, the
same constitutional arguments were raised, and Wein J. wrote very
extensive reasons on the subject.  She found ss. 800(2) and
802(2) of the Criminal Code to be valid federal legislation and
we agree.  As we cannot improve upon the analysis of the law
found at pp. 616-21 of her reasons, we need only set out our
analysis of this issue in summary form.
[17] Sections 800 and 802 are contained in Part XXVII of the
Criminal Code, relating to summary convictions:
          </pre>
    <pre>               800. (1) Where the prosecutor and defendant appear for the
          trial, the summary conviction court shall proceed to hold the
          trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  A defendant may appear personally
          or by counsel or agent, but the summary
          conviction court may require the defendant to
          appear personally and may, if it thinks fit,
          issue a warrant in Form 7 for the arrest of
          the defendant and adjourn the trial to await
          his appearance pursuant thereto.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  Where the defendant is a
          corporation, it shall appear by counsel or
          agent, and if it does not appear, the summary
          conviction court may, on proof of service of
          the summons, proceed ex parte to hold the
          trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               *****
          </pre>
    <pre>               802. (1)  The prosecutor is entitled
          personally to conduct his case and the
          defendant is entitled to make his full answer
          and defence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The prosecutor or defendant, as the
          case may be, may examine and cross-examine
          witnesses personally or by counsel or agent.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  Every witness at a trial in
          proceedings to which this Part applies shall
          be examined under oath.</pre>
    <pre>[18] There can be no question that criminal procedure lies within
federal jurisdiction.  This was articulated by Laskin  C.J. in
Canada (Attorney General) v. Canadian National Transportation
Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 206 at 223:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Language and logic inform constitutional
          interpretation, and they are applicable in considering the
          alleged reach of s. 92(14) and the allegedly correlative
          limitation of criminal procedure in s. 91(27).  I find it
          difficult, indeed impossible, to read s. 92(14) as not only
          embracing prosecutorial authority respecting the enforcement of
          federal criminal law but diminishing the ex facie impact of s.
          91(27) which includes procedure in criminal maters.  As a matter
          of language, there is nothing in s. 92(14) which embraces
          prosecutorial authority in respect of federal criminal matters.
          Section 92(14) grants jurisdiction over the administration of
          justice, including procedure in civil matters and including also
          the constitution, maintenance and organization  of civil and
          criminal provincial courts.  The section thus narrows the scope
          of the criminal law power under s. 91, but only with respect to
          what is embraced within &#147;the Constitution, Maintenance, and
          Organization of Provincial Courts &#133; of Criminal Jurisdiction.&#148;
          By no stretch of language can these words be construed to include
          jurisdiction over the conduct of criminal prosecutions.
          Moreover, as a matter of conjunctive assessment of the two
          constitutional provisions, the express inclusion of procedure in
          civil matters in  provincial Courts points to an express
          provincial exclusion of procedure in criminal matters specified
          in s. 91(27). [My emphasis.]</pre>
    <pre>[19] This reasoning was confirmed and elaborated upon in Knox
Contracting Ltd. v. Canada,  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 338 and Kourtessis
v. M.N.R., [1993] 2 S.C.R. 53.
[20] Each item referred to in ss. 800 and 802 is a matter of
criminal procedure.  A reading of these sections, informed by the
language of Laskin C.J., leaves no doubt that the legislation is
within the competence of the federal government.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2:  The interpretation of the relevant Criminal Code
provisions</pre>
    <pre>[21] The intervenors advanced several arguments in support of
their contention that ss. 800(2) and 802(2) do not provide for
representation by agents who are not lawyers and who are paid for
that representation.
[22] First, it was suggested that &#147;agents&#148; should be restricted
to relatives and friends of the defendant and should not include
those paid for their services. This argument flows from the
restrictions in the Solicitors Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.S.15,
allegedly preventing non-lawyers from presenting legal arguments
on behalf of a client for compensation.  Section 1 of the
Solicitors Act provides that it is unlawful for a person who is
not a solicitor or a party to the action to prosecute or defend
an action for a fee.
[23] The position taken is that this is valid provincial
legislation related to the practice of law and is operative to
prevent the appearance of paid agents in summary conviction
proceedings.  In R. v. Lawrie and Pointts Ltd. (1987), 59 O.R.
(2d) 161 (C.A.), a similar argument was turned aside by this
court in respect of agents appearing pursuant to the Provincial
Offences Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 233 [now R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 33],
which specifically permitted the appearance of agents.  The court
reasoned that s.1 of the Solicitors Act must be read in
conjunction with s. 50(1) of the Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.
233 [now R.S.O. 1990, c. L. 8].  The latter section provides that
no person who is not registered as a member of the Law Society
shall act in the role of barrister or solicitor, &#147;except as
provided by law&#148;.  The court concluded that an appearance
authorized by the Provincial Offences Act was &#147;provided by law&#148;.
This conclusion, which applies to the operation of two provincial
statutes, must also apply where the Criminal Code authorizes the
appearance of agents in criminal summary conviction proceedings.
[24] The word &#147;agent&#148; is not defined in the Criminal Code.  Its
meaning is found in ordinary parlance and the dictionary &#150; in the
most general terms, a &#147;representative&#148;.  The relevant provincial
legislation does not limit the language of the Code (assuming it
could) to unpaid agents.  Thus the fact that the representative
is a hireling is irrelevant to the accused&#146;s right to a
representative of his or her choice to assist in the defence of a
summary conviction proceeding.
[25] Another argument advanced to this court was to the effect
that s. 802(2), on a strict reading, permits an agent only to
examine or cross-examine.  This interpretation does not bear up
under analysis.  Section 800(2) permits the appearance of an
agent and contemplates a hearing without the attendance of the
defendant.  In this circumstance the agent must be capable of
performing all defence functions.  Likewise, a police constable
appearing as agent for the prosecutor gains authority from these
same sections and could not sensibly be limited to examination of
witnesses:  see R. v. Maher (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 476 (Nfld.
C.A.).  In addition, the limitation suggested by the interveners
would also apply to counsel, who is referred to in s. 802
alongside an agent.
[26] Finally, it was argued in the factum of the Canadian Bar
Association that ss. 800 and 802 do not apply to hybrid offences,
which remain in effect indictable offences even after the Crown
has chosen to proceed  by way of summary conviction.  This
argument has enjoyed some success in the Provincial Division:
see R. v. Wilson, [1997] O.J. No. 459 (Prov. Div.).  In our view,
it must be rejected.  The summary conviction procedures described
in Part XXVII of the Criminal Code are a package and apply to all
offences that are prosecuted by way of summary proceedings,
whether they are straight summary conviction offences or hybrid
offences.  This court has expressly held that Part XXVII applies
once the Crown has elected to proceed summarily:  R. v. Gougeon
(1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 218 at 234-5.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 3:  Is there a constitutional right to effective assistance
where an accused is represented by an agent who is not a lawyer?</pre>
    <pre>[27] Every accused is owed a fair trial.  That right is
guaranteed by s. 11(d) of the Charter.  Representation by
professionals trained in the law and bound by the ethics and
obligations of their profession serves that right.  In some
cases, legal representation is essential to the securing of a
fair trial and an accused who wants counsel must be provided with
counsel:  R. v. Rowbotham (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 66 (Ont.
C.A.).  If an accused retains counsel, she is constitutionally
entitled to competent representation by that counsel:  R. v.
L.C.B. (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 353 at 367 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v.
Joanisse (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 at 56-58.  The constitutional
right to the effective assistance of counsel recognizes that
counsel, by virtue of their professional training, will bring to
their task an expertise which others, including the accused, do
not possess.  An accused who chooses to seek the assistance of
legally trained counsel is entitled to assistance which reflects
that expertise.</pre>
    <pre>[28] An accused is also entitled to proceed without counsel.  The
accused may choose self-representation, or if the Crown has
proceeded summarily, the accused may choose to be represented by
an agent:  R. v. Vescio, [1949] S.C.R. 139 at 142;  R. v.
Littlejohn and Tirabasso (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 161 at 173 (Ont.
C.A.).  By choosing to proceed without counsel, an accused elects
to forego the right to the effective assistance of counsel.  An
accused cannot at the same time exercise the right to proceed
without the assistance of counsel and yet demand the right to the
effective assistance of counsel.
[29] If an accused chooses  self-representation, he or she cannot
be heard to complain that the conduct of the trial did not rise
to the level of a competent counsel.  We see no reason why the
same conclusion would not follow when an accused chooses to be
represented by an agent who is not a lawyer.  Nor does the fact
that the agent is paid create any presumption as to the agent&#146;s
competence.  Just as where an accused chooses self-
representation, an accused who chooses to be represented by an
agent who is not a lawyer has decided against exercising the
right to effective assistance of counsel, and cannot be heard to
contend that the agent&#146;s performance should be tested against the
standard reserved to counsel trained in the law:  Harrison v.
Canada, [1998] A.J. No. 109 at paras. 15-17 (Alta. Q.B.).
[30] In holding that an accused who chooses to be represented by
an agent and not a lawyer has no constitutional right to
competent representation, we do not suggest that the accused&#146;s
right to a fair trial is diminished.  That right remains in full
force and the absence of legally trained counsel puts an added
obligation on the trial judge to protect that right:  R. v.
McGibbon (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 334 at 347 (Ont. C.A.).
[31] Nor do we suggest that an accused who is represented by an
agent who is not a lawyer is foreclosed from raising the conduct
of that agent on appeal in support of a submission that the
conviction constitutes a miscarriage of justice.  Any such
submission cannot, however, be made on the basis that the
miscarriage arises because the agent failed to meet the competent
lawyer standard.  Rather, the accused must demonstrate that the
agent&#146;s conduct, perhaps combined with other events, produced a
miscarriage of justice.
[32] An example will help clarify this distinction.  In R. v.
Sumbler, [1997] O.J. No. 1953 (Gen. Div.), the appellant argued
that he had pleaded guilty because of information given to him by
his agent concerning the length of the licence suspension that
would be imposed on conviction.  The information provided by the
agent was wrong.  The mandatory suspension was twice as long as
the appellant had anticipated.  Quinn J. allowed an appeal from
conviction, permitted the accused to withdraw his guilty plea and
directed a new trial on the basis that the misinformation
provided by the agent had invalidated the guilty plea and
resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  Although the agent&#146;s
conduct in Sumbler clearly fell below the level expected of
competent counsel, that was not the basis for the finding that a
miscarriage of justice occurred.  The miscarriage flowed from the
erroneous information provided by the agent which, in the view of
Quinn J., made the guilty plea an uninformed one.
[33] The situation in Sumbler can be usefully compared to an
argument advanced by this appellant to the Summary Conviction
Appeal Court.  The appellant, following his agent&#146;s advice, did
not testify.  On appeal he argued that his defence of lack of
intent could not hope to succeed absent his testimony and that
the advice that he should not testify effectively doomed his
case.  This argument rests on the assumption that the appellant
was entitled to competent legal advice and an informed legal
opinion on whether he should testify.  For the reasons outlined
above, that assumption is misplaced where the appellant has
chosen to be represented by someone who is not a lawyer.  The
appellant, having decided he did not want a lawyer and wished to
be represented by Mr. Carter, cannot be heard to complain that
Mr. Carter in advising him not to testify did not exercise the
judgment expected of a lawyer.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 4:  What obligations, if any, does a trial judge have when
an accused is represented by an agent who is not a lawyer?</pre>
    <pre>[34] This issue is directed to the trial judge&#146;s responsibilities
at the outset of a trial where an accused appears represented by
an agent who is not a lawyer.  There are essentially two
questions to be answered:</pre>
    <pre>*    are trial judges obligated to make inquiries to determine
  whether the accused has made an informed choice to forego
  representation by counsel in favour of representation by an
  agent?</pre>
    <pre>*    are trial judges obligated to make inquiries to satisfy
  themselves that the agent is competent to represent the accused
  in the proceedings?</pre>
    <pre>[35] The inquiries suggested by these two questions serve
fundamentally different purposes.  The first is aimed at ensuring
that the accused has made an informed choice;  it is not
concerned with the sagacity of that choice.  The second inquiry
assumes that the accused has made an informed choice and calls
upon the court to assess the wisdom of that choice in the light
of its assessment of the agent&#146;s competence.
[36] All of the parties to this appeal accept that trial judges
should make some inquiry to satisfy themselves that an accused
has made an informed decision to proceed without counsel and with
representation by an agent.  We agree.  Our analysis of the
effect of the accused&#146;s decision to be represented by an agent
assumes that the decision is an informed one.
[37] The kind of inquiry expected of a trial judge where an
accused chooses to proceed without any representation provides
guidance in cases where an accused chooses to be represented by
an agent who is not a lawyer.  In R. v. McGibbon, supra,
Griffiths J.A. commented on the duty of a judge at the opening of
a trial where the accused is unrepresented. At p. 346 he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The trial judge, of course, has a duty to the accused
          to see that he or she has a fair hearing and that duty will
          generally cast upon the judge an obligation to point out to the
          accused that he or she would be at a distinct disadvantage in
          proceeding without the assistance of competent counsel and that
          the accused is entitled to have such counsel.  Where the accused
          expressly desires counsel, it is clear that unless the accused
          has deliberately failed to retain counsel, or has discharged
          counsel, with the intent of delaying the process of the court,
          the trial judge should afford the accused an opportunity to
          retain counsel either at his expense or through the services of
          Legal Aid.  If Legal Aid will not fund counsel it may be
          necessary at least in long complicated trials to stay the
          proceedings until counsel is funded.</pre>
    <pre>[38] In R. v. Hardy (1990), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 28 (Alta Q.B.),
McDonald J. provided a  checklist of issues which a trial judge
should address before proceeding with a trial where the accused
was unrepresented by counsel.  These included informing the
accused of the right to be represented by counsel, explaining the
assistance that counsel might provide, and ensuring that the
accused did not wish to be represented by counsel.  McDonald J.
held that the failure to take these steps would infringe the
accused&#146;s rights under s. 7 of the Charter.
[39] The result in Hardy was affirmed on appeal (1991), 69 C.C.C.
(3d) 190.  However, the court did not agree that an accused&#146;s
rights under s. 7 of the Charter were implicated.  Major J.A.,
for the court, referred to the checklist provided by McDonald J.
as a useful and instructive guide to trial judges.
[40] We agree with Major J.A. that an accused&#146;s s. 7 rights are
not affected by the trial judge&#146;s failure to make the necessary
inquiries of an unrepresented accused.  Certainly, Griffiths J.A.
in R. v. McGibbon, supra, did not suggest that an accused&#146;s s. 7
rights were implicated.  The right which is important here is the
right to a fair trial.  Inquiries like those described in R. v.
Hardy, supra, protect the right to a fair trial by ensuring that
when the trial commences the accused is aware of the significance
of the decision to proceed without counsel.  The appearance of
the fairness of the proceedings is preserved by inquiries which
assure the trial judge that the accused is not proceeding in
ignorance of his rights or of the potential effect his choice may
have on the proceedings.  A failure to appreciate either could
result in a miscarriage of justice.
[41] We think that a trial judge faced with an accused who has
chosen to be represented by an agent should ensure that the
choice is an informed one.  The trial judge should be satisfied
that the accused is aware that the agent is not a lawyer and that
the accused will not have recourse to various remedies which
might be available to him if the agent were a lawyer and
performed inadequately.
[42] Where it appears that the accused is represented by a paid
agent, the trial judge would do well to inform the accused that
the laws of Ontario do not require that persons receive any
training or demonstrate any level of expertise before being
allowed to take money in return for representing persons in
criminal matters.  It is also advisable that the trial judge
advise the accused that while the law expects certain minimum
standards of competence from lawyers it imposes no such standards
on those who are not lawyers.
[43] The exact details of the requisite inquiry will depend on
the circumstances of each case.  The trial judge in this case
conducted the following inquiry:
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  All right.  You&#146;ve gone over these things with
          your client &#133;

    <pre>               MR. CARTER:  I have.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  &#133; and has he executed a

          effect?
          </pre>
    <pre>               MR. CARTER:  I&#146;ve got a letter of
          understanding to the effect that he
          understands that we are agents.  We are not
          members of any Law Society and the fact that
          he understands the charge and the penalty
          that may be imposed against him.

          </pre>
    <pre>               MS. CAPONECCHIA:  Provided the accused
          knows his status.  The difficulty I have is
          that this individual has a language barrier
          problem.  Perhaps Your Honour can canvas with
          him, with the aid of the interpreter, whether
          he understood the discussion that he had with
          the agent and the Crown does want to proceed
          because we have all our witnesses here.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  Are you content I address
          your client, then?
          </pre>
    <pre>               MR. CARTER:  In fact I would request
          that you address my client, Your Honour.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:   Mr. Romanowicz, how old are

          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  All right.  And you have

          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  Are you aware that Mr.

    <pre>               A.  Yes I am.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  And, of course, not a member
          of the Law Society?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:  If for some reason he should
          do something wrong today, you would have no
          recourse to sue him as a lawyer.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  Yes.  I&#146;m aware of it.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:  And you&#146;re aware that you would
          have no right to complain to the Law Society
          about any of his conduct?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yes I know.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:  You&#146;re aware that you&#146;re facing a
          serious charge here that may, and I know
          nothing about the case, but it may possibly
          result in a jail sentence for you?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yes I was informed. I know about this.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:  All right.  And under those
          circumstances you&#146;re content to have Mr.
          Carter act for you?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:  All right.</pre>
    <pre>[44] We agree with Hill J. that the trial judge&#146;s inquiry was
adequate in the circumstances.  We also find nothing in the
record presented on appeal to suggest that the accused&#146;s choice
to be represented by an agent who was not a lawyer was not a
fully informed one.  His real complaint is that with the benefit
of hindsight he now believes that he made a bad choice.
[45] A difficult problem is raised by the further question of
whether a trial judge, having been satisfied that the accused has
made an informed choice to be represented by an agent, must also
inquire into the competence of that agent.  Obviously, all
interests, particularly those of the accused, are served by
competent representation.  However, imposing a mandatory
obligation on the trial judge to inquire into the competency of
agents in all criminal cases where an accused chooses to be
represented by an agent raises insurmountable difficulties.
First and, perhaps, foremost, how is the trial judge to know what
standard of competency to apply?  Is there to be a different
standard for each trial judge and for each case depending on the
seriousness of the charge and the complexity of the proceedings?
Neither Parliament nor the Legislature has seen fit to impose any
standard on agents who are authorized to appear in summary
conviction proceedings.  The involvement of unregulated agents in
summary conviction proceedings must be accepted as a fact of
life.  Judges cannot become regulators and restrict the
appearance of agents on a case-by-case basis based on their
personal assessment of the competence of each agent.
[46] Second, even if a competence standard could be established,
competence is hard, if not impossible, to determine in the
abstract.  To conduct an effective competence inquiry, the trial
judge would have to know a lot more about the particulars of the
case than the judge knows or, indeed, should know at the outset
of the trial.  An attempt to conduct a meaningful inquiry into
competence could well take the trial judge into confidential
discussions between the accused and the agent or reveal defence
strategies and tactics to the prosecution.  Either result could
render the trial unfair.
[47] Third, a mandatory competence inquiry suggests a
paternalistic role for the court, which is inconsistent with the
adversarial process and the autonomy of the accused.  In summary
conviction proceedings the law presently allows the accused to
choose among self-representation, representation by an agent who
is not a lawyer and representation by counsel.  The exercise of
that choice is part of the accused&#146;s constitutional right to
control his or her own defence:  R. v. Swain (1991), 63 C.C.C.
(3d) 481 at 505 (S.C.C.).  The words of Lacourcière J.A. in R. v.
Taylor (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 551 at 567 (Ont. C.A.) are
apposite:
          </pre>
    <pre>               An accused who has not been found unfit to stand trial must
          be permitted to conduct his own defence, even if this means that
          the accused may act to his own detriment in doing so.  The
          autonomy of the accused in the adversarial system requires that
          the accused should be able to make such fundamental decisions and
          assume the risks involved.</pre>
    <pre>[48] In our opinion, it would be inconsistent with the right of
accused persons to choose their mode of representation if courts
were obligated to scrutinize those choices and veto them if it
were concluded that the chosen representative was not up to the
task.  The emphasis must be on the accused&#146;s right to choose and
not on the merits of that choice.
[49] Fourth, a mandatory inquiry into the competence of the agent
at the outset of the proceedings could undermine the accused&#146;s
confidence in that agent and destroy the appearance of a fair
trial.  An accused who watches a chosen representative undergo a
competency examination by the trial judge might reasonably
conclude that the trial judge regards that representative as a
&#147;second-class citizen&#148; in the courtroom.  The accused might well
conclude that the agent&#146;s presence is regarded with suspicion by
the trial judge and that any arguments made by the agent will not
carry the weight afforded to those made by Crown counsel.
[50] Fifth, mandatory competency inquiries could become extensive
and would inevitably be time-consuming.  Summary conviction
courts are busy places.  Often, several trials are listed for the
same day.  A significant delay in the completion of any one of
those trials will inconvenience those involved in that case and
in any of the cases scheduled to be heard after it.
[51] If trial judges are required in every case where an accused
is represented by an agent to satisfy themselves that the agent
is competent, scheduling of trials in summary conviction court
will become an even more difficult task.  Delay will no doubt
occur.  That delay will at least result in added inconvenience
and cost both to individuals and to the administration of justice
as a whole.  In extreme cases, delays which result in
adjournments may render a trial on the merits impossible.
[52] These considerations compel us to hold, as Hill J. did, that
the trial judge is not obliged to inquire into the competence of
all agents who represent accused charged with criminal offences.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 5:  Does a trial judge have the authority to refuse to
permit an agent to represent an accused in summary conviction
proceedings?</pre>
    <pre>[53] As we interpret the relevant provisions of the Criminal
Code, they permit an accused to be represented by an agent in all
summary conviction proceedings.  The Code does not expressly give
the trial judge any power to prohibit a specific agent from
appearing in a particular case.
[54] Several provincial statutes that provide for representation
by agents before various tribunals recognize the tribunal&#146;s power
to exclude agents.  For example, s.50 of the Provincial Offences
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 33 permits persons charged with
provincial offences to be represented by agents.  Section 50(3)
goes on to provide:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The court may bar any person from appearing as an agent who
          is not a barrister and solicitor entitled to practise in Ontario
          if the court finds that the person is not competent properly to
          represent or advise the person for whom he or she appears as
          agent or does not understand and comply with the duties and
          responsibilities of an agent.    [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[55] This section and similar provisions in other provincial
statutes2 protect both the individual and the tribunal from the
incompetent or unscrupulous agent.  The power to disqualify
agents extends to those whose forensic skills are so wanting as
to render their participation in the proceedings a real hindrance
both to the party for whom they act and to the tribunal.  The
power to disqualify also reaches those who can be described as
ethically incompetent.  In Codina v. The Law Society of Upper
Canada (1996), 93 O.A.C. 214 (Div. Ct.), the appellant, Codina
wished to be represented before a discipline committee of the Law
Society by Mr. Harry Kopyto, a recently disbarred lawyer.
Counsel for the Law Society objected and asked the panel to
exercise its power under s. 23(3) of the Statutory Powers
Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S. 22 to refuse to permit Kopyto
to appear.  Section 23(3) of the Act is virtually identical to s.
50(3) of the Provincial Offences Act.
[56] The Law Society apparently did not challenge Kopyto&#146;s
forensic skills, but rather contended that his recent disbarment
for acts of &#147;pervasive dishonesty&#148; rendered him &#147;incompetent&#148; in
that he could not be relied on to conduct Codina&#146;s representation
in an honest and ethical manner.  After hearing extensive
evidence, including testimony from Kopyto, the discipline
committee disqualified him, holding at p. 216:
          </pre>
    <pre>               We are satisfied &#133; that the tribunal could not rely on Mr.
          Kopyto&#146;s integrity, honesty and forthrightness, and that
          therefore he is not competent properly to represent or to advise
          Ms. Codina before it.</pre>
    <pre>[57] Ms. Codina&#146;s application for judicial review from the order
refusing to allow Kopyto to appear was dismissed in the
Divisional Court:  see also Re Kopyto v. Ontario (Attorney
General) (1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 572 (Div. Ct.).
[58] The Criminal Code does not expressly authorize the court to
disqualify agents in summary conviction proceedings.
Nonetheless, we are satisfied that the power to do so along the
lines found in the provincial legislation exists by virtue of the
court&#146;s power to control its own process in order to maintain the
integrity of that process.  The power of the criminal trial court
to control its process was described as a fundamental value of
the criminal justice system by La Forest J. in Canadian
Broadcasting Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney General) (1996),
110 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 208 (S.C.C.).  In describing the power, he
said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The first such value is the power vested in
          courts of criminal jurisdiction to control
          their own process in furtherance of the rule
          of law.  This was recognized in United Nurses
          of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General),
          [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901, 71 C.C.C. (3d) 225
          (S.C.C.), where McLachlin J. noted that
          &#147;[t]he rule of law is directly dependant on
          the ability of the courts to enforce their
          process and maintain their dignity and
          respect&#148; (p. 931).</pre>
    <pre>[59] The authority of the criminal trial court to control its own
process has been recognized both where the court exercises a
discretionary power granted by the Criminal Code and where there
is no statutory authority for the court&#146;s action.  For example,
it has been held that criminal courts have the power to appoint
counsel, to exclude persons from the court room, to prohibit
publication of proceedings, to control access to court records
and to prohibit the publication of information identifying a
witness or a party to criminal proceedings:  R. v. Rowbotham,
supra, at p. 69;  R. v. Laws (1998), 128 C.C.C. (3d) 516 at 528
(Ont. C.A.);  Nova Scotia (Attorney General) v. MacIntyre (1982),
65 C.C.C. (2d) 129 at 149 (S.C.C.);  Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), supra;  Dagenais
v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 289
(S.C.C.).
[60] The now well-established authority of a criminal trial court
to stay proceedings that constitute an abuse of process is
perhaps the most dramatic example of the court&#146;s power to control
its own process so as to maintain the rule of law and the
integrity of the court:  see R. v. Young (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 1
at 26-32 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Jewitt (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d) 7 at
14 (S.C.C.);  R. v. Keyowski (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 482
(S.C.C.).   The power to stay proceedings as an abuse is not
found in the Criminal Code, but is instead inherent in the role
played by the courts as the ultimate guardians of the rule of law
and the integrity of the criminal justice system.
[61] A power to deny audience to an agent whose participation in
proceedings would either damage the fairness of those
proceedings, impair the ability of the tribunal to perform its
function or otherwise undermine the integrity of the process is
entirely consistent with the exercise of the power recognized in
the authorities referred to above.  Surely, representation by an
agent who has been shown to be incompetent or disreputable can
imperil the accused&#146;s right to a fair trial and can undermine the
integrity of the proceedings just as much as if an accused who
was incapable of representing himself were required to proceed
without counsel.
[62] Both Hill J. in this case and Wein J. in R. v. Lemonides,
supra, were satisfied that trial judges in the exercise of their
power to control proceedings before them could refuse to permit
an accused to be represented by an agent in summary conviction
court.  Wein J. framed the discretion in a manner suggesting a
proactive role for trial judges, especially where the allegations
are serious.  She said at p. 631:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, the potential problems associated with allowing
          unregulated agents to appear necessitate the exercise of a very
          broad discretion in the trial judge, who may well determine that
          the agent should not appear. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;[T]rial judges in my view should be
          cautious before allowing agents to appear and
          actively represent persons charged with
          summary offences under the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>[63] Hill J., while recognizing that a trial judge could
disqualify an agent in any given case, described that power in
these terms, at p. 110:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;[T]he court enjoys a limited discretion to question the
          soundness of the accused&#146;s choice to appear by an agent &#150; a
          discretion to be exercised consistent with the ordered control of
          its own process and the constitutional obligation to ensure that
          an accused, unrepresented by counsel, receives a fair trial.</pre>
    <pre>[64] The approach favoured by Hill J. encompasses both the
accused&#146;s right to a fair trial and the need to preserve the
integrity of the process.  It is consistent with the approach we
take and strikes the balance between the trial judge&#146;s obligation
to protect the integrity of the proceedings, including the
accused&#146;s right to a fair trial and the accused&#146;s right, within
the limits of the law, to choose a representative.
[65] We were referred to two authorities which might be taken to
deny the power of the summary proceedings court to control its
own proceedings by refusing to permit representation by a
particular person.  In R. v. Mahar, supra, the Newfoundland Court
of Appeal, in holding that agents properly appointed by the
Attorney General were entitled to appear as prosecutors in
summary conviction proceedings, said at p. 478:
          </pre>
    <pre>                       Counsel for the respondent contends that Provincial
          Court judges have the inherent jurisdiction to decide who shall
          be granted a right of audience as prosecutor in a given case.  We
          do not accept that argument&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[66] In rejecting that argument, the court cited the well-known
words of Ritchie J. in  Doyle v. The Queen (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d)
177 at 181, where he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;[T]he powers and functions of a Magistrate acting under the
          Criminal Code are circumscribed by the provisions of that statute
          and must be found to have been thereby conferred either expressly
          or by necessary implication.</pre>
    <pre>[67] Doyle was not concerned with the powers of a trial judge,
but rather with the powers of a magistrate or a justice prior to
trial.  Furthermore, the broad language used by Ritchie J. in the
above-quoted passage has been circumscribed in subsequent cases,
which have recognized that all criminal trial courts have the
power to control their own processes in ways that are not
provided for by statute:  R. v. Jewitt, supra;  Canadian
Broadcasting Company v. New Brunswick (Attorney General), supra.
[68] In our view, the real ratio in Mahar appears in the
paragraph preceding that quoted above.  Morgan J.A. for the court
said at p. 478:
          </pre>
    <pre>                       The decision of this court in Hart [(1986), 26
          C.C.C. (3d) 438] is, of course, binding on all Provincial Court
          judges and it is not open to them to determine whether the
          granting of the right of audience to a police officer, properly
          appointed as agent of the Attorney-General to act as prosecutor
          in a summary conviction matter, is constitutional or not.</pre>
    <pre>[69] It would seem that the Newfoundland Court of Appeal felt the
need to remind provincial court judges that they were bound by
decisions of the Court of Appeal and that they had no &#147;inherent
jurisdiction&#148; to adopt procedures inconsistent with those
decisions.
[70] The second decision, Re Milligan (1991), 1 C.P.C. (3d) 12
(Ont. Gen. Div.), arises out of unusual circumstances.  A judge
of the Provincial Division refused to proceed with a trial as
long as Mr. Milligan appeared for the Crown.  The judge took this
position because, in his view, Mr. Milligan had made improper
comments before another judge concerning a ruling the Provincial
Court judge had made in another case.
[71] In deciding that the court could not bar Mr. Milligan, Dilks
J. said at p. 15:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The inherent right of a trial judge to control his own court
          process does not carry with it the right to choose which counsel
          are to appear before him.  He must take them as they come;  the
          good with the bad;  the competent with the incompetent;  the
          articulate with the inarticulate;  the polite with the impolite;
          the succinct with the prolix.  The luxury of picking and choosing
          is not his to enjoy.</pre>
    <pre>[72] Re Milligan involved counsel and not an agent who was not a
lawyer.  The court&#146;s power to deny audience to a lawyer raises
different considerations from those raised in this case.  We do
not address that issue in these reasons, but should not be taken
as agreeing with Dilk J.&#146;s observation that trial judges are
powerless to prevent representation by incompetent counsel.
[73] The power to refuse audience to an agent must be invoked
whenever it is necessary to do so to protect the proper
administration of justice.  The proper administration of justice
requires that the accused&#146;s constitutional rights, particularly
the right to a fair trial, be protected.  It also requires the
fair treatment of other participants in the process (eg.
witnesses) and that the proceedings be conducted in a manner that
will command the respect of the community.
[74] It is impossible to catalogue all of the circumstances in
which representation by a particular agent would imperil the
administration of justice and properly call for an order
disqualifying that agent.  Obviously, representation by agents
lacking the ability to competently represent an accused endangers
all aspects of the proper administration of justice, particularly
the accused&#146;s right to a fair trial.  Other examples where the
administration of justice would suffer irreparable harm if an
agent were allowed to appear are found in the material filed on
this appeal.  They include representation by an agent facing
criminal charges involving interference with the administration
of justice and representation by an agent whose background
demonstrates pervasive dishonesty or a blatant disrespect for the
law.  Representation by persons who have convictions for crimes
of dishonesty or who have otherwise demonstrated a lack of good
character can only bring the administration of justice into
disrepute in the eyes of reasonable members of the public.  This
is so even if those agents have the requisite forensic ability.
We emphasize, however, that we do not suggest that a criminal
record or some discreditable conduct automatically disqualifies
someone from representing an accused.  We are referring to
situations in which the agent&#146;s criminal record or other
discreditable acts are such as to permit the conclusion that the
agent cannot be relied on to conduct a trial ethically and
honourably.
[75] In addition to the cases where the agent&#146;s ability or
character would disqualify the agent from acting, there may be
other situations where disqualification is appropriate.
Representation by an agent who has a conflict of interest, for
example, where the agent has a special relationship with the
complainant or other witness, could well interfere with the
proper administration of justice.  An accused should not be
represented by a relative of the complainant in a sexual assault
case, or by a person who is charged in a separate information
with an offence against that complainant.  Similarly,
representation by an agent who has demonstrated an intention not
to be bound by the rules and procedures governing criminal trials
would also be inconsistent with the proper administration of
justice.
[76] These are only examples of circumstances which could result
in an order disqualifying an agent.  They are provided to
demonstrate that disqualification is justified only where
representation would clearly be inconsistent with the proper
administration of justice.  It is not enough that the trial judge
believes that the accused would be better off with other
representation or that the process would operate more smoothly
and effectively if the accused were represented by someone else.
Disqualification of an accused&#146;s chosen representative is a
serious matter and is warranted only where it is necessary to
protect the proper administration of justice.
[77] The power to disqualify agents, like any other facet of the
court&#146;s power to control its processes, must be exercised
judicially on the basis of the circumstances present in a given
case.  Those circumstances may include the seriousness of the
charge and the complexity of the issues raised in a particular
case.  A presumption, however, that all agents are incompetent to
represent accused persons charged with certain summary conviction
offences is not a proper basis on which to exercise that
discretion.  Trial judges are not at liberty, as we are told at
least one Provincial Division judge does, to adopt a rule that no
agents can appear on criminal matters.  That approach is
arbitrary and contrary to the Criminal Code.  Judges cannot
ignore the letter of the law while purporting to control the
process of the court so as to maintain the rule of law and the
integrity of the proceedings.
[78] Where there is a concern that a particular agent should not
act for an accused in a given case, it should be raised with the
court before trial.  Crown counsel may raise that concern or
third parties (eg. the Law Society of Upper Canada) may be given
leave by the trial judge to raise the issue.  The trial judge may
also raise the question of the propriety of the agent appearing,
although he or she should only do so based on some specific
concern referable to the particular agent and not on a general
disapproval of the law permitting agents to appear for accused in
summary conviction proceedings.
[79] When the issue is raised, the grounds for the potential
disqualification of the agent should be clearly articulated.  The
trial judge should first decide whether those grounds provide any
basis upon which to disqualify the agent.  If satisfied that they
do, the trial judge should then conduct an inquiry in which all
interested parties are given a full opportunity to present their
positions on the issue. Although the rules of evidence would not
necessarily apply to this inquiry, the dictates of procedural
fairness must.
[80] If the trial judge is satisfied that representation by the
agent would interfere with the proper administration of justice
the agent must be disqualified.  We stress that the trial judge
must be able to make that finding. Judicial unease about
representation by a particular agent will not suffice.  The
accused&#146;s right to choose representation by an agent must be
respected unless that choice is clearly incompatible with the
proper administration of justice.
[81] Despite the best efforts of all involved, there will be
cases where the basis for a motion to disqualify does not become
apparent until the proceedings are underway.   If the trial judge
is satisfied that proper grounds for the inquiry exist, he or she
must interrupt the trial and proceed with the necessary inquiry.
A decision to disqualify the agent will, in many cases, produce a
mistrial.
[82] The inquiry directed by these reasons may be a cumbersome
one.  At the minimum, it will prolong the proceedings and, given
the reality of scheduling in summary conviction courts, result in
the adjournment of other trials.  We take some comfort in the
fact that other tribunals which have the statutory power to make
the kind of inquiries we anticipate do not appear to have
encountered significant problems.
[83] The inquiry we have set out carries with it the risks
inherent in the mandatory competence inquiry discussed earlier in
these reasons.  Our holding that there is no obligation to
conduct a competence hearing in every case seems somewhat in
conflict with our holding that a trial judge must in appropriate
cases inquire into the competence of an agent.  We acknowledge
the inconsistency.  In our view, the different conclusions are
justified because a mandatory competence inquiry strikes more
directly at the accused&#146;s right to control his own defence
whereas an inquiry arising from specific circumstances can be
seen more as a legitimate defence of the integrity of the
process.
[84] Despite the difficulties associated with the inquiry we have
described, we see no alternative given the need to honour both
the accused&#146;s right to choose his or her mode of representation
and the obligation to protect the fairness and integrity of the
trial proceedings.  The trial court cannot be powerless to
prevent representation by an agent where that representation
would destroy the fairness of the trial or otherwise bring the
administration of justice into disrepute. Surely, an accused&#146;s
right to choose to be represented by an agent does not compel
trial judges to preside over travesties and leave them helpless
to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion
</pre>
    <pre>[85] In answer to the five issues posed at the outset of these
reasons, we conclude:

</pre>
    <pre>  ¨    Sections 800 and 802 of the Criminal Code are intra vires
     Parliament.
  </pre>
    <pre>  *    Sections 800 and 802 permit agents who are not lawyers to
     represent accused in summary criminal proceedings brought under
     Part XXVII of the Code.
  </pre>
    <pre>  *    There is no constitutional right to effective representation
     where an accused chooses to be represented by an agent who is not
     a lawyer.  The accused does, however, retain the constitutional
     right to a fair trial.
  </pre>
    <pre>  *    Where an accused is represented by an agent who is not a
     lawyer, the trial judge should satisfy herself that the accused's
     choice of representation was an informed one.  However, there is
     no mandatory obligation on a trial judge to conduct a competency
     inquiry where an agent represents an accused in summary
     conviction proceedings.
  </pre>
    <pre>  *    A trial judge has authority to refuse to permit an agent to
     represent an accused in summary conviction proceedings where the
     appearance of the agent would undermine the integrity of the
     proceedings.  Indeed, the trial judge's authority to disqualify
     an agent must be invoked whenever it is necessary to do so to
     protect the proper administration of justice.
</pre>
    <pre>[86] Applying these conclusions to the appellant's case, we agree
with Hill J.'s conclusion that the trial judge properly satisfied
himself that the appellant's decision to be represented by an
agent was an informed one.  We also find that the agent's
performance in this case did not compromise the appellant's right
to a fair trial and conclude that the evidence does not suggest
that the agent's conduct of the trial was such that the trial
judge was required to act on his authority to disqualify the
agent.  There was no evidence whatsoever of discreditable conduct
on the part of the agent such as would warrant a competency
inquiry.
</pre>
    <pre>[87] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>A closing word</pre>
    <pre>[88] A person who decides to sell t-shirts on the sidewalk needs
a licence and is subject to government regulation.  That same
person can, however, without any form of government regulation,
represent a person in a complicated criminal case where that
person may be sentenced to up to 18 months imprisonment.
Unregulated representation by agents who are not required to have
any particular training or ability in complex and difficult
criminal proceedings where a person's liberty and livelihood are
at stake invites miscarriages of justice.  Nor are de facto
attempts to regulate the appearance of agents on a case-by-case
basis likely to prevent miscarriages of justice.
[89] Some 13 years ago in R. v. Lawrie and Pointts Ltd., supra,
at p. 366, this court indicated that legislative attention to the
status of agents and other paralegals appearing on behalf of
accused persons was a matter of importance.  The government of
the day commissioned a report and draft legislation followed.
Unfortunately, however, no legislation was enacted.  Since that
time other courts have echoed the same concerns.  Indeed, as the
jurisdiction of the summary conviction court has expanded, the
concern has increased.  The matter has been thoroughly studied,
debated and various options set out.  Continued legislative
inaction suggests indifference to the proper administration of
criminal justice in summary conviction proceedings.  The cynics
among us will suggest that only some serious and highly
publicized miscarriage of justice will overcome that
indifference.  We hope not.
