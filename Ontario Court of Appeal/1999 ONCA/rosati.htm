    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            IN THE MATTER OF THE BANKRUPTCY OF GUISEPPE
               ROSATI, of the City of Stoney Creek, in the
               Regional Municipality of Hamilton-Wentworth,
               Province of Ontario, Realtor
               </pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        ROSENBERG, FELDMAN and MacPHERSON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Melvyn L. Solmon,
               for the appellant, Guiseppe Rosati
                              </pre>
    <pre>               Adam Bobker,

    <pre>HEARD:         December 1, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the Order of Mr. Justice S. N. Lederman dated
June 3, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                    ENDORSEMENT
                              </pre>
    <pre>[1]   We see no merit to this appeal.  Although Lederman J.
gave no  reasons  on the issue of the right to exercise his
discretion under  s.  172(1)  of  the  Bankruptcy and
Insolvency  Act,  the argument was made to him by counsel.
The fact that he elected to exercise  this  discretion  and
impose  a  conditional  discharge demonstrates  that  he was
satisfied that the opposition  of  the creditor was not a
sham.  The number of creditors and the amounts of  the
debts owed by the bankrupt substantiate that conclusion.
Accordingly, Lederman J. was entitled to exercise his
discretion under s. 172(1).
[2]  Further, while he referred only to the gross income we
see no reason to doubt that Lederman J. took into account
the bankrupt's expenses and his net income.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $2,000
payable to the respondent by the Trustee out of the $10,000
which is to be paid to the Trustee by Mr. Rosati.
