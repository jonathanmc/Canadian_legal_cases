    <pre>[1]  The evidence in reply was for purposes of clarification.  In
our view, the respondents did not improperly split their case and
the trial judge made no error in the exercise of his discretion.
[2]  There was an evidentiary foundation for the conclusion
reached by the trial judge that the appellant, Clarfield, failed
to disclose several significant pieces of information that were
material to the respondents&#146; decision to invest.  Based on the
record, we see no reason to interfere with these findings of fact
nor with the strong credibility findings he made in the
respondents&#146; favour.
[3]  There was, moreover, evidence available to the trial judge
to conclude that the respondents&#146; loss was sufficiently proximate
to the appellant&#146;s breaches of duty, to entitle them to the
amounts awarded.
[4]  Given the late stage at which the election issue arose, we
see no merit in the fourth ground set out in the notice of
appeal, namely, that the trial judge erred in awarding judgment
against the appellant Clarfield.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
