    <pre>HEARD:         July 22, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Gibson J. dated December 31, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Jones, Gable and Company Limited, appeals the
finding of liability on three grounds:
          </pre>
    <pre>    1.    the finding is contrary to the admission made by
          the plaintiff in paragraph 6 of her statement of claim;
          </pre>
    <pre>    2.    the finding of negligence or  lack of  authority to deliver
          the  cheque  to Hunter  was not pleaded in the statement
          of claim;
          </pre>
    <pre>    3.   the finding was unreasonable.
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We see no merit in any of these grounds of appeal.  On the
first ground, we do not read paragraph 6 as a clear admission.
Moreover, Jones, Gable denied the admission in its statement of
defence and in the light of its denial, we doubt it was entitled
to rely on that paragraph of the plaintiff&#146;s pleading.  Most
important, the entire trial was conducted on the basis that
Jones, Gable&#146;s authority to release the cheque to Hunter was a
live issue.  Only when the trial was nearly over did Jones, Gable
assert its reliance on paragraph 6.  This paragraph was never put
to the plaintiff in cross-examination.  To now give effect to
this ground of appeal would be unfairly prejudicial to her.  On
the other hand, Jones, Gable was not prejudiced by the
plaintiff&#146;s pleading because it conducted its defence on the
basis authorization was in issue.
[3]  The second ground of appeal was not raised at trial and had
it been, the trial judge might well have permitted an amendment
to the statement of claim.  Jones, Gable&#146;s conduct was a
substantial issue at trial and it cannot now demonstrate that it
was prejudiced by the plaintiff&#146;s failure to expressly plead
negligence or lack of authority.
[4]  On the third ground, we think that the trial judge&#146;s finding
was reasonably supported by the evidence.  We appreciate that
some aspects of the trial, including the long delay in the
delivery of reasons, were unfortunate and that the facts
underlying the claim were somewhat unusual.  Nonetheless, it was
open to the trial judge to accept the plaintiff&#146;s evidence and to
reject that of the representatives of Jones, Gable.   Accordingly
we are not persuaded that the finding of liability was
unreasonable.  Jones, Gable&#146;s appeal against the plaintiff is
therefore dismissed with costs.
[5]  Jones, Gable also appeals the Sanderson order in favour of
the banks.  The trial judge concluded that the plaintiff acted
reasonably in suing the banks.  He also noted that Jones, Gable
reneged on an agreement with the banks that would have made their
presence at the trial unnecessary.  We are not persuaded that the
trial judge&#146;s conclusion was unreasonable.  Therefore, we decline
to interfere with the Sanderson order.  The banks are entitled to
their costs of the appeal against Jones, Gable.
[6]  Hunter also appeals the finding of liability against him.
Again, the trial judge made a finding of fact that Hunter had no
authority to pick up the cheque.  In the light of the plaintiff&#146;s
evidence, which the trial judge accepted, and Hunter&#146;s failure to
testify, from which, in this case, the trial judge was entitled
to draw an adverse inference, this finding of fact was reasonably
supported by the record .  Accordingly Hunter&#146;s appeal is
dismissed with costs.
