    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On December 7, 1994, a jury found the appellant guilty of
conspiracy to traffic in marihuana.  On December 19, 1994 he was
sentenced to 18 years imprisonment to be served consecutive to a
13 year sentence he was then serving imposed in June, 1989, as
reduced by this court.  We were advised by counsel that this was,
effectively, a 31 year sentence with an expiration date of May
19, 2020.

[2]  The appellant has appealed his conviction and has applied
for leave to appeal against sentence and, if leave be granted,
appeals against the sentence.

[3]  From the materials before us, we are satisfied that it is
impossible to obtain a transcript of the trial proceedings, in
particular, the instructions delivered by the trial judge to the
jury.  Most of the appellant’s grounds for appeal from his
conviction relate to purported errors in the jury charge.  With
respect to one of the errors – the failure to charge on the co-
conspirators exception to the hearsay rule – the trial judge
rejected requests by the Crown and the defence to include a
Carter charge in his instructions.  In this regard, counsel for
the respondent conceded that this amounted to a fatal non-
direction.

[4]  In R. v. Hayes (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 161, one of the issues
considered by the Supreme Court of Canada was the problem of
missing portions of the trial transcript.  The appellant, who had
been convicted of first degree murder, contended that the
inability to obtain a proper and full transcript of the trial
proceedings for an appeal comprises a miscarriage of justice
warranting a new trial.  Both the majority and the minority of
the Supreme Court agreed on the test to be applied where portions
of the trial transcript are missing.  On behalf of the majority,
L’Heureux-Dubé J. stated the test at 165:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A new trial need not be ordered for every gap in a
          transcript.  As a general rule, there must be a serious
          possibility that there was an error in the missing portion of the
          transcript, or that the omission deprived the appellant of a
          ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>For the minority, Sopinka J. stated the test at 170:</pre>
    <pre>                I agree that the correct approach is to
          consider  the effect of the gaps in  relation
          to  any  possible prejudice to an appellant’s
          ability  to appeal a conviction.  The central
          role which the charge to the jury assumes  in
          an   appeal  of  a  jury’s  verdict  must  be
          considered.  However, not every  gap  in  the
          transcript of a charge will justify  granting
          a  new trial.  As a general rule, a new trial
          will  only  be  ordered where there  is  some
          reason  to  believe that there  may  possibly
          have  been  an  error in the passage  of  the
          charge which was missing or that the omission
          otherwise may have deprived the appellant  of
          a ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>
[5]  In this appeal, virtually the entire transcript is
unavailable.  In the circumstances of this appeal, counsel for
the respondent conceded that the Hayes test for granting a new
trial has been met by the appellant.

[6]  Against this background, counsel for the appellant and the
respondent entered into negotiations and reached what was
described by counsel for the respondent as a just resolution of
the appeal that does not offend the administration of justice.
Essentially, what was presented to the court was a joint
submission.

[7]  As presented by Mr. Breen on behalf of the appellant, it was
proposed that the sentence be varied to seven years and five
months to commence on December 19, 1994 and to be served
concurrently with the 13 year sentence the appellant was serving
on the commencement date, to effect the result that each sentence
would expire on May 19, 2002, and that the appellant would
abandon his appeal against conviction.

[8]  In joining in this proposal, counsel for the respondent
acknowledged that the appellant has served a significant amount
of time in custody on other charges and has achieved success in
his rehabilitation as evidenced by the fact that he was granted
day parole on October 5, 1997, and full parole, on November 13,
1998.  As well, the appellant is currently employed as an
associate producer for the CBC and is a member of a reference
group which advises the Solicitor General of Canada on issues
relating to the Corrections and Conditional Release Act.  Counsel
for the respondent is satisfied, given the appellant’s
employment, current interests and the obvious community response,
all of which are outlined in the appellant’s affidavit, that he
is re-integrating himself into the community.

[9]  Although we commend counsel for their efforts in attempting
to resolve this appeal by way of their joint submission, which we
appreciate would result in putting an end to the prosecution of
the conspiracy charge, we do not think that it would be
appropriate for this court to give effect to the joint
submission.  We have no difficulty in accepting the position of
both counsel that the Hayes test has been met and that this is an
appropriate appeal in which to direct a new trial.  We do not,
however, think that it is appropriate for this court to engage in
a review of the sentence on the assumption that the conviction is
well-founded.  It is our view that should the Crown proceed with
a new trial, and if the appellant is convicted or pleads guilty,
the trial court will be the appropriate forum to impose the
appropriate punishment.

[10] In the result, the appeal from conviction is allowed, the
conviction is set aside, and a new trial is ordered.</pre></td>
