      <pre>HEARD:         October 1, 1999
</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from his conviction by The Honourable Judge L. Marshall
on February 20, 1998 and from the sentence imposed on May 12,
1998</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
      <pre>[1]   In  our  view, there must be a new trial  in  this  matter.
Prior to questioning the appellant on April 24, the police failed
to  inform him of the proposed subject-matter of the interview so
that  the appellant could make an informed decision as to whether
or  not  to  exercise his right to counsel.  See R.  v.  Sawatsky
(1997),  118 C.C.C. (3d) 17 (Ont. C.A.).  The statements obtained
as  a  result  of this violation were conscriptive evidence,  the
admission of which would affect the fairness of the trial.  Those
statements, therefore, should not have been admitted.</pre>
      <pre>[2]  As to the April 29th statements, the Crown properly concedes
that the trial judge erred in failing to find a violation of  the
appellant’s s.10(b) rights when the police failed to provide  the
appellant  with  an  opportunity to speak  to  his  lawyer.   The
statements  made  before  he spoke to  his  lawyer  were  clearly
obtained  as  a  result  of the violation and  should  have  been
excluded.</pre>
      <pre>[3]  We would leave it to the judge on the new trial to determine
whether the statements after the appellant spoke to his lawyer on
April  29th as well as the derivative evidence should be excluded
pursuant to s. 24(2) of the Charter.  We should also not be taken
as  expressing any opinion as to the voluntariness of  the  April
29th  statements  in  light  of what  appears  to  us  to  be  an
inducement by the officer.</pre>
      <pre>[4]   We  are  not  persuaded  that  the  trial  judge  erred  in
dismissing the motion under s. 11(b) of the Charter.   While  the
delay  in  completing the trial was unfortunate, the trial  judge
was  aware of the reasons for that delay and her decision is  not
unreasonable.</pre>
      <pre>[5]   Accordingly,  the appeal is allowed,  the  convictions  for
theft are quashed, and a new trial ordered.</pre>
