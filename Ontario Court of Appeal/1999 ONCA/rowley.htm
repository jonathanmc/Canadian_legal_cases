    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Langdon J. dated June
13, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants Rowley and Currie appeal their convictions
for breaking and entering and robbery.  They had been charged
also with attempted murder and were found guilty of the included
offence of attempting unlawfully to cause bodily harm.</pre>
    <pre>Brief overview of the facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Ruby Bible and Bruce Bible were robbed in their residence on
their farm late at night on November 9, 1995, or very early the
next morning.  Two men entered the residence, shot Ruby Bible in
the chest and took money from Bruce Bible.  The issue at trial
was the identity of the robbers.
[3]  Ms. Bible and Mr. Bible were unable to provide reliable
identification evidence. The trial judge described them as
simple, unsophisticated persons of borderline intelligence.  They
both had suffered a horrific experience.  In the words of the
trial judge: &#147;For reasons which were obvious to the court and
counsel, the identification testimony of Bruce Bible and Ruby
Bible is entitled to no weight at all&#148;.
[4]  The appellants were cousins to each other. They were
described by one of the witnesses (Kim Arbon) as being very
close, like brothers. The appellant Currie had been hired to do
some work for the Bibles and had brought Brian Rowley with him to
assist.  Brian Rowley was a cousin of both the appellant Currie
and the appellant Rowley.  The work was unsatisfactory according
to the Bibles and a dispute arose as to the appropriate payment.
While this dispute was more than a year old, it apparently
rankled with the appellant Currie.
[5]  Brian Rowley, a prosecution witness, had pleaded guilty to
involvement in the robbery as a party and testified that the
appellants were the principals.  Specifically, he claimed that
the appellants were the actual intruders who committed the
robbery and that he had driven them to and from the farm.  This
witness had perjured himself at the preliminary hearing and the
trial judge did not accept his evidence. The trial judge said of
him: &#147;In more than 20 years on the bench, I consider that Brian
Rowley is one of the most discreditable witnesses it has been my
misfortune to hear&#148;.
[6]  However, there was circumstantial evidence that Brian Rowley
and the two appellants had been together on the night of November
9 and that they were together very early the next morning.  A
firearms and tool mark examiner testified that two cartridges
found at the crime scene and an unfired cartridge found in the
appellant Rowley&#146;s truck, which he had been driving that night,
had, at some point, been ejected from the same gun.  The trial
judge concluded that the appellants and Brian Rowley had been
involved in the robbery but he could not determine which two of
the three were the intruders.  He convicted the appellants as
parties to the offences of break and enter and commit robbery and
as parties to the offence of attempting unlawfully to cause
bodily harm to Ruby Bible as an included offence to her attempted
murder.</pre>
    <pre>Issue</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellants&#146; principal position on this appeal was that
the factual basis upon which the trial judge founded liability
was speculative and that, therefore, the verdicts are
unreasonable.  It was submitted, more specifically, that what was
unreasonable was (1) the finding that the two appellants and
Brian Rowley were together at the time of the offences and were
therefore involved in the offences, (2) that the three of them
were involved in the offences and that two of them, the trial
judge could not say which, were the intruders in the Bible house
and (3) that the person who did not enter the house was guilty of
the offences as a party for standing by and having the pickup
truck available to secure the escape of the two intruders.</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[8]  While the appellants correctly point out that there was no
evidence that three people participated in the robbery by
entering the house, there was sufficient evidence that the two
appellants and Brian Rowley were together both immediately before
the commission of the offences, and immediately after, such that
the trial judge was entitled to conclude that the three remained
together for the duration of the evening. While the fact that the
appellants and Brian Rowley were together both immediately
before, and immediately after the robbery, does not lead,
inexorably, to the conclusion that they were together for the
robbery, it was reasonable for the trial judge to conclude, that
the threesome were together for the duration of the evening and
that they were all parties to the robbery.  I agree with the
Crown that the evidence establishes at least the following:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1)   The three were together in the afternoon of November 9th.
Roger Rowley, a younger brother of Brian Rowley, testified that
the three attended at his home, that Brian Rowley entered the
house and retrieved a .22 calibre rifle from under his parents&#146;
bed which he gave to Currie, and that the two accused engaged in
target practice.  They left the house together, in the appellant
Rowley&#146;s pick-up truck with two rifles and ammunition.
2)   The threesome attended at the Loretto Tavern that evening in
the appellant Rowley&#146;s pick-up truck.  While bartender Sandra
McLeod testified that Brian Rowley would have left the bar at
9:30, when those underage have to leave, the evidence of Brian
Rowley was that he remained in the bar.  Confirming this evidence
of Brian, was the evidence of his girl friend Jamie Lee Verner
that Brian telephoned her from the tavern at 10:30, as well as
the evidence of two underage patrons Tanya Knowlton and Megan
McGraw, who both testified that Brian was still there with the
appellants when they were asked to leave at 10:45.  The evidence
suggests that the threesome left the tavern between 10:30 and
11:45.
3)   Brian Rowley testified that after the robbery, he had driven
the appellants to Burger King in Orangeville and then to the
residence of Barbara Taylor, a sister of the appellant Rowley and
once again a cousin to Brian and Roger Rowley and the appellant
Currie.  She gave evidence that the three men arrived at
approximately 2:30 a.m. on the 10th.  Brian had also testified
that the appellant Rowley had vomited after leaving the Tavern
and before the robbery. The comments made by the appellant Rowley
on the evening of the 10th at the Taylor residence confirm much
of Brian Rowley&#146;s evidence.  Additionally, Kim Arbon, who
described herself as a close friend of both of the appellants,
testified that on the 10th, the appellant Rowley told her that he
and the appellant Currie had been at the Loretto Tavern with his
cousin Brian the previous night, and that Brian had driven them
to Burger King in Orangeville and then to his sister&#146;s home.  As
well, the appellant Rowley confirmed Brian Rowley&#146;s evidence with
respect to vomiting when he told Ms. Arbon that he had been sick
from too much alcohol.
4)   The evidence revealed that the only vehicle used by the
appellants and Brian Rowley in the afternoon before the offences,
and immediately following the offences to reach the Taylor
residence, was the appellant Rowley&#146;s pick-up truck.  Indeed,
there is no evidence that any of them had access to, or made use
of, any other vehicle at any point in time.  Given the distance
from the Loretto Tavern to the Bibles&#146; home, it was reasonable
for the trial judge to infer that if any of the threesome went to
the farm, the pick-up truck was the means used to get there.
Similarly, the fact that all of the members of the threesome
arrived at the Taylor home together in the truck, further
suggests that all three were with the truck for the course of the
evening.
5)   The evidence was also clear that the threesome remained
together on the day following the offences, during a time in
which there was some evidence that they burned the toques used in
the robbery and, in concert, disposed of the rifles and
ammunition in the Holland Marsh area.  The evidence of these
acts, in concert, is further circumstantial evidence of joint
enterprise the evening before.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[9]  Having determined that the appellants and Brian Rowley were
all present at the Bibles&#146; home, it was open to the trial judge
to conclude that the appellants could be convicted as parties to
the offences, notwithstanding that the trial judge was not
certain which individuals were the two who actually entered the
Bible home. Conversely, it was reasonable for the trial judge to
reject the defence suggestion that Brian Rowley had left the
Tavern without the appellants, perpetrated the robbery with some
other party, and then met up with the appellants again before
going to the residence of Barbara Taylor.
[10] The findings of the trial judge with respect to the roles of
the parties are important:

               It is not possible to find which two of
	  the three culprits actually entered the house
	  without relying on either or both of the 
	  identification testimony of Bruce Bible and 
	  Ruby Bible on the one hand and the testimony
	  of Brian Rowley on the other hand.  I cannot 
          rely on the Bibles&#146; testimony standing alone 
	  because of its inherent frailty.  I cannot
	  rely on Brian Rowley&#146;s testimony standing
	  alone because of his unprincipled dishonesty and
          unscrupulous character....

          Perhaps the non-intruder performed a much
          more active role.  He may have approached the
          residence; he may have shot the dog; he may
          have been sick outside the residence.  I have
          no way of knowing.  I accept that the non-
          intruder, at a minimum, did agree to take the
          pickup truck away and return with it to pick
          up the intruders....
         
	  I am left in this dilemma.  I am satisfied
          beyond a reasonable doubt that Stephen
          Currie, Brian Rowley and Robert Rowley
          attended at the Bible farm close to midnight;
          that a plan was hatched to rob the Bibles;
          that two of the three actually entered the
          residence and committed the atrocities which
          have been described and that the third
          assisted the intruders at least by seeing to
          it that the truck was available to help them
          make their escape.  I do not say that Brian
          Rowley is necessarily lying in how he
          ascribes the roles to the three culprits.  It
          seems probable in fact that events happened
          much as he testified at trial.   I do say
          that I simply cannot rely on his testimony to
          the point where it will stand alone as proof
          of important facts.

          Beyond a reasonable doubt I can say that two
          of the culprits are before me.  One of them
          was an intruder.  I cannot say with certainty
          which.  One of them was a party to the
          offence, at a minimum, by standing by and by
          agreeing to make sure and by making sure the
          pickup truck was available to secure the
          intruders&#146; escape.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[11] In my opinion, it made sense to conclude that all three
individuals, including the non-intruder, knew of, and
participated in, the plan to commit the robbery.  The three spent
the afternoon together, during which time they armed themselves
with two rifles and conducted target practice.  It is clear that
they were together at the Loretto Tavern until about an hour
before the robbery.  The evidence suggests that the three left
the Loretto Tavern at the same time.  The non-intruder would,
therefore, have been present in the pick-up truck during the
drive from the Loretto Tavern to the Bibles&#146; and would have been
present for any discussions planning the robbery.  There is no
evidence whatsoever that any of the three exited the pick-up
truck between the tavern and the Bible farm.  On arrival at the
Bibles&#146;, the non-intruder knew that the intruders were leaving
the truck with the rifles and toques, and had the opportunity to
permanently depart from the scene, either on foot or with the
truck.  Clearly the non-intruder decided not to avail himself of
this opportunity and, instead, chose to assist the intruders in
making their escape, by either driving the truck or, at a
minimum, ensuring that it remained available for the getaway.
The non-intruder then remained with the intruders throughout the
getaway, through the night, and into the next day.  In the
circumstances, it was entirely reasonable for the trial judge to
ascribe to the non-intruder, at a minimum, the participatory role
in the commission of the offences that he did.  There was
evidence upon which it was reasonable to conclude that the non-
intruder had acted in concert with the intruders and was,
therefore, a party to the offences.
[12] The legal argument that was raised by both appellants
related to the application of Regina v. Schell and Paquette
(1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 422 (Ont. C.A) and Regina v. Schell and
Paquette (No. 2) (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.).  These
two appeals relate to the same case. Schell and Paquette were
living together as man and wife.  They were both charged jointly
with murder as the result of the death of the female accused&#146;s
infant child.   They were tried before a jury and convicted of
manslaughter.  On the first appeal, a new trial was ordered, this
court ruling that there was non-direction amounting to
misdirection in the trial judge&#146;s failure to instruct the jury
that if they could not decide which of the accused killed the
child, then both must be acquitted.  The second trial resulted in
another conviction of both for manslaughter.  On appeal, the
charge to the jury was again found to be defective. Jessup J.A.
for the court, stated at p.194:

     It is quite clear from the jury&#146;s verdict in the way
     that it was given that they could not decide which of the two
     appellants inflicted the injury which caused the child&#146;s death,
     and the conviction of the accused therefore must have been under
     the application of s.21(2) [of the Code].  In our view the charge
     of the learned trial Judge with respect to that section was
     defective in particular in that he did not instruct the jury as
     to the findings of fact they would have to make in order to
     invoke that section to convict the appellants.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The problem in the two Schell and Paquette trials, as I see
it, was that both trial judges failed to give proper instructions
to the jury as to the possible guilt of the accused as parties
under s.21(2) of the Code.  The first trial judge ruled that
s.21(2) had no application despite the view of the appellate
court that there was evidence that the two accused had formed a
common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose (child abuse)
and to assist each other therein, and that each knew, or ought to
have known, that the unlawful infliction of bodily harm was a
probable consequence of carrying out that unlawful purpose.   As
indicated from the quotation above, the second trial judge failed
to adequately instruct the jury as to how they could apply the
subsection.  While acknowledging that yet a third trial was the
logical consequence of such misdirection, the court ruled that a
close inspection of the record showed that the evidence of a
common intention to abuse the child was so tenuous that a verdict
of guilty would be unreasonable.  The court therefore simply
quashed the convictions and directed verdicts of acquittal.
[14] Section 21(2) reads:

     (2)  Where two or more persons form an intention in common
     to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein
     and any one of  them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits
     an offence, each of  them who knew or ought to have known that
     the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence of
     carrying out the common purpose is a party to that offence.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The Crown relied upon Regina v. Wood (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d)
201 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 220-221; leave to appeal to the SCC denied
(1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) vi, as distinguishing  Schell and
Paquette, supra.  In Wood, the three Wood brothers were tried for
murder of one Karen Thomson.  It was the theory of the Crown that
they were guilty of first degree murder either as principals or
as aiders or abettors.  The three brothers were very close and it
was the theory of the Crown that they decided to kill Ms. Thomson
because she was to be a witness for the Crown in the upcoming
trial of Colin Wood for breaking and entering.  When she was
found she had been beaten to death.
[16] As in the case in appeal, there was no evidence to determine
the extent to which each individual participated in the violence
inflicted on the deceased.  In upholding the findings of guilt
against all three, this Court held that the case was
distinguishable from Regina v. Schell and Paquette, supra,
because here there was evidence that the brothers acted in
concert and pursuant to a common motive.  Griffith J.A. for the
court stated at p.220:

     In my view, the present case is distinguishable from
     Schell and Paquette, because here there was evidence that the
     Wood brothers acted in concert, pursuant to a common motive.
     Where evidence of concerted action in the commission of the
     offence exists, as in the present case, then it is open to a jury
     to convict all of the accused whether as principals, under s.
     229(a), or as aiders or abettors, pursuant to. 21 of the Code,
     even though the extent of the individual participation in the
     violence is unclear.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Having made the finding that all three participants were
parties to the conduct of the two participants who entered the
farm house, the trial judge was not prepared to find all three
guilty of attempted murder because as he put it &#147;I cannot find
that the Crown has proved the specific intent to kill against one
of the two accused&#148;.  He did find that both could be convicted as
parties to the included offence of attempting unlawfully to cause
bodily harm even accepting that one of them was a non-intruder.
As he put  it:

     It cannot be doubted that the culprit, who did not intrude
     into the house, saw and knew that the intruders were about to
     enter it carrying firearms and with intent to commit robbery.
     That person is fixed with the knowledge that attempting
     unlawfully to cause bodily harm would be a probable consequence
     of carrying out the common design.</pre>
    <pre>[18] No issue was taken with this specific finding on appeal, but
I think I should deal with it for the sake of completeness.  The
validity of a finding that attempting unlawfully to cause bodily
harm is an included offence in an indictment charging attempted
murder is premised on apt words of description importing it as an
included offence.  In this case, the indictment charged that the
appellants &#147;unlawfully did attempt to murder Ruby Bible by
shooting her&#148;.  In my opinion these words qualify for the
included offence as found by the trial judge.  This concept of
&#147;included offence&#148; was dealt with extensively by Martin J.A. in
R. v. Simpson No. 2 (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 122.  I paraphrase him
at p.133 where he stated that the decisions interpreting the
meaning of an &#147;included offence&#148; reflect two complementary
notions or principles.  First, an included offence is part of the
main offence.  The offence charged as described either in the
enactment creating the offence, or as charged in the count, must
contain the essential elements of the offence said to be
included.  The second operative principle is that the offence
charged, as described either in the enactment creating the
offence or as charged in the count, must be sufficient to inform
the accused of the included offences that he must meet.  The
words in the indictment in the case in appeal, &#147;did attempt to
murder Ruby Bible by shooting her&#148;, are sufficient to include
attempting to cause bodily harm and are sufficient to inform the
appellants of this included offence.  An attempt to murder by
shooting must include an attempt to commit bodily harm by
shooting.  Indeed, Martin J.A. commented in obiter at p.143 of
Simpson that it was &#147;difficult to think of any circumstances in
which a charge of attempted murder would not necessarily include
the offence of attempting to unlawfully cause bodily harm.&#148;
[19] There has been no attack made in this appeal upon the
accuracy of the self-instruction of the trial judge.  Rather, it
is said that his findings and conclusions with respect to the two
appellants being parties to the offences of which he convicted
them are unreasonable and with respect to the appellant Currie,
that he erred in his conclusions respecting motive and
consciousness of guilt.  I do not feel that I need deal with this
last point.  There is evidence to support these findings.
However, in addition to what I have said about the reasonableness
of the trial judge&#146;s findings, I cannot leave this case without
observing that the two appellants did not testify. I am entitled
to look at this fact in assessing the reasonableness of the
verdict: see R. v. Noble (1997), 146 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.)
and the judgement of Sopinka J. at pp.428-29.  In particular, I
adopt his quotation from Middleton J.A. in Steinberg v. The King
(1931), 56 C.C.C. 9 at p.36:

     The accused gave no evidence; and, while this cannot be
     commented upon to the jury, it is a factor that must be
     considered by the Appellate Court.  His failure to testify does
     not prove his guilt, but when the court is by the statute
     required to dismiss an appeal unless it is satisfied that there
     was a miscarriage of justice, the failure of the accused to
     explain in any way facts which place a very heavy onus upon him
     cannot be ignored.</pre>
    <pre>[20] In summary then, the trial judge had found that the two
appellants were two of the trio of participants in the breaking,
entry and robbery of the Bible household and the shooting of Ruby
Bible.  As he put it: &#147;Absolutely no doubt could possibly exist
on that issue&#148;.  That finding was very much available to the
trial judge on the evidence and he was equally entitled to find,
as he did, that the three participants had an intention in common
to carry out an unlawful purpose, namely the break and enter of
the Bible residence and the robbery of the Bibles, and to assist
each other therein.  Each knew or ought to have known that the
shooting of one or both of the two Bibles by the armed intruders
was a probable consequence of carrying out this common purpose.
[21] The thrust of the attack on the convictions in this court
was directed to the reasonableness of the primary finding that
the two appellants were two of the three participants.  As
previously noted, the appellants did not testify at trial.  In
assessing the reasonableness of the verdicts in appeal, this
court is entitled to treat their silence as indicating that they
could not provide an innocent explanation of their conduct on the
night in question: see R. v. Noble, supra, at p.429.
[22] Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, I would dismiss
the appeal.
