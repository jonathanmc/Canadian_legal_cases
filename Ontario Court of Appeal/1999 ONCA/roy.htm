    <pre>On appeal against a conditional sentence imposed by Stong J. on
May 25, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  Crown  appeals against a conditional sentence  imposed
upon  the  respondent after a conviction for sexual  assault  and
possession  of pornography. The victim was a young  boy  who  was
sexually  violated over a period extending between the age  of  7
and  12  years.  The  respondent, in his late thirties,  admitted
guilt  immediately  upon  arrest and  has  been  co-operative  in
treatment since that time. The sentencing procedure extended over
a  ten-month period with considerable attention to the  situation
of the respondent and his potential for rehabilitation. Dr. Bloom
was  of  the  view  that  he  is  not  a  pedophile  and  can  be
successfully treated outside of a prison without a real threat of
further offences. He recommended as part of the therapy that  the
respondent  write letters to newspapers speaking to  the  events,
his remorse, and indicating how victims can reach out.
[2]  The sentencing judge issued long and thoughtful reasons in
support of his decision to impose a conditional sentence of two
years less a day with terms including a requirement of writing
the proposed letters to the newspapers and performing 240 hours
of community service.
[3]  The sentencing judge, Dr. Bloom and counsel are to be
commended for the time, effort and concern expended to the end of
creating a packaged sentence which would best serve the
rehabilitation of the appellant. As has been said before, all of
society benefits from rehabilitation of an offender.
[4]  It is clear from the careful reasons of the sentencing judge
that he was very cautious in approaching a conditional sentence,
having regard to the seriousness of the crime, but in the end he
found it to be justified.
[5]  As much as we must and do respect the discretion exercised
by the trial judge and as much as we do not wish to diminish the
opportunity for full rehabilitation following Dr. Bloom&#146;s
direction, we must conclude that the circumstances surrounding
this crime make it one for which a conditional sentence is not
available.
[6]  There has been much debate in the jurisprudence as to
conditional sentencing for serious offences which attract a
sentence of two years less a day. That debate continues. There
can be no debate that a crime calling for a penitentiary sentence
does not come within the conditional sentencing regime. This is,
in our view, such a case.
[7]  We are dealing with an adult sexually abusing a young boy
over an extended period of time. That boy was particularly
vulnerable because he was previously being abused by a friend of
the appellant. The crime involved all of the grossest forms of
sexual abuse including some that are grotesquely novel, such as
urinating in the face. No one can know what impact this abuse
will have upon the life of the victim, but experience tells us it
will be significant. Repetitious abuse of this sort over a
lengthy period of time that is accepted consensually must become
ingrained as a form of moral value in the child. Who can doubt
that this will leave scars and have an impact upon him in other
ways for the rest of his life.
[8]  It is our conclusion that the sentencing judge fell into
error by failing to give adequate weight to the principles of
general deterrence and denunciation and by not assessing the
sentence in the penitentiary range and thus beyond the reach of a
conditional sentence.
[9]  In our view the proper sentence in this case is between
three and four years. He has served six and half months, has
written the letters to the newspapers which were a condition of
his sentence and has completed most of his community service, as
ordered. Also, he will not obtain parole recognition for time
served to this date.
[10] He should therefore be given more than even credit for time
served on the conditional sentence and we would replace that
sentence with one of imprisonment for two years less a day from
this date forward and two years&#146; probation thereafter on the same
terms imposed by the sentencing judge. This will keep him in the
provincial institution and we recommend that every effort be made
to continue the current counselling and treatment that appears to
be meeting with some success.
[11] The appeal is allowed, the sentence is set aside and in its
place a sentence imposed on the terms set out in these reasons.
