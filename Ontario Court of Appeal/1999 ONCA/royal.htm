</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal from the judgment of C.B. Noble J. dated September 11, 1998

</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The question on this appeal is whether the respondent Royal
Tire Service Ltd. (&#147;Royal Tire&#148;) can enforce its non-possessory
lien on trailer equipment, registered under the Repair and
Storage Liens Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.25 (&#147;RSLA&#148;), in priority to
the security interest of the appellant Little Bros. Leasing
Limited (&#147;Little Bros.&#148;) in the same equipment, registered under
the Personal Property Security Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.10
(&#147;PPSA&#148;).  On an application by Royal Tire under the RSLA, Noble
J. determined that Royal Tire&#146;s lien could be enforced in
priority to Little Bros.&#146; security interest and granted judgment
against the latter in the amount of $29,371.00 for monies owing
to Royal Tire for repairs made to the equipment. Little Bros.
appeals from this judgment.
[2]  In our view, the appeal must be allowed. The question
essentially turns on the interpretation of the relevant
provisions of the RSLA  and its application to the facts of this
case. Pursuant to the terms of the RSLA, Royal Tire&#146;s non-
possessory lien has priority over Little Bros.&#146; security
interest. However, the issue is not just one of priority but also
of enforceability. Under the provisions of the RSLA, a non-
possessory lien is enforceable against third parties only if the
claim for lien has been registered. In this case, the claim for
lien was not registered until after Little Bros.  had seized the
equipment and sold it pursuant to the terms of its security
interest. Hence, by the time Royal Tire&#146;s lien became
enforceable, Little Bros. no longer had any interest in the
equipment. Since the lien is not enforceable against the proceeds
of disposition, the judgment must be set aside.
[3]  The following facts are relevant  for the determination of
this appeal.
     </pre>
    <pre>(a) July 4, 1996 - Little Bros., owner of the trailer equipment in issue,
    registered a financing statement describingits security interest in
    the equipment which it had leased to Shelleby Transportation Limited.
(b) On the same date, Little Bros. entered into a repurchase agreement
    with the manufacturer of the equipment, Thru-Way Trailer Centre
    Limited, in which Thru-Way agreed to re-purchase the equipment from
    Little Bros. ninety days after default by Shelleby under the terms
    of the lease.
(c) April 1997 &#150;Royal Tire repaired the equipment for Shelleby, supplying
    both parts and labour.  Shelleby provided a	signed acknowledgment of
    its indebtedness for the repairs.  Royal Tire returned the equipment
    to Shelleby without being paid.
(d) June 25, 1997 &#150; Shelleby defaulted in making payments to Little Bros.
    under its lease.
(e) October 2, 1997 &#150; Little Bros., acting under its security agreement,
    seized the equipment which was then	repurchased by Thru-Way pursuant
    to the provisions of the repurchase agreement.
(f) November 6, 1997 &#150; Royal Tire registered a claim for a non-possessory
    lien under the RSLA in the amount of $29,371, being the amount owing
    for the repairs it performed in April 1997.
(g) April 1998 &#150; Thru-Way directed that the equipment be removed from 
    storage for purposes of sale.
(h) The equipment consists of trailers which are not motor vehicles for
    the purposes of the RSLA.</pre>
    <pre>[4]       Before considering the relevant provisions of the RSLA,
it is necessary to dispose of a factual issue raised by Royal
Tire. Royal Tire took the position on the appeal that the
trailers were not repurchased by Thru-Way on October 2, 1997, but
continued to be owned by Little Bros. until they were ultimately
sold to a third party in April, 1998. This issue is of importance
because, if this position is correct, Little Bros. would still
have had an interest in the equipment at the time Royal Tire
registered its claim for lien. This fact would in turn become
material in the determination of the issue of enforceability. In
support of its position, Royal Tire relies on the evidence in the
record.
[5]  The evidence on the application from which this appeal is
taken was by affidavits filed by both sides and upon which there
was no cross-examination. The only evidence on the question of
repurchase by Thru-Way is paragraph 12 of the affidavit of Chris
Ford, the lease marketing manager of Little Bros. dated June 16,
1998 which states:
          </pre>
    <pre>        12. At the time the trailers were seized at the request of
        Little Bros., the trailers were sold back to Thru-Way, pursuant
        to the provisions of a repurchase agreement between Thru-Way and
        Little Bros., and Thru-Way is now attempting to dispose of the
        trailers on its own behalf.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The applications judge did not deal with this issue, but
made the following finding in his brief reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>          On October 2, 1997 the trailers were seized on behalf of
          Little and ultimately sold in April, 1998.
                  </pre>
    <pre>[7]  It is our view that, in the face of the uncontradicted
evidence, it is not open for Royal Tire  to take the position
that the repurchase did not occur at the time the trailers were
seized on October 2, 1997, or that the court should &#147;look
through&#148; the original repurchase agreement as either a sham or as
otherwise ineffective for the purposes of the RSLA.
[8]   Royal Tire also argues that, by virtue of the PPSA, any
repurchase by Thru-Way does not constitute a disposition of the
trailer equipment and hence cannot affect its rights as against
Little Bros. Counsel relied on s. 63(11) of the PPSA which
provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                63. (11)   A person who is liable to a
          secured party under a guarantee, endorsement,
          covenant, repurchase agreement or the like,
          and who receives a transfer of collateral
          from the secured party or is subrogated to
          the secured party&#146;s rights has thereafter the
          rights and duties of the secured party, and
          such a transfer of collateral is not a
          disposition of the collateral. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[9]       Royal Tire&#146;s position is that, because a transfer under
a repurchase agreement is not a disposition under this section,
the transfer was  ineffective to transfer the interest of Little
Bros. in the equipment  to Thru-Way under the repurchase
agreement. There is no merit to this argument. Section 63 of the
PPSA deals with disposal by secured parties of collateral for
realisation purposes. By s. 63(8), &#147;where collateral is disposed
of in accordance with this section&#148; the effect of the disposition
under the PPSA is to discharge the security interest of the
secured party, and if the disposition is to a buyer in good faith
for value, then there is also a discharge of subordinate security
interests and of the interest of the debtor in the collateral.
Assuming without deciding that s. 63(11) applies in this case,
the effect of the transfer from Little Bros to Thru-Way under the
repurchase agreement is to transfer to Thru-Way, Little Bros.&#146;
rights and duties under the PPSA. It is only for that purpose
that the security interest of Little Bros. is not discharged.
However, Little Bros. itself retains no interest in the
collateral. It was fully paid on the repurchase.
[10] The remaining issue on this appeal is whether Royal Tire was
entitled to enforce its lien, once registered, on November 6,
1997, against the equipment in priority to the interest of Little
Bros., in the face of the fact that Little Bros. had seized and
sold the equipment under its security agreement on October 2, 1997.
[11] As indicated earlier, it is our view that the answer is no.
In order to determine this question, it is useful first to
consider the question of priority and then the question of
enforceability.
[12] Pursuant to s.3(2) of the RSLA, a repairer&#146;s lien arises and
takes effect when the repair is commenced. In this case, the lien
arose sometime in April 1997. Section 7(3) of the RSLA then
provides that:
          </pre>
    <pre>            A non-possessory lien has priority over the interest in the
          article of any other person other than a lien claimant who is
          claiming a lien under Part I, [Possessory Liens]&#133;</pre>
    <pre>The priority created by this section does not depend on
registration of the lien. By virtue of this section, Royal Tire&#146;s
non-possessory lien has priority over Little Bros.&#146;s security
interest.
[13] Section 10(1) provides an exception to the priority created
in s. 7(3) and the question becomes whether Little Bros. falls
within this exception. The relevant part of s.10(1) reads as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; where a person acquires a right against an article after a
        non-possessory lien arises, the right of the person has priority
        over the non-possessory lien of the lien claimant if a claim for
        lien was not registered before the person acquired the right.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Little Bros. acquired its right against the equipment, to
seize and sell in the event of default, by the security agreement
that was registered on July 4, 1996.  This was before the non-
possessory lien of Royal Tire arose in April 1997.  As a result,
Little Bros. does not come within the exception provided in s.
10(1).  We are therefore of the view that Royal Tire&#146;s non-
possessory lien, when it arose, had priority over Little Bros.&#146;s
existing security interest.
[15] However, the fact that a non-possessory lien has priority
over the interests of others in the same article does not in
itself entitle the lien claimant to enforce the lien.  The RSLA
deals with the priority of non-possessory liens and the
enforcement of  non-possessory liens as separate matters.
[16] The applications judge considered s.7(5) which provides
that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (5) A non-possessory lien is enforceable only if the lien
          claimant obtains a signed acknowledgment of the indebtedness
          which acknowledgment may be on an invoice or other statement of
          account.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Little Bros. argued that this section requires that the
acknowledgment be signed by the owner of the articles. We do not
agree. Subsection 7(6) contemplates a possible dispute by the
owner of the amount acknowledged in the acknowledgment of
indebtedness. It is clear that people other than the owner will
have legal possession of articles, will bring them in for repair
or storage, and will sign the acknowledgment when they pick them
up. The applications judge was therefore correct in finding that
the requirements of s.7(5) had been complied with.
[18] However, the applications judge failed to consider that, in
addition, s. 10(1) (a different part of s. 10(1) than that quoted
above) provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>        10. (1)  A non-possessory lien is enforceable against third
        parties only if a claim for lien has been registered &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[19] The third parties referred to in the section are persons
other than those to whom the lien claimant gave up possession of
the goods without having been paid (i.e. in this case, other than
Shelleby). In this case, Little Bros. was such a third party as
long as it retained any interest in the trailers at the time the
lien became enforceable by registration. However, in this case,
Little Bros. no longer retained any interest in the trailers by
November 6, 1997 as they had been repurchased by that time by
Thru-Way.
[20] A non-possessory lien is enforceable only against the
subject articles: s.14. There is no provision in the RSLA for a
lien against proceeds of disposition, subject to any agreement
otherwise by the parties, or if a court orders otherwise. (See
for example, s. 12(1)(c) of the RSLA).
[21] Following the hearing, this court requested written
submissions on the possible application of s.12(1)(f) of the
RSLA. That section provides:
     </pre>
    <pre>          12(1) A non-possessory lien is discharged and
          cannot be revived as an interest in the
          article,
               </pre>
    <pre>               (f) if the article is a motor vehicle,
               upon a change of ownership of the
               vehicle if a claim for lien was not
               registered before the change of
               ownership occurred.</pre>
    <pre>Had the trailers been motor vehicles, then under s. 12(1)(f) of
the RSLA, the lien would have been discharged by the change of
ownership from Little Bros. to Thru-Way prior to the registration
of the claim for lien. We are satisfied on the basis of counsel&#146;s
submissions that the trailers in question in this case are not
motor vehicles and that, therefore, the lien was not discharged
pursuant to s.12(1)(f).
[22] Finally, it is noted that Thru-Way was made a party to this
application and the applications judge invited the parties to
present further submissions if they wished to proceed against
Thru-Way. As the appeal did not involve Thru-Way, we make no
findings with respect to the enforceability of the lien as
against Thru-Way.</pre>
    <pre>  CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[23] The appeal is allowed, the order below is set aside, and the
application is dismissed with costs here and below.</pre></td>
