    <pre>HEARD:         October 21, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice K.M. Gibson, dated
April 29, 1996 at Toronto, Ontario.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This litigation concerns a theft at 670 Industrial Road  in
London during the night of November 3, 1990.  The respondent  had
recently  taken  control  of this site, having  realized  on  its
security over its debtor, DCR. The issues before the trial  judge
were  whether  the  policy  of  insurance  with  the  Continental
Insurance Company covered 670 Industrial Road and if not  whether
the  appellant  Kirkwood Roussy Insurance  Inc.  had  negligently
misrepresented  that  there  was  coverage.   The   trial   judge
concluded  that Continental&#146;s policy did not cover 670 Industrial
Road  but that the appellant negligently misrepresented the  site
was   covered   and   that   the   respondent   relied   on   the
misrepresentation.  The trial judge awarded damages in the agreed
amount of $51,945.50.</pre>
    <pre>[2]   Following oral argument, the Court suggested to the parties
that the true resolution of this litigation might be founded on a
letter dated October 24, 1990 from the appellant Kirkwood to  the
respondent.   That  letter might be read as a commitment  of  the
insurer through an agent having ostensible authority.

[3]  Written submissions were filed on that issue and, having
reviewed them, we are satisfied that a finding of ostensible
authority should not be made at this time on the limited evidence
introduced at trial.  The issue was not squarely dealt with at
trial and the respondent would be prejudiced by making this an
issue on appeal with an incomplete evidentiary base.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge&#146;s findings on the issues before him are
summarized in his reasons as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               While it appears that the broker honestly felt there was
          coverage, in my view in law there was not, and the circumstances
          are such that the representations (written and oral) by Ms.
          Waxman and Kirkwood, on behalf of Kirkwood, Roussy Insurance Inc.
          were negligent misrepresentations which caused damage and loss to
          the plaintiff.  There was a duty owed by it to the plaintiff in
          view of the relationship involving RoyNat with DCR, and Kirkwood,
          Roussy Insurance as the DCR broker.  The representation as to
          coverage was incorrect and misleading, RoyNat relied on these
          misrepresentations (which were known to Kirkwood, Roussy
          Insurance) and sustained damage.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   These findings are fully supported by the evidence  and  we
see  no basis for interference.  On the renewal of the policy for
1990-91 the respondent&#146;s insurance offices wrote to the appellant
to  confirm  that coverage would continue to apply to  the  three
sites where DCR had carried on business, that had been taken over
by  the  respondent, including 670 Industrial Road.  Mr. Kirkwood
on behalf of the appellant wrote (in his October 24, 1990 letter)
that &#147;the 670 Industrial Road location is also extended from  the
property  policy &#133;&#148;  Continental was unaware that 670  Industrial
Road  was  included in the policy and there was no evidence  that
the  appellant  had  authority  to write  endorsements  extending
coverage  to  undisclosed locations.  Nonetheless the  respondent
relied on the appellant&#146;s misrepresentation and therefore did not
place  coverage  on the Industrial Road location  under  its  own
policy.  For these reasons the appeal must fail.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</pre>
