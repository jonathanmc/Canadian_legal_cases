    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On March 13, 1995, the appellant commenced a trial before
the Honourable Mr. Justice H. Locke of the Ontario Court (General
Division) sitting with a jury at Toronto on an indictment
charging that he:

               Count #1:
               on or about the 18th day of June in the
          year 1994, at the Municipality of
          Metropolitan Toronto, did break and enter a
          certain place, to wit: a dwelling house
          situate at 100 Goodwood Park Court, Apartment
          #216 and did commit therein an indictable
          offence, contrary to the Criminal Code.
               Count #2:
               from and including the 8th day of July
          1994 to and including the 13th day of July in
          the year 1994, at the Municipality of
          Metropolitan Toronto, did wilfully attempt to
          obstruct the course of justice by dissuading
          or attempting to dissuade a witness, by
          threats, bribes or other corrupt means, from
          giving evidence, contrary to the Criminal
          Code.
               Count #3:
               on or about the 13th day of July in the
          year 1994, at the Municipality of
          Metropolitan Toronto, did commit an assault
          on S.M., contrary to the Criminal Code.
               Count #4:
               on or about the 14th day of July in the
          year 1994, at the Municipality of
          Metropolitan Toronto, did break and enter a
          certain place, to wit: a dwelling house
          situate at 100 Goodwood Park Court, Apartment
          #216 and did commit therein with intention to
          commit an indictable offence, contrary to the
          Criminal Code.
               Count #5:
               during the period from and including the
          1st day of June in the year 1994 to and
          including the 31st day of July in the year
          1994, at the Municipality of Metropolitan
          Toronto, knowing that S.M. is harassed or
          being reckless as to whether she is harassed
          did without unlawful authority repeatedly
          communicate directly or indirectly with her
          thereby causing her to reasonably, in all the
          circumstances, fear for her safety, contrary
          to the Criminal Code.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant pleaded not guilty to all counts. He was found
not guilty of break and enter on count one, but guilty of the
included offence of assault; guilty of obstruct justice on count
two; not guilty of assault on count three; not guilty of break
and enter on count four; and guilty of harassment on count five.
[3]  On April 7, 1995, the appellant was fined $750 on count one,
sentenced to seven months in custody on count two and sentenced
to one year consecutive on count five.
[4]  The appellant appeals both his convictions and sentences.
[5]  The complainant, S.M., was 22 years of age and was employed
as an exotic dancer at a club called Fantasia. It was here that
she first met the appellant. They developed what is referred to
as a boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. While they were not
formally living together, he had a key to her apartment and
frequently slept with her overnight and would sometimes stay over
for two or three days at a time. All of the incidents that gave
rise to these criminal charges occurred during the course of this
relationship. In the theory of the Crown, the conduct of the
appellant was motivated by his possessiveness and his attempts to
make the complainant feel badly about what she was doing at the
club.
[6]  The appellant testified in his defence. With respect to
Count # 1, he made an admission of fact pursuant to s.655 of the
Criminal Code that he had committed an assault by hitting the
complainant. Otherwise, his evidence was that the events
described by the complainant either did not happen or did not
happen as she had described them. The central issue, therefore,
was one of credibility.
[7]  As a quick glance at the indictment reveals, the charges
against the appellant, while all relating to the same victim,
represent very different legal issues. This is relevant to the
ground of appeal that I think is determinative and necessitates a
new trial. It relates to the decision of the Crown to lead
evidence of a former girlfriend, one K.T., under the rubric of
similar fact evidence. Ms. T. testified to her stormy
relationship with the appellant that led her to lay charges of
assault against him for which he was convicted. In my view, this
evidence cannot be justified as similar fact evidence. It was
highly prejudicial to the appellant and poisoned the atmosphere
of the entire jury trial.
[8]  Ms. T.&#146;s evidence should not have been admitted in this case
where identity was not a live issue and the probative value of
the evidence was directed, as the trial judge ruled, solely to
enhance the credibility of the complainant. While I acknowledge
that the Supreme Court of Canada has held that similar fact
evidence is relevant to the issue of whether the complainant
should be believed  (R. v. B. (C.R.)  (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.) at p.27), it seems to me that the onus is on the Crown
to show that this evidence has great probative value when it is
proffered for this limited purpose.
[9]  McLachlin J. outlined the relevant principles for the
admission of similar fact evidence at p.25 of B. (C.R.):

               &#133; evidence which is adduced solely to show that the accused
          is the sort of person likely to have committed an offence is, as
          a rule, inadmissible. Whether the evidence in question
          constitutes an exception to this general rule depends on whether
          the probative value of the proposed evidence outweighs its
          prejudicial effect. In a case such as the present, where the
          similar fact evidence sought to be adduced is prosecution
          evidence of a morally repugnant act committed by the accused, the
          potential prejudice is great and the probative value of the
          evidence must be high indeed to permit its reception. The judge
          must consider such factors as the degree of distinctiveness or
          uniqueness between the similar fact evidence and the offences
          alleged against the accused, as well as the connection, if any,
          of the evidence to issues other than propensity, to the end of
          determining whether, in the context of the case before him, the
          probative value of the evidence outweighs its potential prejudice
          and justifies its reception. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[10]  I note that in R. v. B. (C.R.), the complainant testified
that she was only 11 years of age when her father inflicted gross
and aberrant sexual acts upon her which were inherently difficult
of belief. The trial judge in that case admitted evidence of
similar sexual conduct on previous occasions with respect to a 15-
year-old girl with whom the accused had established a father-
daughter type of relationship. While acknowledging that the
admissibility of this evidence was &#147;borderline&#148; (at p.28),
McLachlin J., for the majority, was not prepared to interfere
with the ruling of the trial judge. Sopinka J., with Lamer C.J.C.
concurring, wrote a dissenting judgment in which he would have
reversed the ruling.
[11] The general principles outlined by McLachlin J. in B. (C.R.)
were accepted by Cory J. in his recent judgment in R. v. Arp
(1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.). Writing for the court, Cory
J. reiterated the principle that evidence of a propensity to
violence will not generally be admitted. At p.339 he said:

          Thus evidence of propensity or disposition
          may be relevant to the crime charged, but it
          is usually inadmissible because its slight
          probative value is ultimately outweighed by
          its highly prejudicial effect.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The situation in B. (C.R.) differs markedly from that in the
case in appeal. The testimony of children of tender years who
have been trapped in incestuous relationships with adult family
members have problems that the courts have been at some pains to
address. Juries are reluctant to accept, in the face of denials
by the person charged, that the evidence of such aberrant conduct
as the complainant described in B. (C.R.) (fellatio, cunnilingus,
vaginal intercourse and buggery) actually occurred. This
reluctance to believe the complainant can be offset by a second
youthful witness who testifies to similar conduct at a time when
she too was a young girl and in similar circumstances. McLachlin
J. demonstrated that she was fully cognisant of this problem when
she held that the evidence had probative value in connection with
the credibility of the young complainant. She stated at p. 27-8:

               In cases such as the present, which pit the word of the
          child alleged to have been sexually assaulted against the word of
          the accused, similar fact evidence may be useful on the central
          issue of credibility.</pre>
    <pre>[13] It seems to me, however, that in cases where the purpose of
the similar fact evidence is solely or primarily to enhance the
credibility of an adult complainant, we should be hesitant to
depart from the common law&#146;s traditional rejection of evidence
that illustrates that the accused is the sort of person who is
likely to have committed these offences.
[14] In the case in appeal, the probative value of the similar
fact evidence is slight. There is nothing particularly distinct
or unique in S.M.&#146;s account of the manner in which the appellant
treated her. Her description of the appellant as possessive,
distrustful and assaultive, both verbally and physically, can be
replicated in almost any abusive relationship. Moreover, the
majority of the similarities argued by the Crown are not
referable to the conduct of the appellant but to his two
girlfriends&#146; unflattering assessments of his character and
disposition towards violence. In his ruling, the trial judge set
out the facts he was admitting as similar facts as follows:

               Crown counsel, by way of a voir dire, has led the evidence
          of K.T., nee E. I draw from her evidence the inference that she
          and this accused, Mr. Rulli, in late 1990 and through a
          substantial portion of 1991, at that period of time when she was
          about seventeen years of age, were with one another, engaged in a
          boyfriend / girlfriend type of sentimental attachment. They were
          in that type of relationship for a short period of time. As I
          recall her evidence, that amounted to some weeks. Miss T.
          described how Mr. Rulli, after professing his love for her, would
          immediately change, by way of personality, on slight or no
          pretext, and would habitually suddenly, after finding fault with
          her, commence to call her a whore and a slut and other such nasty
          names. He would assault her and then apologize immediately
          thereafter and again profess his love for her. She described how,
          on occasion, he kicked and punched her and dragged her by the
          hair near a bus stop.
                    Ultimately, as in the case of the
          complainant M., Miss T. called the police and
          charges were laid. She then described how, on
          one occasion, after those charges were laid,
          I believe it was at the Yorkdale shopping
          mall near closing time, the accused, Mr.
          Rulli, ordered her to have the charges that
          had been laid against him for assault,
          obviously, dropped. She said on this occasion
          he spat in her face and threatened her with
          bodily harm if she did not comply. He
          followed her and begged her to reconcile.
                    She wrote the letter that he
          ordered her to write to the police, telling
          her what to say in that letter. She also
          described how he forced her to apply for
          welfare in order to provide him with money.
          When she applied but did not immediately
          obtain the cash, she swore that he threatened
          her with harm and berated her with profanity.
          She wrote the letter. That letter is not
          before this court at this time.
               On another occasion, she testified that
          the accused, Mr. Rulli, secreted himself in
          her parents&#146; garage at the home where she
          lived with her parents, and when discovered,
          he was chased out of the garage and then by
          the police, some of whom came from the canine
          unit. She further swore that he stalked her
          at her place of employment, being a clothing
          store where she had obtained work.
                    It is that body of evidence the
          Crown counsel proposes be admitted into
          evidence at Mr. Rulli&#146;s trial, involving the
          indictment that I have just read into these
          reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Consistent with his ruling as to admissibility, the trial
judge instructed the jury that it could use the evidence of the
former girlfriend in assessing the credibility of the present
girlfriend and complainant. He then correctly instructed the jury
that the evidence could not be used to show that the appellant
was guilty because of a disposition to commit wrongful acts.
However, the trial judge gave them no indication of how they
could properly apply this evidence to the five separate and
legally disparate counts in the indictment. Put another way,
while instructing the jury that they could not use the similar
fact evidence of Ms. T. to attack the appellant&#146;s credibility, he
gave them no affirmative guidance as to how the evidence could be
used to make the complainant more credible. In my opinion, this
evidence supporting the complainant&#146;s truthfulness went almost
entirely to showing that the appellant was a bad person who had
abused his former girlfriend and accordingly that he was a person
pre-disposed to abuse his present girlfriend. So far as it
purported to enhance the complainant&#146;s credibility it did so by
trashing the appellant&#146;s. It made her look credible only by
comparison to him.
[16] I recognize that a trial judge&#146;s view of the balance between
probative value and prejudicial effect deserves a high level of
deference from an appellate court. This principle was stated by
McLachlin J. in B. (C.R.) at p.24 and was repeated by Cory J. in
Arp at p.340. However, in the case in appeal, the admission of
similar fact evidence by the trial judge was wholly unjustified.
The evidence he summarized shows not that there is a pattern or
scheme or signature demonstrated by the appellant&#146;s conduct with
respect to both his girlfriends, but that his conduct as
described by both women is erratic, intemperate and obsessive.
Where is &#147;the highly individualized modus operandi [that] is
tantamount to evidence that the [appellant] left his calling
card?&#148; to use the language of Sopinka J. in R. v. B. (C.R.),
supra, at p.11.
[17] The evidence of Ms. T., when combined with that of the
complainant, if believed, illustrates that the appellant is an
abuser of women. That he is just the kind of man who would commit
the offences of which he is charged. My primary concern is that
the prejudice engendered by learning that this was not the first
woman the appellant had mistreated influenced the jury to convict
the appellant because he was a bad person, significantly on the
obstruction of justice and the harassment counts in the
indictment.
[18] There is another problem with Ms. T.&#146;s evidence. At the time
of this trial, the appellant had been convicted of a number of
counts of assault causing bodily harm to Ms. T. The Crown knew
that the convictions were under appeal and took the risk of using
this material anyway. Subsequently, these convictions were
quashed by this court for the reason, not coincidentally, that
the Crown had relied upon similar fact evidence that was found to
be more prejudicial than probative: see R. v. Rulli, [1995] O.J.
No. 1372 (C.A.).
[19] While the fact of the convictions was not brought to the
attention of the jury, the acts that supported the convictions
were put into evidence. The appellant also received a ruling that
he could not be cross-examined on the fact of his convictions
with respect to Ms. T. However, he was placed under severe
limitations as to what he could say as to her similar fact
evidence. In his examination-in-chief he tried to minimize the
nature of the conduct which led to the convictions. However,
during a recess, the trial judge raised with his counsel whether
he should now reconsider his earlier ruling. The trial judge
said:
               Here we have an accused, who like all accused, are allowed,
          as far as this court is concerned, great latitude when they are
          testifying. He knows he was convicted, three convictions for
          assaulting Miss T., and he said they weren&#146;t true. What do you
          think we should do about it?</pre>
    <pre>[20] After some discussion, the jury returned and the appellant
was given another opportunity to deal with the similar fact
evidence and he then admitted that he had assaulted Ms. T.
[21] There is authority in this court for the proposition that
where the appellant has been found not guilty of the criminal
conduct that was introduced in the case in appeal as similar fact
evidence, this court is entitled in the interests of justice to
consider whether for that reason alone the verdict can be
overturned. In R. v. G. (K.R.) (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 268, this
court ordered a new trial of an appellant who had been convicted
of sexual assault of a young girl. At the trial, evidence of
similar facts was admitted with respect to another assault on a
second young girl. Subsequently, the appellant was charged with
respect to the second girl and was acquitted. In an appeal from
the conviction at the first trial, the conviction was quashed and
a new trial ordered. Galligan J.A. for the court stated at pp.270-
1:
               If the appellant had been tried and acquitted of the charge
          of sexual assault upon M. D. before the trial which gives rise to
          this appeal, M. D.&#146;s similar fact evidence would have been
          inadmissible because conduct leading to a charge of which an
          accused has been acquitted is not admissible as similar fact
          evidence: see the judgment of this court in R v. Cullen (1989),
          52 C.C.C. (3d) 459 at p. 462, 36 O.A.C. 195, 9 W.C.B. (2d) 206.
          The appellant thus seeks leave to have admitted into evidence
          before this court the fact of his acquittal on the charge
          respecting M.D.
                               . . . .
                    As the Supreme Court of Canada has
          recently held in R. v. Grant, released
          October 17, 1991, at p. 15 [reported 67
          C.C.C. (3d) 268 at p. 279, 14 W.C.B. (2d)
          167], it is a well-established principle of
          the criminal law that an acquittal is the
          equivalent of a finding of innocence. It must
          be conclusively assumed, therefore, that the
          appellant was innocent of the allegations
          made against him by M. D. It seems to me that
          there would be a clear miscarriage of justice
          if allegations of conduct, of which he was
          innocent, played a part in his conviction for
          these offences.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[22] Similarly, in R. v. Verney (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 363, this
court considered the case of an appellant who had been convicted
of a number of charges arising out of three separate robberies.
The charges relating to the three robberies were tried separately
by different juries. In each trial, the evidence of the other two
robberies was admitted as similar fact evidence. The appellant
was acquitted by a jury at the first robbery trial and was
convicted by separate juries on the charges related to the second
and third robberies. Subsequent to the appellant&#146;s conviction in
the third trial, the second robbery conviction was appealed, a
new trial was ordered and the second trial resulted in an
acquittal. The conviction on the third robbery charge was then
appealed to this court.
[23] I delivered the judgment of the court in Verney. I said at
pp.370-1 and 374:
                    The appellant submitted that the within trial was
          manifestly unfair. Not only was he forced to defend against all
          three robbery allegations, as a result of the Crown&#146;s having led
          evidence of all three incidents during Williams' evidence-in-
          chief, he was unable to effectively assert the invalidity of his
          convictions in relation to the Swiss Chalet robbery, the appeals
          of which were then still before this court.
                               . . . .
               It was submitted that the subsequent
          acquittal of the appellant in relation to all
          counts on the Swiss Chalet robbery precluded,
          ex post facto, the use of those convictions,
          even on the issue of credibility, and that
          the position of the appellant was seriously
          prejudiced in a case in which credibility was
          central to his defence.
                               . . . .
                    In retrospect, I agree that this
          trial was unfair. Fundamental to this ground
          of appeal is the concept that an acquittal is
          more than a finding of not guilty and is in
          law a declaration of innocence for all
          purposes. This must be so, because the
          verdict of not guilty restores to the accused
          the presumption of innocence. In R. v. Grdic
          (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at p. 293, 19
          D.L.R. (4th) 385, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 810
          (S.C.C.), Lamer J. quoted with approval from
          Friedland in Double Jeopardy, ibid, p. 129:
                    As a matter of fundamental policy in the
               administration of the criminal law it must be
               accepted by the Crown in a subsequent
               criminal proceeding that an acquittal is the
               equivalent to a finding of innocence. &#133;
                    The argument on the case on
          appeal is stronger, in my opinion, than
          that in G. (K.R.). If an allegation of a
          similar act of sexual abuse that is
          subsequently found to be unfounded can
          be the basis for upsetting a conviction,
          then the reversal of a conviction for
          one robbery in a crime spree that was
          relied upon to support a charge with
          respect to another robbery in that
          spree, simply cannot stand.</pre>
    <pre>[24] I recognize the force of the argument by the Crown that in
the case of the appellant&#146;s first trial we are not dealing with
an acquittal, but with a verdict of guilty that had been quashed.
The Rulli case is different than G. (K.R.) and Verney. The
appellant had been tried but he had been improperly convicted and
had served the full term of his sentence. The conviction was
quashed because of the Crown&#146;s improper introduction of similar
fact evidence. Ordinarily, this would have led to a new trial,
but the court was concerned that the Crown might proceed despite
the fact that the appellant had already served his sentence.
Accordingly, a new trial was ordered but the new trial was
stayed. In the result, while the court&#146;s disposition restored the
appellant&#146;s presumption of innocence, it did not amount to a
declaration of innocence. On the other hand, that presumption of
innocence cannot again be challenged in a new trial or in any
other criminal trial because of the judicial stay. While
acknowledging the limitations of the comparison to G. (K.R.) and
Verney, I consider this aspect of the appeal to be yet another
reason to interfere in this case.
[25] I am of the opinion that this trial in its totality was
unfair. The Crown over reached in this case just as it did in the
earlier case against the same appellant. This so-called similar
fact evidence was not necessary to enhance the credibility of the
complainant to ensure a proper trial of the appellant and it
should never have been proffered. In my opinion, it has resulted
in another mistrial.</pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[26] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal against conviction,
quash the convictions and order a new trial restricted to the
counts upon which the appellant was convicted.
