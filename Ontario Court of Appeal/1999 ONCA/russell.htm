    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (MacFarland,
Salhany and Sedgwick JJ.), dated October 19, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants appeal, pursuant to leave granted by this
court, from the judgment of the Divisional Court dismissing the
appellants&#146; application for judicial review.</pre>
    <pre>     Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The individual appellants are those Sisters of the Religious
Hospitallers of St. Joseph who are directors of the Hotel Dieu of
Kingston, a public hospital under the Public Hospitals Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c.P.40.  The Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph
are the successors to the Daughters Hospitallers of St. Joseph.
The order was originally founded in 1636 with a mission for the
care of the &#147;sick poor&#148;.  The first Hotel Dieu was founded at La
Flèche in France and subsequently the Religious Hospitallers of
St. Joseph would take their health care mission to Montreal and
later into different provinces in Canada and elsewhere in North
and South America.  In 1845 this religious order was canonically
established as the Sisters of l&#146;Hôtel-Dieu for the Diocese of
Kingston.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The respondent, the Health Services Restructuring Commission
(&#147;HSRC&#148;), was established under s. 8(1) of the Ministry of Health
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.26. For the purposes of this appeal, it
derives its authority under ss.7 and 8 of that statute and O.
Reg. 87/96 passed under the authority of the Public Hospitals
Act.
[4]  The above two statutes assigned broad powers to the HSRC to
develop, establish and maintain an effective and adequate health
care system and to restructure the health care services provided
in Ontario communities. These powers included the authority to
require a health care facility to cease operating a public
hospital or to amalgamate with another public hospital.  The HSRC
began its restructuring work in Kingston in 1997.
[5]  On June 23, 1998, the HSRC issued directions to the Board of
Directors of the Hotel Dieu Hospital to cease to operate as a
public hospital effective October 31, 1998.  Further to that
objective, a specific direction was given to develop and
implement a plan to relinquish to the Kingston General Hospital
the operation and management of the programs and services of the
Hotel Dieu Hospital by October 31, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellants raise four grounds of appeal:
               1.   The Divisional Court erred in failing to find that the
          HSRC exercised an authority exercisable by a commission under s.
          3(5) of the Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.P.13;
               2.   The Divisional Court erred in
          failing to find that the review of planning
          matters by the HSRC fell below the standard
          required of a commission acting under s. 3(5)
          of the Planning Act;
               3.   The Divisional Court erred in not
          finding that it is patently unreasonable to
          &#147;destroy&#148; the Hotel Dieu Hospital before it
          is known whether or not the restructuring
          plan of the HSRC can ever be implemented; and
               4.   The Divisional Court erred in not
          finding that the direction by the HSRC to
          restructure the means of providing health
          care services in the Kingston area interfered
          with the exercise by the Sisters of the
          Religious Hospitallers of St. Joseph of their
          religious beliefs contrary to s.2(a) of the
          Canadian Charter or Rights and Freedoms.</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Grounds one and two can be dealt with together. They are
related to the third ground of appeal that the directions of the
HSRC requiring the Hotel Dieu Hospital to cease operating as a
public hospital were patently unreasonable.
[8]  The HSRC has a broad mandate to restructure public hospital
services across Ontario in the public interest. In carrying out
its public interest mandate, the HRSC is obliged to consider the
health care role played by the Religious Hospitallers of Saint
Joseph. Its directions specifically contemplate a future role for
the Sisters in providing acute hospital care.
[9]  The empowering statute of the HSRC is the Ministry of Health
Act. Section 8(8) specifies that its duties and powers &#147;shall be
duties and powers with respect to the development, establishment
and maintenance of an effective and adequate health care system
and the restructuring of health care services provided in Ontario
communities&#148;.  The authority exercised by the HSRC does not
extend to planning matters such as official plans, zoning by-laws
or other tools employed by municipalities for land use planning.
[10] The term &#147;planning matters&#148;, as used in the Planning Act,
comprises official plan, zoning, and other land-use decisions
that are ordinarily made by municipalities and, if required,
approved by provincial authorities. This is clear from both the
purpose and the language of the Planning Act. Sections 1.1(b) and
(c) include among the purposes of the Act &#147;to provide for a land
use planning system led by provincial policy&#148; and &#147;to integrate
matters of provincial interest in provincial and municipal
planning decisions&#148; [emphasis added]. Similarly, s. 1.1(d) refers
to fair, open, accessible, timely and efficient &#147;planning
processes&#148; and s. 1.1(f) speaks of &#147;the decision-making authority
and accountability of municipal councils in planning&#148;. The entire
focus of the Planning Act is land use planning. Section 3(1),
which provides for the issuance of policy statements, expressly
states that these statements are to be &#147;on matters relating to
municipal planning&#148;.
[11] The Divisional Court held that the HSRC does not exercise
any authority to affect planning matters in this sense. It
recognized that the planning process would not be engaged until
the implementation of the directions, a process in which the HSRC
does not participate.  In our opinion, this holding was correct.
The HSRC has no authority to make or approve municipal plans or
any land use planning instrument, or to require that these
instruments conform to its directions. Its decisions may lead to
requests by public hospitals and other entities involved in the
implementation of the directions that other authorities,
including municipalities and the Ontario Municipal Board,
exercise their authority affecting planning matters. It is also
conceivable that the HSRC may have to exercise its authority to
revise its directions in light of decisions made by planning
authorities, or the time required to complete planning processes.
But this does not bring the HSRC itself within s. 3(5) of the
Planning Act.
[12] It follows that if the provisions of the Planning Act are
beyond the purview of the HSRC, then it was not necessary for the
Divisional Court or this court to concern itself as to the extent
to which the HSRC considered planning and zoning matters. While
the HSRC can embrace considerations beyond its specified mandate,
we are of the opinion that it is neither obliged to nor should it
attempt to consider and resolve any and all problems that the
implementation of its directions could cause with respect to the
Planning Act or any municipal zoning by-law.  Section 3(5) of the
Planning Act only applies to a &#147;commission &#133; of the government&#148;
that is &#147;exercising any authority that affects any planning
matter&#148;. Since the authority of the HSRC relates to health care
and not planning, we agree with the Divisional Court that the
HSRC does not come within s. 3(5).
[13] This takes us to the third ground of appeal, that the
direction to &#147;destroy&#148; the Hotel Dieu Hospital is patently
unreasonable. The appellants note the uncontradicted planning
evidence that the directions as to the transfer of certain
functions to a new hospital site may be impossible to implement
because of difficulties in obtaining the necessary planning
approvals, at least within the time contemplated by the present
directions. This, they say, makes the direction patently
unreasonable. However, given our view that planning
considerations are not a concern of the HSRC, problems of
implementation cannot render patently absurd the direction to
proceed with the restructuring that the HSRC considers necessary
to maintain an effective health care system.
[14] As to the problems inherent in the time restraints, they are
in large measure a reflection of the response by the courts to
this application.  To the extent that problems of timing and the
obtaining of planning approvals are or become a concern, they
will have to be addressed as they arise.  To suggest that the
directions are patently absurd because every conceivable
contingency has not been considered and provided for is itself
absurd.  No project could proceed if it was a requirement of its
implementation that it must proceed without variation or
adjustment.
[15] The appellants&#146; fourth ground of appeal is that the effect
of the HSRC&#146;s directions is to turn the Hotel Dieu Hospital into
a secular hospital and that this result violates s.2(a) of the
Charter, which guarantees freedom of religion.
[16] In making this submission the appellants&#146; starting point is
their long ministry, through the provision of health care, to the
&#147;sick poor&#148; in the Kingston area.  They contend that this
ministry is central to their religious beliefs and practices and
that the restructuring of hospitals in Kingston flowing from the
HSRC&#146;s directions will diminish, or perhaps even destroy, that
ministry.
[17] The appellants assert that their 125-plus year health care
mission is a sincere expression of their religious beliefs and
is, therefore, worthy of constitutional protection. They rely
especially on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Ross
v. New Brunswick School District No. 15, [1996]  1 S.C.R. 825,
wherein La Forest J., speaking for a unanimous court, said at p.
868:
               [A]ssuming the sincerity of an asserted religious belief, it
          was not open to the Court to question its validity.  It was
          sufficient to trigger constitutional scrutiny if the effect of
          the impugned act or provision interfered with an individual&#146;s
          religious activities or convictions.
</pre>
    <pre>[18] The problem with the Sisters&#146; argument is that the real
effect of the HSRC&#146;s directions is to terminate public funding of
their hospital.  Paragraph 3 of the directions provides that the
hospital must &#147;Cease to operate as a public hospital effective
October 31, 1998.&#148;  The crucial word here is &#147;public&#148;.  The HSRC
has decided that public funding of the hospital is no longer
desirable.1  Accordingly, the Sisters&#146; argument becomes, in a
practical sense, that the long-standing public financial support
for their hospital must continue because of the religious
foundation of the hospital.
[19] In our view, this argument simply cannot withstand scrutiny.
The great principle of freedom of religion does not guarantee
public funding for denominational public hospitals.  The decision
of the Supreme Court of Canada in Adler v. Ontario, [1996] 3
S.C.R. 609, affirming the decision of this court (1994), 19 O.R.
(3d) 1, is a complete answer to the appellants&#146; position.
[20] In Adler, the courts held that freedom of religion confers
no right to public funding for religious schools.  Sopinka J.
said, at pp. 702-03:
               [F]ailure to act in order to facilitate the practice of
          religion cannot be considered state interference with freedom of
          religion.  The fact that no funding is provided for private
          religious education cannot be considered to infringe the
          appellants&#146; freedom to educate their children in accordance with
          their religious beliefs where there is no restriction on
          religious schooling.  As submitted by the intervener, the
          Canadian Civil Liberties Association, there are many spheres of
          government action which hold religious significance for religious
          believers.  It does not follow that the government must pay for
          the religious dimensions of spheres in which it takes a role.  If
          this flowed from s.2(a), then religious marriages, religious
          corporations, and other religious community institutions such as
          churches and hospitals would all have a Charter claim to public
          funding.  The same could also be said of the existing judicial
          system which is necessarily secular.  The appellants&#146; argument
          would lead to an obligation by the state to fund parallel
          religious justice systems founded on canon law or Talmudic law,
          for example.  These are clearly untenable suggestions.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In conclusion, for the reasons
          given above, I am of the view that the
          failure to fund cannot constitute state
          interference with freedom of religion
          equivalent to a violation of s.2(a) of
          the Charter. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[21] This reasoning, articulated in the context of public funding
for religious schools, applies equally in the context of public
funding for a religious hospital.  Indeed, the appellants do not
assert that the factual difference between schools and hospitals
has any constitutional significance.
[22] However, the appellants attempt to distinguish Adler on a
different basis.  In Adler, the parents of religious school
students sought to invoke s.2(a) of the Charter to compel public
funding of their schools for the first time.  In the present
case, there has been public funding of the appellants&#146; hospital
for more than a century.  The appellants assert that the
termination of this funding violates an essential component of
their long-standing religious beliefs and practices.  As
expressed in paragraph 65 of their factum:
               The Divisional Court&#146;s reliance on Adler was misplaced.  The
          Sisters&#146; case is quite different.  The issue here is in what
          circumstances can the State, a partner for over a century with
          the Sisters in delivering health care through a denominational
          hospital, unilaterally force that denominational hospital to
          become a secular hospital devoid of its religious mission.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[23] This submission amounts to an assertion that public funding
given to a religious institution cannot be terminated or even
diminished unless the government justifies its policy change
under s.1 of the Charter.  We do not agree with this submission.
We think that the case law supports the respondents&#146; succinct
proposition in paragraph 78 of its factum: &#147;if there is no
constitutional imperative for a policy in the first place,
reversing it cannot be unconstitutional.&#148;  See Ferrel v. Ontario
(Attorney General) (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), especially at
109-11, and Dunmore v. Ontario (Attorney General) (1997), 37 O.R.
(3d) 287 (Gen. Div.), especially at 301, aff&#146;d [1999] O.J. No.
1104 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>     Result</pre>
    <pre>[24] The appeal is dismissed for the reasons set out above. This
is not an appropriate case for costs.

1 There is no suggestion that the HSRC has reached this decision
because of any perceived failure on the part of the Sisters to
operate a highly successful hospital.  Indeed, it is common
ground that both the Sisters&#146; mission, and their activities
pursuant to that mission, are entirely laudable.</pre></td>
