COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Appellant) and GEORGE
               SAADE (Respondent)</pre>

    <pre>COUNSEL:       Barbara L. Kelly, for the appellant
               Philip A. Downs, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         March 19, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We think this appeal must be allowed. The appellant was
charged with keeping a common bawdyhouse contrary to s. 210(1).

[2]  To make out the offence, the Crown must establish not only
that the appellant exercised some degree of management and
control over the premises but that he participated to some extent
in the illicit activities of the common bawdyhouse. That is, that
he participated in the use of the house as a common bawdyhouse:
R. v. Corbiel (1991), 2 S.C.R. 830.

[3]  In this case, the trial judge does not appear to have
addressed the second issue. The decision seems to turn on the
view of the trial judge that:
          </pre>
    <pre>       If it were not for the fact that the opportunity for these
  freelancers to work in this establishment I would have some
  difficulty in attaching knowledge to the defendant as to what was
  going on within the champagne room, if it was simply resorting to
  girls that he hired to perform a dance and they in addition
  provided the opportunity to do this private dance in the
  champagne room. But in my view, the fact that the defendant hired
  girls or offered the girls an opportunity to work free in his
  establishment is in my view the culminating factor that allows
  the Court to determine that the defence knew exactly what was
  taking place in the champagne room, and allowed it by virtue of
  his hiring or allowing these girls to work in his establishment.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  However, there was no evidence that the appellant knew of
the activity testified to by the police officers and there was no
evidence as to whether freelancers were the ones who carried out
the illicit conduct rather than his employees who danced there
for tips.

[5]  In the circumstances, the appeal must be allowed, the
conviction is set aside and an acquittal is entered.</pre>
