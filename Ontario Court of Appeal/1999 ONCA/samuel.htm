    <pre>On appeal from Cameron J. dated May 26, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>FELDMAN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from two orders of Cameron J. striking
out his counterclaims as disclosing no cause of action in law.
The counterclaims were framed as actions for damages arising from
the swearing of allegedly false affidavits in support of an order
for the appointment of a receiver, together with an interlocutory
injunction, at the initial stage of this action. The motions
judge held that there is absolute immunity attached to witness
testimony so that no cause of action lies based on such evidence.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS:</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was an equity owner and the President and
Chief Executive Officer of the Redipac companies. The respondent,
Samuel Manu-Tech is a public company which had a substantial
equity investment in Redipac. The respondent Kevin Talbot worked
in a senior management position for Redipac, while the respondent
Wallace Rayner was Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of
Samuel Manu-Tech.
[3]  As a result of certain actions allegedly taken by the
appellant at Redipac, on June 12, 1992 Samuel Manu-Tech commenced
this action by Notice of Action seeking various forms of relief
including the appointment of a receiver of Redipac, an injunction
to remove the appellant and others in control from the premises,
as well as damages. On the same day Samuel Manu-Tech  sought and
obtained an ex parte order appointing the Receiver, and ousting
the appellant from the premises. That order was served on the
appellant as part of the procedure of having him leave the
Redipac premises.
[4]  To obtain the order, Samuel Manu-Tech gave the usual
undertaking with respect to damages. The only evidence tendered
on the motion in support of the order were two affidavits, one
from Talbot and one from Rayner. The Talbot affidavit details
allegations of financial misconduct by the appellant. The Rayner
affidavit confirms certain details.
[5]  On June 19, 1992 Samuel Manu-Tech also provided copies of
these affidavits to the OPP, resulting in charges being laid
against the appellant and Redipac. Following a preliminary
hearing, the appellant was bound over for trial on some charges,
but they were ultimately withdrawn by the Crown.
[6]  On June 22,  1992 the respondent Samuel Manu-Tech sought and
obtained a further order of the court empowering the receiver to
terminate employees and ongoing contracts. Although the appellant
asserts that no proper notice was provided to him, the order
recites that no one appeared for the appellant although he was
duly served. The court received and relied on the original motion
record  together with some further material in granting the
further order of June 22. The receiver reported to the court with
respect to its investigation of the Talbot allegations, concluded
that Redipac was insolvent and recommended that the receivership
be terminated, which it was by order of July 6, 1992. That order
also recites that no one appeared for the defendants although
&#147;duly notified of the hearing&#148;. Eventually Redipac was declared
bankrupt. The effect of the actions taken by the receiver
pursuant to the orders was to prevent the appellant from
functioning in his employment relationship with Redipac.
[7]  The appellant neither sought to respond to any of the
evidence presented to the court to obtain the above-described
orders, nor was any cross-examination undertaken on the impugned
affidavits, nor was any motion brought to set aside any of the
orders, nor was any appeal taken.
[8]  In 1997 the appellant initiated the counterclaim against
Samuel Manu-Tech as well as against Talbot and Rayner. The
counterclaim is for damages for malicious prosecution by Samuel
Manu-Tech in respect of the criminal proceedings, and against all
three for damages for interference with contractual relations in
respect of the effective termination of the appellant&#146;s
employment with Redipac by the receiver. The basis of the claim
is that the affidavits of Talbot and Rayner, relied upon to
obtain the court orders which led to the appellant&#146;s termination
and the demise of Redipac, were false, misleading and incomplete
in material respects to the knowledge of the three respondents.
[9]  The respondent Talbot brought a motion before Cameron J. to
strike out the counterclaim under Rule 21 on the basis that the
affidavits are protected by an absolute privilege so that no
cause of action can be founded on them. The respondents Rayner
and Samuel Manu-Tech framed their motion as a Rule 20 summary
judgment motion on the same basis. Samuel Manu-Tech also moved
for summary judgment dismissing the malicious prosecution action.
The motions judge struck out the counterclaims against the three
respondents for intentional interference with contractual
relations on the basis of the privilege, and dismissed the
summary judgment motion of the respondent Samuel Manu-Tech
holding that there was a genuine issue for trial on that
counterclaim.  There is no appeal from that portion of the order.</pre>
    <pre>THE ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[10] Cameron J. struck out the counterclaim of the appellant in
respect of the intentional interference with contractual
relations claim on the basis that the affidavits filed by Talbot
and Rayner were protected by an absolute privilege. ([1998] O.J.
2158) On the appeal, the respondents Rayner and Samuel Manu-Tech
raise an additional ground upon which they submit the
counterclaim should be struck out. They say that the issue
pleaded in the counterclaim is res judicata.</pre>
    <pre>RES JUDICATA</pre>
    <pre>[11] I can deal with the submission on res judicata very briefly.
First, as regards the respondent Samuel Manu-Tech, that party
provided an undertaking as to damages upon seeking and obtaining
the order appointing the receiver and granting the injunction.
The undertaking was incorporated into the order and forms part of
the ongoing proceedings. The fact of the undertaking belies the
operation of the res judicata doctrine as it specifically
contemplates that the propriety of the interlocutory orders
obtained will be revisited in the ultimate litigation, and Samuel
Manu-Tech will be answerable in damages if the orders were
obtained improperly. In that event it may be argued by the
respondent Samuel Manu-Tech that the fact that the appellant did
not take any steps to oppose the orders should be considered
relevant to the measure of damages sustained by him.
[12] The other two respondents, Talbot and Rayner were not
parties to the original litigation and therefore, as non-parties,
are not bound by the interlocutory orders under the doctrine of
res judicata.</pre>
    <pre>     ABSOLUTE PRIVILEGE</pre>
    <pre>[13] In order to establish a claim for intentional interference
with contractual relations, the appellant must prove several
elements including an intentional act or acts of the respondents
which caused the breach of contract. The intentional acts which
the appellant relies on in the counterclaim were the swearing of
the affidavits by Rayner and Talbot, knowing them to be false and
knowing their ultimate use, as well as their use by Samuel Manu-
Tech, knowing that the affidavits had shortcomings, to obtain the
receivership orders in this proceeding. Cameron J. held that
court testimony, including in affidavits, as well as pleadings,
counsels&#146; statements, and statements by the court in a legal
proceeding are subject to an absolute privilege and cannot form
the basis of a cause of action, following the decision of Dooley
v. C.N. Weber Ltd. (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 779 (Gen. Div.). On that
basis he struck out the counterclaims against all three parties,
and in the case of Talbot, without leave to amend.
[14] The appellant argued before Cameron J. that the privilege is
not absolute but qualified where proceedings are brought with the
predominant purposes of causing harm, and cited two authorities,
Amirault v. Westminster Canada Holdings Ltd (1994), 127 N.S.R.
(2d) 241 (N.S.C.A.), application for leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada dismissed, S.C.C. bulletin, 1994, p.1688,
and  Bateman v. Newcourt Credit Group Inc., [1995] O.J. No. 325
(Gen. Div.).
[15] Amirault is a very unusual fact situation. In that case the
plaintiffs were the former directors of a Nova Scotia corporation
the shares of which had been purchased by the defendants. The
investment was a poor one and  the defendants blamed the former
directors for misleading them about the value of the company. The
defendants brought an action in Ontario against the plaintiffs
and served the claim just after the directors&#146; liability
insurance policy had expired. The Ontario action was still
outstanding when the plaintiffs brought their action in Nova
Scotia including a claim for conspiracy to injure based on the
institution and timing of the Ontario action. The Nova Scotia
Court of Appeal upheld the trial judge&#146;s findings that the
Ontario action was primarily motivated by an intention to harm
the plaintiffs, and held as a matter of law that a cause of
action in conspiracy could lie where the method of causing the
harm was by commencing an action in another province with the
predominant purpose of causing harm rather to obtain legal
redress for an alleged wrong.
[16] In considering the relevance of that authority to the case
before him, Cameron J. stated, correctly in my view, that the
issue in Amirault  was different from &#147;that of absolute immunity
for witnesses in the course of legal proceedings.&#148; (para. 18)
[17] The Bateman case was a motion to strike out a statement of
claim by the plaintiff against the corporate defendant and three
of its officers alleging improper conduct in proceedings to
collect a debt. The allegations as framed included abuse of
process and malicious prosecution. Ground J. concluded that abuse
of process can form the basis for a cause of action, where a
legal process is used for an extraneous purpose such as
oppression or extortion. He concluded that the elements of
malicious prosecution (which he appeared to equate with abuse of
process) were not pleaded in that case and therefore those claims
were struck out.
[18] Cameron J. dealt with Bateman again on the basis that &#147;In my
opinion the issue of proceedings taken outside of court or in a
separate action is a different issue with different reasons for
the alleged privilege than is the case with witnesses.&#148; (para.
20) He noted later in his reasons that Samuel Manu-Tech was also
entitled to rely on the privilege even if it used the affidavits
of Talbot and Rayner in legal proceedings to obtain the receiver,
knowing that those affidavits had shortcomings, that is, in
effect, with malice. However he again distinguished that immunity
from the cause of action for malicious prosecution: &#147;Malicious
prosecution can fairly constitute an exception to the restriction
on use in as much as that tort is based on an improper use of the
legal system.&#148; (para. 23)


RESULT</pre>
    <pre>[19] Cameron J. was correct when he struck out the counterclaims
for interference with contractual relations in this case, as they
are clearly based, as pleaded, on the swearing and use of
allegedly false affidavits in this action. The affidavits are
evidence in a legal proceeding and as such are protected by an
absolute privilege. The law is set out in Halsbury&#146;s Laws of
England, Fourth Edition Reissue, 1997, Vol. 28 at para. 97:
          </pre>
    <pre>               97. Absolute privilege. No action lies, whether against
          judges, counsel, jury, witnesses or parties, for words spoken in
          the ordinary course of any proceedings before any court or
          judicial tribunal recognised by law.  The evidence of all
          witnesses or parties speaking with reference to the matter before
          the court is privileged, whether oral or written, relevant or
          irrelevant, malicious or not.  The privilege extends to documents
          properly used and regularly prepared for use in the proceedings.
          Advocates, judges and juries are covered by this privilege.
          However, a statement will not be protected if it is not uttered
          for the purposes of judicial proceedings by someone who has a
          duty to make statements in the course of the proceedings.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A separate action for malicious
          prosecution or the malicious institution or
          abuse of civil proceedings may lie
          independently of the law of defamation.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The immunity extends to any action, however framed, and is
not limited to actions for defamation: See the judgment of Lord
Goddard C.J. in Hargreaves v. Bretherton, [1958] 3 All E.R. 122
Q.B.D. In that case the plaintiff was convicted of an offence as
a result of the defendant&#146;s alleged perjury. Lord Goddard
reviewed many authorities and stated at p. 123:    </pre>
    <pre>          
               &#147;the simple point that I have to decide is whether or
          not an action lies at the suit of the person who says that he has
          been damnified by the person who has given false evidence against
          him. In my opinion it is clear beyond peradventure nowadays that
          such an action will not lie.&#148;
     
</pre>
    <pre>[21] Although counsel attempted to support the pleading by
referring to cases where the issue was the propriety of
allegations of abuse of process, malicious prosecution or
conspiracy in relation to the commencement of legal proceedings,
to the extent that those causes of action exist, and may be
available in certain very narrowly defined circumstances, neither
those causes of action, nor the facts upon which such causes
could be based, were pleaded in the counterclaim in this action.
[22] For reasons not explained, the appellant was not precluded
from amending his counterclaim as against Samuel Manu-Tech and
Rayner, but only against Talbot. No appeal was taken from those
dispositions. I note that any counterclaim against Samuel Manu-
Tech appears to be entirely superfluous and redundant, given the
undertaking as to damages.
[23] The appeal is dismissed with costs.
