</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The expert witness, Dr. Padamadan, was entitled to describe
the nature and extent of the injuries to the complainant&#146;s
vaginal area and to give her opinion that these injuries were
consistent  with the particular form of sexual abuse described by
the complainant.
[2]  Her evidence crossed the line, however, when, in response to
a question from the Crown, she ventured her personal opinion that
the bruise &#147;was caused from sexual abuse.&#148;  The next series of
questions revealed that her opinion in this regard was based on
the history and circumstances as described by the complainant.
[3]  This evidence came as no surprise. Defence counsel had asked
that the expert not be permitted to give it but the trial judge
ruled that it was properly admissible.
[4]  With respect, we are of the view that the trial judge erred.
There was no scientific or medical basis for the doctor&#146;s
opinion. Rather, it rested almost entirely on her belief that the
complainant was telling the truth. The question of the
complainant&#146;s ultimate credibility was for the jury, not Dr.
Padamadan.
[5]  Because the doctor had been permitted to give her opinion,
defence counsel felt obliged to explore it in cross-examination.
This resulted in further evidence that was highly prejudicial to
the appellant. That evidence took two forms.
[6]  First, the doctor confirmed that, in her opinion, it was
more likely than not that the complainant had been sexually
abused as she claimed. Second, it resulted in the doctor sharing
with the jury her understanding that 65 to 70 per cent of
children who complain about sexual abuse are telling the truth.
[7]  In our view, this aspect of the doctor&#146;s testimony was
highly prejudicial to the appellant. It served no purpose other
than to bolster the credibility of the complainant and it left
the jury with the impression that an expert in child sexual abuse
had put her stamp of approval on the complainant&#146;s credibility.
[8]  Given the potential prejudice occasioned by this evidence,
we cannot say that the verdict of the jury would necessarily have
been the same had it been excluded. Accordingly, the conviction
cannot stand.
[9]  In view of our conclusion on this issue, it is unnecessary
to decide the second ground of appeal concerning the trial
judge&#146;s failure to provide a Vetrovec warning to the jury. That
matter is best left to be determined by the trial judge in the
event of a new trial. It is also unnecessary to consider the
sentence appeal. That said, we note that the appellant has served
over two years of his four year sentence and this is a factor
which the Crown will no doubt consider when deciding whether to
proceed with a new trial.
[10] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set
aside, and a new trial is ordered on both charges concerning the
female complainant.</pre></td>
