    <pre>HEARD:         May 6, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Justice G.W. Dandie dated January
31, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge preferred the evidence of the respondent
over that offered by the appellants.  We approach the appeal on
the same basis.
[2]  On the respondent&#146;s evidence, her money was advanced to the
corporate defendant (not an appellant) for a specific purpose,
that is as a capital contribution to a company to be incorporated
in which she would play an active role.  The funds were not used
for that purpose and the defendant never received an interest in
the corporation which in fact was never incorporated.  The
existence of the trust and the consequent breach of that trust by
the corporate defendant were clearly established on the
respondent&#146;s version of events.
[3]  The trial judge further found &#147;the individual defendants
appropriated the plaintiff&#146;s money through their control of the
corporate defendant.&#148;  On the evidence, the individual defendants
(appellants) were aware that the funds were held in trust by the
defendant corporation and they were aware of the purpose of that
trust.  Counsel for the appellant has argued that their was no
basis to impose personal liability on Ruth Rothwell because she
exercised no real authority over the corporate defendant, and
derived no personal benefit from the misappropriation of the
trust funds.  In our view, there was evidence on which the trial
judge could find, as he did, that Ruth Rothwell, the majority
shareholder and bookkeeper of the corporate defendant, was part
of the control group identified by the trial judge, and was privy
to the misappropriation of the trust funds.
[4]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.
