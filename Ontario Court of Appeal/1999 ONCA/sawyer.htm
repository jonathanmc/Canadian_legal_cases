    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Tobias J. with a jury, dated March
20, 1996.

</pre>
    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O., OSBORNE, LABROSSE and CHARRON JJ.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants were convicted of assault causing bodily harm
by  a  court composed of Tobias J. and a jury.  They appeal their
conviction, in writing.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The only ground of appeal relates to the existing common law
and   statutory  principles  respecting  the  secrecy   of   jury
deliberations (&quot;the jury secrecy rules&quot;).  The appellants  attack
the  constitutionality  of the jury secrecy  rules  and  seek  to
tender   fresh  evidence  of  matters  relating   to   the   jury
deliberations.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  At trial, the complainant testified that on May 21, 1994, he
was in a vehicle with the appellants when he was suddenly punched
in  the  face  and kicked by them.  He suffered a fractured  jaw.
The appellants completely denied the incident.</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  appellants were convicted on March 20,  1996  and  the
matter  was  put over for sentencing to May 22,  1996.   On  that
date,  counsel  for the appellants advised the trial  judge  that
after  the  jury had rendered its verdict, a juror had  contacted
one  of the appellants and had alleged that certain improprieties
had   taken  place  during  the  deliberation  process.   Counsel
requested  that the trial judge conduct an inquiry of  the  jury.
The   trial  judge  declined,  holding  that  he  did  not   have
jurisdiction  to  make inquiries of jurors or  impugn  a  verdict
already rendered.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Following the imposition of the sentences, counsel for  the
appellants  requested the Crown to conduct an investigation  into
matters disclosed by the juror.  The Crown refused.
[6]   This appeal raises a similar issue as that which the  court
was  asked to consider in R. v. Pan and R. v. Henderson, released
with this judgment.   For the reasons given by the majority in R.
v.  Pan,  the attack on the constitutionality of the jury secrecy
rules  fails  and  the proposed fresh evidence falls  within  the
scope  of  the  rule  of  exclusion  and  is  inadmissible.   The
application to tender fresh evidence is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.


RELEASED:  APR 13 1999             &#147;Roy R. McMurtry C.J.O.&#148;
          RRM                      &#147;C.A. Osborne J.A.&#148;

FINLAYSON J.A. (dissenting):
</pre>
    <pre>[8]   I  have had the opportunity of reading the judgment of  the
court  in  this  matter.   Consistent with  the  opinion  that  I
expressed  in  R.  v. Pan, released contemporaneously  with  this
judgment,  I  would  not  agree  that  the  trial  judge  had  no
jurisdiction to inquire of the individual jurors concerning their
alleged complaints as expressed to defence counsel through one of
their members.  The impediments to his doing so are in my opinion
unconstitutional.  Whether he sought to do so  on  the  facts  of
this case was a matter for his discretion.
[9]  Accordingly, the appellants have been unconstitutionally
denied their right to challenge the partiality of the jury that
convicted them.  There must be a new trial.
[10] I would allow the appeal, quash the verdict below and order
a new trial.
