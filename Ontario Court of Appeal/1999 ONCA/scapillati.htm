    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Bell dated October 1, 1997

</pre>
    <pre>AUSTIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This action considers the impact of a custom of the trade on
the reasonable notice required for dismissal from employment.
[2]  The plaintiff appeals from the decision of Bell J. that,
although the plaintiff received no notice of termination of his
employment because he was excluded from the coverage of the
Employment Standards Act by reason of the nature of his trade, he
was not entitled to notice at common law either, by reason of a
custom of his trade.
[3]  In my view, Bell J. came to the correct conclusion.
However, I disagree with her reasoning and would reach that
conclusion by a different route.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The plaintiff was trained as a carpenter in Italy.  In 1953,
at age 19 he came to Canada.  From 1957 to 1993, he worked as a
finishing carpenter for residential contractors in the Ottawa
area. Generally speaking, finishing carpenters work inside and
rough or framing carpenters work outside. He was always paid on
an hourly basis and was non-union.
[5]  Mr. Scapillati worked for Hobin Homes for 4 ½ years and then
for Campeau Corp. for 18 years.  He said he left Campeau because
Campeau closed down and didn&#146;t build any more houses.  He said
Campeau let him know three or four months ahead that there would
be no more jobs.  He then worked for Joe Perez Construction for
less than a year before going to work for the defendant.
[6]  Alain Potvin was a superintendent at Perez and in 1980 he
left to start the defendant company.  In 1981 Potvin&#146;s foreman,
Rejean Guindon, asked the plaintiff to come to work for Potvin at
$1.00 more per hour than he was making at Perez.  Guindon said it
would be for a long time and that as long as he, Guindon, was
with Potvin, the plaintiff would have a steady job.  The
plaintiff was persuaded and went to work for Potvin on March 12,
1981.  He stayed there until April 12, 1991.
[7]  During that decade he was laid off from time to time but
went back each time.  He said the layoffs were short &#150; two weeks,
three weeks, one month, mostly around Christmas, between
Christmas and New Year&#146;s and then a few times in the spring,
because of a lack of work.  Each time he would be told it was
temporary: &#147;we will call you back as soon as possible&#148;.
[8]  One year an arrangement was made whereby he remained on
Potvin&#146;s payroll but lived in a hotel in Toronto and worked on
Campeau&#146;s mansion in Toronto from May until Christmas.
[9]  After being laid off by Potvin in April 1991, the plaintiff
went on unemployment insurance.  He also looked for work and
starting on July 15, 1991, worked for Urbandale Corporation
building houses.  This lasted until January 29, 1993 when he was
again laid off due to a shortage of work.
[10] In April 1993 he ran into Guindon at the Home Show.  Guindon
asked him if he was working and when the plaintiff said he was
not, Guindon invited him back to Potvin.  He went back to Potvin
a few days later.  He was there from April 12, 1993 until
December 21, 1993 when he was again laid off.  Again, he was told
that it was temporary and that he would be called back.  Others
were called back but he was not.
[11] No notice of termination was given.  Cause was not an issue;
he was regarded as an excellent employee.  No explanation was
provided as to why others were called back but the plaintiff was
not.  The employer does not contest that the plaintiff was
terminated.
[12] Soon after being laid off, he went on unemployment
insurance.  In November 1994, he applied to the Canada Pension
Plan for a retirement pension.  He was notified that his pension
would start in December 1994.
[13] Defence evidence was given by Potvin, by Richard Sachs of
Urbandale and by Jeffrey J. Doll, an employee or former employee
of Teron Inc., Wimpey Construction and Coscan, all well known
house builders.  Mr. Doll was president of the Ottawa-Carleton
Homebuilders&#146; Association in 1997.  The defence evidence dealt
with two matters &#150; the way the home building industry in the
Ottawa area worked and the matter of notice to hourly rated
workers.
[14] Apart from the ups and downs of the economy, local and
general, employment was directly affected by the way the home
building industry worked.  Builders would subcontract actual
construction to organizations such as that of the defendant and
Urbandale.  These latter would bid on a builder&#146;s work, the bids
being based upon drawings or models of homes and the anticipated
number of each model to be built.  A new contract would be
entered into each year.
[15] Those anticipated numbers, however, were only that.  The
contract would not specify the number of houses.  When
construction got underway, the number of houses actually built
would be the number the builder had been able to sell.  That, in
turn, would vary depending upon a variety of factors.  Thus, the
demand for persons such as the plaintiff could rise or sink
rapidly and, to some extent, unpredictably.  According to Mr.
Doll, &#147;quite often, the work was not continuous&#148;.
[16] All of the defence witnesses testified that hourly rated,
non-union, on-site workers in the residential building sector in
the Ottawa area did not get notice of termination.  Nor did they
give notice; they could work for one contractor one day and
another the next.  They would usually move for more money, but
they were free to change employers as they saw fit, and did so
without notice. The plaintiff moved from Perez to Potvin in 1981
because he could earn a dollar more per hour at Potvin.  Potvin
testified that that happened a lot.
[17] Potvin testified that in his time he had probably done 4,000
lay offs, all without advance notice or pay in lieu of notice.
He also said that in calculating his costs he did not include
anything for severance.  He continued:
          </pre>
    <pre>               That&#146;s why union companies can&#146;t bid on residential right
          now, because they would be a lot more expensive than us.</pre>
    <pre>That is, one of the reasons why unionized businesses could not
compete on residential contracting was because they would have to
include termination or severance pay.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Like the plaintiff, Potvin testified that the people working
on site &#147;can see if there&#146;s work ahead or not.  You know that the
lay off is coming&#148;.  &#147;Almost every year it&#146;s the same story.
When winter comes, there&#146;s a very slow down; and then it starts
back around April.  It&#146;s been that way in construction since I
know it&#148;.
[19] Mr. Doll testified that if notice or pay in lieu of notice
were required to be given to hourly rated on-site construction
workers, it would change the industry and greatly increase the
price of houses.  He was unable to quantify that impact.
[20] The evidence of the defendant&#146;s witnesses was that much of
the labour force under discussion was transient but that the
practice of termination without notice applied to all, whether
long term or not, skilled or not.  The trial judge accepted the
evidence that there was such a custom and that it would apply to
the plaintiff.
[21] She went on to find that the custom was reasonable.  In this
respect, she relied upon the defence evidence and upon the fact
that &#147;By permitting an exemption in s.2 of Regulation 327 of a
person employed on-site in the construction buildings [sic] the
Legislature has recognized no need to given even the minimum
protection accorded to other long term employees under s.57(1)(h)
of the Act&#148;.
[22] The trial judge concluded her reasons as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Having considered all of the evidence, I conclude that there
          was no implied term in the plaintiff&#146;s contract of employment
          that, if he were terminated, he would receive notice, payment in
          lieu of notice or severance pay.  Accordingly, the plaintiff has
          not proved his claim for damages for breach of his employment
          contract.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The trial judge dismissed the action but, before doing so,
assessed the plaintiff&#146;s damages in the event of an appeal.  She
found that the appropriate notice period would have been ten
months and the plaintiff&#146;s damages $24,960.</pre>
    <pre>EMPLOYMENT STANDARDS ACT</pre>
    <pre>[24] Before reviewing the analysis by the trial judge of the
common law right to reasonable notice, reference should be made
to the Employment Standards Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.E.14.
[25] No claim was made under this Act by the plaintiff and no
mention of the Act was made in the statement of claim.
Reference, however, was made to the Act in the statement of
defence.
[26] Section 57(1)(a) of the Act reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               57(1)     No employer shall terminate the employment of an
               employee who has been employed for three months or more unless
               the employer gives,
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  one weeks notice in writing to
                    the employee if his or her period of
                    employment is less than one year;
          </pre>
    <pre>                              &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               and such notice has expired.</pre>
    <pre>Where the employment has been between one and three years, then
two weeks has to be given and so on.  Eight weeks notice in
writing is appropriate if his period of employment is eight years
or more:  s. 57(1)(h)</pre>
    <pre>[27] Section 57(10)(e) reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (10) Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply to,
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (e)   an  employee employed  in  an
                    activity, business, work, trade, occupation
                    or profession, or any part thereof, that is
                    exempted by the regulations.</pre>
    <pre>Ontario Regulation 327, s. 2(e) reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>           Section  57 of the Act does not apply  to  a
person who,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (e)  is employed in the construction, alteration, decoration,
               repair or demolition of buildings, structures, roads, sewers,
               water or gas mains, pipelines, tunnels, bridges, canals or other
               works at the site thereof;</pre>
    <pre>[28] Returning the to Act itself, ss.4(1) and (2) and s. 6 are as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4(1)      An employment standard shall be deemed a minimum
               requirement only.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (2)      A  right, benefit,  term  or
               condition   of   employment   under    a
               contract,  oral or written,  express  or
               implied, or under any other Act  or  any
               schedule,   order  or  regulation   made
               thereunder that provides in favour of an
               employee a higher remuneration in money,
               a  greater  right or benefit  or  lesser
               hours   of  work  than  the  requirement
               imposed by an employment standard  shall
               prevail over an employment standard.
          </pre>
    <pre>               6(1)  No  civil  remedy of  an  employee
               against his or her employer is suspended
               or affected by this Act.</pre>
    <pre>[29] The Act requires employers to give written notice of
termination of employment.  Minimum lengths for such notice
depending upon the duration of the employment are prescribed.  In
the event of failure to give notice, the employer is required to
pay the employee an amount equal to the amount the employee would
have earned during the notice period.  Some industries are
exempted from the application of these provisions.  The standards
are minimums and do not detract from an employee&#146;s rights  at
common law or otherwise.  An employee cannot contract out of the
Act&#146;s requirements.
[30] The trial judge dealt with the Act and its relationship to
this claim in her reasons as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It was not disputed and there is no question that the
          plaintiff was a person who was employed in the construction of
          buildings at the site thereof.  Consequently, s.57(10) of the Act
          and s.2 of Regulation 327 would apply to the plaintiff, thereby
          disentitling the plaintiff to the benefits under s.57(1) of the
          Act, i.e. for an employee employed for less than one year a
          minimum notice of one week and for an employee employed for more
          than eight years a minimum notice of eight weeks.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Counsel for the defendant submitted that
          the  plaintiff  had no common  law  right  to
          damages  for  wrongful dismissal because  the
          common law no longer applies, the Legislature
          having enacted the Employment Standards  Act,
          which,  in  this case, would not entitle  the
          plaintiff  to  any  notice  because  of   the
          exemption  in s.57(1) of the Act and  s.2  of
          Regulation 327.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Section 2 of the Act provides that  the
          Act   applies  to  every  oral  contract   of
          employment in Ontario.  However, s.4(1) makes
          it  clear than employment standard in the Act
          is  only a minimum requirement.  Section 4(2)
          provides  that a greater benefit, express  or
          implied, under an oral contract will  prevail
          over  an  employment standard.  Further,  s.6
          specifically  preserves an  employee&#146;s  civil
          remedy against his or her employer.</pre>
    <pre>[31] Notwithstanding the language of the Act and Regulations and
notwithstanding the clear and correct findings of the trial
judge, counsel for the plaintiff asserted in her factum that her
client was entitled to benefits under the Act.  Counsel was
advised at the outset of the appeal that if she were asserting
any claim under the Act, it should be brought in the first
instance before an enforcement officer of the Ministry of Labour
pursuant to the provisions of the Act.  Re Susan Shoe Industries
and Ricciardi et al (1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 660 (C.A.) at p. 662.
In my view, the sole relevance of the Act and Regulations to this
action is to indicate the position taken by the Ontario
government with respect to on-site construction workers.
[32] Section 57 was added to the legislation in 1981.  In
introducing the legislation, the Minister of Labour, the
Honourable Robert Elgie said amongst other matters:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Regular full-time and part-time employees are eligible for
          severance payment, but not those casual employees who have a
          right to elect whether to work when requested.  Construction
          industry employees who work at construction sites will not be
          eligible.  Their employment is typically irregular and
          intermittent due to the limited duration of most construction
          projects.  The special nature of this industry is recognized by
          all jurisdictions in Canada, which have exempted construction
          workers from the notice-of-termination provisions.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 On-site   construction   workers   are
          excluded from severance pay coverage  because
          of  the special nature of the industry, where
          employment   is   typically   irregular   and
          intermittent; that principle is recognized by
          all jurisdictions in Canada through exclusion
          from   the   termination  notice  provisions.
          [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[33] I turn now to the question whether the trial judge was
correct in concluding that &#147;there was no implied term in the
plaintiff&#146;s contract of employment that, if he were terminated he
would receive notice, payment in lieu of notice or severance
pay&#148;.
[34] Although reference is made to both &#147;termination&#148; and
&#147;severance&#148;, what is in issue in the instant case is
&#147;termination&#148;, the ending of the employment of an individual
employee.  &#147;Severance&#148; has been appropriated by s. 58 of the Act
to refer to employees of at least five years where 50 or more are
discharged over a period of six months or less, or one or more
are discharged by an employer having a payroll of $2.5 million or
more.
[35] Having decided that the Act did not take away the
plaintiff&#146;s common law remedy, the trial judge turned directly to
the question whether there was a custom in the plaintiff&#146;s trade
that no notice was required.  In so doing, the matter of the
giving of reasonable notice was bypassed.  In my respectful view,
an understanding of the giving of such notice and the factors
that go into the calculation of such notice, including customs
and usages, is necessary to an understanding of the resolution of
this matter.
[36] The precise nature of the origin of the giving of reasonable
notice of termination has been the subject of much writing.  In
Allison v. Amoco Production Co. [1975] 5 W.W.L. 501 (Alta. S.C.)
at p.508 MacDonald J., speaking of the source of a term requiring
reasonable notice quoted from 3 Halsbury 58 (Contract) as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A contract is in some cases said to be implied by law.  Such
          an implied contract is really an obligation imposed by law
          independently of any agreement between the parties, and may be
          imposed notwithstanding an expressed intention by one of the
          parties to the contract.  It is not a contract in the true sense
          of the term at all, but an obligation of the class known in civil
          law as quasi-contracts.</pre>
    <pre>[37] In Thomson v. Bechtel Canada Ltd. (1983), 3 C.C.E.L. 16
(H.C.) Osborne J. said at p.19:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The reasonable notice term of this oral contract of
          employment is an implied term.  Whether this term and a term
          relating to the amount of notice are implied by resort to pure
          policy or by an oblique consideration to what the parties would
          have agreed to had they considered the issue at the time of
          hiring, does not matter.  The policy approach seems to me to be
          more realistic than does resort to the law of implied contract.</pre>
    <pre>[38] In Machtinger v. HOJ Industries Ltd.[1992] 1 S.C.R. 986,
Iacobucci J. reviewed the subject, concluding at p.998 that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               For the purposes of this appeal, I would characterize the
          common law principle of termination only on reasonable notice as
          a presumption, rebuttable if the contract of employment clearly
          specifies some other period of notice, whether expressly or
          impliedly.</pre>
    <pre>At p. 1008 McLachlin J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Requirements for reasonable notice in employment contracts
          fall into the category of terms implied by law:  Allison v. Amoco
          Production Co. [citation omitted].  They do not depend upon
          custom or usage, although custom and usage can be an element in
          determining the nature and scope of the legal duty imposed.  Nor
          do they fall into the category of terms implied as a matter of
          fact, where the law supplies a term which the parties overlooked
          but obviously assumed.</pre>
    <pre>[39] Whatever the origin and nature of the practice of giving
reasonable notice of the termination of a contract of employment,
it must be accepted as law.  Two more matters must be considered,
namely, what does &#147;reasonable&#148; mean in this context &#150; and where
does &#147;custom or usage&#148; fit in.
[40] Insofar as &#147;reasonable&#148; is concerned, the seminal case is
Bardal v. Globe &amp; Mail (1960) 24 D.L.R. (2d) 140, McRuer C.J.H.C.
listed the factors at p.145 as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;the character of the employment, the length of service of
          the servant, the age of the servant and the availability of
          similar employment, having regard to the experience, training and
          qualifications of the servant.</pre>
    <pre>Since 1960, a substantial number of additions and refinements
have been made to this list, but these items remain the
foundation upon which what is reasonable is to be determined.</pre>
    <pre>[41] In some cases, there is a custom or usage as to the
appropriate length of notice of dismissal.  In The Contract of
Employment, Freedland M.R. (1976) Oxford University Press at p.
149 the author states that the best known custom of this nature
is that of a month&#146;s notice in the case of domestic servants.  It
is so well established that judicial notice is taken of it.
[42] When a custom is alleged, its proponent has to satisfy the
tests of certainty reasonableness and notoriety or universality.
The role of trade customs in providing for notice of termination
has largely been supplanted by collective agreements and by
statutory provisions, in this case the Employment Standards Act.
Freedland, ibid, p. 150.
[43] In Bardal, supra, McRuer C.J.H.C., before turning to the
question of reasonable notice, stated that &#147;there is no evidence
of custom in the case before me&#148;.
[44] Sometimes the nature of the trade, rather than a specific
usage is relied upon.  In Thomson, supra, Osborne J. said at
pp.19-20:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The defendant takes the position that the amount of notice
          to which the plaintiff is entitled must take into account the
          nature of the industry in which the plaintiff became a small, but
          relatively important, yet eventually dispensable part.  The
          cyclical nature of the defendant&#146;s business is conceded, and is
          beyond dispute.  The defendant&#146;s business, and for that matter,
          that of its U.S. parent, is a project-oriented business.  The
          emphasis seems to have tended towards mega-projects.  How does
          the nature of the industry and the nature of the defendant&#146;s
          business affect the issue of notice to which the plaintiff is
          entitled?&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                If the purpose of reasonable notice  is
          to  provide a period in which, in theory,  an
          employee   can  readjust  by  finding   other
          employment  the defendant&#146;s argument  becomes
          somewhat  circular.  The more precarious  the
          industry,  or the more sensitive an  industry
          is  to economic downturns, the more it can be
          said that additional time will be required to
          relocate within that industry.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               At best, I view the general issue of the
          cyclical  nature  of  the  industry  and  the
          economic factors issue as being factors to be
          considered   along  with   many   others   in
          determining what notice the plaintiff  should
          have been given.</pre>
    <pre>[45] The custom of the trade was not argued in Thomson, rather it
was suggested that by reason of the nature of the trade in which
the plaintiff was employed, relatively short notice should have
been anticipated.
[46] Nor was custom of the trade argued in Boyd v. Culliton
Brothers Limited (1995), 13 C.C.E.L. (2d) 205.  In that case, the
issue was whether or the plaintiff was exempted from the minimum
notice requirements of s.57 of the Employment Standards Act by
reason of being in the construction industry.  Again, no issue
was raised with respect to custom of the trade.  In his reasons,
however, Misener J. said at p.213:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;The construction industry exceptions are intended to
          recognize the employment problems peculiar to that industry.  The
          industry suffers from frequent, unpredictable, and rapid
          expansions and contractions in its activities, not only because
          of the sudden ups and downs of the market, but as well because of
          changes in the seasons.  Unlike other industries, a significant
          percentage of its work force is hired on a temporary basis, and
          for the execution of a specific project or a specific number of
          projects.  It was my impression that the government was of the
          view that the industry should not be saddled with requirements of
          notice of termination, termination pay and severance pay with
          respect to these temporary employees, and that that was the
          purpose &#150; and the only purpose &#150; that the exceptions with which I
          am dealing were intended to accomplish.</pre>
    <pre>[47] Krewenchuk v. Lewis Construction Ltd. (1985), 8 C.C.E.L. 206
(B.C.S.C.) is on its facts very close to the instant case.  The
plaintiff had been employed from 1956 to 1982 as a carpenter&#146;s
apprentice, a journeyman finishing carpenter and a foreman, with
interruptions for short lay-offs and a two-year period of self-
employment.  In 1982, he was laid off but not asked to return.
He sued for damages for wrongful dismissal.  The defendant
raised, by way of defence, a custom of the trade that persons in
the plaintiff&#146;s class were dismissed without notice.  Sheppard
J., allowing the plaintiff&#146;s claim, said at p.211:
          </pre>
    <pre>               On the evidence, the defendant has failed to satisfy me that
          there is a custom and usage in the non-union construction
          industry that long term employees can be terminated without
          notice and without severance pay.  The evidence clearly
          establishes that short term employees can be laid off between
          projects without notice or severance pay, but that is not the
          case here.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Clearly then, as counsel have agreed, at
          common  law,  the plaintiff  is  entitled  to
          notice.  The question is how much.</pre>
    <pre>He concluded that 12 months notice was appropriate.</pre>
    <pre>[48] The establishment of a custom or usage does not end the
discussion; the court may accept it or reject it.  In Andrews v.
Pacific Coast Coal Mines Limited (1909), 13 W.L.R. 306 (B.C.C.A.)
Irving J.A. held at p.310 that a usage of no notice at all might
be proven but not given effect because it &#147;could not be
sanctioned by the court&#148;.
[49] In any event, if a custom or usage is proven, it becomes
simply a factor to be taken into account, with other factors, in
determining what is reasonable notice in the particular
circumstances of a case.  In Employment Law in Canada, 2d ed.
Christie; England and Cotter Butterworths (1993) at p. 626, it is
stated that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Custom
          </pre>
    <pre>                A  custom regarding the length  of  the
          notice   period  should  theoretically   take
          precedence   over   the   determination    of
          &#147;reasonable&#148;   notice   under   the   &#147;strict
          contractualist&#148; paradigm, for a  custom  will
          only  be  recognized by the courts if  it  is
          &#147;reasonable, certain and notorious&#148; such that
          it  can  be  said to represent  the  parties&#146;
          unexpressed  intention.  Indeed, some  courts
          have  acknowledged  this logic  even  to  the
          extent of upholding one custom which provided
          for  no  notice  at  all  and  another  which
          provided  that an hourly wage-rated  employee
          was  entitled  to  only  one  hour&#146;s  notice.
          However,  other more modern courts have  held
          that  even a strictly proven custom will  not
          automatically dictate the notice period,  but
          simply  constitutes another  factor  to  take
          into   account  in  determining  &#147;reasonable&#148;
          notice.   The  latter  approach,  of  course,
          relegates    the    &#147;strict   contractualist&#148;
          paradigm firmly to second place, allowing the
          court  to  effectuate its own policy  choices
          under the &#147;reasonable&#148; notice test. [Emphasis
          added]</pre>
    <pre>[50] The case cited for the upholding of a custom which provided
for no notice at all is Andrews v. Pacific Coast Coal Mines Ltd.,
supra.  In my view, it does not support the proposition.  In that
case, the trial judge rejected evidence of the custom of the
trade, found that a month&#146;s notice would be reasonable and
awarded damages in lieu thereof.  On appeal, the four person
panel split two and two so the trial judgment remained.
[51] In my view, the instant case resolves itself into the
question what is reasonable notice here and in the light of all
the circumstances, including custom, can that be no notice?
[52] In reaching this conclusion, I rely on the evidence of both
Mr. Scapillati and Mr. Potvin to the effect that a person on the
site could see what was going to happen.  Mr. Scapillati said
that &#147;at Urbandale&#133;we could see it was slowing down.  They told
us it was getting bad.  You don&#146;t need the boss to tell you when
you&#146;re running out of work; you just have to look where they&#146;re
building the homes and you can tell that they&#146;re running out of
work.  The workers can figure that one out&#148;.  Potvin testified
that the people working on the site &#147;can see if there&#146;s work
ahead or not.  You know that the lay off is coming&#148;&#133;. &#147;Almost
every year it&#146;s the same story.  When winter comes, there&#146;s a
very slow down; and then it starts back around April.  It&#146;s been
that way in construction since I know it.
[53] I rely as well on the fact that Potvin did not choose the
plaintiff&#146;s trade; Mr. Scapillati did.  That trade, at least in
Ontario, is seasonal.  It also both prospers and declines, being
strongly influenced by business cycles both general and local, by
interest rates and by legislation.
[54] The irregular nature of the on-site construction industry is
not limited to the Ottawa area.  It is specifically recognized in
the legislation of this province and, apparently, in the
legislation of other provinces as well.  See also  Krewenchuk,
supra.
[55] Consideration must be given to the purposes of notice,
perhaps the main one being to alert the employee to the necessity
of looking for other employment.  In light of the description of
the industry in the evidence, it is questionable how useful
notice would be in the circumstances.  When one employer is
laying off, it appears unlikely that others will be hiring.
[56] The parties are agreed that the slow down in work and the
end of work is foreseeable.  In the circumstances, where the
plaintiff admittedly can foretell his lay off, is there still a
duty on the part of the employer to give notice?  Not
surprisingly, the court was referred to no jurisprudence on this
point.  In the instant case, I would answer in the negative and
agree with the trial judge that the usage, at least in these
circumstances, is reasonable.
[57] In reaching this conclusion, I attach considerable
significance to the fact that Mr. Scapillati worked for Urbandale
for approximately a year and a half.  The circumstances are
therefore not similar to the situation in Cronk v. Canadian
General Insurance Company (1995), 14 C.C.E.L. (2d) 1 (C.A.).
There Mrs. Cronk &#147;spent practically all her working years as an
employee&#148; of the defendant, leaving only to raise a family, and
working two-thirds of that time for the same employer through a
temporary employment agency.  That is not the instant case.
[58] Mr. Krewenchuk also had interruptions in his employment.
He, however, was back with his employer for eight years before
the final lay off.  In this regard, the trial judge said at p.212
&#147;Here I regard the interruptions in employment as being
relatively unimportant and look on the plaintiff as a long-term
employee who was trusted sufficiently by his employer that he was
named foreman on many projects&#148;.  In reaching the conclusion that
the interruptions in employment were relatively unimportant, the
trial judge appears to have relied on the decision in Gordon v.
Saint John Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. (1983), 47 N.B.R. (2d)
150.  In that case, there was a total of 39 years employment with
an interruption at the 30 year point.  Hoyt J. said at p.155:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the circumstances, I am not convinced that it is a matter
          of substantial importance in considering the notice to which Mr.
          Gordon is entitled, that is, should it be based on nine years or
          thirty-nine years.</pre>
    <pre>[59] In Krewenchuk, supra, the question was whether he was an
employee of twenty-three years, seven years or three and a half
years.  In the instant case, the periods are ten and three
quarters years and just over nine months, but between them is a
year and a half at Urbandale.  In these particular circumstances,
the plaintiff must be regarded as a relatively short term
employee in considering what would be reasonable notice.
[60] In all of these circumstances, I am unable to find that the
trial judge erred in reaching the conclusion she did.  I would
therefore dismiss the plaintiff&#146;s appeal with costs.
[61] The trial judge awarded the defendant its costs on a party
and party scale to April 23, 1997 and on a solicitor and client
scale thereafter.  The appellant asks for leave to appeal this
award.
[62] The trial judge&#146;s endorsement respecting costs reads as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Counsel have made submissions today on costs.  In this case
          the plaintiff&#146;s claim was dismissed.  On April 23, 1997
          immediately after the pre-trial, the defendant made a written
          offer that the action be dismissed without costs.  At that time,
          the defendant&#146;s actual costs were over $10,000.  The plaintiff
          rejected that offer in writing and proceeded to trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that
          no  costs should be awarded because there was
          no  Ontario precedent in an area of important
          public    concern    to    the    residential
          construction  industry.  Notwithstanding  the
          lack  of  precedents  in  Ontario  there  was
          precedent  in  British Columbia which  should
          have  alerted the plaintiff to  the  need  to
          support  his  legal position with appropriate
          evidence.  None was called and I accepted the
          defendant&#146;s expert and other evidence on  the
          issue.  Consequently, this is not a case  for
          no costs.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  my  view the case falls within  the
          principles  enunciated in S. and A.  Strasser
          Limited  v. Richmond Hill (1990) 1 O.R.  (3d)
          243   (C.A.).   Accordingly,  I   award   the
          defendant party and party costs to April  23,
          1997   and   solicitor   and   client   costs
          thereafter.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The defendant has sought to have me fix
          costs.   Counsel for the plaintiff  submitted
          that costs should be assessed because no Bill
          of  Costs  had  been prepared.  However,  all
          bills  rendered  to  the defendant  had  been
          produced  and counsel for the plaintiff  made
          no  specific reference to any item  in  those
          accounts  in his submission.  I am  satisfied
          that  I  have sufficient information  to  fix
          costs  and that it is appropriate that  I  do
          so.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Accordingly, I fix costs in the  amount
          requested by the defendant of $22,835.62.</pre>
    <pre>[63] As the plaintiff&#146;s claim failed, Rule 49 has no application
whatever.  Strasser, supra, at p. 245.  But the principle upon
which solicitor and client costs were awarded in Strasser is a
very narrow one.  The plaintiff had made a claim for $1 million,
the defendant made an offer after discovery of $30,000 and the
action was dismissed at trial.  In the instant case, no similar
offer was made.  While the trial judge in the instant case made
an award of solicitor and client costs, it does not appear from
the record that she felt as strongly about it as the trial judge
in Strasser who said &#147;I think this case, in these circumstances,
screams for solicitor and client costs&#148;.
[64] I agree with the trial judge&#146;s opinion that in view of the
complete disclosure made by the defence, the plaintiff should
have been better prepared.  I do not however see that as
justifying a award of solicitor and client costs.
[65] I would grant leave to appeal the award of costs, allow that
appeal and vary the order below by reducing it to an award to the
defendant of party and party costs to be assessed.</pre>
