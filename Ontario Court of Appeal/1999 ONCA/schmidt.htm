COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            GERALD H. SCHMIDT (Plaintiff/Respondent) &#150;and&#150;
               COATINGS 85 LIMITED (Defendant/Appellant)</pre>

    <pre>               Paul L. Seitz, for the plaintiff/respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         May 12, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgments of Herold J., dated October 10,
1997, made at Guelph, and dated November 3, 1997, made at Milton.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]       This case turned on the issue of credibility between
the respondent and a fellow employee with whom he had a number of
private conversations in which he may have made some indiscreet
comments about the personnel of his employer company.  The
employee had reported to management his version of these
statements that he maintained constituted disloyalty to
management on the part of the respondent.  This led to the
respondent&#146;s dismissal.  The respondent denied most of the
allegations and the trial judge expressly believed him and
rejected the testimony of the fellow employee.  In the
circumstances, he then found that the employer was not justified
in discharging the respondent for cause.  He awarded damages
based on twelve months notice and, in addition, awarded $15,000
in aggravated damages.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge&#146;s finding that the respondent was wrongfully
dismissed is entirely supported by the evidence and we see no
reason to interfere. However, the trial judge was in error in
believing that he was in the position to award either aggravated
or punitive damages without a finding that there was an
actionable wrong separate from the wrongful dismissal.  See
Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (1989), 58
D.L.R. (4th) 193 (S.C.C.), Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.
(1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.) and Beaird v. Westinghouse
Canada Inc. [199] O.J. No. 893.  In the latter case this court
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Aggravated damages are compensatory, while punitive
          damages, as the name implies, constitute a punishment imposed
          upon a person by the court.  Before either aggravated or punitive
          damages can be awarded, a separate actionable wrong must be
          demonstrated by the plaintiff.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The respondent conceded that there was no finding by the
trial judge of a separate actionable wrong but, in support of the
additional $15,000 award, relied on language used by Mr. Justice
Iacobucci in giving the majority decision in Wallace v. United
Grain Growers Ltd., supra, where he said at paragraph 74 at p.27:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Court of Appeal concluded that there was insufficient
          evidence to support a finding that the actions of UGG constituted
          a separate actionable wrong either in tort or in contract.  I
          agree with these findings and see no reason to disturb them.  I
          note, however, that in circumstances where the manner of
          dismissal has caused mental distress but falls short of an
          independent actionable wrong, the employee is not without
          recourse.  Rather, the trial judge has discretion in these
          circumstances to extend the period of reasonable notice to which
          an employee is entitled.  Thus, although recovery for mental
          distress might not be available under a separate head of damages,
          the possibility of recovery still remains.  I will be returning
          to this point in my discussion of reasonable notice below.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  And further at paragraph 88 at p.31:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The appellant urged this Court to recognize the ability of a
          dismissed employee to sue in contract or alternatively in tort
          for &#147;bad faith discharge&#148;.  Although I have rejected both as
          avenues for recovery, by no means do I condone the behaviour of
          employers who subject employees to callous and insensitive
          treatment in their dismissal, showing no regard for their
          welfare.  Rather, I believe that such bad faith conduct in the
          manner of dismissal is another factor that is properly
          compensated for by an addition to the notice period.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  However, a review of the record in this case discloses
nothing in the &#147;manner of dismissal&#148; of the respondent as opposed
to the &#147;fact of dismissal&#148; that would have entitled the trial
judge to exercise his discretion and extend the notice period
even if he had sought to do so.  As the trial judge acknowledged,
the respondent was not entitled to a formal hearing before he was
discharged.  In fact he was given the opportunity to comment on
the remarks attributed to him by his fellow employee and he took
advantage of the occasion.  We see nothing unusual about the
manner of his termination.
[6]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part by striking out
paragraph two of the formal judgment which awarded aggravated
damages in the sum of $15,000.  It is now apparent that with this
reduction in the overall award, the basis upon which the trial
judge awarded solicitor-and-client costs to the respondent
pursuant to an offer to settle is no longer justified. It is
conceded by the respondent&#146;s counsel that the appropriate order
now for costs at trial is that the respondent receive his costs
on a party-and-party basis.
[7]  Success on the appeal was divided and accordingly there
should be no costs in this court.</pre>
