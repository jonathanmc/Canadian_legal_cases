</pre>
    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Bank&quot;)
appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Kiteley
dated May 15, 1997 whereby the respondent (hereinafter referred
to as &quot;Schumacher&quot;)  was awarded damages for constructive
dismissal in excess of 1.7 million dollars. Schumacher cross-
appeals in relation to the period of notice to which he was
entitled, the damages awarded in relation to his bonus and the
failure to award him his costs on a solicitor-client scale from
September 21, 1995.
FACTS
[2]  Schumacher commenced employment with the Bank in May 1984 as
a trainee and, by the fiscal year which ended shortly before his
departure in 1995, he had become a Senior Vice-President and was
within the top five earners in the Bank earning $1,600,000.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In 1993 Schumacher was assigned responsibility for the
development and implementation of a program known as the
Navigator Project, which was an extensive reorganization of the
Treasury Group's operations within the Bank.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  As a result of the implementation of the Navigator Project,
Schumacher was promoted to the position of Global Head of Trading
with responsibility for all of the Bank's worldwide trading and
risk management.  He was responsible for all trading in the
following five areas: derivatives, fixed income, money market,
funding (including repos) and foreign exchange.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  By January of 1995, Schumacher had one hundred and two
people reporting to him directly and indirectly (referred to as
&quot;reports&quot;).  The trial judge found that &quot;Schumacher and members
of his group handled trillions of dollars of investments&quot; and
that his job was &quot;much bigger than any other in the Canadian
Market.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The President of the Bank, A. Charles Baillie, agreed at
trial that he had told Schumacher that &quot;he was one of four or
five of the officers of his generation who, with skill and with a
little luck and continued good performance, should be in the
group running the Bank, meaning at the level of executive vice
president and up.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[7]  On January 23, 1995 the Bank hired Donald A. Wright as a
Vice-Chairman, T.D.S.I., to take over from the respondent his
responsibility for fixed income, money market trading and bond
borrowing and lending (repo business).  Schumacher would retain
foreign exchange, derivatives and bank funding.  Schumacher was
not consulted in relation to the hiring of Wright and he learned
of the hiring as a result of the news &gt;leaking' before a formal
announcement.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The trial judge described Schumacher's reaction to the news
in part as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          He considered that the unbroken pattern of
          promotions, and ever increasing
          responsibilities and accountabilities which
          he had enjoyed for the previous ten years,
          had come to an abrupt halt. Instead of
          expanding responsibilities, his job was
          reduced.  Schumacher thought that this
          signalled the end of his career at the Bank.
          He felt that it was the worst day of his
          life.</pre>
    <pre>                              .....</pre>
    <pre>          In the late afternoon, Schumacher assembled
          his direct reports, a group of 6 to 8, and
          told them the news - which by then they all
          had known unofficially. Schumacher said that
          he felt vulnerable because he couldn't answer
          some of the questions, such as who would be
          responsible for Fixed Income Research and
          whether the hiring of Wright meant the
          dismantling of Navigator.  He had never been
          in a position of not knowing answers to such
          questions.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Prior to the hiring of Wright, Schumacher's immediate
superior Ken Foxcroft, an Executive Vice-President, prepared a
memorandum which included the following statement:</pre>
    <pre>          (1)  Be prepared to offer C.J. Schumacher a
          package (constructive dismissal).</pre>
    <pre>[10] Three witnesses were called on behalf of Schumacher at trial
in relation to the implications for his job and career as a
result of the hiring of Wright.  The trial judge referred to
their evidence in her judgment, in part, as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          (i)  Robert Catani</pre>
    <pre>               Robert Catani had worked for the bank
               for about ten  years.  In his last
               position he had been Chief Dealer,
               Government Trading...he  reported to
               Schumacher.  Since Schumacher was in
               charge of liability trading for the
               entire bank, including bonds, money
               market, capital markets and foreign
               exchange, it was Schumacher who was &quot;the
               number one guy&quot;.  He was &quot;the man&quot;, &quot;the
               person that you went to for everything.
               He was in charge, he was the pulse of
               the trading room.&quot; ... Schumacher had
               reached the &quot;pinnacle of success&quot; ...</pre>
    <pre>               Catani heard about the Wright hire from
               other dealers on the street ... He said
               that he felt that Schumacher was &quot;now
               suddenly not in charge and that he was
               being pushed off somewhere else. ...&quot;
               He concluded that Schumacher was not
               &quot;the man anymore.&quot;  The hiring of Wright
               meant that Schumacher &quot;had just been,
               you know, fired, canned from most of his
               job.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>          (ii) Nick Hungerford</pre>
    <pre>               Nick Hungerford had worked at the Bank
               in Toronto since June, 1992... By early
               1995 he had reported to Schumacher for
               about two years...  He also expressed
               surprise [regarding the Wright hire]
               A...because it was my view that John's
               star was on the rise within the bank and
               that he was within the loop as far as
               strategy and that he was going to play a
               leading role in that strategy, so to do
               this was effectively demoting John.  So,
               to me, it sent a clear message that John
               was out of the loop, he wasn't involved
               in this decision.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>                              .....
                                </pre>
    <pre>               It was his view that instead of
               Schumacher's next move being to a very
               high level in the bank, &quot;his career had
               ground to a screaming halt.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     Arthur Filip</pre>
    <pre>               From 1989 to January 1994, he [Filip]
               had been Manager of Human Resources for
               Corporate and Investment Banking...</pre>
    <pre>               He was asked what it would mean to an
               employee who had responsibility for
               Money Markets, Fixed Income and Bonds,
               and those responsibilities were taken
               away.  He said with considerable
               hesitation that it meant that the &quot;job
               was getting smaller.  It could be viewed
               as a loss of responsibility, the
               opposite of promotion, a demotion.&quot;
               When a similar question was asked, but
               related to Schumacher, rather than the
               hypothetical employee, he gave the same
               answer, again with hesitation.</pre>
    <pre>[11] It should be emphasized that the witness Filip was a senior
employee at the Bank when he gave evidence at trial.  He attended
and testified as a result of a summons by Schumacher's counsel.</pre>
    <pre>[12] In respect to the evidence of Catani and Hungerford, the
trial judge stated in her reasons that &quot;I accept their compelling
evidence that they would perceive the change as a demotion.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[13] In a letter dated January 25, 1995 Schumacher's legal
counsel, Robert L. Colson, delivered a letter to the Bank which
stated in part as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          Our client has been stripped of a substantial
          portion of his overall responsibilities which
          the employer has reassigned to another as
          part of what has been described to him as a
          reorganization.  Mr. Schumacher was given no
          notice whatsoever of these intended changes,
          and needless to say, it has not been
          suggested by Toronto Dominion that there is
          lawful cause such as to permit the employer
          to make these changes unilaterally without
          proper and appropriate notice.  We regard the
          changes as fundamental and they unarguably
          constitute a significant diminution of
          responsibilities and thus a demotion
          amounting in law to a constructive dismissal.</pre>
    <pre>          In view of the fact that the employer does
          not wish to continue the existing employment
          arrangement, our client is reluctantly
          prepared to enter into negotiations for an
          appropriate termination package.</pre>
    <pre>          ...[O]ur client is prepared to assist TD by
          remaining in his present position and
          continuing to fulfil his overall
          responsibilities for so long as negotiations
          continue and appear to be making progress,
          provided that it is understood that in doing
          so he is not to be taken as having waived the
          legal consequences of the changes or to have
          condoned them.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The Bank relies on this letter as part of its submission
that Schumacher resigned. The trial judgment noted that
Schumacher insisted that &quot;his intention was not to leave the bank
but to get involved in a process that would give him more
information.&quot;  In fact, Schumacher continued to communicate with
the Bank and on January 25, 1995 sent an e-mail to the Bank's
most senior executives as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          The only request I would have made is that in
          the circumstances, given the obviously
          significant degree to which my
          responsibilities have been cut, is that I had
          been given the opportunity to have portrayed
          it to my reports and to the trading room as a
          whole, as a decision I was involved in and
          one which I therefore supported in the best
          interests of TD.  I did my best but being
          given no warning and having KBF [Foxcroft]
          tell me virtually nothing in terms of his
          reasoning or what I did to warrant this type
          of treatment or any detail as to what role
          and opportunities were going forward left me
          in a tough position.  Again, I did my best
          but I could have done a better job for you if
          I had had some help.</pre>
    <pre>          On a personal note, I always did my best for
          TD and although I understand these things
          happen I would have hoped I had earned an
          explanation of the reasoning behind such a
          big change in my career and life.  In now
          basically 2 days of trying I have been unable
          to get one.</pre>
    <pre>          I am assuming there is a strong message in
          this silence.</pre>
    <pre>In Schumacher's cross-examination at trial he described this e-
mail as &quot;a cry for help from senior people at the bank.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[15] On January 27, 1995 Foxcroft wrote Schumacher instructing
him to return to work on January 30, 1995.  On January 29, 1995
Schumacher wrote to Foxcroft stating that he did not wish &quot;to be
considered by the bank to have ignored your letters but only
wish, in what I would describe as difficult circumstances, to
have the opportunity to digest the events of last week more
thoroughly.&quot;  On January 30, 1995 his legal counsel, Colson,
wrote to Foxcroft reiterating his concern about &quot;the Bank's
imposition of these unannounced and unilateral changes&quot; on
Schumacher and that his client had &quot;suffered substantial
humiliation because of the way in which the Bank has chosen to
handle this matter.&quot;  The letter concluded by stating that
A...[a] return to work in these circumstances, and particularly
while matters remain unresolved, would constitute a further
embarrassment to him.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[16] Foxcroft responded to Colson's letter by again writing
directly to Schumacher, instructing him to return to work on
February 1, 1995.  Schumacher replied to the Bank on February 2,
1995 after the Bank waived its &quot;request&quot; to return to work on
February 1, that</pre>
    <pre>          I am prepared to continue discussions and I
          await further word from you.</pre>
    <pre>[17] A memorandum by Allen Bell, Senior Vice-President Human
Resources Division, was prepared following a meeting with
Schumacher which took place on February 6, 1995.  The purpose of
the meeting was to &quot;discuss the financial magnitude of the
revised position identified to John in the previous weeks.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[18] On February 7, 1995, Foxcroft wrote to Schumacher stating
that &quot;We [the Bank] remain convinced that your position has not
been changed materially and there will be no significant adverse
impact as a result of this restructuring.&quot;  The letter concluded
by requiring him to return to work on February 8, 1995 at 10:00
a.m.</pre>
    <pre>[19] On February 8, letters were sent by Colson to the Bank and
by the Bank to Schumacher, which crossed in their delivery.  The
Colson letter stated that while the changes in Schumacher's
employment &quot;constitute a repudiation by the Bank of the current
employment relationship amounting to constructive dismissal&quot;,
Schumacher &quot;remains willing to continue the dialogue concerning
these issues.&quot;  The letter from the Bank to Schumacher, which was
sent before the Colson letter was received, advised him that the
Bank concluded &quot;from all of your actions, that you have resigned
from our employ&quot; and that the resignation was to be effective
immediately.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
[20] The legal issues, in my view, were correctly outlined by the
trial judge in her reasons as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          The plaintiff alleges that</pre>
    <pre>          (a) the unilateral changes which were imposed
          upon him by the bank as a consequence of the
          hiring of Wright amount to a constructive
          dismissal;</pre>
    <pre>          (b) he has fulfilled his obligation to
          mitigate his damages; and</pre>
    <pre>          (c) in the alternative to (a) the plaintiff
          was wrongfully dismissed on February 8, 1995.</pre>
    <pre>          The defendants take the position that:</pre>
    <pre>          (a) the changes caused by the hiring of
          Wright did not amount to a constructive
          dismissal; rather Schumacher simply refused
          to accept a new assignment;</pre>
    <pre>          (b) the plaintiff had a duty to mitigate
          which was fulfilled in so far as attempts to
          obtain employment are concerned, but that he
          should have remained at the Bank in the new
          position offered to him; and</pre>
    <pre>          (c) in the alternative to (a), Schumacher's
          refusal to return to work was unjustified and
          amounted to repudiation of his employment
          contract, and permitted the Bank to treat the
          contract at an end.</pre>
    <pre>Constructive Dismissal</pre>
    <pre>[21] In Farber v. Royal Trust Company, [1997] 145 D.L.R. (4th) 1
the Supreme Court of Canada stated at p. 14:</pre>
    <pre>          However, each constructive dismissal case
          must be decided on its own facts, since the
          specific features of each employment contract
          and each situation must be taken into account
          to determine whether the essential terms of
          the contract have been substantially changed.</pre>
    <pre>[22] The Ontario Court of Appeal in Reynolds v. Innopac Inc.
(1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 577 commented upon Farber v. Royal Trust at
p.582-3 as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          The latest decision of the Supreme Court of
          Canada on the question of constructive
          dismissal, Farber v. Royal Trust Co., [1997]
          1 S.C.R. 846, 145 D.L.R. (4th) 1, was
          released the same day as the hearing of this
          appeal.  It does not, in my view, change the
          law of constructive dismissal, but it does
          articulate clearly the question which the
          trial judge must answer on the facts of the
          case.  At pp. 858-59 of his reasons,
          concurred in by all members of the court
          sitting on the appeal, Gonthier J. sets out
          the concept of constructive dismissal as it
          is understood in civil law and defines common
          law constructive dismissal in the same
          manner.  He states:</pre>
    <pre>                 Where an employer decides unilaterally
               to make substantial changes to the
               essential terms of an employee's
               contract of employment and the employee
               does not agree to the changes and leaves
               his or her job, the employee has not
               resigned, but has been dismissed.  Since
               the employer has not formally dismissed
               the employee, this is referred to as
               &quot;constructive dismissal&quot;.  By
               unilaterally seeking to make substantial
               changes to the essential terms of the
               employment contract, the employer is
               ceasing to meet its obligations and is
               therefore terminating the contract.</pre>
    <pre>                              .....
                                </pre>
    <pre>                 To reach the conclusion that an
               employee has been constructively
               dismissed, the court must therefore
               determine whether the unilateral changes
               imposed by the employer substantially
               altered the essential terms of the
               employee's contract of employment.  For
               this purpose, the judge must ask
               whether, at the time the offer was made,
               a reasonable person in the same
               situation as the employee would have
               felt that the essential terms of the
               employment contract were being
               substantially changed.  The fact that
               the employee may have been prepared to
               accept some of the changes is not
               conclusive, because there might be other
               reasons for the employee's willingness
               to accept less than what he or she was
               entitled to have.</pre>
    <pre>               Moreover, for the employment contract to
               be resiliated, it is not necessary for
               the employer to have intended to force
               the employee to leave his or her
               employment or to have been acting in bad
               faith when making substantial changes to
               the contract's essential terms.
               [Emphasis added in original]</pre>
    <pre>[23] The trial judge drew the following conclusions as a result
of the reallocation of responsibilities between Schumacher and
Donald Wright:</pre>
    <pre>          (1)  Two of the [five] products were no
               longer Schumacher's responsibility;</pre>
    <pre>          (2)  Fixed Income was the product with the
               greatest potential for growth.
               According to Schumacher, it was the
               &quot;flagship business&quot; of any investment
               banking operation and was considered by
               industry standards to be one of the two
               most important businesses in any
               treasury operation.  Bell agreed that
               Fixed Income and derivatives were the
               two &quot;prestigious products&quot; and that
               Schumacher lost one of them.  Bell also
               agreed that Schumacher was left without
               any investment banking business;</pre>
    <pre>          (3)  the synergy arising from Schumacher's
               leadership in five areas was lost;</pre>
    <pre>          (4)  the position description which
               represented nine months of collaboration
               and analysis leading up to the
               implementation of Navigator no longer
               applied.  It is simplistic to say, as
               Foxcroft asserted, that certain products
               were no longer Schumacher's
               responsibility.  The concept of
               delivering services designed to address
               client needs (as was the foundation of
               Navigator) was abandoned.  Schumacher's
               1993/4 &quot;notable achievements&quot; were
               obliterated;</pre>
    <pre>          (5)  The hiring of Wright caused the roll
               back of Navigator which was a novel and
               creative reorganization, spearheaded by
               Schumacher in consultation with all
               those affected, which had dramatically
               increased profitability in its first
               part-year of performance;</pre>
    <pre>          (6)  Schumacher lost the opportunity to make
               broad recommendations affecting all five
               areas and participate in their
               implementation; and</pre>
    <pre>          (7)  Schumacher's objectives, as set out in
               the Position Document, could not be met
               in many respects because he no longer
               had control nor direction over important
               products and research.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge found that Schumacher  &quot;had established on a
balance of probabilities that his duties and responsibilities had
been fundamentally changed by the unilateral action of the
employer.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[25] The trial judge also found that Schumacher's loss of bonus
&quot;may be as high as 25-30%&quot; but that it &quot;was at least 15%&quot;, which
was an additional loss which &quot;adds to the many other losses&quot;
experienced by Schumacher.</pre>
    <pre>[26] These findings of fact were amply supported in the evidence,
and were open to the trial judge to make.</pre>
    <pre>[27] In my view the finding of the trial judge that Schumacher
had not resigned but had been constructively dismissed is amply
supported by the evidence.  Significant changes were imposed by
the Bank which substantially altered essential terms of
Schumacher's contract of employment.  The removal of such
significant parts of his job, which was not agreed to by
Schumacher, objectively represented a demotion or reduction in
his job responsibilities.  Equally significant was the loss of
bonus imposed on him.  A reasonable person in the respondent's
situation would have felt that the essential terms of his
employment contract had been substantially changed.</pre>
    <pre>[28] The trial judge also found a breach of an implied term of
Schumacher's employment to be consulted in advance of the hiring
of anyone like Wright who was to perform the tasks so closely
related to Schumacher's responsibilities. I do not find it
necessary to agree that there was such an implied term.  However,
the fact that Schumacher was not consulted about the hiring,
given his senior, important and particular responsibilities is
further evidence of the Bank's repudiation of Schumacher's status
with the Bank and therefore relevant to the issue of constructive
dismissal.
Wrongful Dismissal
[29] I am also of the view that there was evidence upon which the
trial judge could have found that Schumacher was wrongfully
dismissed on February 8, 1995.  While Schumacher's legal counsel
had taken the position that Schumacher had been constructively
dismissed, the evidence indicates that there were still ongoing
discussions between the Bank and Schumacher which suggest that
his continuing employment was within the contemplation of both
parties.  However, these discussions, which were characterized as
&quot;informal&quot; discussions by the Bank, were abruptly terminated by
the Bank when it decided to go the &quot;formal route&quot; just before its
letter of February 8, 1995 to Schumacher.  In my  view the Bank
should have given Schumacher additional time in which to finally
determine whether or not he intended to remain in the Bank's
employ.</pre>
    <pre>Mitigation</pre>
    <pre>[30] The Bank submits that there was an opportunity for
Schumacher to mitigate his damages by taking the position that
was available to him at the Bank.</pre>
    <pre>[31] In Mifsud v. MacMillan Bathurst Inc., (1989), 70 O.R. (2d)
701 at 709, this court held that, in certain situations in which
an employee is constructively dismissed, it may be &quot;reasonable to
expect the employee to accept the position offered in mitigation
of damages during a reasonable notice period, or until [the
employee] finds acceptable employment elsewhere&quot;.  However,
McKinlay J.A., writing for the court, also acknowledged (at 710)
that there would also be constructive dismissals &quot;where it would
be patently unreasonable to expect an employee to accept
continuing employment with the same employer in mitigation of
[his or her] damages&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[32] The critical question is therefore whether Schumacher could
reasonably have been expected to mitigate his damages during the
notice period by accepting the alternate position offered to him
by the Bank.  The trial judge, however, ultimately did not have
to consider this question, as she found that the Bank never
offered Schumacher the option of working at the alternate
position during the notice period:</pre>
    <pre>          In Mr. Colson's first letter, he extended
          Schumacher's offer to work in the different
          position pending negotiation of the severance
          package.  But that option of working in the
          different position while Schumacher looked
          for alternative employment was not available.
          In his letter dated January 30, Foxcroft said
          that &quot;remaining at work while negotiating a
          severance arrangement with us is unacceptable
          and is tantamount to resignation.&quot;  Bell
          agreed.  Unless Schumacher accepted the new
          position unconditionally, he was not
          permitted to return to the workplace.  For
          that reason, the option of working out the
          notice period was not available.</pre>
    <pre>          In addition, Schumacher was never given the
          opportunity to choose between working out the
          notice period while he looked elsewhere or of
          being terminated.  He was never threatened
          with termination.  He was never told that he
          would be terminated if he did not accept the
          new job description.  In order to mitigate,
          the employee must be aware of the options
          available and choose the most reasonable
          course of action from among the options.  In
          the context of being terminated, Schumacher
          was never given the option of working out the
          notice period.</pre>
    <pre>In my opinion, these findings of the trial judge were supported
by the evidence at trial.</pre>
    <pre>[33] The onus is on the Bank to establish that Schumacher did not
act reasonably in mitigation of his damages, and in our view that
onus has not been satisfied.</pre>
    <pre>Cross-appeal</pre>
    <pre>[34] I am of the view that the period of notice to Schumacher of
thirteen months was reasonable in all of the circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The trial judge calculated the bonus due to Schumacher on
the basis of what he had earned the previous year.  Although
there was some evidence that Schumacher would have earned a
greater bonus had he continued in the employ of the Bank we find
no palpable or overriding error in the trial judge's calculations
of the bonus relative to the notice period.
[36] I find no error in the trial judge declining to award
Schumacher solicitor-client costs from September 21, 1995.  Given
the element of uncertainty in relation to the reference to
solicitor-client costs in the offer to settle I do not find any
error of principle in the exercise of the trial judge's
discretion.</pre>
    <pre>[37] In the result the appeal and the cross-appeal are both
dismissed with costs.
