    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Stone appeals and Schwartz Levitsky Feldman (&#147;SLF&#148;) and
Polon cross-appeal from the judgment of Caswell J. dated February
22, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>A.   The Stone-SLF Appeal and Cross-Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On his appeal against the accounting firm, Stone raises four
issues:  the amount to which he is entitled under the Agreement,
the effect of the non-competition covenant, damages for breach of
fiduciary duty or aggravated damages, and costs.  SLF&#146;s cross-
appeal concerns the second and fourth issues (the non-competition
covenant and costs) and the question of prejudgment interest.
     </pre>
    <pre>1.   The Payments to Stone under the February 1, 1992 Agreement</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Stone submits that the trial judge erred by terminating the
payments to him at the end of October 1995.  He submits that he
was entitled to his base draw of $10,500 per month and his
maximum primary bonus of $50,000 annually for the full five years
of his partnership Agreement, that is to his retirement date on
January 31, 1997.  We agree with this submission.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The amount of the base draw is fixed by paragraph 6.03(2) of
the Agreement.  The amount of the primary bonus is determined by
a formula in paragraph 6.05 of the Agreement, which depends on
determining the fees billed and collected by the partnership from
Stone&#146;s clients.  The trial judge found that these fees for the
years 1993 and 1994 totalled $1,435,069.40, a figure that under
the formula would entitle Stone to the maximum primary bonus of
$50,000 annually.  However, the trial judge then reduced these
fees by deducting 20% for bad debts.  We think that she erred in
doing so.  No evidence was led to justify a 20% reduction or
indeed any reduction for bad debts.  Equally important, nothing
in the Agreement allows for a bad debt reduction when calculating
the primary bonus.  The trial judge held that the parties&#146; rights
were &#147;set out within the four corners of the agreement&#148;.  That
being so, no reduction should have been made for bad debts.
Thus, Stone was entitled to a primary bonus of $50,000 annually
together with his base draw of $10,500 per month.  The question
is for how long?
[5]  Under his Agreement with the firm, these two amounts for
base draw and primary bonus were to be paid &#147;so long as Stone
shall remain a partner&#148;.  As Stone left the partnership at the
end of October 1995, the trial judge terminated the payments at
that date.  Stone says they should continue until January 31,
1997, his retirement date under the Agreement.
[6]  At trial, Stone did not rely on the provisions of paragraph
7 of the Agreement, nor did he put his claim forward on the basis
the firm repudiated the Agreement.  Although Stone sought to rely
on paragraph 7.04 in this court, as Mr. Morton pointed out, we
simply do not have the necessary documents or the necessary
findings by the trial judge to give effect to that provision.
[7]  Nonetheless, we think that Stone&#146;s claim is properly
supportable as an award of damages for breach of fiduciary duty.
The trial judge concluded that the firm had breached its
fiduciary duty to Stone.  That conclusion is amply supported by
the evidence and by the trial judge&#146;s findings.  She found that
the firm&#146;s actions preceding Stone&#146;s departure were a &#147;flagrant
breach&#148; of the Agreement, that the firm&#146;s downgrading of Stone&#146;s
office location was &#147;mean spirited&#148; and that Stone was &#147;entirely
justified&#148; in leaving and setting up his own business.
[8]  However, having found a breach of fiduciary duty, she
awarded no damages.  That was wrong.  Stone is entitled to
damages and we think that the appropriate measure of damages is
the amount he would have received under the Agreement had he
remained a partner for the full five years.  That measure of
damages gives effect to what we view as the underlying intent of
the Agreement:  Stone was to be a partner of the firm for five
years.  If, for whatever reason, he left before the five years
were up, he was entitled to his base draw and primary bonus; in
return, the firm was protected by the non-competition covenant,
which prevented Stone from practising accounting elsewhere
without the firm&#146;s consent for the five-year period.
[9]  Thus, on this first issue, Stone is entitled to an
additional $157,500 on his base draw and an additional $62,500
for his primary bonus, a total increase of $220,000.  Stone&#146;s
total award is subject to being offset by his breach of the non-
competition covenant, an issue to which we now turn.
     </pre>
    <pre>2.   The Non-Competition Covenant and Liquidated Damages</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial judge found the non-competition provisions of the
Agreement were reasonable and enforceable, and we were not
persuaded that we should interfere with that finding.  Although
she also found that Stone was justified in leaving the
partnership, she held that he was in &#147;technical breach&#148; of
paragraph 9.01(1) of the Agreement because he set up his own firm
and serviced six of his former clients.  To give effect to this
breach, she awarded SLF damages of $62,500.  That figure was
based on an agreed figure of $50,000 for annual billings of the
six clients, pro rated over the fifteen month period from October
31, 1995 when Stone left the partnership to January 31, 1997, his
retirement date under the Agreement.  Stone submits that the
trial judge should not have awarded any damages.  On its cross-
appeal, SLF submits that the proper award of damages was
$125,000.  We agree with SLF&#146;s submission.
[11] We do not know what the trial judge meant by a &#147;technical
breach&#148;.  The fact is Stone breached paragraph 9.01(1) by setting
up his own business and servicing former clients who had become
clients of SLF.  Paragraph 9.02(1) provides for liquidated
damages on a breach of paragraph 9.01(1).  The trial judge did
not give effect to paragraph 9.02(1).  In our view, she was wrong
not to do so.  Consistent with our view of the underlying intent
of the arrangement between Stone and SLF, we think that the firm
is entitled to damages in accordance with the formula in
paragraph 9.02(1).  That formula, which in our view is reasonable
in the light of the terms under which Stone joined the
partnership, depends on calculating the gross fees billed by the
firm to clients (during the most recent complete fiscal year of
the client), whom Stone serviced after he left the partnership.
In this court, Stone submitted that even if we were to give
effect to paragraph 9.02(1), SLF failed to prove its damages
because it did not lead evidence of the amount of these gross
fees.  We think that submission is untenable in the light of
counsels&#146; agreement at trial.  Counsel agreed at trial that the
gross fees for the purpose of calculating liquidated damages
under paragraph 9.02(1) was $50,000.  We accept that figure.
Liquidated damages are stipulated to be two and-a-half times that
amount or $125,000.  SLF is thus entitled to damages of $125,000.
     </pre>
    <pre>3.   Damages for Breach of Fiduciary Duty or Aggravated Damages</pre>
    <pre>[12] On this issue, Stone makes two submissions.  First, having
found that the firm breached its fiduciary duty to him, the trial
judge erred in not awarding any damages either for that breach or
not awarding aggravated damages.  Second, the trial judge erred
in finding that Stone had breached his fiduciary duty to the
firm.
[13] On the first submission, we have found Stone entitled to
damages for breach of fiduciary duty equivalent to the amount of
his base draw and primary bonus he would have earned to his
retirement date under the Agreement.  We do not think that any
further award is appropriate.  Further, we are not persuaded that
Stone is entitled to an award of aggravated damages in the light
of the trial judge&#146;s finding that the firm&#146;s conduct was not
egregious.
[14] We agree with Stone&#146;s second submission.  The trial judge
does not say why she found Stone had breached his fiduciary duty
to the firm.  Indeed, the only substantial finding she made
against Stone was that he breached the non-competition covenant
and even that breach she excused as &#147;technical&#148; and found his
departure and setting up of his own business to be &#147;entirely
justified&#148;.  In our view, the trial judge&#146;s finding that Stone
breached his fiduciary duty to SLF was unreasonable and it is
therefore set aside.
     </pre>
    <pre>4.   Costs</pre>
    <pre>[15] Stone asked for an award of solicitor-and-client costs
against SLF.  SLF says that no costs of the trial should have
been awarded.  Initially, the trial judge awarded no costs but,
in supplementary reasons, she varied her order to award Stone his
party-and-party costs of the trial.  SLF acknowledges that the
trial judge had the jurisdiction to vary her cost order.  In our
view, in awarding Stone his party-and-party costs, she did not
err in principle.  Solicitor-and-client costs for Stone are not
justifiable.  On the other hand, though SLF has succeeded on its
claim, the award of party-and-party costs of the trial to Stone
is reasonable.  The claim and counterclaim were intertwined and
proceeded as one action.  The note was not an issue at trial.
The counterclaim took up far more of the court time, and Stone
has substantially succeeded on his counterclaim.  We would
therefore not give effect either to the appeal or to the cross-
appeal on costs.
     </pre>
    <pre>5.   Prejudgment Interest</pre>
    <pre>[16] SLF acknowledges that Stone is entitled to prejudgment
interest on the amounts awarded to him for his base draw and
primary bonus.  SLF submits, however, that the money found owing
to it should be deducted from Stone&#146;s award before prejudgment
interest is calculated.  The trial judge refused to give effect
to this submission either for the promissory note or for the
amount she awarded for damages for breach of the non-competition
covenant.  We agree with the trial judge on the note because of
the terms of the note.  But we think it fair to deduct the amount
of damages we have awarded to SLF, $125,000, from the amount
awarded to Stone, and award Stone prejudgment interest on the
difference.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[17] Both Stone&#146;s appeal and SLF&#146;s cross-appeal are allowed in
the terms of this endorsement and the judgment of Caswell J. is
amended accordingly.  If counsel are unable to agree on the
calculations or on the form of the order, we may be spoken to.
Because success has been divided, we think the parties should
bear their own costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.
Accordingly, we make no order for the costs of the appeal or of
the cross-appeal.</pre>
    <pre>B.   The Stone-Polon Appeal and Cross-Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[18] Stone submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to
find Polon had breached his fiduciary duty to Stone and in
failing to award Stone his costs of the action against Polon.  We
did not call on counsel for Polon on these submissions.
[19] The trial judge&#146;s finding that Polon did not breach his
fiduciary duty to Stone is fully supported in her reasons.  She
noted, for example, that Stone refused to discuss relevant
matters with Polon, that Polon made every effort to maintain an
even hand between Stone and the firm and that Polon was put in a
very difficult situation, in the trial judge&#146;s words, between
&#147;the proverbial rock and hard place&#148;.
[20] On costs, though Stone&#146;s accounting was accepted by the
trial judge, his claim for breach of fiduciary duty failed.
Thus, the trial judge did not err in awarding no costs of the
Stone-Polon action.  Stone&#146;s appeal therefore fails.
[21] Similarly, Polon&#146;s cross-appeal must fail.  The trial judge
properly applied the terms of the parties&#146; Agreement.  Polon did
not plead rectification, duress or undue influence.
[22] Accordingly, Stone&#146;s appeal against Polon is dismissed and
Polon&#146;s cross-appeal against Stone is also dismissed.  There
shall be no costs of either appeal.
