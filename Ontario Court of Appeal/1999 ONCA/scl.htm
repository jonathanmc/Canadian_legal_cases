    <pre>Nature of the Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals the stay of proceedings of a dangerous
offender application and seeks a new hearing. On November 27,
1995 the respondent was convicted of sexual assault and forcible
confinement. Prior to sentencing the appellant obtained an
adjournment for the purposes of initiating dangerous offender
proceedings against the respondent. The hearing of the dangerous
offender application commenced on June 10, 1997. On June 12, 1997
the trial judge stayed the dangerous offender application and
proceeded with the sentence hearing. On June 13, 1997 the
respondent was sentenced to eleven years' imprisonment on the
sexual assault with a weapon, and eight years concurrent on the
forcible confinement charge.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  It is the position of the appellant that the trial judge
erred in law in staying the dangerous offender application and in
refusing to hear the appellant's evidence with respect to that
application, including the evidence of unproven allegations.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Alternatively, the appellant seeks to appeal against the
sentence of eleven years in total.</pre>
    <pre>Facts found by trial judge relating to offences on which
appellant convicted</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge found in part as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          The basic facts situation is that in the
          evening of November 22, 1994 the accused
          driving a van owned by him picked up K.S....
          negotiated an arrangement with her pursuant
          to which she would perform sexual acts in
          consideration of the sum of $100.00.</pre>
    <pre>                               ...</pre>
    <pre>          The evidence is that... the complainant,
          lying on a sort of cot... was bound hand and
          feet by something called &quot;tie wraps&quot;, plastic
          devices which were used to secure her wrists,
          her arms and her legs... She was nude from
          the midriff down to the knees... the accused
          admits to all that.</pre>
    <pre>          There is no question about the forcible
          confinement, the binding, the tying up of the
          victim. The question is whether he committed
          a sexual assault and in the process of doing
          so, used a weapon, namely a knife, as set
          forth in the indictment.</pre>
    <pre>                               ...</pre>
    <pre>          I am satisfied on the evidence beyond a
          reasonable doubt that the accused did commit
          a sexual assault... and I believe her
          evidence that he used a knife in the process.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  It would appear from the trial judge's findings that he
accepted the complainant's evidence that before being tied up the
respondent held the knife to the complainant's throat and later
ran the blade of the knife along the complainant's buttocks. It
was also accepted by the trial judge that during the assault the
respondent grabbed a rag &quot;which smelled like gasoline&quot; and forced
it into the complainant's mouth. The complainant also alleged
that the respondent told her that if she did not co-operate &quot;he
would kill her&quot; and that he repeatedly hit her on the back of the
head with his hand. After the complainant was allowed to leave
the car, the respondent threatened her that he would &quot;run her
over&quot; if she looked back.

Criminal History of Respondent</pre>
    <pre>Criminal Record</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The respondent was born January 4, 1957. His first criminal
conviction was as a youth in 1972. The respondent and a friend,
E.B., were playing with a rifle belonging to the
respondent's father. The respondent at one point grabbed the gun
and pointed at the victim, who began to run away. The respondent
shot the victim in the buttocks, and then refused to let the
victim leave to get help. He eventually let him go after the
victim promised to say he had been shot by a stranger. The
respondent pled guilty to the offence of pointing a firearm and
received a sentence of probation to age sixteen.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In 1977, the respondent stole a three ton truck and evaded
police who tried to stop him. He drove at high speeds at oncoming
cars on a highway, forcing them off the road.  In 1978, he was
convicted of theft over and criminal negligence in the operation
of a motor vehicle and received a sentence of 40 days in jail and
one year's probation.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In November of 1979, the 21-year old victim, M.K., was
asleep alone in her residence in Thunder Bay. At about 4 a.m.,
the victim awoke to find the respondent standing at the foot of
her bed. He had broken into her home and picked up a steak knife
in her kitchen. The respondent forced the victim back into her
bed, put the knife to her throat, and proceeded to sexually
assault her. During the assault the respondent had the knife at
her wrist, and she was cut. He was convicted of attempt rape on
July 11, 1980 and sentenced to nine months jail and three years
probation.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In December of 1982, while the respondent was still on
probation for the attempted rape, he abducted two hitchhikers, a
man and a woman, along the highway west of Thunder Bay. They were
hitchhiking to Calgary and the respondent promised them a ride to
Winnipeg. He drove north to Savant Lake, where he told them he
had a cabin. He then drove to a desolate area in the bush. There
he brandished a pellet gun (a replica of a revolver), handcuffed
them, and began to assault the female victim. He made her get
into the back of his truck and had forcible sexual intercourse
with her. The respondent received a sentence of seven years total
for rape and forcible confinement on April 18, 1983. He was
apparently released in 1986.</pre>
    <pre>Other Allegations of Misconduct</pre>
    <pre>[10] The Crown's Notice of Application to have the respondent
declared a dangerous offender set out six allegations of
misconduct for which the respondent had not been charged
criminally. It was alleged that:</pre>
    <pre>(a)  On two occasions on or about 1971 to 1973, the respondent
     sexually assaulted a young neighbourhood friend of his
     sister;</pre>
    <pre>(b)  On or about 1977-78, the respondent sexually assaulted his
     sister;</pre>
    <pre>(c)  In 1988 to 1991, the respondent told his wife of an incident
     where he had killed a man, a story he had repeated to
     others; [there was no evidence that he did kill anyone]</pre>
    <pre>(d)  In December, 1989, the respondent told his wife of how happy
     he was that he had burned down the shack of someone that he
     hated; [there was no evidence that this in fact happened]</pre>
    <pre>(e)  On or about the month of April, 1991, in Thunder Bay, the
     respondent sexually assaulted his wife, C.S.;</pre>
    <pre>(f)  On or about December 1993 and January 1994, while in custody
     in Sudbury awaiting trial upon charges of which he was
     ultimately acquitted, the respondent attempted to hire K.S.
     and then L.H., to murder his ex-wife C.S. [who was the 
     complainant on a charge of sexual assault for which the 
     respondent was acquitted in June of 1994].</pre>
    <pre>[11] With respect to the allegation of the conspiracy to murder
Mrs. S., the officer in charge of the investigation had
begun his testimony but the hearing of his evidence was adjourned
so that counsel for the respondent could view the contents of the
entire investigative file. The Crown had also begun to call
evidence with respect to an additional incident that occurred on
July 4, 1994, when two prostitutes were allegedly threatened with
a gun by the respondent.</pre>
    <pre>[12] As stated above, the respondent was convicted on November
27, 1995 but the dangerous offender hearing did not commence
until June 10, 1997. The appellant Crown nominated Dr. Phillip
Klassen as its psychiatrist and the respondent nominated Dr. John
Bradford as the defence psychiatrist.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The reports of Drs. Bradford and Klassen were filed at the
sentencing hearing, following the &quot;stay&quot; of the dangerous
offender application. The reports were edited to remove any
reference to the unproven allegations. Dr. Klassen testified at
the hearing. He gave the opinion that the respondent suffered
from an antisocial personality disorder, was at least a
borderline psychopath, and that he was a significant risk to
commit violent offences if released. Dr. Klassen also testified
that the respondent had a sexual behaviour disorder. Dr.
Bradford's report indicated that although the respondent did have
a conduct and personality disorder, he was not typically 'rape
prone' but had an alcohol problem. Dr. Bradford concluded that
the risk of repetitive sexual violence was less than that
estimated by Dr. Klassen.</pre>
    <pre>[14] During the course of the dangerous offender hearing, counsel
for the respondent stated that he would not be bringing a motion
to stay the proceedings for unreasonable delay. However, he did
complain about late disclosure and objected to the admissibility
of the evidence relating to the unproven allegations of prior
misconduct.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Prior to the staying of the dangerous offender proceedings,
the trial judge made the following remarks:</pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     Mr. Dubinsky, let me assure
                         you that I will not find, I
                         will not likely find that your
                         client assaulted this woman
                         unless its proof beyond a
                         reasonable doubt but I
                         suppose, having read the
                         authorities, I suppose I have
                         to hear the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>          MR. DUBINSKY:  I'm not taking issue with
                         that. Unfortunately the
                         authorities surprised me as we
                         talked about yesterday.</pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     Certainly surprised me too.</pre>
    <pre>          MR. DUBINSKY:  However, what I am taking
                         issue with is halfway through
                         examination-in-chief, exactly
                         how it started yesterday with
                         the first witness I am finding
                         out about disclosure I haven't
                         been provided with. I still
                         have to try and do an adequate
                         job for Mr. S.</pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     Don't worry about it. Here's
                         some witness who's, with all
                         due respect and deference to
                         her, is barely articulate, is
                         going to tell us now about an
                         alleged assault. Let's hear it
                         and we'll decide whether it
                         has any weight or not. Let's
                         go ahead.</pre>
    <pre>          MR. DUBINSKY:  Thank you my lord. All right
                         my lord.</pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     Mr. Nicol before we do go any
                         further, I don't know how many
                         more witnesses like this
                         you're going to call but I
                         hope you will exercise that
                         intelligent judgement of yours
                         that I recognized before and
                         not waste a lot of court time.</pre>
    <pre>                               ...
                                </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     I've been hearing arguments
                         from item and item about non-
                         disclosure, partial
                         disclosure, inadequate
                         disclosure. That fact is that
                         you, the prosecutor, counsel
                         for the crown, is asking this
                         court to impose an
                         indeterminate sentence on the
                         accused man and maybe that
                         would be appropriate but it's
                         based on a whole lot of
                         evidence of criminal offences
                         in respect of which there were
                         no charges ever laid. If you
                         think that Mr. S.
                         committed sexual assaults,
                         rapes, whatever they used to
                         call them, for which he was
                         never charged you can still
                         charge him, there is no
                         statute of limitations. If you
                         think that he conspired to
                         commit murder you can charge
                         him with that too but what
                         you're asking me to do, what
                         you're asking this court to do
                         in this proceeding is to in
                         effect convict him of those
                         offences with which he was
                         never charged. Mr. Dubinsky
                         doesn't seem to want to make a
                         motion that I am trying to
                         encourage him to make. If he
                         doesn't I might make it ex
                         proprio motu.</pre>
    <pre>                               ...
                                </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     Mr. Dubinsky, I've been a
                         lawyer long enough and a judge
                         long enough to know that you
                         don't convict people without
                         proper trials.</pre>
    <pre>                               ...
                                </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:     Why don't you move right now
                         and if you don't move, if you
                         don't move I'd invite you to
                         move that this is an abuse of
                         process. That the crown is
                         trying to convict your client
                         of a whole lot of offences,
                         maybe a dozen or more, in
                         respect of which they never
                         saw fit to lay charges.</pre>
    <pre>[16] After hearing further submissions from Crown and defence,
the learned trial judge ruled as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          The Crown, now on this sentencing hearing in
          which I am asked to find the accused to be a
          dangerous offender pursuant to those sections
          of the Code that I have referred to, the
          Crown purported to attempt to prove very
          serious allegations of sexual misconduct,
          assaults including the use of a firearm,
          conspiracy - if I may use the word, maybe not
          all that accurately - to commit murder -
          wanted to prove those offences before me on
          this sentencing hearing. The law is clear, I
          have read all of these cases, I will not give
          the citations now but The Queen v. Louis
          [sic], The Queen v. Currie and other cases.
          The Crown would have to satisfy me beyond a
          reasonable doubt that some of those offences,
          allegedly 13 in number, were committed by the
          accused and that I should be satisfied beyond
          a reasonable doubt that they were committed.
          I recognize that on the basis of the
          authorities the Crown is entitled to adduce
          such evidence on an application under section
          753 and 754 of the Criminal Code but here
          there were 13 of them. In effect I would be
          trying this accused man on very serious
          criminal charges, very many serious criminal
          offences without him having the safeguards
          that fortunately our judicial system has
          afforded to accused persons over the last
          hundred years without having him being
          afforded the opportunity of a full trial, an
          opportunity to make full defence. I think
          that under those circumstances the motion
          brought on behalf of the accused by his
          counsel, Mr. Dubinsky, for a stay should be
          granted. I therefore grant the stay of the -
          again using perhaps unduly shortened
          terminology - a stay of the dangerous
          offender proceedings under section 753 and
          754 of the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>Right of the Appellant Crown to Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[17] The first issue to be determined is whether the Crown has
the right to appeal against a stay of the dangerous offender
application.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Section 759 of the Criminal Code sets out the rights of
appeal from decisions made in dangerous offender proceedings.
Subsection 759(2) provides for a right to appeal by the Attorney
General. At the relevant time, the provision read as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          759 (2) The Attorney General may appeal to
          the court of appeal against the dismissal of
          an application for an order under this Part
          on any ground of law.</pre>
    <pre>This Code provision has since been amended to reflect the added
provisions related to long-term offenders but the amendment is
not relevant to this appeal. The Crown submits that the stay of
proceedings was tantamount to a &quot;dismissal&quot; of the dangerous
offender application and that, consequently, a right of appeal
lies under s.759(2). The Crown relies on R. v. Jewitt, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 128 in support of its position.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Alternatively, the Crown submits that its right of appeal
from the stay can be found in the general appeal provisions for
indictable offences. A right of appeal is provided under
s.676(1)(c) as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          676(1) The Attorney General or counsel
          instructed by him for the purpose may appeal
          to the court of appeal
</pre>
    <pre>               (c) against an order of a trial court
               that stays proceedings on an indictment
               or quashes an indictment;</pre>
    <pre>[20] In my view, s.676(1)(c) has no application. The proceedings
on the indictment were not stayed. The trial judge simply
dismissed the Crown's application and proceeded to sentence the
accused. Furthermore as s.759 specifically deals with appeals in
dangerous offender applications, it would not be an appropriate
construction of the Code provisions to look at another section to
find a right of appeal. If the Crown has a right of appeal, it
must be found under s.759(2).</pre>
    <pre>[21] I am of the view that the reasoning in R v. Jewitt, supra,
can be applied to the facts of this case. In Jewitt, the
principal issue in the appeal was whether a judicially entered
stay of proceedings was &quot;a judgment or verdict of acquittal of a
trial court&quot; from which the Crown could appeal to the Court of
Appeal under s.605(1)(a) of the Code [now s.676(1)(a), as
amended].</pre>
    <pre>[22] In considering the issue Dickson C.J.C. stated at p.147-48:</pre>
    <pre>          On a true reading of s.605(1)(a) of the Code,
          to determine whether a stay of proceedings is
          a judgment or verdict of acquittal, we must
          look to the substance of the action of the
          trial judge and not the label he used in
          disposing of the case. Substance and not form
          should govern. Whatever the words used, the
          judge intended to make a final order
          disposing of the charge against the
          respondent. If the order of the court
          effectively brings the proceedings to a final
          conclusion in favour of an accused then I am
          of the opinion that, irrespective of the
          terminology used, it is tantamount to a
          judgment or verdict of acquittal and
          therefore appealable by the Crown.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The substance of the order in this case must therefore be
looked at rather than its form. First, it is important to note
that the order did not simply serve to suspend the proceedings
but effectively brought the dangerous offender application to a
final conclusion. Second, and perhaps more importantly, it is my
view that the stay was, in effect, an adjudication on the merits
of the application. This is not a case where a stay was granted
on the basis of extraneous circumstances that amount to an abuse
of process. Rather, the trial judge appears to have based his
decision on his view of the evidence sought to be introduced by
the Crown. In these circumstances, I am of the view that the
order staying the dangerous offender application was tantamount
to a &quot;dismissal&quot; of the application within the meaning of
s.759(2) of the Criminal Code and that this court has
jurisdiction to entertain the Crown's appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Stay of Proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[24] The second issue to be determined is whether the trial judge
erred in law in granting a stay. While part of the context of the
stay of the application was the allegation of late disclosure,
this issue could have been properly resolved by an adjournment.
In fact, that was the sole remedy sought by the respondent's
counsel.</pre>
    <pre>[25] Section 753(b) of the Criminal Code [now s. 753(1)(b)]
provides that the Crown may apply to have an offender declared a
&quot;dangerous offender&quot; and sentenced to an indefinite term of
imprisonment if: (a) he has been convicted of a &quot;serious personal
injury offence&quot; and (b) his failure to control his sexual
impulses reveals &quot;a likelihood of his causing injury, pain or
other evil to other persons&quot; in the future. A &quot;serious personal
injury offence&quot; is defined in s. 752 of the Criminal Code to
include all forms of violence and all forms of sexual assault.</pre>
    <pre>[26] The dangerous offender provisions of the Criminal Code
contemplate the admissibility of evidence of prior misconduct,
including matters which were not the subject of criminal charges
if the evidence is relevant.</pre>
    <pre>[27] This Court in R. v. Lewis (1984), 46 O.R. (2d) 289 at p.293,
held that &quot;evidence of other incidents of a sexual nature
involving the accused could be adduced even though the incidents
had not resulted in convictions.&quot; In R. v. Corbiere (H.E.)
(1995), 80 O.A.C. 222, this Court stated at p. 223 that &quot;[t]here
is no statutory or constitutional numerical limit on the number
of prior incidents with respect to which the Crown may lead
evidence on a dangerous offender application&quot; and that &quot;[t]he
Crown may also lead evidence of previous acts which have not been
the subject of any prior adjudication as long as that evidence is
relevant to the issues raised in the application.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[28] This Court in Corbiere at p. 223 also stated that &quot;[t]here
may be cases where the number of previous incidents relied on by
the Crown is so numerous, or the Crown's reliance on previously
unproved allegations is so significant, that the proceeding is
rendered unfair or abusive.&quot; In my view there was no evidence
before the trial judge to justify a finding that the nature or
number of incidents sought to be proven in this case would have
rendered the proceedings unfair or abusive. In particular, there
was no evidence before the trial judge to support a finding that
the &quot;affront to fair play and decency is disproportionate to the
societal interest in the effective prosecution of criminal
cases&quot;: see R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 at 461. The trial
judge did not even hear the evidence that the Crown wanted to
introduce beyond starting to hear the evidence of one police
officer and the evidence of one complainant.</pre>
    <pre>[29] It is important also to note that the trial judge invited
the respondent's counsel to bring an application for a stay of
the dangerous offender proceedings. It is obvious from the
comments made by the trial judge that he did not wish to hear the
dangerous offender proceeding. The trial judge was of the opinion
that it was fundamentally unfair of the Crown to adduce evidence
of criminal offences in respect of which there were no charges
ever laid.</pre>
    <pre>[30] In granting the stay, the trial judge stated, as quoted
above and which for convenience is repeated:</pre>
    <pre>          In effect I would be trying this accused man
          on very serious criminal charges, very many
          serious criminal offences without him having
          the safeguards that fortunately our judicial
          system has afforded to accused persons over
          the last hundred years without having him
          being afforded the opportunity of a full
          trial, an opportunity to make a full defence.</pre>
    <pre>[31] There was no evidence before the trial judge that the
respondent would be denied the &quot;traditional safeguards&quot;. The
trial judge was simply of the opinion that evidence related to
criminal conduct in respect of which no charge had been laid
should not be permitted. This opinion is contrary to the
established jurisprudence and therefore represents an error in
law.</pre>
    <pre>[32] In conclusion the appeal is allowed and it is ordered that
the hearing of the dangerous offender application proceed before
the trial judge.
