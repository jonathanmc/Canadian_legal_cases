</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by a jury dated March 17,
1998 and a sentence imposed by The Honourable Mr. Justice Dunn
dated April 23, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>ABELLA J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Anthony Sebastian was found guilty by a jury of sexually
assaulting a 16 year-old complainant.  The trial was essentially
a credibility contest.  The 16 year-old complainant alleged that
she was assaulted by the 50 year-old appellant Sebastian, a
medical doctor, on an evening when she was babysitting for her
neighbour, Grace Gyles.  Dr. Sebastian, who was involved in a
close personal relationship with Ms. Gyles, denied that the
assault took place.  A previous trial on the same charge ended in
a mistrial.  The appellant was sentenced to 30 months
imprisonment.
[2]  The appellant argued that as a result of a number of serious
errors, the trial was rendered unfair and the jury&#146;s verdict
unreasonable.  The determinative error that supports the
appellant&#146;s position, in my view, involves the evidence of two
women who negotiated with the complainant to induce her not to
give evidence at trial.
[3]  The complainant lived with her mother in the upper unit of a
duplex. She babysat for Ms. Gyles at least once a week for a year
prior to the night she said she was assaulted by Dr. Sebastian.
[4]  The lower unit was occupied by Grace Gyles, her brother, and
her two young sons. She had a full-time job as a computer support
technician for Peel Region, and a part-time job as a bartender in
a nightclub.
[5]  On the night of March 3, 1995, the complainant said she
decided to sleep over at Ms. Gyles&#146; house, as she had on a number
of previous occasions, because she had a test the next day at
school and did not want to have to wake up and return to her own
apartment when Ms. Gyles came home late from work, as she often
did.  It was the evidence of the complainant that she went to bed
at around 1:00 a.m. in the bedroom belonging to Ms. Gyles&#146;
brother.
[6]  Ms. Gyles came home at around 3:00 a.m. with Dr. Sebastian,
to whom the complainant had been introduced on one occasion
several weeks earlier.  The complainant said she let Ms. Gyles
and Dr. Sebastian into the apartment, then went back to bed.  It
was her evidence that sometime later, Ms. Gyles came into the
room in which she was sleeping, woke her up, and invited her to
join her and Dr. Sebastian in bed.  The complainant stated that
she answered &#147;hell no&#148; when Ms. Gyles said &#147;Tony wants to know if
you&#146;d like to join us in bed.&#148;  The complainant said that Ms.
Gyles giggled and then left.
[7]  Some time later, according to the complainant, Ms. Gyles
returned and woke her again saying that Dr. Sebastian wanted the
complainant to &#147;tell him herself.&#148;  When the complainant asked
why this was necessary, Ms. Gyles replied that &#147;if she just told
him herself, it would be all over.&#148;  Her evidence was that she
followed Ms. Gyles to her bedroom to tell Dr. Sebastian that
&#147;whatever they had in mind I wasn&#146;t really up to it, and I just
didn&#146;t want to partake in anything.  I wished they&#146;d leave me
alone.  I had a test the next morning and basically they were
irritating.&#148;
[8]  When she went into Ms. Gyles&#146; bedroom, the complainant found
Ms. Gyles and Dr. Sebastian in bed under the covers.  She told
Dr. Sebastian that she wanted to go to bed and was not interested
in &#147;whatever they were up to.&#148;  She said Dr. Sebastian called her
over, held her wrist, and said they were not going to hurt her or
do anything that she did not want to do.  He then loosened his
grip and the complainant went back to her room and went back to
sleep.  It was her evidence that she did not return to her own
apartment upstairs because she did not want to have to explain to
her mother what had happened.  In any event she felt safe because
the children were awake and she knew that Ms. Gyles did not want
the children to know there was a man in the house.
[9]  The complainant&#146;s next memory is of someone coming into the
room and putting a hand on her shoulder.  She turned and saw the
appellant who, she said, started climbing into her bed.  He had a
towel wrapped around his waist.  He held the complainant&#146;s hands
above her head, then wedged one of his legs between hers.  The
complainant said that she initially resisted, but that Dr.
Sebastian was successful in lowering her underwear.  He started
to penetrate her when the complainant stopped him by grabbing his
penis and squeezing it.  She said that Dr. Sebastian then said
&#147;Come with me&#148; and left the room.  The complainant put her
clothes on and followed Dr. Sebastian into Ms. Gyles&#146; room where
she was asked by Ms. Gyles &#147;what&#146;s wrong?&#148;
[10] She left Ms. Gyles&#146; apartment at about 5:00 a.m. after
phoning her boyfriend.  The complainant did not testify as to
what she told her boyfriend had happened.  Her boyfriend
confirmed that the complainant called him at around 5:00 a.m. in
the morning, that she was upset and breathing hard.  It was a
ten minute conversation which ended, according to the boyfriend,
when Ms. Gyles came downstairs.
[11] The complainant testified that she was not planning to tell
her mother about what had happened.  At school the next day, she
was upset and went home.  Later that evening, she told her mother
what had happened.  Her mother, after calling an aunt, called the
police.  The complainant and her mother attended the police
station either that day or the next one to tell the police what
happened.  The complainant gave no evidence at trial about what
she told her mother or the police.
[12] The mother&#146;s evidence was that the day after the alleged
assault, the vice-principal called from school to request
permission for her daughter to go home early, which she gave.
When she returned from work at around 6:30 p.m., she found her
daughter in her own room, looking as if she were &#147;coming down
with something.&#148;  The complainant&#146;s mother left the apartment
and, when she returned at around 10:00 p.m., found her daughter
still in bed.  When she checked in on her, her daughter asked her
to stay, a request she had never made before because their
relationship had been a fractious one.
[13] After about 5 minutes, the complainant went to her mother&#146;s
room and told her that something had happened.  According to the
mother, the complainant told her that Ms. Gyles had awoken her
the night before and asked her to join her and Dr. Sebastian in
bed.  She said that later, when she was again awoken by Ms.
Gyles, &#147;some guy [was] standing there without clothes on&#148; and
that &#147;the guy held onto to her and tried to pull her pants down
while Ms. Gyles just laid there.&#148;
[14] Ms. Gyles&#146; evidence at trial contradicted that of the
complainant.  She said that no arrangements had been made for the
complainant to sleep over and that Ms. Gyles&#146; brother never
offered his room to the complainant.  Whenever the complainant
had slept over, she had slept on the couch.
[15] When Ms. Gyles returned home with Dr. Sebastian on the
morning of March 3, 1995, she said they immediately went to her
bedroom because as a rule she did not want her children to know
if a man was staying over night.  Ms. Gyles stated that Dr.
Sebastian did not leave her bedroom until the next morning.  One
of her sons knocked on her bedroom door at around 4:00 a.m. so
she got up and took him back to his room.  When she did so, she
said, she saw the complainant downstairs studying.  She went to
her bed and did not see the complainant again that day.  She
denied asking the complainant to join her and Dr. Sebastian in
bed, denied that either she or Dr. Sebastian went into her
brother&#146;s room, and denied that the complainant ever came into
her bedroom that evening.
[16] Ms. Gyles said that she would not have permitted Dr.
Sebastian to wander out of the bedroom because of her desire that
the children not see a man in the house.  Dr. Sebastian, who had
been to Ms. Gyles&#146; home on several occasions, knew that she did
not want the children to see a man in the house because of her
recent separation from their father.  As a result, Dr. Sebastian
confirmed that when he came to her home, he went straight to her
bedroom.
[17] Dr. Sebastian&#146;s evidence was that when he and Ms. Gyles came
home sometime after 3:00 a.m. on March 3, 1995, the complainant
was on the couch in the livingroom.  He and Ms. Gyles went
directly to Ms. Gyles&#146; room where they spent the night.  He
denies leaving Ms. Gyles&#146; room at any time during the night and
says that he left her home at approximately 8:00 a.m. the next
morning.  He denies all of the sexual conduct alleged by the
complainant.
[18] On March 5, 1995, because the complainant had told the
police her assailant&#146;s name was &#147;Mike, Michael or John&#148;, the
police were looking for someone with that name.  After speaking
to Ms. Gyles, the police were contacted by Dr. Sebastian, who
volunteered the information that he was at Ms. Gyles&#146; home
between Thursday, March 2 and Friday, March 3, 1995.
[19] Dr. Sebastian was fully co-operative with the police in
their investigation and telephoned them immediately after
learning from Ms. Gyles, who was interviewed by the police on
March 14, 1995, that he might be involved.  He attended at the
police station, where he denied the allegations.
[20] A substantial portion of the evidence led by the Crown
involved discussions the complainant and her mother had with two
women known as &#147;Thourla&#148; and &#147;Kadine.&#148;  The complainant&#146;s
evidence was that about a year after the assault, while she was
at the hairdresser&#146;s, her mother phoned and told her that two
women were coming to speak to her about something.  The two women
were very friendly on their first meeting, and Kadine told her
that she had heard about the case.  The two women said that while
they did not know Dr. Sebastian personally, they were doing a
favour for a friend.
[21] The mother&#146;s evidence was that both women came to her
office, wanting to help her daughter.  Her conversations with the
two women continued over a period of months.
[22] One of the women offered the complainant help and money.
During that first meeting and subsequent conversations over the
next five months, various sums were discussed, initially
including $10,000, a cruise and a job for the complainant and a
friend of hers.  After further negotiations, the offer was
revised to $16,000.  The purpose of the offers was to encourage
the complainant to recant her allegations.  As the complainant
said in her evidence:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And what, what was the message that Kadine brought to
          you, what was the meeting about?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   She said that she had heard about
          the case.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   When she said &#145;the case&#146; did you
          know what case she was talking about?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   What case was that?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   The trial between me and Mr.
          Sebastian.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And so did she, did she make
          reference at all to anything about the case
          or did she just refer to it as &#145;the case&#146;?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I don&#146;t remember how she put it.
          She said that she didn&#146;t know, she didn&#146;t
          know the accused personally but she was doing
          a favour for a friend.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And what was, what was the favour,
          what was&#133;what did she say?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   She wanted to see if she could help
          me and give me money, or something, so that&#133;I
          don&#146;t know exactly how it was put, but some,
          by some method he wouldn&#146;t be going to jail.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   So when you said she would give you
          some money, did you talk about money?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   What was said about money?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Some sums came up in the thousands.
          A cruise was mentioned.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   So there was thousands of dollars,
          an actual figure or was it&#151;
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   They said, well, they made it seem
          like money was no object, so whatever I
          wanted.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And you say a cruise was, was
          spoken of?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Who spoke of the cruise?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I don&#146;t remember.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Did you bring the cruise up?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No, no actually they asked me if I
          wanted to go anywhere.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And other than money and a cruise
          was anything else talked about in terms of
          things offered?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   A job.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And where was the job going to be,
          do you know?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Where they worked, apparently.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Did you know where they worked?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I think they worked at an insurance
          company, I think Manu Life, or something.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Anything else other than money, a
          cruise, a job?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And what, did...was there any
          discussion about what you would do in order
          to get that money or cruise or a job?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I believe there was but I don&#146;t
          remember what we concluded.  Well we didn&#146;t
          conclude anything.  I told them that I would
          have to call my mother and get back to them.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And what kind of things were
          discussed in terms of what...their
          expectations of you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   They, they wanted me to write a
          letter to say that, just to say that I didn&#146;t
          remember or to say that it never happened.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And when they suggested to you to
          say that you didn&#146;t remember or that it never
          happened, how did you feel about that?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I was upset.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Did you ever write a letter of that
          kind?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.  No.</pre>
    <pre>[23] After the first meeting, the complainant told the two women
that she would have to check with her mother and get back to
them.  There were no further personal meetings between the two
women and the complainant, but negotiations continued via
telephone, mostly with the complainant&#146;s mother, who encouraged
the complainant to keep talking to the women.
[24] The complainant&#146;s evidence was that she understood that in
return for some counselling, money, a cruise and a job, she would
be expected to write a note saying that she did not remember
anything.  She acknowledged that she participated in the
conversations willingly and told the women what she wanted in
exchange for such a letter.
[25] The complainant stated that she was unclear about why the
two women were taking to her, but thought they were out to &#147;trick
her&#148; and eventually prove her to be a liar.  She did not think
that talking to them was wrong.  As she said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   In terms of how you were feeling about any plan in
          relation to testifying, how did you feel about it yourself?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I was offended that someone would
          basically try to defend him and get him off.
          I was also, I was suspicious.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   What were you suspicious of?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   &#133; I figured they were trying to
          trick me.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Neither the complainant nor her mother knew the two women
prior to being contacted by them.  The mother acknowledged that
she told her daughter throughout to &#147;lead them on.&#148;  She too was
of the view that the women had not done anything wrong.
[27] The complainant gave the following evidence about her
conversation with Thourla and Kadine:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   My mother told me to keep talking to them.  I didn&#146;t
          exactly know why but I kept talking to them because she said so,
          so I was&#133;I said, I stated that I wanted things.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   and what did you tell her you
          wanted?
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   &#133; I said I wanted $16,000.00
          because I believe that sum came up during
          either the face to face meeting or one of the
          phone calls, and that I didn&#146;t want the
          cruise.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And when you were talking to these
          women, or to Kadine, and indicated to her
          what you wanted, what were you prepared to do
          to get that, to get this?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Oh, nothing.  The, the agreement
          was that I was supposed to write a note
          saying that I didn&#146;t remember or&#133;yeah, that
          was what they wanted me to do, basically, and
          sign my name to it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Had you talked to the police at the
          time you were telling Kadine what you wanted?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No, my mother told me that she
          spoke to her lawyer, though.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Was the accused, Mr. Sebastian,
          ever mentioned?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes, she asked me if I knew what he
          did and if I knew him previously to what had
          happened, and I said no, to both questions,
          and previously, when we met face to face, she
          told me that he had, he had lost his
          practising licence, and that his daughter was
          upset with him and that he &#150;
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:   Just a second, how far are
          we going?  If you would perhaps tie the
          witness to the proper responses to the
          question. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Crown counsel] Q.  So she asked you, in
          this conversation Kadine asked you if you
          knew him and if you knew what he did, and you
          answered no to both of those questions?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And during this conversation is
          there any other discussion about Mr.
          Sebastian?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Not that I can recall.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   You say that you recall one other
          telephone conversation?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And do you remember who that was
          with?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   That was with Thourla.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   With?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Thourla.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Do you remember any of the content
          of that conversation?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yeah, I&#133;she, again, was trying to
          sum up what I wanted, and trying to persuade
          me to write the letter or do&#133;she kept on
          asking me what am I going to get in return,
          as if she was trying to get me to say
          something.  She was expecting a certain
          answer that she wasn&#146;t getting.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Was there any discussion of you
          doing anything other than writing a letter?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes, I said that I didn&#146;t have to
          write a letter, I just didn&#146;t have to&#133;I just
          wouldn&#146;t show up and that the police didn&#146;t
          know where I was.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And when you said that the
          police&#133;you were saying this to Thourla, were
          you, or&#151;
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.  Or Kadine.  I don&#146;t remember
          who I said that to.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And when you said that to them was
          that true that the police didn&#146;t know where
          you were?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Why did you say that?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Because I didn&#146;t want to write the
          letter and I was being pressured.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Other than suggesting that you
          wouldn&#146;t show up for court or the suggestion
          that you would write a letter, were there any
          other suggestion about what you might do?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Not that I can recall.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   You have indicated that this went
          on for about a month where there were a
          number of conversations between yourself and
          these two women?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Do you remember how it ended?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No, after that they were dealing
          with my mother and I never got any orders to
          call them back or anything, so.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And you indicated that you didn&#146;t
          want to write the letter and that is one of
          the reasons why you suggested you just
          wouldn&#146;t go to court?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Right.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Why didn&#146;t you want to write the
          letter?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Because I just, I figured they were
          tricking me.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Did you report this to the police
          at any time?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   What they had one?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes, my mother told the police
          about it and I made a statement.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And do you remember how long
          afterwards, after you had these
          conversations, that you went to the police?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.  It was a couple of months
          after.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   And do you remember why you waited
          so long?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Basically to me it was, it was my
          mother&#146;s call, so I don&#146;t know.  Like I
          didn&#146;t hear anything else from her. I didn&#146;t
          ask about it because I knew that as far as I
          was concerned nothing&#133;it wasn&#146;t doing
          anything for me, and, you know, I just left
          it in her hands because I figured she knew
          what she was doing.  She was getting legal
          advice.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[28] On cross-examination, the complainant admitted that she told
the women that she would not go to court if she got the money:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Now, in exchange for these benefits, madam, you were
          going to keep yourself scarce from these court proceedings,
          correct?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I told them I would keep myself
          scarce.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Or, if you went to court, you told
          them that you would say that you didn&#146;t
          remember, right?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I told them that, yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Defence counsel]   Q.  and you told
          them that you would not go to court if you go
          the money, right?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Yes, I said that.</pre>
    <pre>[29] Five months later, in the fall of 1996, the complainant&#146;s
mother told the police about the negotiations with the two women
and explained that she did not go to the police earlier because
she was satisfied that &#147;these ladies were playing a game and had
not succeeded&#133; .&#148;
[30] Kadine did not testify.  The evidence of Thourla was that
although she was acquainted with Dr. Sebastian and Ms. Gyles, she
was not a friend of either and had only met them about a half
dozen times over a period of three years. She had no contact with
Dr. Sebastian about the case and had no reason to want to help
him, but had heard about his problems with the complainant and
had approached her and her mother out of curiosity.
[31] Thourla&#146;s evidence was that she and Kadine went to visit the
complainant at the invitation of the mother.  She said that
rather than finding a young woman who was traumatized, she found
someone who was more interested in the benefits being offered.
The complainant called her two or three times and the mother
called several more.  Both Thourla and Kadine tape-recorded some
of the telephone conversations because Thourla changed her
attitude towards the complainant after meeting her.
[32] Thourla stated, and the complainant conceded in cross-
examination, that the complainant was &#147;pretty well calling her
own terms in demanding money and a cruise.&#148;  She increased her
financial demand from $10,000 to $16,000 after deciding she was
no longer interested in a cruise, and asked instead for a job for
herself and her boyfriend in exchange for making herself &#147;scarce
from the court proceedings.&#148;
[33] There was virtually no evidence suggesting that Dr.
Sebastian was in any way connected to the two women or had any
involvement in their negotiations with the complainant and her
mother. Dr. Sebastian testified that he had no role in the
discussions and was &#147;flabbergasted&#148; when he learned of them.  The
complainant&#146;s mother testified that from her conversations with
the women, it was clear that Dr. Sebastian did not know what
Thourla and Kadine were doing.  The complainant herself said she
knew that no money would be coming from him personally.
[34] It was never clear from the evidence why these two women,
who were only casual acquaintances of Dr. Sebastian and Ms.
Gyles, had become involved in this case, but it is beyond dispute
that the complainant was actively negotiating with them for a
period of time for benefits in exchange for not testifying.
[35] The appellant submits that the only conceivable purpose the
Crown would have in bringing this evidence to the jury&#146;s
attention would be to create the inference that Dr. Sebastian was
responsible for the negotiations initiated by these women and
that this involvement was evidence that could lead to an
inference of consciousness of guilt.  The appellant notes,
however, that in pre-charge submissions, the Crown conceded &#150; and
the trial judge agreed &#150; that there was little, if any, evidence
connecting Dr. Sebastian to the conduct of the women and
therefore no evidence from which consciousness of guilt could be
inferred.  Since the evidence relating to the two women was
conceded not to be probative of Dr. Sebastian&#146;s guilt, the
appellant submits that the trial judge had a duty to instruct the
jury to disregard the evidence relating to these negotiations, or
at least to caution them against using this evidence to infer Dr.
Sebastian&#146;s guilt. The appellant argues that the absence of a
limiting instruction prejudiced Dr. Sebastian.
[36] The Crown concedes that there was no connection between the
conduct of the two women and Dr. Sebastian, but since all of the
witnesses called by the Crown, including the complainant,
categorically denied such a connection, it would have been
apparent to them that the evidence was not capable of supporting
an inference of consciousness of guilt.
[37] No limiting instruction was therefore required since such an
instruction would have been superfluous.  In the Crown&#146;s view,
the only inference the jury could logically draw from the
evidence was one that would either support or contradict the
defence&#146;s theory that the allegations were fabricated as part of
a &#147;shakedown.&#148;
[38] In his charge, the trial judge discussed the negotiations
with Thourla and Kadine at some length.  He did not, however,
remind the jury that there was no evidence linking Dr. Sebastian
to these negotiations.  In fact, the only statement he made with
respect to the use to be made of this evidence was the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I don&#146;t know whether the evidence of [Thourla] is going to
          help you much about the incidents of that night.  Perhaps, of
          course, her evidence is reflective on the credibility of the
          complainant.</pre>
    <pre>[39] Because this was a case which turned entirely on
credibility, the jury ought to have been cautioned against any
improper use of the evidence about the negotiations.  This
evidence was a large part of the Crown&#146;s case, and it is
difficult to see how it could have been tendered for any purpose
other than to suggest that Dr. Sebastian was in some way
attempting to discourage the complainant from testifying.  In the
absence of a clear limiting instruction from the trial judge,
this evidence could logically have led the jury to infer
consciousness of guilt.
[40] Although all the witnesses indicated that Dr. Sebastian was
not directly involved, it was never made clear to the jury who
the instigator of the negotiations was, or why these two women
would have approached the complainant and offered her a
substantial amount of money if they had no connection to Dr.
Sebastian.  Absent a proper limiting instruction from the trial
judge, this evidence was highly prejudicial. Since, as even the
Crown conceded, the evidence had &#147;little, if any&#148; probative
value, the argument in favour of the need for a limiting
instruction was even more compelling.
[41] The Crown argued that the evidence it introduced about the
negotiations between the complainant, her mother, and the two
women, was helpful to the defence since it demonstrated that the
complainant had a motive to fabricate, namely, so that she would
have enough money to move out of her mother&#146;s home.
[42] It is true that the negotiations were in fact used by the
defence to undermine the credibility of the complainant.  It is
also true, however, that the evidence of the negotiations was
left as circumstantial evidence for the jury&#146;s evaluation, not as
evidence of consciousness of guilt. It is nonetheless the case
that the evidence was highly inflammatory and could easily have
led to an inference not supported by the evidence. The trial
judge should have instructed the jury that there was no evidence
that Dr. Sebastian was in any way involved with the negotiations
and that no such inference should be drawn by the jury.
[43] There is, in my view, no doubt that the appellant was
prejudiced by the failure to alert the jury to the way the
evidence could or could not be used.
[44] It was not a question of how much weight the evidence should
be given by the jury in its determination of guilt or innocence
since the Crown conceded, and the trial judge agreed, that the
evidence had no probative value and that weight was therefore not
an issue.  Given the Crown&#146;s concession that there was no nexus
between Dr. Sebastian and the two women, it is highly
questionable whether this evidence should have been introduced by
the Crown at all.
[45] But having been introduced, a strong limiting instruction
was required, telling the jury to disregard the evidence relating
to the negotiations.  Otherwise, the prejudice was overwhelming
and the improper inference clearly available that Dr. Sebastian
was somehow involved in the negotiations.  This required the
trial judge to tell the jury that there was no evidence linking
Dr. Sebastian to the attempts at bribing the complainant.
[46] It cannot be said that the verdict would necessarily have
been the same if the trial judge had given a limiting
instruction.  Consequently, the curative provision is
inapplicable in this case.  The appeal is accordingly allowed,
the conviction is set aside,  and a new trial ordered.
