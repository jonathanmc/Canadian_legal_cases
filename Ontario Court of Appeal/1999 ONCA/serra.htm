    <pre>HEARD:         December 3, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Somers J. dated March 9, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
[1]  We would grant leave to appeal the judgment of Somers J.  by
which  he  awarded the plaintiffs their costs of the trial  until
February  20,  1998, which was the date upon which he  found  the
defendants had served a Rule 49 Offer to Settle, and awarded  the
defendants their costs on a party-and-party scale thereafter.
[2]  The costs awarded to the defendant constituted the costs of
a five-day jury trial.  Somers J. further ordered that the
defendant was entitled to set off the costs against the amount of
the judgment awarded to the adult plaintiff, Rosalina Serra, who
was the principal plaintiff in the action.
[3]  In our view, the trial judge erred in the award of the costs
for two reasons.  The first reason is that the trial judge erred
in considering that the &#147;offer&#148; on which he relied complied with
the requirements of rule 49.02(1).  The &#147;offer&#148; was not in
writing, did not disclose how long it remained open for
acceptance and had not been served on the plaintiffs&#146; solicitor.
See John Logan Chevrolet Oldsmobile Inc., v. Baldwin, [1994] O.J.
No. 1378.
[4]  The second reason arises from the decision of this court  in
Onisiforou  v. Rose (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 737, which  was  decided
subsequent  to  the  award  of costs.   In  this  appeal,  as  in
Onisiforou,  the &#147;offer&#148; relied on by Somers J. was an  offer  to
settle the claims of all the plaintiffs for a single amount  less
the applicable deductibles plus interest and costs.
[5]  In this appeal, in addition to the plaintiff Rosalina Serra,
there were three other plaintiffs who asserted derivative claims
under the Family Law Act.  As in Onisiforou, in this appeal it
was not possible to compare Rosalina Serra&#146;s award of damages
with the terms of the alleged offer for the purposes of rule
49.10(2), as the offer was a lump sum amount payable to all the
plaintiffs.  In the normal course, Rosalina Serra would be
entitled to costs as a successful party and the defendant would
be liable for the costs.
[6]   The trial judge based his costs judgment squarely on Rule
49 and did not purport to exercise his discretion under section
131 of the Courts of Justice Act and rule 57.01.
[7]  Therefore, we would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal
with costs, set aside the costs order at trial and in its place,
make an order granting the plaintiffs their costs of the action.</pre>
