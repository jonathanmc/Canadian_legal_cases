    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant argues that the verdict was unreasonable and
that the appellant should have been found to be Not Criminally
Responsible.

[2]  The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence including
the evidence of the Crown and defence psychiatrists.  Their
evidence was mutually exclusive in respect of the s. 16 issue
which was raised in this case.  The appellant did not testify.

[3]  The trial judge gave careful consideration to the history
which the appellant gave to his psychiatrist, Dr. Shafey, whose
opinion was largely based on that history. He concluded that &#147;the
appellant lied or consciously and grossly exaggerated his
history.  I conclude that since this is so that little weight
should be given to the opinion of Dr. Shafey.&#148;

[4]  The trial judge then turned to the competing evidence of Dr.
Prakash, the psychiatrist called by the Crown.  In the end, he
accepted Dr. Prakash&#146;s evidence, the essence of which was that:

  1.   the appellant did not suffer from any major mental illness;
  2.   the appellant was quite aware of his actions at relevant times;
  3.   the appellant knew of the consequences of his actions;
  4.   the appellant&#146;s actions and symptoms were not typical of
       post-traumatic stress disorder;  and
  5.   the appellant did not fall within the perimeters of s. 16 of
       the Criminal Code.
          </pre>
    <pre>[5]  The trial judge was entitled to accept Dr. Prakash&#146;s
evidence over that of Dr. Shafey.  Thus, in our view, it cannot
be realistically said that the verdict was unreasonable or that
it was a verdict that was not supported by the evidence.

[6]  Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>     SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[7]  We think that the sentence imposed is within a reasonable
range and that the trial judge&#146;s reasons reflect no error in
principle.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal
against sentence is dismissed.
