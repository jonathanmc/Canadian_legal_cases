</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal arises out of an action brought by the
respondents Mabel and Grant Sheardown against the appellant James
Slater, a solicitor, for damages arising from an aborted real
estate transaction. Judgment was granted in the amount of $30,000
for the loss of the deposit plus interest and costs. The
appellant appeals from both the finding of liability and the
quantum of damages.</pre>
    <pre>1.   Liability</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge held that the appellant breached his duty to
represent the respondents in a manner that was consistent with
the duty owed by a reasonably competent solicitor. The appellant
submits that the trial judge erred in so holding in two respects:
a)   there was no evidence that the builder's solicitor would
     have accepted evidence that the mortgages and liens had been
     paid off other than the registration of the actual
     discharges of these encumbrances; and
b)   the basis upon which liability was founded was not alleged
     in the Statement of Claim, as particularized upon discovery.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, these grounds of appeal misconstrue the
essential basis for liability. It is apparent from the trial
judge's reasons, when considered as a whole, that the finding of
liability essentially rests, not so much on any assumptions made
with respect to the actions of the builder's solicitor, but on
the appellant's inaction. The trial judge found that the
transaction failed to close because the appellant failed to take
adequate steps to provide evidence to the builder's solicitor
that the condominium had been refinanced, existing encumbrances
had been paid out and that the actual discharges of liens and
mortgages would be forthcoming. He held that, in essence, the
appellant abandoned the respondents.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The trial judge's rejection of the appellant's testimony is
of critical importance to these findings. The trial judge
expressly stated that he was not impressed with the appellant's
testimony and that he was not prepared to make any findings based
on his evidence alone. In our view, this finding of credibility
is supported by the evidence. The appellant gave inconsistent
testimony with respect to his alleged communications with the
builder's solicitor, a material issue in the proceedings.
Further, his testimony was not supported by any documentation and
was contradicted in some respects by correspondence received from
the builder's solicitor. Finally, the evidence showed that the
appellant had taken none of the usual steps taken by a solicitor
in handling a real estate file.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Given the rejection of the appellant's testimony, the trial
judge's finding that some satisfactory arrangement could have
been made with the builder's solicitor so as to finalize the
transaction was reasonable and supported by the evidence.  The
first ground of appeal therefore fails.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  We find no merit in the appellant's contention that the
finding of negligence was not claimed in the Statement of Claim.
In our view, the pleadings were sufficiently wide to encompass
the finding of negligence made by the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>2.   Quantum of damages</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing
to consider the evidence presented by the defence showing, in
essence, that the respondents would have suffered greater
financial loss had the transaction in fact closed. He contends
that this evidence was relevant on the issue of damages.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  We do not read the trial judge's reasons as a refusal to
consider this evidence. Rather, the reasons show that he
considered the evidence and expressly rejected what he referred
to as the &quot;secondary defences.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In our view, it was open to the trial judge to reject the
evidence. Once it was shown that the respondents had sufficient
funds to close the transaction (a fact which was conceded by the
appellant in his testimony), one can only conclude that, had the
transaction closed,  the respondents would not have lost their
deposit but, rather, would have received the subject property.
There was no evidence that the subject property was not worth the
purchase price on the day of closing. The evidence of the
builder's quick discount resale does not assist the appellant in
the circumstances of this case where the builder had the benefit
of the respondent's deposit monies. It then becomes entirely
speculative to consider what may have happened some months later.</pre>
    <pre>[10] We therefore conclude that the trial judge did not err in
his assessment of the damages.</pre>
    <pre>[11] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
