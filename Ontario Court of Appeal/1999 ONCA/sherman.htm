COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            MICHAEL JAY SHERMAN (Applicant (Respondent in

               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         April 15, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Daudlin J. dated May 6, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In a 1993 divorce judgment, the appellant, Donna Clair
Sherman, received  $1,700 per month for two children of the
marriage and $250 per month for spousal support.  In addition,
the respondent, Michael Jay Sherman, had been required to
designate her irrevocably as beneficiary on his life insurance
policy.  Michael Sherman brought an application to vary the
judgment granted in the divorce action because of what he said
was a change in circumstances arising primarily from the
enactment of the Federal Child Support Guidelines.  As a result
of his application, Justice Daudlin varied the divorce judgment
by reducing the child support from $1,700 per month to $907,
reducing spousal support from $250 per month to $200, and
relieving the respondent of his obligation to designate Donna
Sherman as beneficiary on his life insurance policy and requiring
that she be replaced by the children as beneficiaries for as long
as they were children of the marriage.  The real issue in this
appeal is whether s. 14(c) of the Federal Child Support
Guidelines entitles an applicant to an automatic variation of
child support.
[2]  Section 14 of the Federal Child Support Guidelines states:
          </pre>
    <pre>               14.  Circumstances for variation. &#150; For the purposes of
          subsection 17(4) of the Act, a change of circumstances is
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  in the case where the amount of child support includes a
          determination made in accordance with the applicable table, any
          change in circumstances that would result in a different child
          support order or any provision thereof;
(b)  in the case where the amount of child support does not
include a determination made in accordance with a table, any
change in the condition, means, needs or other circumstances of
either spouse or of any child who is entitled to support;  and
(c)  in the case of an order made before May 1, 1997, the coming
into force of section 15.1 of the Act, enacted by section 2 of
chapter 1 of the Statutes of Canada, (1997).  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Justice Daudlin expressed the view that:
          </pre>
    <pre>            I am satisfied and I do find that there is here a change of
          circumstance, and that the change of circumstance then gives rise
          to the operations of the presumptive rule and to the use of the
          guidelines.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  As a result of his conclusion that the coming into force of
the child support guidelines is a change of circumstances that
presumptively requires the variation of a child support order to
accord with the table amount, Justice Daudlin reduced the support
order for the Sherman children in accordance with the amount
stipulated under the guidelines.
[5]  In our view, Justice Daudlin erred in his interpretation of
s. 14(c).  This section merely provides a triggering mechanism to
permit a review of the circumstances to see whether there is a
sufficient change, under the jurisprudence on &#147;change in
circumstances&#148;, that a variation should be made in the support
payments [See:  B.(G.) v. G.(L.) (1995), 15 R.F.L. (4th) 201;
Willick v. Willick, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670, 6 R.F.L. (4th) 161; and
Meloche v. Kales (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 688].
[6]  Counsel for the respondent concedes that s. 14(c) of the
guidelines does not mandate an automatic entitlement to the
guideline amount.  He therefore urges us to find on the facts of
this case that there is nonetheless a change of circumstances
arising from the non-payment of a promissory note in the amount
of $90,000, a submission Justice Daudlin appears to have
accepted.
[7]  A review of the evidence upon which the original support
orders were made in 1993 reveals that the debt represented by the
promissory note was in the nature of a &#147;flow through&#148; amount;
namely, if payment was made by the debtor, Michael Sherman repaid
the finance company for the debt he had incurred on behalf of the
debtor.  Moreover, he acknowledged at the time of the divorce
action that he had not been receiving any amount on account of
the loan for several months.  In other words, the loan was a
neutral factor at the time of the divorce and is no less so now
that the debt has been extinguished by virtue of Michael
Sherman&#146;s declaration of bankruptcy.
[8]  What we are left with is virtually no change in the
circumstances of Donna Sherman other than her efforts to attempt
to find employment, efforts which have so far proved to be
unfruitful.  The evidence on the other hand discloses that
Michael Sherman&#146;s income has increased from $51,000 in 1993 to
$68,000 at the time of his application for variation.  To the
extent, therefore, that there is a change in circumstances, it is
a change which finds Michael Sherman in a substantially improved
financial situation from the time of the divorce.  There is
therefore no evidentiary foundation for Justice Daudlin&#146;s
conclusion that there should be a reduction in the amount of
either child support, spousal support, or a change in the
designation of Donna Sherman as beneficiary of the insurance
policy.
[9]  Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, set aside the order
of Daudlin J., and dismiss the variation application, with costs
throughout to the appellant.
