</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We agree with the conclusion of the trial judge that the
search warrant was valid and therefore there was no violation of
s. 8 of the Charter.

[2]  As set out in R. v. Garofoli (1990), 60 C.C.C. (3d) 161
(S.C.C.), the task of the court reviewing the sufficiency of a
search warrant information is limited to determining whether, on
the basis of the record before the authorizing judge as amplified
on the review, the authorizing judge could have granted the
authorization.

[3]  In accordance with R. v. Debot (1989), 52 C.C.C. (3d) 193
(S.C.C.), the court is required to consider the totality of the
circumstances in determining the sufficiency of the information
in support of the warrant. Here, the information given, albeit
from an anonymous informant, was compelling. There was
significant detail concerning the accused, his apartment, and the
opium in that apartment. In addition, the informant indicated the
source of his information, namely, his recent visit to the
apartment.

[4]  Secondly, the police corroborated some of the information
provided, although this did not go beyond elements of the
information that were innocent and commonplace such as the fact
that a party by the name of the accused lived in the building
identified by the informant.

[5]  The third concern set out in R. v. Debot (1989), 52 C.C.C.
(3d) 193 (S.C.C.) is the credibility of the source. The Crown
conceded that two critical sentences in the information were
inaccurate and should be deleted. They are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>       This informant is proven and reliable by Constable Brent
  Wickens, No. 4313 of 31 Division. Constable Wickens has acted on
  information given by the informant that has resulted in arrests
  and narcotics being seized.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The amplified record demonstrates that the second
sentence was simply wrong and cannot be considered. That same
record makes clear, however, that the first of these sentences is
simply inelegantly worded, but not inaccurate. According to the
affiant, he was told by Constable Wickens that the informer was
proven and reliable.

[7]   The inelegant language used by P.C. Carlton in setting
out this information as he did in the first sentence quoted above
was not done to mislead the justice of the peace and there is no
basis for excluding it from the information.

[8]   Properly understood, the search warrant information
provides some support for the credibility of the source. P.C.
Carlton had obtained some verification of credibility from a
colleague. Although this verification is minimal, the informant
cannot be said to be completely untested as to credit.
</pre>
    <pre>[9]   Thus, in this case the informant supplied substantial
detail and his means of knowing it. There was some corroboration
and some limited verification of his credibility. In our view,
taking all these circumstances together, the authorizing justice
could have granted the authorization. Hence, the trial judge was
correct in not interfering. The search was not based on an
invalid warrant. It is thus unnecessary to address the
appellant's submissions relating to s. 24(2) of the Charter. This
ground of appeal is dismissed.

[10]  The appellant also attacks the reasonableness of the verdict
on count 2. He argues that the two facts on which it is founded,
namely the finding of the money with the appellant's clothing in
the apartment together with the finding of the opium seized
pursuant to the warrant, are insufficient to permit a trier,
acting reasonably, to convict. We agree. There is simply nothing
linking the money found to the sale of narcotics to make it the
proceeds of such a sale.

[11]  We therefore allow the appeal from the conviction on count 2
and direct an acquittal thereon.

[12]  Finally, the appellant appeals from sentence. The Crown
concedes that the trial judge erred in ordering a period of
probation in addition to the two and one-half years' imprisonment
imposed. We agree and the probation term of the sentence will be
struck.

[13]  As to the term of imprisonment, we would not interfere. The
drug involved here was opium. While it is not heroin, it is
nevertheless an addictive narcotic the trafficking in which must
be very firmly discouraged. We do not view the term of
imprisonment imposed as outside the range. We therefore grant
leave to appeal but would dismiss the appeal as to sentence.</pre></td>
