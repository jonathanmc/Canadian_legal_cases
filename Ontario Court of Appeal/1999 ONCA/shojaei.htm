      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant seeks leave to appeal and to appeal his
conviction for theft of a walkman.  The appellant went to Costco
and was observed by a store security guard to pick up a walkman
package.  When apprehended, the appellant was wearing headphones
for a walkman and there was a cassette tape in the walkman.  The
appellant told the security guard that the walkman was his. The
security guard called the police who arrested the appellant.
[2]  At trial, the security guard testified that he had seen the
appellant take the walkman out of its package, put the headphones
on and insert a cassette tape into the walkman. He acknowledged
that there are no batteries in a new walkman. The appellant
testified that he had gone to the store intending to purchase
another walkman as a gift for a relative and had picked up a
walkman package.  The appellant said he realized the package was
too light, that it must have been an empty box and discarded it.
The appellant maintained that the walkman he was wearing when
apprehended was his and produced a receipt showing the purchase
of a walkman of the identical make and model nine days before the
date of the alleged theft.
[3]  The appellant claimed that there were batteries in the
walkman, that he had pre-set the radio stations and that, given
the opportunity, he could show this to the court.  The walkman
could not be produced to the court as, pursuant to store policy,
the walkman had been repackaged and sold.  The appellant
testified that the arresting officer had told him the walkman
would be kept and produced at trial. The appellant claimed that
his right to make full answer and defence had been infringed
because he could not demonstrate that the walkman he was wearing
had batteries in it and pre-set radio stations.  No prior notice
of the constitutional challenge was given to the Crown. The
arresting officer was not called by either party.    The trial
judge convicted the appellant and his appeal to a summary
conviction appeal court judge was dismissed.
[4]  We are mindful that leave to appeal to this court may only
be taken on a question of law that is of importance.  We are,
however, of the opinion that, given the state of the record in
the court of first instance, we are unable to properly consider
the appellant’s constitutional challenge.  The court of appeal
may, however, review the record to ascertain if the “trial judge
made a patent legal error” even if the matter was not raised at
the summary conviction appeal: R. v. Anderson (1996), 111 C.C.C.
(3d) 540 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused May 1,
1997.  Additionally, an appeal court, in considering whether the
verdict at trial was unreasonable, may review the findings of
fact made at trial to determine whether the summary conviction
appeal court was correct in dismissing the appeal: R v. W. (G)
(1996), 93 O.A.C. 1 (C.A.).  In the particular circumstances of
this case, we have come to the conclusion that the trial judge
failed to consider the importance of the missing walkman and
that, in light of the defence put forward, the verdict cannot be
maintained.
[5]  Accordingly, we would grant leave to appeal, allow the
appeal and set aside the conviction.  In the circumstances, an
acquittal is appropriate and we so order.
