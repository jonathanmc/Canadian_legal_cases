    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We see no reason to interfere with the trial judgment.
Several grounds of appeal were raised. They can be disposed of
summarily as follows:</pre>
    <pre>First issue:   What was the effect of the reconciliation on the
          separation agreement?</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We are of the view that it was entirely open to the trial
judge on the facts of this case to conclude that the
reconciliation effectively terminated the separation agreement,
including the mutual release with respect to pensions. We are not
at all persuaded that the release was in any way connected to the
division of property effected under the agreement as contended by
the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>Second issue:  Did the trial judge err in failing to calculate
          the equalization payment pursuant to the provisions of
          the Family Law Act?</pre>
    <pre>[3]  It is clear from the record that the parties had agreed to
limit the issues to be determined at trial on the question of
division of property to the appellant&#146;s pension. Two questions
required determination: a) the date of separation; and b) the
effect of the reconciliation on the release contained in the
separation agreement. The parties also agreed that any order made
with respect to the division of the pension would be made in
accordance with the Pension Benefits Division Act. The trial
judge determined the two questions and made an order accordingly.
[4]  In these circumstances, it is our view that it is not open
to the appellant to seek a different calculation based on a
consideration of all the property. Given the understanding at
trial, these issues were not litigated. In any event, we are not
persuaded, based on the submissions that we have heard, that the
husband's net family property was zero as submitted or that the
ultimate division effected at trial, in the manner consented to
by the parties through their counsel, was unreasonable or unfair.</pre>
    <pre>Third issue:   Did the trial judge err in not terminating the
          spousal support at the time of the appellant&#146;s
          retirement?</pre>
    <pre>[5]  We do not think that any issue of &#147;double dipping&#148; arises on
these facts where the support order is based on the appellant&#146;s
continuing income: see Best v. Best, [1999] S.C.J. No. 40
paragraphs 118-120. It was open to the trial judge in the
exercise his discretion to make a support order unlimited as to
time. The issue can always be reviewed upon the appellant&#146;s
retirement if there is a change in circumstances at the time.</pre>
    <pre>Fourth issue:  Costs</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Although the trial judge did not provide reasons for  his
award of costs in the amount of $15,000, we are satisfied on the
basis of the written submissions made to him that this award was
justified. Of particular importance was the fact that the
respondent made an offer to settle that was less favourable to
her than what she received at trial. Hence the consequences of
Rule 49.10 applied.
[7]  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $4,000.00.</pre></td>
