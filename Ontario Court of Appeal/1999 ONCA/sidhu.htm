    <pre>HEARD:         July 21, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the cost judgment of Caputo J. dated August 26, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  The trial judge does not expressly say why he awarded
solicitor and client costs.  However, we think that the award is
supportable on the ground that the respondents sought no personal
gain but instead sought to enforce the rules of the Society&#146;s
constitution for the benefit of all the members and on the ground
that the executive, in failing to follow the constitution,
breached their fiduciary obligation to their members.

[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
