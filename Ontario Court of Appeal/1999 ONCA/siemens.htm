    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant seeks to set aside the order granting judgment
to the plaintiff on the Rule 20 motion.  This is a final order
and the appeal is properly to this court.

[2]  The endorsement of the motions judge does not appear to
address the defence of equitable set-off on the summary judgment
motion granting the plaintiff's claim.  Nor, however, did she
grant the summary judgment sought by the plaintiff dismissing the
counterclaim which has essentially the same factual and legal
basis.  She must have concluded that the counterclaim raises a
genuine issue for trial.  It is appropriate that both the
equitable set-off defence and the counterclaim be tried rather
than one decided on summary judgment motion and the other sent on
to trial.

[3]  Moreover, in our view there is a genuine issue for trial
with respect to the defence of equitable set-off, including
whether the set-off claimed flows from the same relationship as
the claim itself, so as to raise the equitable set-off defence.

[4]  We would therefore set aside the judgment below and direct
that both the claim and the counterclaim proceed to trial save
for the value of the goods and services supplied by the plaintiff
to the defendant which is fixed at $96,861 at the relevant date.

[5]  Costs will be in the cause.</pre></td>
