    <pre>CHARRON J.A.

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This appeal concerns the subrogated right of an insurer  to</pre>
    <pre>recover  monies paid to a landlord under a fire insurance  policy</pre>
    <pre>for  damage to  the leased premises caused by the actions  of  an</pre>
    <pre>employee/director of a corporate tenant.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  action  arises  out of a  fire  which  occurred  in  a</pre>
    <pre>restaurant  leased  to  Mamma  Mia  Pizza  (Kingston)  Ltd  (&quot;the</pre>
    <pre>tenant&quot;).  The  respondent,  Norman  Silva,  (&quot;Silva&quot;)   is   the</pre>
    <pre>president and directing mind of the corporate tenant. It is  also</pre>
    <pre>alleged  that he is an employee of the corporation. Silva  denies</pre>
    <pre>that he is an employee in his pleadings. For the purposes of this</pre>
    <pre>appeal,  I do not think that the distinction is material.  It  is</pre>
    <pre>alleged  that the fire occurred as a result of Silva's negligence</pre>
    <pre>in leaving the gas stove on &quot;high&quot; under a pot of butter while he</pre>
    <pre>went next door for a cup of coffee.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  restaurant  is  part of a  strip  mall  owned  by  the</pre>
    <pre>appellants  Antonio Sarris and James Zikovelis (&quot;the  landlords&quot;)</pre>
    <pre>and  insured by the appellant Canadian General Insurance  Company</pre>
    <pre>(&quot;the insurer&quot;). The policy mistakenly identified the insured  as</pre>
    <pre>the appellant Tony and Jim's Holdings Ltd, a company owned by the</pre>
    <pre>landlords.  The insurer accepted liability under the  policy  and</pre>
    <pre>paid for the fire damage. The landlords and the corporate insured</pre>
    <pre>have  all assigned any rights they may have against Silva to  the</pre>
    <pre>insurer.  This  action, in all respects, is  a  subrogated  claim</pre>
    <pre>brought by the insurer for the recovery from Silva of monies paid</pre>
    <pre>to the landlords under the policy.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]   Silva denies negligence but also maintains that this action</pre>
    <pre>cannot be brought by the landlords, or by anyone whose rights are</pre>
    <pre>subrogated to their interest, because the tenant, by the terms of</pre>
    <pre>its  leasing  agreement,  was  responsible  for  payment  of  the</pre>
    <pre>insurance premiums. In these circumstances, Silva maintains  that</pre>
    <pre>as  the  landlords assumed the risk for the loss by  agreeing  to</pre>
    <pre>obtain  insurance against it, they cannot bring an action against</pre>
    <pre>the  tenant. Silva further maintains that he and the  tenant  are</pre>
    <pre>one  and  the  same for this purpose and that no  action  can  be</pre>
    <pre>brought against him.

</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellants' right to maintain this action was raised  on</pre>
    <pre>a  motion for determination of a question of law and for  summary</pre>
    <pre>judgment  brought by Silva pursuant to Rules 21  and  20  of  the</pre>
    <pre>Rules  of  Civil  Procedure, R.R.O. 1990,  Reg.194.  The  motions</pre>
    <pre>judge,  Métivier J., held that the subrogated action  was  barred</pre>
    <pre>and,  consequently, granted summary judgment dismissing  it.  The</pre>
    <pre>appellants appeal against this finding.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]   At  the  time  the  fire occurred, the  lease  between  the</pre>
    <pre>landlords  and  the  tenant had expired. The tenant  remained  in</pre>
    <pre>possession  while  a  new  agreement was  being  negotiated.  The</pre>
    <pre>parties  agree  that at the relevant time the  tenancy  continued</pre>
    <pre>from month to month on the same terms as contained in the written</pre>
    <pre>lease.  While the lease contained no express covenant to  insure,</pre>
    <pre>it  did  provide for  any insurance premiums to be  paid  by  the</pre>
    <pre>tenant. The lease also contained the usual  tenant's covenant  to</pre>
    <pre>repair,  &quot;reasonable wear and tear, and damage by fire, lightning</pre>
    <pre>and tempest only excepted.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  appellants  concede that, in the  circumstances,  they</pre>
    <pre>cannot  sue  the  tenant  to recover damages  caused  by  a  fire</pre>
    <pre>resulting  from  the  tenant's  negligence.  This  concession  is</pre>
    <pre>rightly made.

</pre>
    <pre>[8]   It is well established that the risk of loss by fire passed</pre>
    <pre>to  the  landlord  under the provision of  the  lease  respecting</pre>
    <pre>payment of insurance rates by the tenant. This is so even in  the</pre>
    <pre>absence of an express covenant to insure: Ross Southward Tire Ltd</pre>
    <pre>v. Pyrotech Products Ltd, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 35.  The risk passed to</pre>
    <pre>the  landlord  despite the tenant's general covenant  to  repair,</pre>
    <pre>which,  in  the absence of the landlord's obligation  to  insure,</pre>
    <pre>would  obligate  the tenant to repair damage caused  by  its  own</pre>
    <pre>negligence:  Agnew-Surpass Shoe Stores  Limited  v.  Cummer-Yonge</pre>
    <pre>Investments  Limited, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 221.   As  stated  by  this</pre>
    <pre>court in Madison Developments Ltd v. Plan Electric Co. (1997), 36</pre>
    <pre>O.R. (3d) 80 at 84 (C.A.):

</pre>
    <pre>          The rationale for this conclusion is that the
          covenant  to insure is a contractual  benefit
          accorded  to the tenant, which, on its  face,
          covers  fires  with or without negligence  by
          any person.  There would be no benefit to the
          tenant from the covenant if it did not  apply
          to a fire caused by the tenant's negligence.
</pre>
    <pre>It is equally clear that the insurer can be in no better position</pre>
    <pre>than the landlords on their subrogated claim.

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellants take the position, however, that Silva cannot</pre>
    <pre>benefit from the landlords' obligation to insure under the  lease</pre>
    <pre>because  he is not a party to that agreement. The tenant  is  not</pre>
    <pre>Silva,  but  Mamma  Mia  Pizza  (Kingston)  Ltd.  The  appellants</pre>
    <pre>maintain  that Silva is an employee of the tenant  and  that,  as</pre>
    <pre>such,  he  is  liable for his own negligence  regardless  of  his</pre>
    <pre>employer's  legal status with respect to the same occurrence.  It</pre>
    <pre>is  argued  that Silva cannot be a third-party beneficiary  under</pre>
    <pre>the  lease  because he does not fall within any of the recognized</pre>
    <pre>exceptions to the doctrine of privity of contract.

</pre>
    <pre>[10]  Silva takes three alternative positions in defence  of  the</pre>
    <pre>appellant's  claim. First, he argues that he  and  the  corporate</pre>
    <pre>tenant  are  in fact one and that they should be treated  as  one</pre>
    <pre>entity   under  the  lease.  He  notes  that,  although   not   a</pre>
    <pre>shareholder,  he  is  the president and  directing  mind  of  the</pre>
    <pre>corporate  tenant. Mamma Mia Pizza (Kingston) Ltd.  is  a  family</pre>
    <pre>business  that  was  first started as a sole proprietorship.  The</pre>
    <pre>business was incorporated in 1977 and continued to be run by  him</pre>
    <pre>and  his  wife following the incorporation. At the  time  of  the</pre>
    <pre>fire,  his wife was the sole shareholder of the corporation.  The</pre>
    <pre>evidence shows that any dealings between the corporate tenant and</pre>
    <pre>the  landlords  were made through Silva. The landlords,  although</pre>
    <pre>aware  that  the  business  was  incorporated,  were  indifferent</pre>
    <pre>whether  they  dealt with the corporation or  Silva  himself.  In</pre>
    <pre>these  circumstances, Silva argues that there is an &quot;identity  of</pre>
    <pre>interest&quot;  between the  corporation and himself and that  he  can</pre>
    <pre>benefit from the implied covenant to insure in the lease.

</pre>
    <pre>[11]  Second,  Silva  argues that the corporate  veil  should  be</pre>
    <pre>lifted  in  this case so that justice can be done  in  accordance</pre>
    <pre>with the commercial reality of the situation.

</pre>
    <pre>[12]  Third,  Silva  maintains that he is an unnamed  insured  by</pre>
    <pre>necessary  implication under the insurer's policy  and  that,  as</pre>
    <pre>such, he cannot be sued for a loss covered by the policy.

</pre>
    <pre>[13]  The  motions  judge  held that  the  action  could  not  be</pre>
    <pre>maintained against Silva for all the reasons he advanced.

</pre>
    <pre>[14]  In my view, the evidence establishes without question  that</pre>
    <pre>Silva and Mamma Mia (Kingston) Ltd are separate entities and that</pre>
    <pre>the  corporation is the tenant under the leasing agreement. I see</pre>
    <pre>no  valid  juristic  reason  to  &quot;lift  the  corporate  veil&quot;  as</pre>
    <pre>contended  by  Silva.  Nor do I find it  necessary  to  determine</pre>
    <pre>whether  Silva  is  an  unnamed insured by necessary  implication</pre>
    <pre>under  the insurer's policy. It is my view that this case  turns,</pre>
    <pre>rather,  on whether there is such an identity of interest between</pre>
    <pre>Silva  and  the  tenant  with respect to the  landlords'  implied</pre>
    <pre>covenant to insure as to justify extending its benefit to both. I</pre>
    <pre>have  come  to the conclusion that there is such an  identity  of</pre>
    <pre>interest and that, consequently, the motions judge was correct in</pre>
    <pre>dismissing the appellants' action as barred.

</pre>
    <pre>Analysis
</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The  appellants  rely on Greenwood Shopping  Plaza  Ltd  v.</pre>
    <pre>Beattie,  [1980]  2 S.C.R. 228 in support of their  position.  In</pre>
    <pre>Greenwood  Shopping  Plaza, a lessor sued two  employees  of  its</pre>
    <pre>corporate  lessee who negligently caused a fire by acts committed</pre>
    <pre>in the course of their employment. The question arose whether the</pre>
    <pre>provisions  of  the lease obligating the landlord to  insure  the</pre>
    <pre>premises  exempted  the tenant's employees  from  liability.  The</pre>
    <pre>Supreme  Court  held  that the employees  were  not  exempt  from</pre>
    <pre>liability. In essence, the court refused to relax the application</pre>
    <pre>of  the rule of privity beyond the recognized exceptions of trust</pre>
    <pre>or  agency and, on the limited evidence available with respect to</pre>
    <pre>the  relationship between the employees and their employer,  held</pre>
    <pre>that  neither  exception  was made out. The  two  employees  were</pre>
    <pre>considered  &quot;strangers&quot; to the contract who  could  not  claim  a</pre>
    <pre>benefit under it.

</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Twelve  years  later, the Supreme  Court  reconsidered  the</pre>
    <pre>doctrine of privity and third party beneficiaries in London Drugs</pre>
    <pre>Ltd.  v. Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd., [1992] 3 S.C.R.  299.</pre>
    <pre>One  of  the issues raised in London Drugs, was whether warehouse</pre>
    <pre>employees  who negligently damaged a customer's property  in  the</pre>
    <pre>course  of  their employment could benefit from a  limitation  of</pre>
    <pre>liability clause in the contract of storage between the  employer</pre>
    <pre>and  the  customer.  The  court held  that,  while  none  of  the</pre>
    <pre>traditional  exceptions to privity of contract was applicable  in</pre>
    <pre>the  case  at bar, the doctrine should nonetheless be relaxed  in</pre>
    <pre>the circumstances. In the final analysis, the court concluded  as</pre>
    <pre>follows (at 448):

</pre>
    <pre>          In  the end, the narrow question before  this
          Court   is:  in  what  circumstances   should
          employees  be  entitled  to  benefit  from  a
          limitation  of liability clause  found  in  a
          contract  between  their  employer  and   the
          plaintiff  (customer)? Keeping  in  mind  the
          comments  made  earlier and the circumstances
          of  this  appeal,  I  am  of  the  view  that
          employees  may obtain such a benefit  if  the
          following requirements are satisfied:
</pre>
    <pre>               1)  The  limitation of liability  clause
               must,  either  expressly  or  impliedly,
               extend its benefit to the employees  (or
               employee) seeking to rely on it; and
</pre>
    <pre>               2)  the  employees (or employee) seeking
               the  benefit  of  the limitation  clause
               must  have been acting in the course  of
               their  employment  and  must  have  been
               performing  the  very services  provided
               for   in  the  contract  between   their
               employer  and  the plaintiff  (customer)
               when the loss occurred.
</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  appellants  submit that London  Drugs  establishes  an</pre>
    <pre>additional but very narrow exception to the rule of privity,  and</pre>
    <pre>that the present case simply does not fall within its purview. In</pre>
    <pre>particular,  they  submit that Silva's negligent  actions,  while</pre>
    <pre>arguably  performed in the course of his employment,   cannot  be</pre>
    <pre>said to have been in the performance of the lease agreement. They</pre>
    <pre>note  further that Greenwood Shopping Plaza was not overruled  in</pre>
    <pre>London   Drugs   but,   rather,  that  it  was   considered   and</pre>
    <pre>distinguished.  They submit that the present case is on all fours</pre>
    <pre>with  the  fact situation in Greenwood Shopping Plaza  and  that,</pre>
    <pre>consequently,  the  same result should follow denying  Silva  the</pre>
    <pre>benefit of any terms of the lease.

</pre>
    <pre>[18]  On the other hand, Silva submits that the Supreme Court  in</pre>
    <pre>London  Drugs  has not just distinguished the facts in  Greenwood</pre>
    <pre>Shopping  Plaza  but  has applied a new reasoning  to  create  an</pre>
    <pre>incremental change in the law of privity. Silva argues  that  the</pre>
    <pre>rationale in London Drugs is not restricted to its facts and that</pre>
    <pre>it can apply in other fact situations, such as the present case.

</pre>
    <pre>[19]  In  my view, the approach suggested by Silva is the correct</pre>
    <pre>one.   Greenwood   Shopping  Plaza  was  indeed  considered   and</pre>
    <pre>distinguished  in  London Drugs but the basis for  distinguishing</pre>
    <pre>the case was not entirely factual. Iacobucci J., in writing for a</pre>
    <pre>majority   of  the  court,  made  four  observations   concerning</pre>
    <pre>Greenwood  Shopping Plaza (at 431-32). It is sufficient  for  the</pre>
    <pre>purpose  of  this  analysis to refer  to  his  summary  of  these</pre>
    <pre>observations (at 432):

</pre>
    <pre>               In  sum,  the decision of the  Court  in
          Greenwood  Shopping Plaza,  while  containing
          certain   general  statements   relating   to
          privity of contract, involved a contract  and
          provisions  which  are  different  from   the
          contract  and provision in the case  at  bar.
          More  importantly, however, is the fact  that
          that  case was not decided with reference  to
          third party beneficiaries and with the aspect
          of  privity denying a jus tertii, but  rather
          with  reference  to complete strangers  to  a
          contract.  Accordingly,  Greenwood   Shopping
          Plaza, like Canadian General Electric, is  of
          limited  use  in a determination  of  whether
          third  party  beneficiary  rights  should  be
          recognized in certain limited circumstances.
</pre>
    <pre>[20]  While  the contract and the provisions in question  in  the</pre>
    <pre>present  case  are  similar to those found in Greenwood  Shopping</pre>
    <pre>Plaza, the fact remains that, as stated by Iacobucci J., the case</pre>
    <pre>is  of  limited use in a determination of third party beneficiary</pre>
    <pre>rights.  On  the other hand, London Drugs specifically  considers</pre>
    <pre>the issue.

</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  approach suggested by Silva was expressly  adopted  by</pre>
    <pre>this  court  in  Madison Developments Ltd, supra.  The  following</pre>
    <pre>words of Carthy J.A. are particularly relevant on this point  (at</pre>
    <pre>91):

</pre>
    <pre>          ...  the Supreme Court [in London Drugs]  has
          not   just   distinguished   the   facts   in
          Greenwood;  it has applied new  reasoning  to
          create  an incremental change in the  law  of
          privity,  and  has set forth a test  for  the
          application  of  that  change  which  is  not
          restricted   to   cases   involving   limited
          liability.  In my view, it is now unnecessary
          to compare the facts of this case to those in
          Greenwood. It is rather a matter of  applying
          the  general principles enunciated in  London
          Drugs  Ltd. to a case involving an obligation
          to  obtain fire insurance, as opposed to  one
          imposing a limitation of liability.
</pre>
    <pre>[22]  In order to extract the general principles in London Drugs,</pre>
    <pre>it  may be useful to review the approach taken by the majority of</pre>
    <pre>the  court. Iacobucci J. first stated the doctrine of privity  of</pre>
    <pre>contract as follows (at 415-16):

</pre>
    <pre>          Broadly   speaking,   it   stands   for   the
          proposition  that  a contract  cannot,  as  a
          general   rule,  confer  rights   or   impose
          obligations  arising under it on  any  person
          except   the   parties  to  it:  [authorities
          omitted].  It  is now widely recognized  that
          this   doctrine   has   two   very   distinct
          components  or aspects. On the one  hand,  it
          precludes parties to a contract from imposing
          liabilities or obligations on third  parties.
          On  the other, it prevents third parties from
          obtaining   rights   or  benefits   under   a
          contract;  it  refuses  to  recognize  a  jus
          quaesitum tertio or a jus tertii. This latter
          aspect  has not only applied to deny complete
          strangers    from    enforcing    contractual
          provisions  but  has also  applied  in  cases
          where the contract attempts, either expressly
          or  impliedly, to confer benefits on a  third
          party. In other words, it has equally applied
          in cases involving third party beneficiaries.
</pre>
    <pre>[23]  Iacobucci J. noted that the reasons behind the doctrine  of</pre>
    <pre>privity  have  received very little judicial attention.  He  then</pre>
    <pre>reviewed   some  of  the  justifications  for  the  rule.   These</pre>
    <pre>justifications  become important later in  his  judgment  in  the</pre>
    <pre>determination  of whether the doctrine should be applied  in  the</pre>
    <pre>case  under  appeal.  He  stated that  Professor  Treitel  offers</pre>
    <pre>&quot;perhaps  the  most often cited (and debated) justifications  for</pre>
    <pre>the  doctrine&quot;  in  his  treatise The Law of  Contract,  8th  ed.</pre>
    <pre>London: Stevens &amp; Sons, 1991 at 527-28:</pre>
    <pre>C    a  contract  is a very personal affair, affecting  only  the</pre>
    <pre>     parties to it;</pre>
    <pre>C    it would be unjust to allow a person to sue on a contract on
     which he or she could not be sued;</pre>
    <pre>C    if  third  parties could enforce contracts  made  for  their
     benefit, the rights of contracting parties to rescind or vary
     such contracts would be unduly hampered; and</pre>
    <pre>C    the third party is often merely a donee and a &quot;system of law
     which does not give a gratuitous promisee a right to enforce the
     promise  is  not likely to give this right to  a  gratuitous
     beneficary who is not even a promisee&quot;.
</pre>
    <pre>Iacobucci J. noted other possible justifications as follows:</pre>
    <pre>C    preventing  the  promisor  from  being  subject  to   double</pre>
    <pre>     recovery and</pre>
    <pre>C    avoiding a floodgate of litigation brought about by third
party beneficiaries.
</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The  court  noted  that, while  the  doctrine  was  a  well</pre>
    <pre>established  principle of contract law,  it  is  not  an  ancient</pre>
    <pre>principle. Many earlier English common law decisions have allowed</pre>
    <pre>third  party  beneficiaries to enforce contracts made  for  their</pre>
    <pre>benefit. In this century, the doctrine, at least when it comes to</pre>
    <pre>third  party  beneficiaries, has received much criticism  by  law</pre>
    <pre>reformers,  commentators, and judges. The following  observations</pre>
    <pre>were made on the many concerns about the doctrine (at 423):

</pre>
    <pre>          For  our  purposes, I think it sufficient  to
          make  the  following observations. Many  have
          noted that an application of the doctrine  so
          as to prevent a third party from relying on a
          limitation  of  liability  clause  which  was
          intended  to  benefit him or  her  frustrates
          sound  commercial practice  and  justice.  It
          does  not respect allocations and assumptions
          of  risk  made by the parties to the contract
          and  it  ignores the practical realitites  of
          insurance  coverage. In essence,  it  permits
          one  party  to make a unilateral modification
          to   the   contract   by  circumventing   its
          provisions   and  the  express   or   implied
          intention of the parties. In addition, it  is
          inconsistent with the reasonable expectations
          of   all  the  parties  to  the  transaction,
          including the third party beneficiary who  is
          made   to   support  the  entire  burden   of
          liability.   The  doctrine  has   also   been
          criticized  for creating uncertainty  in  the
          law.  While  most  commentators  welcome,  at
          least  in  principle,  the  various  judicial
          exceptions  to privity of contract,  concerns
          about  the predictability of their  use  have
          been  raised. Moreover, it is said, in  cases
          where the recognized exceptions do not appear
          to   apply,   the  underlying   concerns   of
          commercial reality and justice still militate
          for   the  recognititon  of  a  third   party
          beneficiary right.
</pre>
    <pre>[25]  After  noting the numerous calls from the judiciary  for  a</pre>
    <pre>reconsideration  of the doctrine of privity,  Iacobucci  J.  held</pre>
    <pre>that,  for  sound policy reasons, major reforms to  the  doctrine</pre>
    <pre>should  be made by the legislature. He noted, however,  that  &quot;in</pre>
    <pre>appropriate circumstances courts have not only the power but  the</pre>
    <pre>duty to make incremental changes to the common law to see that it</pre>
    <pre>reflects the emerging needs and values of our society&quot; (at 438).

</pre>
    <pre>[26] The application of the doctrine on the facts in London Drugs</pre>
    <pre>would  give  rise to a number of the usual criticisms  about  the</pre>
    <pre>doctrine.  Further, as Iacobucci J. noted (at  440),  there  were</pre>
    <pre>&quot;few principled reasons for upholding the doctrine of privity  in</pre>
    <pre>the  circumstances  of this case.&quot; Hence, he concluded  that  the</pre>
    <pre>doctrine should be relaxed so as to allow the employees to  claim</pre>
    <pre>the  protection  of  the limitation clause  in  their  employer's</pre>
    <pre>contract.

</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Admittedly, the present case is different from London Drugs</pre>
    <pre>in  several  respects. However, as noted in Madison  Developments</pre>
    <pre>Ltd,  the  rationale  in London Drugs is  not  limited  to  cases</pre>
    <pre>involving  limited liability. Many of the points noted in  London</pre>
    <pre>Drugs apply equally well to this case.

</pre>
    <pre>[28]  First,  as stated in London Drugs (at 440),  &quot;most  of  the</pre>
    <pre>traditional reasons or justifications behind the doctrine are  of</pre>
    <pre>little application in cases such as this one, when a third  party</pre>
    <pre>beneficiary is relying on a contractual provision as a defence in</pre>
    <pre>an  action  brought  by  one  of  the  contracting  parties.&quot;  In</pre>
    <pre>comparison with the recognition of a third party's right to  sue,</pre>
    <pre>there  are  no  concerns in a case such as this one about  double</pre>
    <pre>recovery, floodgates of litigation, reciprocity or the  right  of</pre>
    <pre>contracting parties to rescind or vary their contracts.

</pre>
    <pre>[29] Second, as in London Drugs, the doctrine of privity fails to</pre>
    <pre>appreciate  the  special  considerations  which  arise  from  the</pre>
    <pre>relationship  between the parties in this case. In London  Drugs,</pre>
    <pre>the  court  recognized  that there was clearly  an  &quot;identity  of</pre>
    <pre>interest between the employer and his or her employees as far  as</pre>
    <pre>the  performance  of  the employer's contractual  obligations  is</pre>
    <pre>concerned.&quot;  In my view, there is also quite clearly an  identity</pre>
    <pre>of interest between Silva and the corporate tenant in this case.

</pre>
    <pre>[30]  The  appellants quite rightly note that a tenancy would  be</pre>
    <pre>created  in  this  case  even in the  absence  of  Silva  or  any</pre>
    <pre>employees  on  the premises. In this sense, the &quot;performance&quot;  of</pre>
    <pre>the lease did not engage the conduct of third parties in the same</pre>
    <pre>way  as the contract for services did in London Drugs. It  is  my</pre>
    <pre>view,  however, that the consideration of whether  there  is  any</pre>
    <pre>identity of interest need not encompass the whole contract. It is</pre>
    <pre>sufficient  if there is an identity of interest with  respect  to</pre>
    <pre>the  clause in question. I find support for this approach in  the</pre>
    <pre>following excerpt from London Drugs (at 441):

</pre>
    <pre>          Of  course,  I  am in no way suggesting  that
          employees  are  a  party to their  employer's
          contracts  in the traditional sense  so  that
          they  can bring an action on the contract  or
          be sued for breach of contract. However, when
          an  employer  and  a customer  enter  into  a
          contract  for services and include  a  clause
          limiting  the  liability of the employer  for
          damages  arising from what will  normally  be
          conduct   contemplated  by  the   contracting
          parties  to  be  performed by the  employer's
          employees, and in fact so performed, there is
          simply  no  valid  reason  for  denying   the
          benefit  of  the  clause  to  employees   who
          perform the contractual obligations.
</pre>
    <pre>[31]  In  the  same way, Silva, for example, could  not  sue  the</pre>
    <pre>landlords  under  the lease for possession of the  premises,  nor</pre>
    <pre>could he be sued for the rental payments. There is no identity of</pre>
    <pre>interest in this sense. However, by including provisions  in  the</pre>
    <pre>lease  giving  rise to the landlord's contractual  obligation  to</pre>
    <pre>insure  for losses extending to those occasioned by the  tenant's</pre>
    <pre>negligence, the parties must be taken to have understood that the</pre>
    <pre>corporate  tenant could only be guilty of negligence through  its</pre>
    <pre>directors  or employees. It is in this respect that there  is  an</pre>
    <pre>&quot;identity of interest&quot;. Whether Silva is regarded as an  employee</pre>
    <pre>acting  within  the scope of his employment  or  as  one  of  the</pre>
    <pre>directors  and  the operating mind of the corporate  tenant,  his</pre>
    <pre>alleged  negligent conduct can only be regarded as  that  of  the</pre>
    <pre>corporation in this context.

</pre>
    <pre>[32]  Third,  In  London  Drugs, the court  held  that  a  strict</pre>
    <pre>application of the doctrine of privity in the circumstances would</pre>
    <pre>have  the  effect  of  allowing the customer  to  circumvent  the</pre>
    <pre>limitation  of  liability  clause  to  which  it  had   expressly</pre>
    <pre>consented. Similarly, it is my view that a strict application  of</pre>
    <pre>the doctrine in this case would, in effect, allow the insurer  to</pre>
    <pre>circumvent  the  waiver of subrogation to which  it  agreed.  The</pre>
    <pre>policy contained the following clause:

</pre>
    <pre>          The  Insurer,  upon  making  any  payment  or
          assuming liability therefore under this  form
          shall be subrogated to all rights of recovery
          of  the Insured against others and may  bring
          action     to     enforce    such     rights.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights  of
          subrogation  are  hereby waived  against  any
          corporation,  firm,  individual,   or   other
          interest  with respect to which insurance  is
          provided by this policy. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>While  the  language  used in this clause is  certainly  not  the</pre>
    <pre>clearest,  it would seem to me that, in a case such as  this  one</pre>
    <pre>where  fire  coverage  is extended to leased  premises  for  fire</pre>
    <pre>caused by the negligence of anyone, the scope of this waiver  can</pre>
    <pre>reasonably  be interpreted to extend to the tenant  who,  in  the</pre>
    <pre>words  of  the  clause, has an &quot;interest with  respect  to  which</pre>
    <pre>insurance  is  provided&quot; by the policy. Indeed, the insurer  does</pre>
    <pre>not  assert  the  right to make a subrogated  claim  against  the</pre>
    <pre>tenant. It is my view that the words used are also wide enough to</pre>
    <pre>include those individuals through which the corporate tenant,  of</pre>
    <pre>necessity, must act.

</pre>
    <pre>[33]  Fourth, it is clear that the parties intended, by the terms</pre>
    <pre>of  the  lease, to allocate the risk of damage between  them  and</pre>
    <pre>then  to  procure  insurance accordingly.  The  tenant  paid  the</pre>
    <pre>premiums,  and the landlord procured the insurance. The appellant</pre>
    <pre>Sarris confirmed in his examination for discovery that &quot;we had to</pre>
    <pre>protect ourselves, and the tenants.&quot; Given that Silva signed  the</pre>
    <pre>lease  which  included the insurance provision on behalf  of  the</pre>
    <pre>corporation,  it  makes no commercial sense to  expect  in  these</pre>
    <pre>circumstances  that Silva would understand that he was  obligated</pre>
    <pre>to  procure  separate  insurance  to  cover  the  acts  of  those</pre>
    <pre>individuals through which the corporation would act. In my  view,</pre>
    <pre>such   an   interpretation  would  clearly  defeat  the  parties'</pre>
    <pre>allocation of risk and their reasonable expectations.

</pre>
    <pre>[34]  For  these reasons, I am of the view that this  case  falls</pre>
    <pre>within  the  principles  enunciated in  London  Drugs  and  that,</pre>
    <pre>consequently, the insurer's subrogated claim cannot be maintained</pre>
    <pre>against  Silva.  I  note that a similar result  was  obtained  in</pre>
    <pre>Madison Developments Limited, supra, where this court held that a</pre>
    <pre>contractor's  covenant to insure on its behalf and on  behalf  of</pre>
    <pre>the owner protected the subcontractor from a subrogated claim for</pre>
    <pre>losses  caused  by  fire  resulting from the  negligence  of  the</pre>
    <pre>subcontractor's employees.

</pre>
    <pre>[35] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre></td>
