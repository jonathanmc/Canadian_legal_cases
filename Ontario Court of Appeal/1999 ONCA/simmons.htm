    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Applicant)
               v.  ROY SIMMONS (Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        LABROSSE, CHARRON and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Christine Bartlett-Hughes,
               for the applicant</pre>
    <pre>               Richard Litkowski,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         February 4, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                          ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an application pursuant to s. 680 of the Criminal
Code for a review of the order of Rosenberg J.A. (the &quot;Chambers
judge&quot;) releasing the respondent on bail pending his re-trial.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The onus at the hearing before the Chambers judge was on the
Crown to establish why the respondent should not be released
pending his re-trial. The Chambers judge had the advantage of a
substantial degree of familiarity with the entire record as he
was a member of the panel that heard the appeal and ordered a new
trial.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The Chambers judge gave detailed reasons in support of his
decision to release the respondent. He gave proper consideration
to the primary and secondary grounds. He also adverted to and
addressed the public interest ground or &quot;tertiary ground&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In effect, the Chambers judge addressed fully each ground
advanced by the Crown in support of its position that the
respondent should be detained.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  We see no error in the Chambers judge's assessment of the
facts or in the application of the applicable legal principles
and we agree with his decision. We note that the respondent has
been at liberty since December 4, 1998. There is no evidence that
he has not abided fully by the terms of his release. His trial is
scheduled for March 22, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Accordingly, the application is dismissed.</pre></td>
