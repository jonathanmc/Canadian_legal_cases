    <pre>[1]  In our view, the trial judge was correct in dismissing the
appellant&#146;s action against Her Majesty the Queen in Right of
Ontario and in dismissing his motion to add a Crown counsel as a
party defendant.

[2]  The appellant&#146;s claim is based on the alleged breach of his
rights under s.7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
by Crown counsel during the course of a prosecution against him
on two counts of fraud.

[3]  The appellant argues firstly that the institution of
criminal proceedings, in and of itself, constituted a violation
of his s.7 Charter rights because proof of the required mens rea
for the alleged offences was dependant on the interpretation to
be given to the terms of a collective agreement, a question that
formed part of a pending arbitration proceeding at the time.

[4]  We see no merit to this argument. The arbitration between
the appellant&#146;s employer and his union is a dispute between
private parties over the terms of their contract. It does not in
any way constitute a bar to criminal proceedings that are founded
on the same conduct or subject-matter. The authorities relied
upon by the appellant in his factum concern civil proceedings and
are of no application to this case.

[5]  The appellant also founds his claim on a number of
allegations relating to the conduct of the prosecution in
preparation for trial and at trial. The appellant does not allege
any malice. Rather, his claim appears to be founded on
allegations of negligent conduct.

[6]  The respondent correctly notes that it is a clearly settled
principle of law in Canada that there exists no cause of action
in negligence at common law against the Crown for alleged
negligence by Crown counsel in the exercise of their duty to
prosecute: Nelles v. Ontario (1989), 60 D.L.R. (4th 644 (S.C.C.);
Thompson v. R. a decision released by this Court on October 1,
1998.

[7]  The respondent argues that the same considerations which
have led the courts to conclude that negligence in the conduct of
a prosecution will not support an action for damages at common
law apply when the action is framed under the Charter. The
respondent fairly concedes that this question appears to be still
open on the existing jurisprudence.

[8]  We do not find it necessary or advisable on this record to
make any determinative finding on this point. In our view, the
appellant&#146;s claim for damages bears no chance of success. All of
the allegations of misconduct relate to matters that properly
formed part of the criminal proceedings. In our view, a trial
court could come to no other conclusion but that the appellant&#146;s
s.7 rights were given full accordance at his criminal trial. The
appellant&#146;s Charter claim raises no genuine issue for trial and,
consequently, it was properly dismissed.

[9]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
