    <pre>R. A. BLAIR J (ad hoc):</pre>
    <pre>                     I - OVERVIEW AND FACTS
     Overview</pre>
    <pre>[1] On December 27, 1991, Michael and Sandy Simone orally agreed
to purchase a home located at 55 Bayside Court in the Town of
Vaughan from the Defendants, Sean Daley and Sandra Montanari.
They moved in immediately, and have continued to live in the
premises to the present time -- although not in their capacity as
purchasers.  The transaction was to have closed in January 1993,
but it aborted.  It failed to close largely because of the
financial travails of the appellant, Sean Daley, which ultimately
led to his voluntary assignment in bankruptcy in October 1993.
Mortgagees sold under power of sale.  Relatives of the Respondent
purchasers acquired the premises from the mortgagee and the
Simones still reside in the premises, but as tenants.  In the
meantime, they have lost more than $130,000 in payments they made
to the appellant vendors on account of the purchase price, and on
behalf of the appellants to the first mortgagee, and in
improvements which they made to the property in contemplation of
becoming its owners.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge concluded that the transaction had failed to
close because of Sean Daley's failure to arrange for the
financing on closing, which he held Mr. Daley had agreed to do as
part of the transaction.  As a result of the breach the Simone's
lost the amounts above referred to; however, the trial judge
deducted from those amounts the sum of $11,000 for taxes which he
held were the responsibility of the Simone's under the oral
agreement, and a further sum of $64,800 for occupation rent.  He
therefore awarded the Simones damages in the amount of $53,320
plus pre-judgment interest from January 1, 1995.  The trial judge
also concluded that Mr. Daley had been acting in a fiduciary
capacity and that his breach constituted a misappropriation or
defalcation as contemplated in paragraph 178(1)(d) of the
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended
(the &quot;BIA&quot;), and accordingly he granted a declaration that Mr.
Daley's discharge from bankruptcy does not extinguish the debt as
against him.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The central issue on this appeal relates to that declaration
and to the trial judge's conclusion that Mr. Daley had committed
a misappropriation or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary
capacity.  An additional element on the appeal relates to damages
(the appellants argue further deductions should have been made),
and the Respondents cross-appeal as to damages as well
(submitting that fewer deductions should have been made).</pre>
    <pre>     Facts</pre>
    <pre>[4]  At the time of the agreement, Mr. Daley was a young lawyer
recently called to the Bar, and Ms. Montanari was his secretary.
They had been engaged to be married, but at the time had had a
falling out1.  In contemplation of their pending marriage they
had purchased 55 Bayside Court, which was situated across the
street from Ms. Montanari's parents.  Because of the falling out,
however, Mr. Daley no longer wished to live across the street
from Ms. Montanari and her parents.  Moreover, with a large
mortgage against them and taxes, calling for monthly payments in
the area of $5,000, the premises were difficult to carry.
Accordingly, Mr. Daley was looking for a solution to this
problem.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  He found what was thought to be the solution in his friend,
Michael Simone.  Mr. Simone is a real estate agent of 20 years
experience.  He and Mr. Daley had first become acquainted when
Mr. Daley had successfully represented Mr. Simone in some court
proceedings.  A friendship developed.  They began to socialize
together.  Mr. Daley became aware that Michael and Sandy Simone
were looking for a place to live.  Mr. Simone discovered that Mr.
Daley was an interested seller.  In late December, 1991 B with
some involvement of Sandy Simone B they negotiated the agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The agreement, however, was never reduced to writing.  The
parties disagreed as to some of its terms.  They were
substantially in agreement that:</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  the purchase price was to be
          $380,000.00;</pre>
    <pre>          (b)  the Simones were to take possession
          immediately, and were to assume the costs of
          utilities;</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  the Simones were to make monthly
          payments on account of the purchase price at
          a minimum of $1,000.00 to a maximum of
          $2,000.00 per month for about one year; and,</pre>
    <pre>          (d)  title was to transfer from the
          defendants to the Simones in or about January
          1993 when the balance of the purchase price
          was to be paid.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  There were three issues upon which the parties could not
agree, however, and the trial judge was required to resolve them.
The issues, and his findings with respect to them, were as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  Who was responsible for the payment of municipal
          taxes during the period of possession prior to
          closing?  Jennings J. found that the taxes were to
          have been paid by Mr. and Mrs. Simone, the
          purchasers.</pre>
    <pre>     (2)  Had the Simones agreed to make a payment of up to
          $60,000 to Mr. Daley, on account of the purchase
          price, by June 30, 1992?  The trial judge found
          that there was to be no such &quot;maximum&quot; payment
          made by that date.</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  Who was to arrange for the financing required to
          pay the balance of the purchase price due on
          closing?  Significantly, for the purposes of this
          case, the trial judge found that it was Mr. Daley
          who agreed to find the financing to close, and
          that he failed to comply with that obligation.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In making his findings, the trial judge assessed the
evidence of Michael Simone and of Sean Daley and concluded that
where the evidence of the two differed on critical matters he
preferred and accepted the evidence of Mr. Simone.  It was open
to the trial
judge to make the foregoing findings on the evidence, and I see
no basis for interfering with them.  The trial judge then went on
to conclude that the appellants had breached their agreement of
purchase and sale, that Sean Daley was in breach of  fiduciary
obligations owed to the plaintiffs, that his fiduciary breach
constituted a misappropriation or defalcation as contemplated by
paragraph 178(1)(d) of the BIA, and accordingly that the judgment
against him survives his discharge from bankruptcy.  I turn now
to an analysis and consideration of those issues.
</pre>
    <pre>                     II - LAW AND ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     Fiduciary Obligations</pre>
    <pre>[9]  From the start of his analysis, Jennings J. rejected &quot;out of
hand&quot; the submission that Mr. Daley was acting as the Simone's
solicitor in connection with the transaction.  This finding is
well-supported by the evidence.  It meant, however, that the
finding of a fiduciary relationship, if one were to be made, had
to be based on something other than the existence of a solicitor-
client relationship B a clear category of fiduciary.  That
circumstance has given rise to some difficulties in this case, in
my view.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial judge correctly relied upon the observations of
appellate courts to the effect B as stated by Griffiths J.A. in
Knoch Estate v. John Picken Ltd.(1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 385, at p.
394 B that,</pre>
    <pre>          it is a question of fact in each case whether
          a fiduciary relationship exists and that it
          is the nature of the relationship, not the
          special category of the actors involved,
          which gives rise to the finding of a
          fiduciary.
</pre>
    <pre>[11] He then proceeded to examine the facts in light of the
&quot;three general characteristics&quot; first attributed to fiduciaries
by Wilson J., in dissent in Frame v. Frame, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 99,
and subsequently adopted by the majority of the Supreme Court of
Canada (per Sopinka J.) in Lac Minerals Ltd. v. International
Corona Resources Ltd., [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574, at pp. 598-599, as a
&quot;rough and ready guide&quot;, namely that:</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  the fiduciary has scope for the exercise of some
          discretion or power;</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  the fiduciary can unilaterally exercise that power
          or discretion so as to affect the beneficiary's
          legal or practical interests; and,</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  the beneficiary is peculiarly vulnerable to or at
          the mercy of the fiduciary holding the discretion
          or power.
</pre>
    <pre>[12] Applying the foregoing principles to the circumstances of
this case, Jennings J. concluded that, once the agreement had
been made, the appellant vendors were in &quot;a special relationship&quot;
with the plaintiffs by reasons of their obligation, as vendors,
to act as trustees of the title to the property for the
purchasers pending closing.  I quote in full his reasoning with
respect to the fiduciary finding, which is contained in the
following passage from his Reasons:</pre>
    <pre>          In the case before me, once the agreement was
          made, I find the defendants were in a special
          relationship with the plaintiffs.  Although
          they were the legal owners of the property,
          the plaintiffs were the beneficial owners,
          subject to complying with the terms of the
          agreement.  To that extent, the defendants
          acted as trustees of the title to the
          property.  They were obliged to take no steps
          to deal with that title in a manner harmful
          to the plaintiffs' beneficial interest.  As
          legal owners, they clearly had the scope to
          exercise power, and to exercise it
          unilaterally, to affect the beneficiaries'
          interest.  As legal owners, they knew they
          were trusted, as friends of the plaintiffs,
          and because of that trust the plaintiffs were
          vulnerable to or at the mercy of any dealing
          they chose to take with the title.</pre>
    <pre>               They were obliged to keep the mortgages
          in good standing so that they could be
          discharged, and they did not.  They were
          obliged to keep the title clear of executions
          so that a clear title could be transferred,
          and they did not.  Most importantly, they
          were obliged not to further encumber the
          title, and by placing a third mortgage for
          $60,000 on title six months into the deal,
          without the knowledge of the plaintiffs, they
          breached what I find to be their fiduciary
          duty to the plaintiffs.
</pre>
    <pre>[13] I have serious reservations about the finding of a fiduciary
relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendants in the
circumstances here.  Nonetheless, the existence of such a
relationship is a question of fact for determination in each
case, and I would not interfere with the trial judge's ultimate
disposition in this regard.  Some further comments with respect
to the fiduciary aspect of this case are nevertheless in order
however, in my opinion.</pre>
    <pre>[14] The relationship between the parties was that of vendor and
purchaser, and in my opinion the existence of such a relationship
does not, in itself, give rise to fiduciary duties.  Nor does the
fact that the vendors and purchasers happened to be friends,
elevate the relationship to a fiduciary level.  The normal
contractual relationship between a vendor and purchaser is not
characterized by the reposing of a trust or confidence by one
person in another and a consequent dependence resulting
therefrom, which the authorities indicate give rise to a
fiduciary duty.  It is true that the vendor acts as trustee of
the title for the purchaser pending completion of the
transaction.  However, to the extent that there may be an
obligation of the vendor &quot;to take no steps to deal with [the]
title in a manner harmful to the [purchaser's] beneficial
interest&quot;, as the trial judge concluded, it is only in the sense
of an obligation to be in a position to deliver title on closing,
in my view.  Breach of the obligation to convey the title, on
tender of the purchase price at closing, is remedied by damages
or, in appropriate circumstances B because of the equitable
requirement to hold title B by the equitable remedy of specific
performance.  There is no need to resort to the fiduciary
concept.

[15] Thus, I would be reluctant to attribute to vendors and
purchasers, generally, the obligations pending the completion of
a sale which the trial judge attributes to them in order to seal
the existence of a fiduciary obligation.  It goes too far, in my
respectful view, to suggest categorically that a vendor is
obligated &quot;to keep the mortgages in good standing so that they
could be discharged&quot;, or &quot;to keep the title clear of executions
so that a clear title could be transferred&quot;, or even &quot;not to
further encumber the title&quot;.  The obligation of a vendor is to
convey clear title on closing.  Not infrequently people find
themselves in a position where it is necessary to re-organize and
restructure their financial and proprietary affairs in order to
place them on a sounder footing and avoid insolvency.  They are
not always successful in this endeavour.  There will be many
circumstances where mortgages continue to be in default with
arrears continuing to accumulate, or where the property becomes
subject to other executions because of a vendor's outstanding
financial difficulties in other areas, pending the closing of a
transaction.  Such developments in themselves do not constitute
the sort of unilateral exercise of power in respect of a
&quot;vulnerable&quot; beneficiary which gives rise to a fiduciary duty or
a breach of that duty.  Even the placing of a further mortgage
against the property is not necessarily prohibited, provided the
vendor can convey title free of it on closing B particularly
where, as here, the additional mortgage was placed on title in
order to raise funds to reduce the outstanding obligations
pursuant to the first mortgage.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Purchasers are well able to protect themselves with respect
to title by registering the agreement: see the Land Titles Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. L-5, section 71.  I observe in passing that Mr.
Simone, the purchaser in this case, was hardly a neophyte when it
came to matters of real estate.  He is a real estate agent with
more than 30 years of experience. It is apparent that the trial
judge was not impressed with Mr. Daley as a witness.  Nor was he
impressed with his financial and investment lifestyle, for a
young professional of such limited experience.  A fiduciary
obligation must be grounded in the nature of the relationship
which exists between the parties, however, and not on the result
in law or equity which it is sought to reach.  The courts have
cautioned against the latter approach and the resort to what have
been referred to as &quot;false indicators of a fiduciary
relationship&quot;, one of which may be the presence of conduct which
attracts judicial sanction: see, Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994]
S.C.R. 277, per Sopinka J. and McLachlin J., at p. 463.</pre>
    <pre>[17] Subject to the caveat of the foregoing reservations,
however, I think there was evidence which might have supported a
fiduciary finding in this case.  That evidence relates to the
undertaking on the part of Mr. Daley to arrange the financing,
which he was unable to do.  A fiduciary finding based upon the
power/discretion/vulnerability analysis might have been sustained
on that footing.  In the end, I would not interfere with the
conclusion of Jennings J. that in the peculiar circumstances of
this case Mr. Daley owed a fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs.
</pre>
    <pre>     Debt Surviving Bankruptcy</pre>
    <pre>[18] Having concluded that Mr. Daley owed a fiduciary duty to the
plaintiffs, the trial judge went on to find that he had committed
a misappropriation or defalcation in that capacity, as
contemplated by paragraph 178(1)(d) of the BIA.  He accordingly
granted the plaintiffs a declaration that the debt of Mr. Daley
arising from the judgment was not extinguished by his discharge
from bankruptcy.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Respectfully, I am of the opinion that he erred in this
regard.</pre>
    <pre>[20] Section 178 of the BIA, in its entirety, reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          178(1) An order of discharge does not release
          the bankrupt from</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  any fine, penalty, restitution order or
          other order similar in nature to a fine,
          penalty or restitution order, imposed by a
          court in respect of an offence, or any debt
          arising out of a recognizance or bail;</pre>
    <pre>          (b)  any debt or liability for alimony;</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  any debt or liability under a support,
          maintenance or affiliation order or under an
          agreement for maintenance and support of a
          spouse or child living apart from the
          bankrupt;</pre>
    <pre>          (d)  any debt or liability arising out of
          fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation or
          defalcation while acting in a fiduciary
          capacity;</pre>
    <pre>          (e)  any debt or liability for obtaining
          property by false pretences or fraudulent
          misrepresentation; or</pre>
    <pre>          (f)  liability for the dividend that a
          creditor would have been entitled to receive
          on any provable claim not disclosed to the
          trustee, unless the creditor had notice or
          knowledge of the bankruptcy and failed to
          take reasonable action to prove his claim.</pre>
    <pre>          (2)   Subject to subsection (1), an order of
          discharge releases the bankrupt from all
          claims provable in bankruptcy.
</pre>
    <pre>[21] The trial judge addressed both paragraphs (d) and (e).  He
found that there was no evidence of false pretences, that Mr.
Daley had not made any fraudulent misrepresentations, and that he
had committed no fraud.  This left him with the concepts of
&quot;misappropriation&quot; and &quot;defalcation&quot;, as contemplated by
paragraph 178(d), and he concluded that Mr. Daley had fallen
afoul of those provisions.  Specifically, he held that Mr. Daley
had committed a misappropriation and defalcation in a fiduciary
capacity,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  by failing to keep the mortgages in good standing
          so that they could be discharged;</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  by failing to keep title clear of executions so
          that a clear title could be transferred; and,</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  by further encumbering the title by placing a
          third mortgage on the property, without the
          knowledge of the purchasers.
</pre>
    <pre>[22] I have already indicated that, in my view, the foregoing
conduct neither creates a fiduciary duty in relation to a real
estate transaction, nor constitutes a breach of such a duty.
Even accepting the existence of a fiduciary duty on the part of
Mr. Daley, based on the evidence as a whole, I am satisfied, in
the same way, that they do not amount to a &quot;misappropriation or
defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity&quot;, as
contemplated in paragraph 178(1)(d) of the BIA.  In the
circumstances of this case, they do not entail the misapplication
of, or failure to account properly for, property or funds
entrusted to a fiduciary which is the characteristic of conduct
amounting to misappropriation or defalcation.

[23] It is worth observing at this point that not only did the
trial judge negative fraudulent misrepresentation and fraud on
the part of Mr. Daley, and make no finding of bad faith;
importantly, he did not make a finding that the parties had
agreed the funds paid by the Simones were to be used solely for
purposes of reducing the defendant's obligations vis à vis the
subject property.  It was Mr. Daley's position that he was
permitted to use the funds to make payments towards other
obligations.  While Mr. Simone testified at one point that he was
under the assumption the monies were going to be used to pay the
mortgages on 55 Bayside Court, he ultimately conceded in cross-
examination that he didn't care where the money went or what Mr.
Daley did with it, as long as it went towards reducing the
purchase price.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The problems with accumulating arrears on the mortgages to
which the property was subject, and the registration of
executions against the lands, had their origins in Mr. Daley's
inability to cope with his overall financial difficulties arising
from the six or seven bad real estate investments in which he
found himself entangled.  He did not have sufficient revenues
from all sources B including the monies coming from the Simone's
B to defray the costs of carrying those investments.  His
financial world was tumbling down over his head.  Even the
criticized third mortgage in question, as I have previously
noted, was placed on title in order to raise funds to reduce the
outstanding obligations under the first mortgage, and thus did
not have any overall negative affect on the net encumbrances
outstanding against the property.</pre>
    <pre>[25] Not infrequently, bankrupts are at least to some extent the
authors of their own misfortune.  This does not disqualify them
from ultimately obtaining their discharge; nor should it
necessarily turn them into fiduciaries of those with whom they
have dealt.  Suppose that people make reasonable, but ultimately
unwise, attempts to stave off bankruptcy by agreeing to sell
certain of their assets in order to reduce liabilities and free
up funds to carry other remaining assets.  Are those people to be
precluded from obtaining a discharge, after bankruptcy, from
liabilities relating to the failed attempts, because arrears have
continued to accumulate against the properties which are subject
to the sale pending closing, and third party executions are
registered during the same period as a result of other judgments
incurred?  In my opinion, a significant purpose of bankruptcy
legislation might well be jeopardized, if such were to be the
case.</pre>
    <pre>[26] I turn now to a consideration of that purpose and of the
scheme of section 178 of the BIA, and to an examination of the
concepts of &quot;misappropriation&quot; and &quot;defalcation&quot; as found in that
section.

[27] An important purpose of bankruptcy legislation is to
encourage the rehabilitation of an honest but unfortunate debtor,
and to permit his or her re-integration into society B subject to
reasonable conditions B by obtaining a discharge from the
continued burden of crushing financial obligations which cannot
be met: see, Re Newsome (1927), 8 C.B.R. 279 (Ont. S.C.);
Canadian Bankers' Association v. Saskatchewan (Attorney General)
(1955), 35 C.B.R. 135 (S.C.C.); Cleve's Sporting Goods Ltd. v.
J.G. Touchie &amp; Associates Ltd. (1986), 58 C.B.R. (N.S.) 304
(N.S.C.A.);  Ironwood Investments Joint Venture v. Leggett
(Trustee of) (1995), 38 C.B.R. (3d) 256 (Ont. Gen. Div.), at p.
264; and Jerrard v. Peacock (1985), 57 C.B.R. (N.S.) 54 (Alta.
Q.B., Master).</pre>
    <pre>[28] Debts which survive a bankruptcy as a result of the
provisions of subsection 178(1), therefore, are exceptions to
this overriding principle, and should be addressed accordingly.</pre>
    <pre>[29] An analysis of the provisions of subsection 178(1) shows
that the types of debt which survive a bankruptcy may be divided
into four overall categories, namely,</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  those which have been imposed by a court in the form of
     a fine or some other penalty for an offence against the
     state (paragraph (a));</pre>
    <pre>     (2)  those which reflect the legislative policy decision to
     protect spouses and children requiring support (paragraphs
     (b) and (c));</pre>
    <pre>     (3)  those arising out of acts of fraud, dishonesty, or
     misconduct while acting in a fiduciary capacity (paragraphs
     (d) and (e)); and finally,</pre>
    <pre>     (4)  those which, if discharged, would undermine the
     integrity of the bankruptcy process itself (paragraph (f)).
</pre>
    <pre>[30] In Jerrard v. Peacock, supra,  Master Funduk B an
experienced official in matters of this nature B subjected
section 178 to the following analysis, which in my opinion is an
accurate one.  At pp. 62-63 he said:</pre>
    <pre>               Considering the new start object
          ingrained in the Act, the logical
          interpretation of the two subsections in
          question is that subs. (2) creates the
          general principle (being a release of all
          debts) with subs. (1) being an exception to
          the general principle.  Subsection (2) [sic]2
          establishes exceptions, not the principle,
          and must be viewed in that light.</pre>
    <pre>               It is as if the section literally reads
          that the order of discharge releases the
          bankrupt from all claims provable in
          bankruptcy &quot;except the following&quot; and then
          lists the seven (now six) categories in subs.
          (1).</pre>
    <pre>                             . . .</pre>
    <pre>               All of the exceptions in the section are
          based on what might be classed as an
          overriding social policy.  In other words,
          they are the kinds of claims which society
          (through the legislators) considers to be of
          a quality which outweighs any possible
          benefit to society in the bankrupt being
          released of these obligations.</pre>
    <pre>               Paragraph (a) is essentially an
          administration of justice concept.  The
          liabilities caught by it will be in relation
          to criminal or quasi-criminal matters.</pre>
    <pre>               Paragraphs (b) and (c), regardless of
          the language used, are nothing other than
          society's vested interest in ensuring that a
          person &quot;supports&quot; a dependent spouse and
          children.  Obligations incurred for that
          cannot be shucked by the bankruptcy.</pre>
    <pre>               Paragraphs (d) and (e) are morality
          concepts which look at conduct.  Those kinds
          of conduct are unacceptable to society and a
          bankrupt will not be rewarded for such
          conduct by a release of liability.
</pre>
    <pre>[31] Others have taken a different approach to paragraphs (d) and
(e), however.  In Smith v. Henderson (1992), 10 C.B.R. (3d) 153,
the British Columbia Court of Appeal held that a &quot;defalcation
while acting in a fiduciary capacity&quot;, as envisaged by paragraph
178(1)(d), did not necessarily involve dishonesty and that, in
the case of a fiduciary, a simple failure to meet an obligation
was sufficient.  Herold D.C.J. (as he then was) adopted a similar
view with regard to a &quot;misappropriation&quot; in Abstainer's Insurance
Company v. Pellegrino (1989), 77 C.B.R. (N.S.) 108 (Ont. D.C.).</pre>
    <pre>[32] Smith v. Henderson involved a judgment against Mr. Smith,
the principal of a small trucking operation, Normax Transport
Inc.  Mr. Smith was an officer and director, and the operating
mind of the company.  Normax had contracted with another trucker,
Mr. Henderson, to permit him to work off the purchase of a truck
and trailer through the payment of $1500 per month over 48
months.  Normax was itself purchasing the truck under a
conditional sales contract.  After 34 2 months and the payment of
$43,128 by Mr. Henderson, however, the truck was repossessed by
the conditional vendor because the company had not kept up
payments or paid off liens which had accumulated against the
vehicles for non-payment for repairs.  At trial, Smith was found
to be personally liable on the ground that, as the sole directing
mind of the corporation, he had caused Normax to be in breach of
trust by allowing the liens to accumulate and not making the
payments, and accordingly he was equally liable for breach of
trust.  Smith ultimately went bankrupt.  He was granted a
discharge from bankruptcy, but the judge granting the discharge
held that it did not release him from the liability under the
judgment because it was caught by paragraph 178(1)(d) of the
Bankruptcy Act.  That decision was upheld on appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[33] In Abstainer's Insurance Company v. Pellegrino (1989), 77
C.B.R. (N.S.) 108 (Ont. D.C.), the defendant, Pellegrino, had
obtained judgment against Abstainer's for the recovery of
accident benefits and for damages for mental distress, in an
earlier action.  The insurer had appealed, but had agreed to pay
certain monies to the defendant in order to reduce the risk of
post-judgment interest. The payment pending appeal, however, was
subject to a negotiated condition that the defendant would repay
the monies if the insurer were successful on an appeal.
Abstainer's succeeded on the appeal.  Nonetheless, the defendant
refused to repay the monies.  He had gone bankrupt in the interim
and argued, amongst other things, that the debt had been
extinguished by his bankruptcy.  In response to this argument,
Abstainer's relied upon paragraph 178(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy
Act.  Herold D.C.J. agreed with the insurer, concluding that the
defendant's failure to repay the monies constituted a
&quot;misappropriation&quot; of funds by a fiduciary in the circumstances.
He held that the defendant had accepted the monies on the premise
that he would have an obligation to account for them in the event
the insurer was successful on the appeal, that he was acting on
behalf of the insurer to the extent of an accounting, and that he
had misused the position of trust which was created by his
implied undertaking.  At p. 111, Herold D.C.J. noted:</pre>
    <pre>               The word &quot;misappropriate&quot; in the
          Bankruptcy Act is not, as I read the cases,
          used in any pejorative or accusatory sense;
          rather, it may simply be the failure of a
          person to account when he is called upon to
          do so, particularly where, as here, he is in
          possession of the necessary funds to do so
          and chooses for reasons which he believes are
          valid not to do so.
</pre>
    <pre>[34] Jennings J. followed Smith v. Henderson and Abstainer's
Insurance.</pre>
    <pre>[35] Mr. Justice Day, on the other hand, declined to follow the
reasoning of Abstainer's Insurance in Ironwood Investments Joint
Venture v. Leggett, supra.  He does not appear to have been
referred to Smith v. Henderson.  Before Day J., the issue
revolved around a disputed management fee which the promoter and
manager of a joint venture, Mr. Leggett, had caused the joint
venture to pay to him.  The project failed and Mr. Leggett
subsequently went bankrupt and was later discharged.  The unit
holders sought to recover the monies against him nonetheless, on
the grounds that he had obtained the monies through fraud,
embezzlement, misappropriation or defalcation while acting in a
fiduciary capacity.  Day J. immediately ruled out fraud or
embezzlement on the part of Mr. Leggett.  He was then faced with
deciding whether or not the monies had been obtained as a result
of misappropriation or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary
capacity.  Day J. concluded that the defendant had not
deliberately misappropriated the funds, believing that he was
entitled to them and that the fee had been disclosed to the unit
holders, notwithstanding that under the strict terms of the
agreement he had not properly formalized authorization for the
payment.  With regard to the interpretation of paragraph
178(1)(d) of the BIA, Day J stated (p. 264):</pre>
    <pre>               In any event, the subsection read as a
          whole includes fraud and embezzlement, both
          of which are quasi-criminal in nature, along
          with misappropriation and defalcation.  In my
          opinion if a debt is to survive bankruptcy
          pursuant to s. 178(1)(d) of the Bankruptcy
          and Insolvency Act, there must have been some
          wrongful conduct on the part of the debtor
          sufficient to exclude the debtor from the
          relief granted by the Act.  One of the prime
          purposes of the Bankruptcy Act is to permit
          an honest but unfortunate debtor to obtain a
          discharge from his debts subject to
          reasonable conditions.  The Act is designed
          to permit a bankrupt to eventually receive a
          complete discharge so that he can integrate
          himself into the business life of the country
          as a useful citizen, free from the crushing
          burden of his debts: Re Newsome (1927), 8
          C.B.R. 279 (Ont. S.C.); Canadian Bankers'
          Association v. Saskatchewan (Attorney
          General) (1955), 35 C.B.R. 135 (S.C.C.).
          Given that a bankrupt may be saved from the
          consequence of his negligence and
          incompetence, as was the case in Urbanowski
          v. Demkiw (1992), 12 C.B.R. (3d) 129 (Man.
          C.A.), it is preposterous that a discharged
          bankrupt might remain accountable for monies
          paid to himself as compensation, when in all
          the circumstances he had very good reason to
          believe he was acting properly and with the
          knowledge of the affected parties, with
          neither their objection nor challenge.
          Accordingly, I adopt the approach taken in
          Janco (Huppe), supra,3 that misappropriation
          is the act of misappropriating or turning to
          a wrong purpose.[Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[36] Thus, there appear to be two approaches which have been
taken to the interpretation of the words &quot;misappropriation or
defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity&quot;.  On the one
hand, the approach reflected in Ironwood Investments Joint
Venture v. Leggett and in Jerrard v. Peacock views the words in
the context of those with which they are associated in the
paragraph and attributes to them some element of dishonesty,
wrongdoing, or misconduct.  On the other hand, decisions such as
that of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in Smith v.
Henderson suggest a broader interpretation which eschews the need
for dishonesty, wrongdoing or misconduct, and is prepared to
extend the exception to all cases in which a fiduciary is in
breach of any fiduciary obligation.

[37] In my view, the former approach is the correct one, having
regard to the purposes of bankruptcy legislation and to the
language used in section 178, and keeping in mind as well that
not all breaches of obligation by a fiduciary are breaches of a
fiduciary obligation.  They may simply be inadvertence,
negligence or incompetence.  In this latter regard, the remarks
of Sopinka J. and McLachlin J. in Hodgkinson v. Simms, supra,
concerning what they viewed as the second &quot;false indicator&quot; of a
fiduciary obligation, are worth noting.  At p. 463 they observed:</pre>
    <pre>               The second consideration which may act
          as a false indicator of a fiduciary
          obligation is the &quot;category&quot; into which the
          relationship falls.  Professional
          relationships like doctor-patient and lawyer-
          client often possess fiduciary aspects.  But
          equally, many of the tasks undertaken
          pursuant to these relationships may not be
          trust-like or attract a fiduciary obligation.
          (citation omitted)</pre>
    <pre>               Just as not every act in a so-called
               fiduciary relationship is encumbered with a
          fiduciary obligation, so conversely fiduciary
          obligations may arise in relationships which
          have not been traditionally considered as
          fiduciary. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[38] I agree with the observation of Day J., cited above, that if
bankrupts are normally saved from the consequences of their
negligence or incompetence by a discharge, it makes no sense that
they should remain accountable for similar conduct simply because
the conduct is carried out by someone who may now be classified
as falling within a certain category of relationship, namely that
of fiduciary.  The courts have resisted a rigid approach to the
determination of what constitutes a fiduciary relationship, as
previously noted, emphasizing that it is &quot;the nature of the
relationship and not the category of actors involved&quot; which is
important for purposes of that exercise.  In this same spirit, it
seems to me, the courts should avoid attempting to sweep into
concepts such as &quot;misappropriation&quot; or &quot;defalcation&quot; B which in
their ordinary meanings connote some element of wrong doing,
improper conduct, or improper accounting B any and all failures
by the fiduciary to comply with the obligations attending upon
that capacity.  When it comes to the application of insolvency
legislation, the results of not resisting that temptation can be
far reaching and inconsistent with the purposes of such
legislation.</pre>
    <pre>[39] The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines the words
&quot;misappropriate&quot;, &quot;defalcate&quot;, and &quot;defalcation&quot; as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          Misappropriate</pre>
    <pre>          To appropriate to wrong uses; chiefly, to
          apply dishonestly to one's own use. So,
          misappropriation.</pre>
    <pre>          Defalcate</pre>
    <pre>          To cut or lop off (a portion from the whole);
          to retrench, deduct; to curtail, reduce; to
          commit defalcations; to misappropriate
          property in one's charge.</pre>
    <pre>          Defalcation</pre>
    <pre>          To reduce by deductions; to lop off; to
          abate; defection; shortcoming; failure; a
          fraudulent deficiency in money matters; also,
          the amount misappropriated.
</pre>
    <pre>[40] Black's Law Dictionary, 6th ed., defines &quot;misappropriation&quot;
as &quot;the unauthorized, improper, or unlawful use of funds or other
property for purpose other than that for which intended&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[41] In Smith v. Henderson, Legg J.A. cited the definition of
&quot;defalcation&quot; from Black's Law Dictionary 5th ed., in the
following fashion (supra, p. 158):</pre>
    <pre>          Defalcation: The act of a defaulter . . .
          failure to meet an obligation . . .
</pre>
    <pre>[42] Respectfully, this citation omits important aspects of the
full definition, and takes the phrase &quot;failure to meet an
obligation&quot; out of context.  The full definition in the 5th
edition of Black's Law Dictionary reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          Defalcation</pre>
    <pre>          The act of a defaulter; act of embezzling;
          failure to meet an obligation;
          misappropriation of trust funds or money held
          in any fiduciary capacity; failure to
          properly account for such funds.  Commonly
          spoken of officers of corporations or public
          officials.4
</pre>
    <pre>[43] Looked at in its entirety, then, the Black's definition
demonstrates that the reference to a failure to meet an
obligation must be read in the context of the references to
&quot;embezzling&quot;, to &quot;misappropriation of trust funds&quot; and to a
&quot;failure to properly account&quot;.   Moreover, an examination of the
American authorities on which the inclusion by Black's of
&quot;failure to meet an obligation&quot; within the concept of defalcation
for purposes of bankruptcy legislation, confirms that they can be
explained in these terms, notwithstanding that they may appear on
the surface to stand for the proposition that an innocent default
in duty on the part of a fiduciary will suffice to create a debt
that survives bankruptcy.</pre>
    <pre>[44] Re Anderson (1986), 64 B.R. 331, a decision of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Illinois, Western
Division, is an example.  In that case the court ruled that a
creditor need not show wrongdoing on the part of a fiduciary
debtor for the purposes of establishing a nondischargeable debt
under section 523(a)(4) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.
&quot;Defalcation&quot;, for such purposes, was held to encompass a debt
resulting from fraud or defalcation by a debtor while acting in a
fiduciary capacity, a failure to meet an obligation,
misappropriation of trust funds or money held in any fiduciary
capacity, and a failure to properly account for such funds.  Mr.
Anderson, the bankrupt debtor, had undertaken to act as the
treasurer for a non-profit corporation which was established to
set up a bicycle racing track for community children, and which
earned revenues through entry fees and concessions.  He failed to
account for the revenues he had received.  There was no evidence
of wrongdoing.  During a period of ill health and family
difficulties, he had failed to deposit the proceeds from three
races in a timely fashion.  Instead he kept the monies in a paper
back in his desk at home.  The monies were stolen from his home,
apparently by someone else.  Mr. Anderson agreed to repay the
funds, and signed a promissory note to that effect, but
eventually went bankrupt.  The court held his debt survived his
discharge from bankruptcy, concluding that his failure to deposit
the monies that had been entrusted to him by the corporation in a
timely fashion amounted to a failure to account properly, and
constituted a breach rising to the level of a defalcation.</pre>
    <pre>[45] In Re Anderson the court relied upon a decision of Justice
Learned Hand in Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Herbst, 93 F.
2d 510 (2nd Cir. 1937).  It attributed to Learned Hand J. the
proposition that, in the context of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code,
Adefalcation&quot; did not contemplate fraud or dishonesty, but
rather, because of the special trust given to a fiduciary, the
word included innocent defaults in duty on the part of the
fiduciary.  An examination of Learned Hand J's decision shows,
however, that the learned justice did not stop there.</pre>
    <pre>[46] In Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Herbst a privately
appointed receiver in a foreclosure action had withdrawn and
spent for his own account monies which had been awarded to him on
an interim passing of accounts when he knew that the time for
appeal had not elapsed and without consulting with the plaintiff
in the foreclosure action as to whether it intended to appeal.
The plaintiff successfully appealed and obtained judgment against
the receiver, who subsequently went bankrupt and obtained a stay
of execution.  The stay was vacated, and it was the appeal from
the order vacating the stay which came before the Second Circuit.
That Court held that when a fiduciary takes money upon a
conditional authority which may be revoked and knows at the time
that it may be, the fiduciary is guilty of a &quot;defalcation&quot; though
it may not be a &quot;fraud&quot; or an &quot;embezzlement&quot; or perhaps not even
a &quot;misappropriation&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[47] The Court did not rule, however, that any innocent default
on the part of a fiduciary gives rise to a debt which is not
discharged by bankruptcy.  It pointed out (p. 512) that the
bankrupt &quot;had not been entirely innocent . . . though possibly
one may acquit him of deliberate wrongdoing.&quot;  Learned Hand J.
noted that in its origins a bankruptcy discharge &quot;relieved
bankrupts of all their debts without exception, provided they
conducted themselves properly&quot; (p. 511).  His reference to
&quot;innocent defaults&quot; was as follows (p. 511):</pre>
    <pre>          . . . Colloquially perhaps the word,
          &quot;defalcation,&quot; ordinarily implies some moral
          dereliction, but in this context it may have
          included innocent defaults, so as to include
          all fiduciaries who for any reason were short
          in their accounts. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[48] Finally, and significantly, Learned Hand J. concluded (p.
512):</pre>
    <pre>          . . . We do not hold that no possible
          deficiency in a fiduciary's accounts is
          dischargeable; in Re Bernard, 87 F. 2d 705,
          707, we said that &quot;the misappropriation must
          be due to a known breach of the duty, and not
          to mere negligence or mistake.&quot;  Although
          that word probably carries a larger
          implication of misconduct than &quot;defalcation,&quot;
          &quot;defalcation&quot; may demand some portion of
          misconduct; we will assume arguendo that it
          does. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[49] See also:  Re Gagliano, 44 B.R. 259 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1984),
where an insurance agent who had failed to remit collected
premiums to the insurance company had committed a defalcation;
and Re Alvey, 56 B.R. 170 (Bankr. W.D. Kentucky, 1985), which
involved the unauthorized use of cash collateral received by a
debtor in possession under Chapter 11 proceedings without
reporting to the court as required.</pre>
    <pre>[50] Thus, it would appear that the American authorities which
have held that a failure by a fiduciary to meet an obligation
gives rise to a debt which is not discharged from bankruptcy, and
which have given rise to the reference to such an event in the
definition of &quot;defalcation&quot; in Black's Law Dictionary, are all
cases where there has been &quot;some portion of misconduct&quot; in the
sense, at least, of a failure by the fiduciary to account
properly for funds entrusted to the fiduciaries possession and
care.</pre>
    <pre>[51] There is a qualitative difference in the nature of the
breaches involved in the American authorities referred to above,
and in the Canadian authorities which have extended the meaning
of &quot;defalcation&quot; or &quot;misappropriation&quot; to innocent breaches, on
the one hand, and the type of breach committed by Mr. Daley in
the circumstances of this case, on the other hand.  Those cases
in which it has been held that an innocent default in duty or a
failure to meet an obligation on the part of a fiduciary create a
debt which survives a bankruptcy all involve at least a failure
to account in a proper fashion for monies or entrusted to the
fiduciary.  That is not the case with Mr. Daley, whose breach was
not a failure to account for monies paid to him by the Simones,
but rather a failure to close the real estate transaction in his
capacity as vendor.</pre>
    <pre>[52] Consequently, I am not persuaded that the exception to a
release of liability upon a bankruptcy discharge which is
provided for in paragraph 178(1)(d) of the BIA should be extended
to conduct which does not display at least some element of
wrongdoing or improper conduct on the part of the fiduciary in
question in the sense of a failure to account properly for monies
or property entrusted to the fiduciary in that capacity or
inappropriate dealing with such trust property.  Had Parliament
intended that any innocent breach of an obligation on the part of
fiduciary would give rise to a debt that would not be released by
a discharge from bankruptcy it could very easily have said so, by
providing that an order of discharge does not release the
bankrupt from any debt or liability arising from a breach of
fiduciary obligation.  It did not do so.  It chose to couch the
types of debts or liabilities &quot;while acting in a fiduciary
capacity&quot; which would attract the exceptions of subsection
178(1), in the context of debts or liabilities arising from
fraud, embezzlement or misappropriation, as well as defalcation.
While these notions may have slightly different shades or
gradations of meaning, I can only conclude that Parliament
intended the words &quot;misappropriation&quot; and &quot;defalcation&quot; to bear
their plain and ordinary meaning, as the context in which they
are used suggests.</pre>
    <pre>[53] Here, there was no finding of bad faith with respect to the
conduct of Mr. Daley.  The trial judge expressly found that there
was neither fraud nor fraudulent misrepresentation on his part.
Had there been a finding that Mr. Daley had agreed to use the
funds paid by the Simones solely for purposes of paying down the
mortgages and indebtedness against 55 Bayside Court, and that he
had failed to do so, the results might arguably be different.  In
such a case, a finding that there had been a misappropriation or
a defalcation would have been justified. There was no such
finding, however.</pre>
    <pre>[54] In my view, the declaration that the judgment against Mr.
Daley survives his discharge from bankruptcy cannot be sustained.
</pre>
    <pre>     Damages</pre>
    <pre>[55] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in
including in his assessment of damages the value of improvements
made to the property by the respondents.  They argue that the
appellants received no benefit from the improvements, although
the plaintiffs have, and that the plaintiffs assumed the risk of
any improvements they made when they made them without title
having yet been transferred.  The appellants accordingly seek to
have the damages assessed by the trial judge reduced by the sum
of $40,000 which was allowed for improvements.  They also seek a
further reduction of $45,000 in the damages awarded on the basis
that this later amount was paid by the Simones after they knew
that the transaction had not closed in January 1993.  These two
deductions would have the effect of wiping out the damage award
altogether.</pre>
    <pre>[56] There is no merit in the latter claim.  Mr. Daley and Ms.
Montanari gladly accepted the $45,000 from the Simones during the
period in question, after they knew that the transaction had not
closed in January 1993.  It hardly lies in their mouths now to
say that the plaintiffs should not have paid the monies,
particularly when approximately $32,000 of it went to pay down
obligations on the first mortgage.  All parties were operating on
the hope, during this period of time, that the agreement would
ultimately be completed.  In my view the trial judge was quite
correct in including those sums paid in the losses sustained by
the plaintiffs.</pre>
    <pre>[57] The issue of recovery for the improvements made by the
plaintiffs stands on a different footing, however.  There was no
express approval on the part of the defendants for the
improvements that were made, although it could be said that they
were aware of them and acquiesced in what was being done.
Neither Mr. Daley nor Ms. Montanari (except indirectly) received
any benefit from any of the improvements.  With the exception of
the paving done to the driveway, which may have been necessary to
meet subdivision requirement, the improvements seem to have been
made by the Simone's without asking for permission on the premise
-- as Mr. Simone testified -- that he &quot;didn't think he needed to
ask Daley's consent to do any work because it was my house&quot;,  and
to convenience them in their new home.  It could be said that Ms.
Montanari received at least some indirect benefit from the paving
because her father had posted a letter of credit on behalf of the
defendants in the amount of approximately $10,000 regarding the
completion of the pavement.  The other improvements consisted of
such things as interior painting and decorating, including the
installation custom light switches, expensive french doors
between rooms, window screens, locks, and an alarm system.  The
Simones continue to enjoy the benefits of these improvements to
this day, abeit as tenants rather than owners.  As far as the
interior improvements are concerned, they could in fact be said
to be very much in the nature of tenants improvements.

[58] The trial judge did not provide any rationale for including
the cost of the improvements in the recovery he awarded, other
than to say that they formed part of the plaintiffs &quot;investment'
in the house.  The respondents argue that they are entitled to
such recovery on the basis of equitable compensation for breach
of fiduciary duty.  Except for the outside paving and related
work B which could be said to be more &quot;real property&quot; related,
and where at least an indirect benefit was enjoyed by the
defendants as a result of the release of Mr. Montanari's letter
of credit B I do not agree.  The plaintiffs simply proceeded to
decorate the premises to their liking, and they took the risk of
losing these expenditures on improvements if the transaction, for
whatever reason, failed to close: see Peter D. Maddaugh and John
D. McCamus, The Law of Restitution, (Aurora: Canada Law Book),
pp. 288-291.</pre>
    <pre>[59] I would reduce the amount credited to the plaintiffs for
their investment in the property by the sum of $15,000.00,
representing the amount which the trial judge allowed for the
interior decorating and finishing matters.  I would not alter the
trial judge's decision to permit the $25,000.00 which was
expended on the outdoor paving, curbing and drainage work.</pre>
    <pre>     Cross-Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[60] On the cross-appeal, the plaintiff respondents attack,</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  the trial judge's finding that they were responsible
          for paying municipal taxes pending closing;</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  the reduction of their recovery by an amount
          representing the sum of $1,800 per month for occupation
          rent, both in terms of its quantum and in terms of the
          period of time for which it was applied; and,</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  the award of pre-judgment interest only from January 1,
          1995, and only on the sum of $55,320.00 when the
          payments by the plaintiffs were made in 1992 and 1993.
</pre>
    <pre>     </pre>
    <pre>Municipal Taxes</pre>
    <pre>[61] The question whether it was the plaintiffs or the defendants
who were to be responsible for the payment of municipal taxes
under the terms of the agreement was one of fact.  There was
ample evidence upon which the finding of the trial judge in this
regard could be based and it should not be interfered with.</pre>
    <pre>     Occupation Rent</pre>
    <pre>[62] The trial judge was justified in the circumstances in
finding the plaintiffs responsible for the payment of occupation
rent.  It is not correct to say, as the cross-appellants submit,
that there was no evidence regarding what a reasonable rent would
be.  After the house was sold, in March 1995, the Simones have
continued to live in it, as tenants to owners who are relatives,
and they paid a monthly rental of $1,400.  The amount they were
to pay per month under the agreement with Mr. Daley pending
closing was between $1,000 and $2,000.  Moreover, Ms. Montanari B
who had at least some experience in real estate matters as a
legal clerk, and whose evidence the trial judge accepted in other
respects B testified that in her view $2,500 per month was a
reasonable rental for the premises.  The trial judge made a
finding in this regard, on the evidence he had, and I would not
interfere with it.</pre>
    <pre>[63] As to the length of &quot;rent-free use of the property&quot;, the
trial judge found on the evidence that the period ended at the
end of 1994.  It was shortly thereafter that the property was
sold under power of sale and the new owners obtained title.  The
finding is not unsupported by the evidence, and should stand.</pre>
    <pre>     Pre-judgment Interest</pre>
    <pre>[64] For the same reason, I would not interfere with the trial
judge's determination of the timing of pre-judgment interest, or
the amount on which it is to be paid.   The amount of the
judgment is an amalgam of the payments made by the plaintiffs
over the period 1992 - 93, and the deductions for taxes and
occupancy rent extending throughout 1994.  The trial judge
obviously considered that matters were finally terminated at the
end of 1994, as between the parties, and he allowed pre-judgment
interest from that point on.</pre>
    <pre>[65] The court has a discretion under subsection 130(1) of the
Courts of Justice Act R.S.O., c. C.43, to award pre-judgement
interest for a period other than that provided for in section 128
of that Act.  I would not interfere with the exercise of that
discretion in the circumstances of this case.
</pre>
    <pre>     Motion for Leave to Introduce Fresh Evidence on Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[66] The appellants sought leave to introduce fresh evidence on
the appeal to this Court.  The evidence sought to be introduced
related to an update of the plaintiffs' legal interest in and
occupation of 55 Bayside Court since the date of the trial.  It
was said to relate to the issue of the plaintiffs' right to
recover the cost of improvements.</pre>
    <pre>[67] In my view the proposed evidence would not be dispositive of
the appeal, or even particularly helpful in its determination, to
the extent that it adds anything to what was conceded by the
plaintiffs, namely, that they continue to live in the premises
and that the premises are owned by relatives.  I would dismiss
the motion with costs.
</pre>
    <pre>                       III - DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[68] In the end, then, I would allow the appeal to the extent of
setting aside the declaration that the judgment as against Mr.
Daley is not extinguished by his discharge from bankruptcy, and
to the extent of reducing the principal amount of the recovery
awarded by $15,000, from the sum of $55,320.00 to $40,320.00.
The appeal is otherwise dismissed.  As success was divided, I
would not award any costs of the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[69] The cross-appeal is dismissed.  Again, in the circumstances,
I would not award any costs of the cross-appeal.
