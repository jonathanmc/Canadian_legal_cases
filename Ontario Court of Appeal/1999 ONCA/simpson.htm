    <pre>APPEAL FROM:   Hockin J. dated July 4, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

[1]  In January 1991, the government of Ontario implemented a new
evaluation and compensation regime for 1400 senior managers
within the civil service, which was based on pay for performance.
After giving the first salary increases for the 1991 year, in
October of that year the Chair of Management Board of Cabinet
announced in the legislature that there would be a salary freeze
for MPP&#146;s and other senior government employees including the
senior managers in the new Plan for 1992 at 1991 levels.
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellants appeal from the decision of Hockin J. after
trial, wherein he held that the government of Ontario was not
contractually bound to pay an annual salary increase to members
of the Senior Management Group of civil servants in the years
1992 through 1997. The appeal now only relates to the 1992 year.
We agree with the result reached by the trial judge.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The trial judge described the history of the implementation
of the Compensation Plan: Senior Management Group, which
streamlined the evaluation and compensation process for 650
executive positions and 1400 senior management positions within
the civil service, beginning in 1988 for the executives and
bringing in the senior managers in 1991 through an order-in-
council of January 31, 1991. The plan focused on a scheme of pay
for performance, based on a complex structure of performance
goals and levels of achievement to be set and agreed for each
manager and to be evaluated on an annual basis. The concept of
the scheme was that managers would receive an increase for the
following year, depending on their level of performance in the
previous year and based on a pay grid which contained percentage
increases, including 0% for unsatisfactory performance, which
grid was to be published every year. The 1991 grid is contained
within the order-in-council.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Each of the managers entered the plan at one of the new
salary ranges, which in some cases involved an increase from
their December 31, 1990 salary level. Then all members of the new
Plan also received a performance rating by July 1991, to which
the 1991 grid was applied to fix their salaries retroactive to
January 1, 1991. For example, Mr. Simpson, the nominal plaintiff
for the class, received his 7% increase in accordance with his
performance rating for 1991 upon application of the 1991 grid.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  It was conceded and found by the trial judge that the
intention of the government and the understanding of all parties
in developing and implementing this elaborate restructuring and
streamlining of the senior civil service performance and pay
structure was that employees who performed up to expectations in
a year would receive a salary increase for the following year.
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  However, the issue before the court was whether it was a
term of the contract of employment of each member of the plan
that there would always be an increase.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The contract of employment was not one signed document
between the government and the employee containing all of the
terms of employment. Instead there was a series of communications
with the group, a signed performance agreement with each employee
for the 1991 year setting out the performance goals for that
year, and a 34 page manual which set out the details of the plan.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Although the format of the manual is somewhat cryptic, it
describes the process of pay for performance and includes within
it the 1991 pay grid. It contains no grid for future years. It
also contains the following language under the heading &#147;Salary
Increases&#148;:</pre>
    <pre>     Treasury Board/Management Board approves:
         Annual funding for SMG salary ranges
     Human Resources Secretariat gains approval for:
         Annual salary range adjustments
         Annual performance grid
     Deputy Ministers authorize:
         Performance ratings
         Individual annual performance increases
     
</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The SMG members also received a memorandum of March 4, 1991
from the Secretary of Cabinet which said that &#147;all employees&#146;
salary increases will be implemented through a performance grid
approved by Cabinet&#148;.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial judge accepted the evidence of the government
representative that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;the  pay  cycle  of the  SMG  Plan  and  its
          predecessor, the ECP Plan were in  lock  step
          with  the  fiscal  cycle of government.   The
          creation    of   the   pay   grid    was    a
          contemporaneous act with the  preparation  of
          the budget. The essence of  budget making  is
          the  taking into account of current  economic
          and   political  factors  and  these  factors
          applied  equally  and coincidentally  to  the
          issue of salary increases.  The question  for
          government,  in simple terms,  was  what,  if
          any,    salary   increase   can   we   afford
          politically and economically this year.  Such
          a  decision  was  a  decision  made  for  the
          upcoming fiscal year; there was nothing about
          the exercise which required the government to
          predict  what it could afford a  year  later.
          Moreover, those members of the SMG  who  were
          once  members of the ECP Plan knew  that  the
          pay grid which triggered increases was always
          struck  annually and following the completion
          of  the  performance cycle.  Striking  a  pay
          grid far in advance of its implementation did
          not accord with the well known fiscal routine
          of government.</pre>
    <pre>There was also evidence from Mr. Simpson who was one of the SMG
members who had not been a member of the ECP Plan and who had the
responsibility of preparing an annual budget for his correctional
institution, that he was familiar with the process whereby
cabinet would set the budget and that all expenditures for an
upcoming year were subject to that process.
</pre>
    <pre>[11] Therefore the wording of the memorandum and of the manual
that treasury board/management board approves annual funding for
the salary raises was consistent with the process used by the
government to set its annual budget.
</pre>
    <pre>[12] The trial judge found that in the budget process, by early
in a new year the Cabinet decided whether or not to approve a
salary increase, the decision was announced in March and the
increase was paid through a new pay grid. He concluded, based on
the wording of the documents together with the oral evidence,
that the references to a salary increase in the plan constituted
a conditional promise to pay, conditional on the approval of an
increase by Cabinet each year as part of the budget process.
</pre>
    <pre>[13] In our view this conclusion is a reasonable one. It is
further supported by the fact that only the 1991 grid had been
established and set out in the manual. Any increase to be awarded
in future years would await the promulgation of the future grids,
the contents of which were completely within the discretion of
the government. The appellants submitted both at trial and on
appeal that the 1991 grid was intended to apply to 1992 raises as
well, and that when implementing this plan beginning in 1991, the
government had already funded it for 1992. We agree with the
trial judge that this interpretation is not supported by the
documents or the evidence of government process in setting annual
budgets which are based on the circumstances pertaining at the
relevant time in each year and are applied prospectively to the
next fiscal year.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Because there was no unconditional promise by the government
within the plan to pay an increase for performance in all future
years after 1991, the plaintiffs have not established a breach of
contract entitling them to damages based on the wage freeze for
1992 and following years.</pre>
    <pre>[15] In light of our conclusion on this issue, which was the main
issue on the appeal, it is unnecessary to comment on the issue of
the authority of Management Board (as opposed to the Lieutenant
Governor in Council) to enact the freeze.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</pre>
