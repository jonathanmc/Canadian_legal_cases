    <pre>McKINLAY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by the appellant, Antonio Mascioli, from a
judgment  of  the  Honourable  Mr.  Justice  Hermiston,  granting
damages to the respondents, Bruch Hon Sin, Jenny So Chun Sin  and
Patricia  Henry, for loss of contents of a building  occupied  by
the  plaintiff  which was destroyed by fire. The insurer  of  the
respondents cross-appeals, claiming subrogated rights  respecting
damage to the realty which were denied by the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The appellant, Antonio Mascioli, and his wife purchased the
property  involved in 1973 or 1974. At that time it  contained  a
restaurant,  a garage with a gas station, a living area,  a  gift
shop,  a  candle  store  and  four apartments.  They  rented  the
property  to  others for two years, but from November  1975  they
took  possession  and operated the businesses  themselves.  While
carrying  on  the  businesses,  they  began  renovations  to  the
buildings,  and continued with those renovations  until  June  of
1988,  when  they sold the property, including contents,  to  the
respondents,  Bruce Hon Sin and Jenny So Chun Sin, for  $600,000.
They took back a mortgage for $400,000 of the purchase price.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   At the time of the purchase the Sins took over the existing
fire  insurance  policy  of  the  Masciolis,  which  insured  the
building for fire loss in the amount of $275,000 and the contents
in  the  amount of $30,000. It was a term of the vendor take-back
mortgage  that  the  buildings continue to  be  insured  with  an
insurer approved by the mortgagee.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In November of 1988 the Sins replaced the insurance with  an
insurer  not  approved by the Masciolis. One policy  covered  the
building  for  a reduced amount of $250,000, with  the  Masciolis
named  as loss payees, and the other covered the contents for  an
increased  amount  of  $80,000. The insured  under  the  contents
policy was &quot;Sun Valley Restaurant operated by Kam Hoi Chau&quot;,  and
neither the Masciolis nor the Sins were named as loss payees.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   On  November 5, 1988 the Sins leased the businesses to  Kam
Hoi Chau and Kenneth Ka Wah Wong.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   From  the time of the sale to the Sins to the time  of  the
fire  on  February  13,  1989  no  contents  were  added  in  the
restaurant to those sold as part of the original agreement,  with
the  exception of approximately $3,000 in stock belonging to Chau
and Wong, for which the Sins reimbursed them. There were contents
on the premises owned by tenants of the apartments.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   On  the  morning of the fire, Mr. Chau lit a  fire  in  the
fireplace,  using gasoline as an incendiary. Sometime between  10
and  ll  a.m.  Francis  Kay, a tenant  in  one  of  the  upstairs
apartments, noticed that there was a fire in the building.</pre>
    <pre>[8]   One  of the renovations carried out by Mr. Mascioli  before
the  sale  of  the  property to the Sins was the  building  of  a
fireplace  in the restaurant portion of the building.  The  trial
judge  found  that  the  fire was caused by  a  faulty  fireplace
chimney. The issues in this case centre around that finding.</pre>
    <pre>TRIAL DECISION</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  Sins are merely nominal plaintiffs in this case.  They
were  paid by the insurer in satisfaction of the claims filed  by
them after the fire. Mr. Mascioli defended on the basis that  the
Sins  had  been  compensated fully for their loss.  Although  the
insurers were never joined in the action, the trial proceeded and
was  decided  on  the basis that it was the insurer's  subrogated
claims which were in issue.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The issues on appeal are:</pre>
    <pre>     (i)  Was there evidence to support the trial judge's finding
          that  the  cause of the fire was a defective  fireplace
          chimney?</pre>
    <pre>     (ii) Did  the  trial judge err in finding that Mr.  Mascioli
          was   liable  for  the  negligence  of  an  independent
          contractor hired by him to build the fireplace?</pre>
    <pre>     (iii)      Is  the quantum of liability of Mr. Mascioli  (if
          any)  equal to the amount paid out by the insurers  for
          contents  without adequate proof of quantum of  damages
          before the court in this action?
</pre>
    <pre>     (iv) Does  the contents insurer's right of subrogation apply
          against  a mortgagee of the insured's property  if  the
          terms  of the mortgage require the mortgagor to  insure
          for  the benefit of the mortgagee and not to change the
          policy   without  the  mortgagee's  consent,  and   the
          mortgagor breaches those terms?</pre>
    <pre>(i)  Was there evidence to support the trial judge's finding that
     the cause of the fire was a defective fireplace chimney?</pre>
    <pre>[11] There was an abundance of evidence, expert and otherwise, as
to  the  origin and cause of the fire. The trial judge's  finding
that  it  originated in the area surrounding the point where  the
flu  pipe from the first floor joined that proceeding upward from
the  second  floor  is  well supported. In  addition,  there  was
evidence to support his finding that the fire was caused  by  the
improper  installation of the chimney flu pipe when the fireplace
was  built  in  1985.  I  see no reason to interfere  with  those
findings.</pre>
    <pre>(ii) Did  the  trial judge err in finding that Mr.  Mascioli  was
     liable for the negligence of an independent contractor hired
     by him to build the fireplace?</pre>
    <pre>[12]  This  is the second issue as articulated by the  appellant.
However, the finding of the trial judge was not as clear-cut.  He
considered  evidence that the appellant hired a bricklayer  named
&quot;Joe&quot;,  whom he located working on a construction project in  the
area. The appellant, at the time of the trial, stated that he was
unable to locate Joe. It was argued by the respondent that  there
was in fact no &quot;Joe&quot;, but that his existence was a fabrication by
the  appellant to escape liability for negligent construction  of
the fireplace. The trial judge stated on page 10 of his reasons:</pre>
    <pre>          On all the evidence, without deciding whether
          &quot;Joe&quot; actually exists, I can come to no other
          rational  conclusion but that  the  defendant
          Antonio  Mascioli was the general manager  of
          the   building  project,  and   oversaw   the
          construction    of    the    fireplace,    or
          alternatively, he built it himself...</pre>
    <pre>[13]  On  that basis, he found that the appellant was responsible
for  the negligent construction of the fireplace. Since there was
no  actual  finding that the appellant himself did the work,  the
appellant  argues that this court must approach this  portion  of
the  appeal  on  the basis that the appellant in fact  contracted
with  &quot;Joe&quot; to do the work. The trial judge was obviously of  the
view  that liability was the same in any event. There is no doubt
that  if  the  appellant actually performed the work  himself  he
would   be   liable   to  the  respondents  for   the   negligent
construction.  However, the trial judge  did  not  give  detailed
reasons  for his finding that the appellant would be  liable  for
negligent construction performed by a person such as &quot;Joe&quot;.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The  cases cited by both parties deal with  the  hiring  of
independent contractors to perform either building or  repair  of
structures.  Liability is visited on the hirer in two situations:
first,  where the work itself is inherently dangerous and,  as  a
result  of  the actual carrying out of the work function,  damage
results. Second, where the work is performed negligently, and the
negligently built portion of the structure causes damage at  some
later date. In the first type of situation, the hirer may be held
liable  on  the  basis  that he himself  did  not  take  adequate
precautions to see that the independent contractor performed  the
work  function  in a safe fashion: see Savage v.  Wilby  et  al.,
[1954]  S.C.R. 376. In the second, he may be held liable  on  the
basis  that  he did not exercise reasonable care in  selecting  a
competent  contractor capable to perform the work  involved:  see
Chappells'  Ltd.  v. Municipality of the County of  Cape  Breton,
[1963] S.C.R. 340.</pre>
    <pre>[15]  There  was no indication in this case that the work  itself
was  inherently dangerous; therefore, the first type of situation
does  not  exist in this case. To find the appellant  liable  for
negligent work performed by &quot;Joe&quot;, it would be necessary to  find
that  the appellant did not exercise reasonable care in selecting
&quot;Joe&quot; to do the work. However, even assuming that the onus was on
the  plaintiffs to show that &quot;Joe&quot; was not competent  to  perform
the  work involved, it would have been impossible for them to  do
so,  since  it was the evidence of Mr. Mascioli that he  did  not
know &quot;Joe's&quot; surname, and knew of no way to contact him. On these
facts,  and  on the basis of the trial judge's finding  that  the
fireplace  was  negligently  constructed,  it  would  have   been
reasonable  for the trial judge to infer that the  appellant  did
not exercise reasonable care in selecting &quot;Joe&quot; to do the work.</pre>
    <pre>[16] In my view, the trial judge was not in error in finding  the
appellant liable for the negligent performance of the independent
contractor whom he says he hired.</pre>
    <pre>(iii)      Is  the quantum of liability of the appellant (if any)
     equal  to  the  amount  paid out  by  the  insurers  without
     adequate proof of the quantum of damages?</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  trial  judge assessed the quantum of damages  for  the
restaurant contents loss at the amount the insurer paid out under
the  contents  insurance policy. The appellant  argues  that  the
insurer  paid  too much, and therefore the appellant's  potential
quantum of liability is too high.</pre>
    <pre>[18] The trial judge heard evidence as to how the insurer reached
its  decision on the quantum of its liability under the  contents
policy, and he heard evidence of quantum of loss on behalf of the
appellant. The difference in the final figure was not great,  and
the  trial judge was disposed to accept the figure arrived at  by
the   insurer.  There  may  be  some  cases  where,  because   of
carelessness of the adjuster, the amount paid by an insurer could
be  shown  to  be  too high. I expect that such  cases  would  be
extremely  rare,  and this is not one of them.  The  trial  judge
valued  the  loss on the basis of evidence before him  which  was
adequate to decide this issue.
(iv) Does  the  contents  insurer's right  of  subrogation  apply
     against  a mortgagee of the insured's property if the  terms
     of  the  mortgage require the mortgagor to  insure  for  the
     benefit  of  the  mortgagee and not  to  change  the  policy
     without  the mortgagee's consent, and the mortgagor breaches
     those terms?</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The  trial judge correctly held that the appellant  had  no
insurable  interest in the contents. As a result of that  finding
he  concluded that the insurer could recover the amounts paid  to
the  insured  for  loss  of  contents  based  on  its  right   of
subrogation to the position of the insured. In my view,  the  one
does  not necessarily follow from the other. The insurer can only
have a right of subrogation if the Sin's had a right against  the
appellant as a result of the appellant's negligence.</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The  position of the appellant is premised on an  agreement
under  the  vendor  take-back mortgage that the  purchasers  (the
Sins)  would insure the property involved for the benefit of  the
mortgagee.  The evidence clearly indicates that the agreement  to
insure  for  the  benefit  of the mortgagee  was  to  insure  the
mortgaged property. The mortgaged property was the real  property
only,  and  did  not include the personalty. Thus, the  insurer's
right of subrogation with respect to contents was not affected by
the agreement between the insured and the mortgagee.</pre>
    <pre>[21] The issue of subrogation respecting the realty is dealt with
in the reasons on the cross-appeal.</pre>
    <pre>CROSS-APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[22]  The insurer cross-appeals the denial by the trial judge  of
recovery by way of subrogation of the insurer to the position  of
the  insured  - that is, against Mr. Mascioli for damage  to  the
real property resulting from his negligence..</pre>
    <pre>[23] The trial judge was of the view that the mortgagees, as loss
payees  under  the  policy, were intended by the  insurer  to  be
covered  for  fire loss even if caused by the negligence  of  the
appellant. He stated at pages 14 and 15 of his reasons:</pre>
    <pre>          ...  However,  an insurer may  not  bring  an
          action  against  its own insured.  Thus,  the
          question arises, is a person designated in  a
          policy  as a loss payee an insured or an  un-
          named  insured. If a loss payee can be deemed
          to be an insured, or if there is any evidence
          to  indicate an agreement by the  insurer  to
          consider  the loss payee an insured,  then  I
          find  the  insurer cannot pay the loss  payee
          its  loss  with one hand and with  the  other
          hand take it back by way of subrogation.</pre>
    <pre>          In  the case at bar, the defendant mortgagees
          had  an  insurable interest,  their  mortgage
          debt  was  secured  by the building  and  the
          defendants  were entitled to be paid  by  the
          insurer  for  their loss as provided  by  the
          insurance  policy and the mortgage  document.
          The  intent of the mortgage document  was  to
          require  the plaintiff/purchasers  to  insure
          the defendant/vendors against any loss during
          the term of the mortgage. I can only conclude
          that it was intended by the parties that  the
          defendant/vendors have the  benefit  of  fire
          insurance    to    be    placed    by     the
          plaintiff/purchasers in respect  of  loss  to
          the  vendor/mortgagees no matter how  caused.
          If   it  was  intended  that  this  duty   to
          indemnify  the defendants was subject  to  an
          exclusion    based    on   the    defendants'
          negligence, words to that effect should  have
          been  included in both the mortgage  document
          and the insurance policy.</pre>
    <pre>[24]  I agree with that portion of the trial judge's reasons.  It
is  supported by the comprehensive reasons of this court  in  the
case of Madison Developments Ltd. v. Plan Electric Co. (1997), 36
O.R. (3d) 80.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  However,  I  am  also of the view that  the  issue  can  be
resolved  on  a more simple and fundamental basis. Any  right  of
subrogation in this case depends on the ability of the insured to
sustain  an  action  in  damages against Mr.  Mascioli.  Had  Mr.
Mascioli  been  someone  to  whom the  insurers  did  not  owe  a
contractual  duty  to  insure, there can be  no  doubt  that  the
insured  would  be  able  to sustain an  action  against  him  in
negligence.  Therefore, the fundamental question is  whether  the
mortgage  provision requiring the purchaser to  insure  the  real
property precludes a successful action by the insured against the
mortgagee  for  the mortgagee's negligence. If the insured  could
not  succeed in such a claim, the insurer cannot have a right  of
subrogation.</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The mortgage includes an unqualified obligation on the part
of  the  mortgagor  to  insure the real  property  for  its  full
insurable value against loss by fire. Having insured the property
and  been paid by the insurer for its loss, the insured could not
sue  the appellant for the loss which the insured agreed with the
appellant  that he would insure against. Since the insured  could
not sustain an action against Mr. Mascioli, there is no right  to
which the insurer could be subrogated.</pre>
    <pre>[27] In my view, the cross-appeal fails.</pre>
    <pre>RESULT</pre>
    <pre>[28]  I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal, except  as
to  costs. Success at trial was divided, the insurer having  been
unsuccessful  in  its claim to subrogation with  respect  to  the
larger  portion of its claim -- loss for damage to the realty.  I
would  therefore allow the appeal to the extent of  deleting  any
order as to costs against the appellant at trial, and would  make
no order as to costs of the appeal for the same reason.
