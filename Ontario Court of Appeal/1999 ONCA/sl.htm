</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, who was 15 years old at the time of the
offence in June 1993, was convicted of sexual assault  of a four
year old girl, contrary to s. 271(1) of the Criminal Code on May
3, 1995, following a trial in Youth Court which commenced in
September, 1994 and extended over 17 days during that period. He
appeals his conviction and disposition of nine months open
custody, but not the probation period of 15 months.
[2]  The appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)   The  trial judge erred in refusing 
	       to  stay  the  charge for delay in June, 
	       1994.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)   The  trial judge erred in refusing
               to  qualify the psychologist tendered by
               the defence as an expert to give opinion
               evidence on the voir dire and trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)   The trial judge erred by admitting
               into evidence the hearsay statements  of
               the  child  made to her mother,  to  her
               step-father  and  to  the  CAS   worker,
               following  a Khan application where  the
               Crown led expert evidence which was  not
               able  to  be  answered  by  the  defence
               because of the above ruling.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)    The  trial  judge  erred  in  her
               application of the standard of proof, in
               that she believed that she was to choose
               between the evidence of the accused  and
               that of the Crown witnesses.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)   The  trial judge erred in refusing
               to  declare a mistrial on the  basis  of
               reasonable apprehension of bias, in that
               she  had  made a contribution of between
               $500  and $1000 to the capital fund  for
               the  clinic  which  employed  the  Crown
               expert witness.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (f)    The  custodial  portion  of   the
               disposition  was unreasonable,  with  an
               appropriate  sentence  being  a  lengthy
               period of probation.</pre>
    <pre>Because of our findings on grounds (a) and (b),  it  is
unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant was 15 years old in June 1993.  He lived with
his mother and sister. He had befriended two boys who were a few
years younger than he and also became a babysitter for those boys
as well as for a third boy and their younger sister, the
complainant, who was four years old. The children&#146;s mother was
about to deliver another baby and had asked the appellant to
sleep over at the house for a few nights to be ready in case the
mother and stepfather had to leave for the hospital during the
night. The appellant slept on the couch. The appellant had a very
good relationship with the whole family.
[4]  On the night of June 25, 1993 the parents went out and left
the appellant with the children. They testified that when they
went to leave, the complainant, E., was hysterical and clinging
to them, which was very unusual. The appellant testified that he
did not see or know about this and believed that E. was already
in bed when they left. The parents stated that when they
returned, the appellant reported to them that he had had trouble
putting E. to bed and that she might say something strange about
him because she was mad at him. The parents did not mention this
comment to the police when they reported the assault. The
appellant denied that he said that E. might say something strange
about him, but only that she was mad at him for putting her to
bed. He said he had found her watching T.V. and picked her up and
put her into bed.
[5]  The mother said that the next morning E. came into her
bathroom when she was in there and said to her:  &#147;Mommy, L. tried
to put his penis in my mouth last night&#148;.  She repeated that a
few minutes later to her stepfather, who went and confronted the
appellant who then left the house. The appellant said he woke up
and left normally, then called later to play with his friends and
to see if the mother wanted him to babysit. He said that he did
not know about the allegations until a few days later on June 29
at the police station.
[6]  E. was interviewed by a CAS worker on June 29, 1993 and gave
a videotaped statement in which she repeated what she had said to
her mother and stepfather and also added that the appellant put
his penis in her vagina.
[7]  The case was set to proceed to trial in October, 1993.
However, it was adjourned because the Crown had further
disclosure to provide. In December the case was adjourned again
as the Crown now required an assessment of the complainant in
order to bring a Khan application to introduce her hearsay
statements to the parents and CAS worker as evidence rather than
have her testify herself. The Crown expert, Dr. Sas, interviewed
the complainant on January 25, 1994 and her report was provided
to defence counsel on March 10, 1994. On March 16, the defence
objected to the admissibility of the report, otherwise he would
require a further adjournment to prepare to respond to it. That
motion was denied but the trial was adjourned to allow the
defence to review the report with its own expert. Due to delay in
obtaining authorization from legal aid, the appellant was not
able to retain his expert until May 24, 1994. The trial was set
for June 1, but could not proceed on that date due to delay in
disclosure of a video statement of the appellant, the existence
of which was previously unknown to either counsel. The case was
put over to June 7 for the defence to argue a motion for a stay
on the basis of unreasonable delay. That motion was adjourned to
June 22 because officers were not available on June 7.  The
motion was argued on June 22 and dismissed.
[8]  The trial proceeded in September, 1994 beginning with the
Khan voir dire. The Crown tendered Dr. Louise Sas as an expert to
testify in child behavioural and clinical psychology, child
memory and behaviours of victims of child sexual abuse and of
child witnesses, in order to give evidence on the competency or
capacity of the complainant to testify, and the issues of
necessity and reliability. Defence counsel conceded the expert
qualification of the witness.
[9]  The defence then sought to qualify its proposed expert, Dr.
Ronald Langevin to give opinion evidence in the area of forensic
psychological assessments of child sexual abuse victims with
respect to reliability of the statements made by those victims.
The trial judge held that although he was qualified as a forensic
psychologist, Dr. Langevin was not qualified specifically to give
evidence about sexually abused children as he was not
sufficiently experienced in dealing with child victims.  She
therefore denied the defence request to tender Dr. Langevin to
give opinion evidence on the issue of reliability of the
complainant's hearsay statements. Therefore on the voir dire
there was no evidence called to refute the evidence given by Dr.
Sas which was accepted,  the hearsay statements were ruled
admissible, and the complainant did not give evidence herself
either on the trial or on the voir dire.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant was the only defence witness called. He denied
the allegations, but the trial judge disbelieved him and entered
a conviction.</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS</pre>
    <pre>1.   Delay
</pre>
    <pre>[11] The reasons for the delay were not systemic, but rather late
and piecemeal disclosure by the Crown, together with the need for
both sides to marshall evidence for the Khan application. As of
the motion date, which was June 22, 1994, the time elapsed since
the date on the information (July 12, 1993) was just over 11
months, just outside the range referred to in R. v. Askov, [1990]
2 S.C.R. 1199 and R. v. Morin, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771 (8 to 10
months in Provincial Court).  The trial judge considered the
relevant factors including the bona fides of the Crown and
particularly that there was no evidence of prejudice to the
accused.  Although the delay was about 1 month outside the
parameter target set by the Supreme Court of Canada and therefore
substantial, the trial judge weighed the appropriate factors in
considering whether the delay infringed the appellant&#146;s right to
be tried within a reasonable time. This was a case of some
complexity and we can see no error by the trial judge in the
exercise of her discretion on this issue.</pre>
    <pre>2.   The Refusal to Qualify Dr. Langevin as an Expert Witness</pre>
    <pre>[12] In her reasons for refusing to qualify Dr. Langevin, the
trial judge set out the following checklist of criteria to
determine whether a witness should be qualified as an expert:
professional qualifications, participation or membership in
professional associations, the nature and extent of publications,
actual experience, teaching, keeping up with the literature in
the field, participation in courses or conferences in the field,
the number of times qualified to give opinion evidence in the
specific area.  The trial judge then proceeded to evaluate his
evidence to determine to what extent his qualifications met the
criteria.
[13] It was clear that the trial judge found the witness to be
evasive, vague and hard to follow, and that her negative
impression of him played heavily in her decision to refuse to
qualify him. She correctly noted that the main focus of his work
was not on child victims of sexual assault, but on the
perpetrators.   However, she extrapolated from that that he had
little experience with child victims of sexual assault.  That
conclusion ignored much of his evidence and placed too much
emphasis on the fact he was not a child psychologist. In
reviewing his evidence, she failed to take account of his
extensive experience with child victims when he dealt with them
as part of a family. She also discounted the number of children
he did deal with directly and the fact that he had been qualified
to give similar expert evidence as he proposed to give in this
case on three prior occasions in the past year. The trial judge
relied further on the fact that Dr. Langevin had done no
teaching, had not attended conferences nor published specifically
in the area. The trial judge was not satisfied that the doctor
kept up with the literature in the area and noted that in his
evidence he made no reference to recognized authors in the field.
Finally the trial judge noted that &quot;there is no reference upon
which the court might rely that he considers himself a specialist
in dealing with the assessment of very small children...&quot;.  The
trial judge concluded that she was prepared to accept him as a
forensic psychologist, but not to give expert opinion on the
methodology of assessment of the complainant which Dr. Sas used.
After the ruling was read, counsel submitted that there had been
no evidence that the method of assessment was different for a
young child than for anyone else.  The trial judge responded that
if Dr. Langevin were to say that the methods were the same, given
that he is not a child psychologist, she would not accept his
opinion on the point.
[14] In our view the trial judge erred in refusing to qualify Dr.
Langevin to provide opinion evidence on the methods of assessment
of the reliability of the child complainant's evidence both in
the Khan voir dire and in the trial.
[15] The test for admissibility of expert opinion evidence is set
out by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Mohan (1994), 89
C.C.C. (3d) 402 at 411.  Four criteria must be met:  a)
relevance, b) necessity in assisting the trier of fact,  c) the
absence of any exclusionary rule, d) a properly qualified expert.
In our view, all four of these criteria were met.
[16] The proposed evidence of Dr. Langevin was clearly relevant
to the issues before the court. There was no relevant
exclusionary rule. More importantly, the issue of the reliability
of the 4 year old complainant was central to the Crown&#146;s case.
The assistance of a psychologist on behalf of the defence was
therefore necessary to present concerns about the reliability of
the complainant&#146;s hearsay evidence and to assist the judge in
understanding and weighing the Crown evidence of Dr. Sas on the
issue.
[17] In our view,  the trial judge failed to fully and properly
consider the considerable qualifications of  Dr. Langevin.  He is
a highly qualified forensic psychologist of long standing with
considerable experience in the sexual assault area including
dealing with  child victims and assessing the reliability of
victims&#146; statements in the context of dealing with perpetrators.
Dr. Langevin testified that he had been qualified previously to
give opinion evidence in court on the methodology used to obtain
statements of child complainants, one of the critical issues in
this case.
[18] In our view, Dr. Langevin was qualified to give the expert
opinion evidence for which he was being tendered as a witness.
The concerns raised by the trial judge about the extent of his
experience and the focus of his involvement in the field, as well
as about the manner in which he gave his evidence are all issues
which would go to the weight to be accorded his evidence by the
trier of fact, rather than to the threshold issue of  his
qualification to testify.
[19] The exclusion of Dr. Langevin&#146;s evidence as an expert
prejudiced the appellant in his defence at trial.  In her reasons
for judgment, the trial judge referred extensively to Dr. Sas&#146;
evidence as to the indicia of reliability of the complainant.
This evidence was accepted in part because it was uncontradicted.
The result would not necessarily have been the same had the
proposed defence evidence been admitted.  This is not a case for
the application of the proviso in s. 686 (1)(b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code:  R. v. Wildman [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311;  R. v. S.
(P.L.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909.  On this ground alone, the
conviction must be set aside.
[20] Because of this finding it is not necessary to deal with the
other grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>RESULT
</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appeal is allowed and the conviction is set aside.
Although as of June, 1994, the court found that the appellant had
not suffered prejudice as a result of the delay, the trial itself
commenced in September, the evidence and argument were not
completed until March, 1995, and judgment was given in May, 1995.
There was a further extended period before the appeal was
perfected, much of it caused by delay in obtaining the
transcripts. At this stage, the appellant is 21 years of age,
while the complainant is 10 years old. The appellant has spent a
very significant portion of his teenage years under the cloud of
these proceedings. In all the circumstances, the Crown may wish
to consider whether it is in the public interest to proceed with
a new trial.</pre>
