</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by His Honour Judge R.T.
Weseloh dated April 27, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The background and history of the respondent, including his
post-sentence conduct, leads us to believe that at present, he
poses a very serious risk to society.  For his sake and that of
society at large, the respondent requires a prolonged period of
intense treatment in a secure setting.  Absent this, we fear that
his prospects for rehabilitation, which at the moment appear dim,
will be irretrievably lost.
[2]  Much as we are required to show deference to the discretion
exercised by the trial judge, we are all of the view that based
on the record before him, the trial judge failed to give adequate
weight to the principles of specific and general deterrence and
he also failed to recognize that in this case, the offender&#146;s
ultimate rehabilitation could best be accomplished by a lengthy
period of secure custody accompanied by an intense program of
treatment.  Manifestly, the post-sentence material filed on
consent lends support to this conclusion.
[3]  For these reasons, the sentence under review cannot stand.
In all of the circumstances, we think that a fit sentence is one
of 16 months secure custody plus 20 months probation, concurrent
on all charges, with the terms and conditions of probation being
those ordered by the trial judge.  We strongly recommend that the
sentence be served in an institution where the respondent can
receive the necessary treatment.
[4]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal
is allowed, and the sentence imposed at trial is varied in
accordance with these reasons.</pre></td>
