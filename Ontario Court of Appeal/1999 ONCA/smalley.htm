    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice G. Yates dated
February 16, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant purchased the interest of the respondent
Milner in a condominium project.  Milner&#146;s interest was a tax
sheltered limited partnership interest in the condominium project
that the limited partnership built and operated as rental units.
The limited partnership interest could be converted into title to
the condominium suite, without cost.
[2]  The appellant claims that she believed that she was
purchasing a condominium unit instead of a limited partnership
interest, that she did not enter into a binding agreement to
assume the indebtedness of Milner, and that the transaction
failed to comply with the Securities Act.   The appellant is not
pursuing this last issue.
[3]  The trial judge found that there had been no
misrepresentation and that the appellant did in fact know she was
purchasing a limited partnership interest.  In light of the
documents received and executed by the appellant and her dealings
with Revenue Canada, the trial judge&#146;s findings are amply
supported by the evidence.  Moreover, she made loan payments,
received rental income and took deductions for income tax
purposes, which conduct is consistent with the investment.  She
also had a chartered accountant advising her.
[4]  After the administrative error showing the interest in the
name of Milner was discovered, the appellant made an application
for the assumption of the outstanding loan which was approved by
Canada Trusco Mortgage Company (&#147;Canada Trusco&#148;).  The appellant
refused to execute the assumption agreement because of the legal
costs involved.  In our view, the finding of the trial judge that
the appellant agreed to assume the loan obligation and so
demonstrated by her conduct is supported by the evidence.  She
considered herself the owner of the interest.
[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.
[6]  Canada Trusco seeks leave to appeal on the issue of costs,
arguing that it should have been  awarded costs on a solicitor-
and-client basis as opposed to party-and-party costs.
[7]  The trial judge gave no reason for awarding party-and-party
costs.  The mortgage document provided that Canada Trusco is
entitled to its costs in enforcement proceedings on a solicitor-
and-client basis.
[8]  In the absence of reasons from the trial judge indicating
that he was exercising his discretion to the contrary, we see no
basis for depriving Canada Trusco of its contractual right to
costs on the higher scale.  Accordingly, leave to appeal is
granted and the cross-appeal is allowed.  Canada Trusco is
awarded its costs, both at trial and on appeal, on a solicitor-
and-client basis.  Costs to the other respondents on the appeal
are awarded on a party-and party-basis.</pre></td>
