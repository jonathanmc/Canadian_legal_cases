    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  Counsel for the appellant and for the respondent agreed that
the affidavit evidence filed by both of them should be admitted
and considered on the issue of the appellant's claim of a denial
of the effective assistance of counsel at trial.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  In our view, the purported expert evidence of Dr. Perkons
fails to establish the opinion for which he contends, because the
evidentiary basis on which that opinion is grounded was not made
out at trial and certainly was not made out on the information
available to Mr. Warren as recited in his uncontradicted
affidavit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In these circumstances, the appellant has shown neither that
Mr. Warren acted incompetently in failing to call expert evidence
at trial nor that, even if it could be said that he did, there is
a reasonable probability that the appellant would not have been
convicted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The appellant's position is not advanced by the submission,
made for the first time on the argument of this appeal, that the
appellant's symptoms of impairment could not have been caused by
the sole consumption of alcohol, an argument that involves a
factual finding (not made by the trial judge) regarding the
amount of alcohol consumed by the appellant and that does not
raise a question of law alone.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</font></pre></td>
