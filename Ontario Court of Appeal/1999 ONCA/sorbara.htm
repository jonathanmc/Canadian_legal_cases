</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Cameron J. dated May 4, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   In  our  view Cameron J. was correct in finding no  genuine
issue  for trial and granting summary judgment in favour  of  the
plaintiff.
[2]  In reaching this conclusion we do not find it necessary to
look to the doctrine of issue estoppel or the conclusion reached
at trial in Adriatic v. Soja. Rather, it is enough to address the
defences to this action advanced by the appellant.
[3]  Before Cameron J. the appellant put forward three defences
which he argued were sufficient to warrant a trial: fiduciary
duty, duress, and equitable setoff. The motions judge found that
none of these raised a genuine issue for trial. For the reasons
he gave we agree.
[4]  Before us the appellant built on his duress position to
argue that the respondent had originally agreed with the
appellant that they would each contribute $125,000, then reneged
by changing his contribution into a loan to the appellant. The
appellant argued that the failure of the respondent to make his
contribution as originally promised creates a genuine issue for
trial.
[5]  We disagree. While the appellant asserted this promise by
the respondent he refused to be cross-examined about it and the
respondent denied it. Moreover, even if there were a factual
issue for trial this allegation raises no legal issue. The
appellant could show no consideration for the promise so as to
make it legally binding on the respondent. Thus, even assuming
the promise was made the respondent was entitled to resile from
it.
[6]  We therefore conclude that the appeal must be dismissed with
costs.</pre>
