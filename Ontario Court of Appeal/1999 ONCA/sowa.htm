    <pre>[1]  We agree with the conclusion reached by the trial judge.  It
was common ground that the applicant had no paper title.  The
claim for rectification therefore depended upon evidence as to
the intentions of the parties.  In this regard, the trial judge
rejected the evidence of the applicant.  He preferred the
evidence in the memoranda of the solicitors and concluded as a
result that rectification was not available.  This would defeat
any claim to a legal right-of-way.

[2]  While the trial judge did not expressly deal with the
acquisition of a right-of-way by user, the evidence would clearly
not support such a claim.  Nor was there any basis upon which an
“equitable” right-of-way could be supported.

[3]  It was argued that the phrase “together with all the
appurtenances thereto belonging” would bring within the agreement
any existing rights-of-way although not expressly mentioned in
the agreement.  Assuming without deciding that that proposition
is sound, it does not assist the appellant.  The phrase only
appeared in a 1962 long-term Agreement of Purchase and Sale.
There were no existing rights-of-way at that time.  The land was
just then being severed.  Alternatively, if there were existing
rights-of-way, they were the twelve-foot rights-of-way shown on
the 1961 drawing.  These are different in size and location from
those found on the 1972 drawing.  The deed was not given until
1973.  It says nothing about appurtenances.  The rights-of-way
claimed at that time were different in size and location from
those shown on the 1961 drawing.  Accordingly, the argument based
on appurtenances must fail.

[4]  The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
