      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

      <pre>[1]  The trial judge properly instructed the jury on the
essential elements of the offence of unlawful confinement.  She
did not distinguish between the evidence of the confinement which
was necessarily incidental to the alleged sexual assault and the
evidence of confinement apart from the commission of sexual
assault.  The trial judge was not asked to make that distinction
by either the Crown or the accused.  In our view, her failure to
do so does not constitute an error in law.
[2]  The jury convicted on both the sexual assault and the
confinement charges.  There was some evidence which could support
a finding of confinement apart from the sexual assault.  In light
of the charge, the unlawful confinement charge may or may not
have been based on confinement other than that which formed part
of the sexual assault.  The two findings of guilt may or may not
have given rise to a Kienapple claim.  That claim was not
advanced at trial.  The trial judge entered convictions on both
counts and imposed concurrent sentences.  On this record we are
not in a position to conclude that the unlawful confinement
charge should have been stayed pursuant to the Kienapple
principle.  This ground of appeal fails.
[3]  The trial judge’s review of the evidence was adequate.  Her
failure to advert to a piece of evidence which could offer some
support for one aspect of the case for the defence (the
complainant’s motive to fabricate) does not constitute reversible
non-direction.
[4]  The reasonable doubt instruction was satisfactory.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed.
                                                                 </pre>
