    <pre>HEARD:         DECEMBER 2, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from  the judgment of Dandie J. dated May 20, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, the motions court judge erred in granting
summary judgment dismissing the claims against the respondent.
The accident giving rise to these claims occurred after a night
of drinking by a group of young people.  Shortly before the
accident, the group attended at the respondent&#146;s establishment
and alcohol was consumed.
[2]  The motions court judge relied principally on the contention
that the Phillip Berry, a member of the group, was not drinking
and was available to drive.  In our view, it is not sufficiently
clear on this record that Mr. Berry&#146;s presence brought the case
within the situation of Stewart v. Pettie, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 131, a
case that involved a group of adults, two of whom were not
drinking.
[3]  Mr. Berry was a young person, under the legal age for
drinking, who held only a limited licence that did not allow him
to drive without a sober licensed driver present.  In the
circumstances, a trier of fact might well conclude that the
respondent should have been aware of the risk that a drunken
patron would drive the group from the establishment.  There was
no evidence of any steps taken by the respondent to deal with the
risk on the night in question.  In the final analysis, on this
record, in dismissing the claims against the respondent, the
motions judge decided issues which he was not permitted to decide
on a motion for summary judgment under Rule 20.
[4]  For these reasons, the appeals are allowed with costs both
here and below.</pre>
