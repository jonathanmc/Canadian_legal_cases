</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Quinn J. dated September 16, 1996,
made at Windsor.
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Patricia Spendlove worked for the national accounting  firm
of  Thorne,  Ernst  &amp; Whinney (T.E.W.) as the office  manager  of
their  Windsor office. On August 11, 1988, she was fired for  her
participation  in  what became known as the  Quenneville  scheme.
This  was a plan involving kickbacks and tax fraud set up  for  a
client  of T.E.W. by Wallace Robson, the managing partner of  the
Windsor Office.
[2]  Ms. Spendlove sued T.E.W. for wrongful dismissal and to
recover her legal costs pursuant to an indemnity agreement she
asserted with T.E.W. T.E.W. counterclaimed for damages flowing
from the Quenneville scheme.
[3]  At trial, Quinn J. allowed both her claims and dismissed the
counterclaim. T.E.W. appeals.
[4]  For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that   </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)  T.E.W. had just cause to dismiss Ms. Spendlove and that this
was unaffected by the involvement of Mr. Robson in the Quenneville
scheme;
(b)  that Ms. Spendlove cannot, in law, recover her legal costs
pursuant to the alleged indemnity agreement; and
(c)  that T.E.W. has not satisfactorily proven any loss resulting
from Ms. Spendlove&#146;s breach of her employment contract.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[5]   I would therefore allow the appeal from the judgment in Ms.
Spendlove&#146;s favour on her claims, but would dismiss the appeal by
T.E.W. from the dismissal of its counterclaim.

THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[6]   In  1988 Ms. Spendlove was 58 years old. She had spent  the
preceding  18  years working in accounting firms in positions  of
increasing  responsibility. From 1982, she had  been  the  office
manager of the Windsor accounting firm of Robson Sovran.
[7]  On December 1, 1985 that firm merged with the national
accounting firm of Thorne Riddell, becoming its Windsor office.
Eight months later, Thorne Riddell merged with Ernst &amp;Whinney to
form the T.E.W. partnership. Ms. Spendlove continued in her
position as office manager where she remained until she was
suspended with pay on June 10, 1988 and then terminated for cause
on August 11, 1988.
[8]  In her role as office manager, she was an integral part of
the Windsor office of T.E.W. Her duties included the performance
of important bookkeeping functions for its clients. As the trial
judge concluded, she was a very competent individual with an
excellent grasp of the mechanics of an accounting firm.
[9]  Mr. Robson was the senior partner in the Robson Sovran firm,
which had a successful public accounting practice in Windsor.
When the firm merged with Thorne Riddell and then with Ernst &amp;
Whinney, Mr. Robson became a partner in the national accounting
firm and the managing partner of the Windsor office. T.E.W.
continued to carry on a national accounting practice and Mr.
Robson continued as a partner and managing partner of the Windsor
office. Throughout this period, Mr. Robson was the person to whom
Ms. Spendlove reported.
[10] Ms. Spendlove was terminated for her participation in the
Quenneville scheme. Mr. Quenneville was a client of the Robson
Sovran firm who, following the mergers, became a client of Thorne
Riddell and then of T.E.W. The trial judge described the scheme
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Raymond Quenneville at all material
	 times was the general manager of a large metal
	 stamping  plant  in  the  City of Windsor. Mr.
	 Quenneville had  authority to  grant contracts
         relating  to  his  company&#146;s business. In this
	 regard  Mr. Quenneville  demanded a commission
	 from each  customer  who received  a contract.
	 The &#147;kickback&#148;  commissions  received  by  Mr.
	 Quenneville were substantial.  Mr. Quenneville
	 in  approximately  1980 approached Robson  and
	 told him that he was  going through  a divorce
	 and  the  he  wished  to  hide the  commission
	 earnings from his wife. Robson	 arranged for a
	 company to be incorporated the shareholders of
	 which  would  be  himself  and  Spendlove. The
	 purpose  of  this company was  to  receive Mr. 
	 Quenneville&#146;s commission earnings and  to hide
	 the  earnings  from Mr. Quenneville&#146;s  present
	 wife.  The  scheme  which  would  permit   Mr.
	 Quenneville  to  hide  his   commissions   was
	 devised  by Robson. The day to day bookkeeping
         involved with the scheme was done by Spendlove.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     One  aspect  of  the   Quenneville
         scheme     involved    Spendlove     declaring
         Quenneville income on her income  tax returns.
         Robson  would then review Spendlove&#146;s   income
         tax  return and calculate the income  tax  due
         with  and  without  the  Quenneville   income.
         Spendlove  would then be reimbursed   whatever
         additional  tax she had paid as a   result  of
         the Quenneville income.</pre>
    <pre>[11]  Mr.  Robson  and Ms. Spendlove made no  disclosure  of  the
Quenneville scheme to Thorne, Riddell or T.E.W. They  carried  it
on  until  it came to light on April 19, 1988, when the  R.C.M.P.
and  Revenue  Canada  raided the Windsor office  and  seized  the
documents relating to the scheme. During the Revenue Canada audit
which followed, Ms. Spendlove made matters worse by intentionally
lying  to  the  investigators concerning the true nature  of  the
scheme.
[12] Charges were subsequently laid against both Mr. Quenneville
and Mr. Robson. Mr. Quenneville pleaded guilty to tax evasion.
Mr. Robson was tried and convicted of 10 counts of tax fraud
under the Income Tax Act and sentenced, after appeal, to two
years less a day in prison.
[13] It is clear, as the trial judge concluded, that the
Quenneville scheme was unethical and illegal, that Ms.
Spendlove&#146;s participation in it was wrong, and that at all times
she knew it was wrong.
[14] Following the R.C.M.P. raid, Mr. Robson retained counsel to
represent T.E.W. and separate counsel to represent both himself
and Ms. Spendlove. Then on May 19, 1988, Mr. Robson delivered a
letter to Ms. Spendlove purportedly on behalf of T.E.W. and
himself. It provided that in consideration of her agreement to
continue working for the firm, T.E.W. and Mr. Robson personally
would indemnify her for all costs and claims arising out of the
Quenneville scheme. Subsequently, Ms. Spendlove incurred costs of
$18,853.07 to retain counsel to advise her in connection with the
scheme.
[15] Despite his characterization of her conduct, the trial judge
allowed her claim for wrongful dismissal and awarded her damages
equivalent to 20 weeks&#146; notice. He set out the core of his
reasoning in the following passage:
          </pre>
    <pre>    I would conclude, that T.E.W.&#146;s dismissal of Spendlove was
    wrongful. An employee should not be discharged for carrying out
    the instructions of the employer even when the employer and the
    employee appreciate the instructions might constitute an illegal
    act.</pre>
    <pre>[16]   The   trial  judge  further  concluded  that   there   was
consideration  for  the indemnification agreement  and  that  Ms.
Spendlove  was entitled to recover the amount she  had  spent  on
counsel.
[17] Finally, the trial judge dismissed T.E.W.&#146;s counterclaim for
damages suffered because of the Quenneville scheme, apparently
for the same reason that he allowed her claim for wrongful
dismissal, namely that she was merely carrying out the
instructions of her employer.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appellant raises three issues on this appeal. First, did
the  trial judge err in finding that Ms. Spendlove was wrongfully
dismissed?   Second,  did the trial judge  err  in  allowing  Ms.
Spendlove&#146;s  claim  for indemnification?  Third,  did  the  trial
judge  err  by dismissing T.E.W.&#146;s counterclaim?  I will  address
each of these in turn.
[19] The wrongful dismissal analysis must begin with an
assessment of Ms. Spendlove&#146;s actions. To repeat, she was an
active participant for a number of years in a tax fraud scheme of
significant illegality. The scheme was created to serve a client
of the accounting firm and was carried on from its offices. Ms.
Spendlove was aware from the beginning that the scheme in which
she was integrally involved was wrong. Indeed, it is difficult to
think of anything more antithetical to the mission of a national
accounting firm than effecting a major tax fraud for a client.
[20] Hence, there is no doubt that absent the involvement of Mr.
Robson, Ms. Spendlove&#146;s actions constitute just cause for her
dismissal. They constitute a marked departure from the broad duty
of fidelity that is an implied component of the common law
employment relationship.1
[21] In Malik v. Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA
[1997] 3 All E.R. 1, the House of Lords discussed this concept in
the context of the alleged breach of such a term by the employer
rather than the employee. The House of Lords determined that this
implied term, which was referred to as one of trust and
confidence, binds both the employer and the employee and imposes
reciprocal duties on each. The decision makes clear that the
purpose of this broad duty is to facilitate the proper
functioning of the employment contract. In language equally
applicable to Ms. Spendlove in this case, the House of Lords
described the duty on the employer bank this way at p.5:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; the bank was under a implied obligation
	  to its employees not to conduct a dishonest or
	  corrupt business. This  implied  obligation is
	  no  more  than  one  particular  aspect of the
          portmanteau, general obligation not to  engage
	  in conduct likely to  undermine  the trust and
	  confidence     required  if    the  employment
          relationship  is to continue in the manner the
          employment contract implicitly envisages.
          </pre>
    <pre>                &#133;  The trust  and confidence required in
          the employment relationship  can be undermined
          by  an  employer, or indeed  and employee,  in
          many  different ways. &#133; The  conduct must,  of
          course,  impinge on the relationship   in  the
          sense  that,  looked  at objectively,   it  is
          likely  to  destroy or seriously  damage   the
          degree  of trust and  confidence the  employee
          is   reasonably   entitled  to  have  in   his
          employer.</pre>
    <pre>[22]  Ms.  Spendlove was an active and dishonest  participant  in
this  illegal scheme which she carried on in the context  of  her
work  for  her employer. It does not avail her that she  did  not
benefit  personally,  nor  that her  actions  were  not  directed
against  her employer. Her conduct was fundamentally inconsistent
with  the  nature  of her employer&#146;s business.  It  violated  the
implied  term of fidelity by which she was bound and  constituted
just cause for her dismissal.
[23] The only question is whether Mr. Robson&#146;s role in this
scheme alters that conclusion. Unlike the trial judge, I conclude
that it does not.
[24] Quinn J. seems to have proceeded on the basis that Mr.
Robson was Ms. Spendlove&#146;s employer and that since her misconduct
simply resulted from following her employer&#146;s instructions, she
was protected from discharge by a kind of estoppel. This argument
might well have some validity if the facts fit. However, this is
not the case. While Ms. Spendlove&#146;s participation in the
Quenneville scheme was directed by Mr. Robson, he was not her
employer. T.E.W. was her employer.
[25] Nor was it reasonable in these circumstances for Ms.
Spendlove to take Mr. Robson&#146;s directions as being made on behalf
of T.E.W. It is true that Mr. Robson was a partner of T.E.W.
However, the conduct he sought from her was dishonest and she
knew it. The illegal scheme involved kickbacks and hiding
earnings. It required her to knowingly file false income tax
returns. Given the normal business done on behalf of its clients
by T.E.W. as a national accounting firm, Ms. Spendlove simply
could not reasonably take Mr. Robson&#146;s instructions as being
those of her employer. They were obviously not within the
ordinary course of its business.
[26] Hence, Mr. Robson&#146;s involvement did not constitute the
employer instructing the employee to engage in the conduct for
which she was then terminated. Rather, both Mr. Robson and Ms.
Spendlove breached their duties to T.E.W. and T.E.W.&#146;s right to
dismiss Ms. Spendlove for just cause remained unimpaired.
[27] In summary, this is not a case where the employee might
reasonably be uncertain about whether the instructions to her
were truly those of her employer or not. Here Mr. Robson&#146;s
invitation to play an active role in the Quenneville scheme was
so clearly outside the scope of T.E.W.&#146;s business that Ms.
Spendlove could have declined without risk of penalty from her
employer. Once she acceded to that invitation, her dishonest
actions were just cause for T.E.W. to dismiss her.
[28] The second issue concerns Ms. Spendlove&#146;s claim for
indemnification from T.E.W. pursuant to the letter to her from
Mr. Robson dated May 19, 1988.
[29] The trial judge determined that this indemnity was binding
on T.E.W. He found that the problems which required Ms. Spendlove
to have counsel were created for her by Mr. Robson and that this
constituted consideration for the promise on indemnification
given by Mr. Robson on behalf of T.E.W.
[30] With respect, I disagree. The problems caused for Ms.
Spendlove by the Quenneville scheme were created by Mr. Robson,
not by T.E.W. For the reasons I have already given, Mr. Robson
was not acting within the scope of his authority as a partner of
T.E.W. when he directed her participation in the scheme. Nor
could she have reasonably concluded that he was. Her enduring of
the difficulties inflicted on her by Mr. Robson cannot constitute
consideration given to her by T.E.W.
[31] Moreover, while the indemnity letter recites her agreement
to continue working for the firm as the consideration for the
promise of indemnification, her evidence belies this. She made
clear that as of May 19, 1988, she fully intended to continue to
work for the firm unless she was fired, regardless of the promise
of indemnification.
[32] I therefore conclude that the indemnity letter of May 19,
1988 fails to bind T.E.W. for want of consideration, and that the
trial judge erred in finding otherwise.
[33] Finally, I turn to the counterclaim. As I have said, the
trial judge dismissed the counterclaim of T.E.W. on the basis
that Ms. Spendlove was simply following the directions of her
employer.
[34] For the reasons I have given, I disagree with this analysis.
In my view, Ms. Spendlove&#146;s participation in the Quenneville
scheme was in clear breach of her duty of fidelity to her
employer, T.E.W. However, I would reach the same conclusion as
Quinn J. and dismiss the counterclaim because T.E.W. has not
proven that any damages flowed from this breach.
[35] T.E.W. argues that because in a parallel, but undefended,
action against Mr. Robson for damages arising from the
Quenneville scheme it recovered a judgment for $1,458,699, it
should recover the same against Ms. Spendlove. However, Ms.
Spendlove&#146;s liability is in breach of contract. She is not
jointly liable with Mr. Robson. Moreover, her participation in
the scheme was very different from his and the damages flowing
from her actions cannot simply be assumed to be the same as those
caused by him. Since this basis for a damage award fails and
since the appellant proved no other basis, the counterclaim must
be dismissed.
[36]  I,  therefore, conclude that the appeal from  the  judgment
against  T.E.W. must be allowed with costs and the action against
it must be dismissed with costs. The appeal from the dismissal of
the counterclaim must also be dismissed with costs.
