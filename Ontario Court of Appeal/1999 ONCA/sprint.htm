    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">BY THE COURT:
</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants, Sprint Canada Inc. and Lightel Inc., appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from the summary dismissal of their action against the respondents,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bell Canada and BC Tel by MacPherson J.  They also appeal against</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the dismissal of their motion for summary judgment against the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respondents.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellants are resellers of telecommunication services</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">purchased from the respondents. Their action is for damages in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relation to rates charged by the respondents to other resellers of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">telecommunication services under contracts more particularly</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">described as hotel/motel commissions plans (&quot;HMCP&quot;).  The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fundamental basis for the appellants' action rests on their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contention that they were entitled to the same discounts given to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondents' hotel and motel customers under the HMCP from the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">time the appellants entered the competitive market to the time the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">HMCP were terminated by the Canadian Radio-Television and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Telecommunications Commission (the &quot;CRTC&quot;) in 1995.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  In May 1992, the appellants brought an application before the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CRTC requesting that they be provided with the same discounts</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">provided to hotels and motels under the HMCP. In 1995, the CRTC</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rendered its decision on the appellants' application. In Decision</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">95-2, the CRTC reversed its long standing position and its earlier</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">explicit rulings on HMCP.  It held that as a result of an evolution</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">which occurred in the telecommunications market place, the HMCP in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">fact allowed for discounted rates and thus were subject to its</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">jurisdiction.  The CRTC concluded that the HMCP must be terminated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Shortly thereafter, this action was commenced.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The motions judge held that (1) the action was an</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">impermissible collateral attack on Decision 95-2 and that the court</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did not have jurisdiction over the claim, (2) the claim was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">precluded by s. 72 (3) of the Telecommunications Act (the &quot;Act&quot;)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and (3) the appellants had failed to raise a triable issue on their</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">claim for damages.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  It is only necessary to deal with the first and third issues</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">on this appeal.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Collateral attack on the CRTC decision

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  In our opinion, the motions judge was correct in concluding</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appellants' action constituted an impermissible attack on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Decision 95-2.  Although framed in tort, the action, in essence,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">raises the same fundamental issue with respect to the appellants'</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">entitlement to the discount afforded to hotels and motels under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">HMCP. This question was raised by the appellants' 1992 application</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">before the CRTC, it was clearly within its jurisdiction and it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decided in Decision 95-2.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  As noted by the motions judge, in Decision 95-2, the CRTC was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reviewing five years of complicated economic activity in one sector</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of the telecommunications industry.  It reconsidered its own</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">previous decisions in light of the changes in the nature of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">industry.   The CRTC crafted a complex remedy and found that, as of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">1995, the HMCP violated the Act. Hence it ordered that the HMCP be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">terminated in six months' time thereby giving customers the time to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">rearrange their affairs.  More importantly, the CRTC did not find</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the appellants were entitled to the same discount as requested</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">nor did it find that the appellants had not received an equivalent</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">treatment through the volume discounts it received during the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">relevant period.  Finally, the CRTC did not make any compensatory</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">order in favour of the appellants.  The appellants did not appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Decision 95-2.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  The  CRTC is a highly specialized tribunal with particular</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">expertise.  It enjoys a broad discretion over telecommunication</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">matters and has broad powers to make remedial orders including</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">financial remedies.  The CRTC is entitled to curial deference. The</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appellants chose not to appeal Decision 95-2 and it is not open to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">them to revisit the matter by this action. On this ground alone,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the respondents were entitled to summary judgment.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">No triable issue

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  In our view, the appellants' action is entirely misconstrued</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and raises no triable issue. As indicated earlier, the fundamental</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">basis for the appellants' action rests on their contention that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">they were entitled to the same discounts given under the HMCP for</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the relevant period of time and that the respondents acted contrary</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to the Telecommunications Act in failing to give them the same or</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">equivalent discounts.  The appellants concede that this question is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">one that properly falls within CRTC jurisdiction and they interpret</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Decision 95-2 as having determined it in their favour.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] We do not agree with this interpretation. Despite some</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">language in Decision 95-2 that may appear to state otherwise, we</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">are of the view that the only reasonable interpretation that can be</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made of the decision is that it speaks only from the date it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">given and does not have any retrospective effect. Prior to the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">decision, the HMCP, according to earlier CRTC rulings, did not</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contravene the  Telecommunications Act or its predecessor. Due to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">changes in the telecommunications environment, the CRTC</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reconsidered the matter and found that the HMCP offered</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">&quot;significant potential for anti-competitive behaviour&quot; which would</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">be in contravention of the legislation. Hence, the decision was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">made to terminate the HMCP in six months' time. The appellants</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">concede that they do not have a right of action with respect to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">this six months' period. This concession is well founded because it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">could not be argued that the respondents were acting illegally in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">continuing the HMCP in accordance with the CRTC ruling for that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">period of time. In our view, the same reasoning applies with</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">respect to the relevant period of time prior to Decision 95-2.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Statutory bar to the action

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] In light of our conclusion that the appellants' action is ill-</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">founded,  we do not find this to be an appropriate case to decide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether an action for damages in relation to a rate is entirely</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">precluded by s.72(3) of the Telecommunications Act. The question is</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">better left for determination based on a proper factual foundation.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</font></pre></td>
