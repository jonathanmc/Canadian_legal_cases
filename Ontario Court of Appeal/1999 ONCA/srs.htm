    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from the decision of Leitch L.C. J. in
which she found the appellant liable in damages for sexually
assaulting his daughter, the respondent.  The sole issue on this
appeal is with respect to liability.
[2]  The respondent alleges that the appellant sexually abused
her when she was 15 and 16 years of age.   The sexual abuse
consisted of fondling, masturbation, oral sex and sexual
intercourse.  The appellant denies any sexual misconduct.
[3]  The appellant raises the following issues on appeal:

     1.   The use made by the trial judge of the Victim Impact
          Assessment;

     2.   The trial judge’s treatment of the failure of the appellant
          to keep in contact with the respondent;

     3.   The trial judge’s treatment of the failure of the appellant
          to respond to a police request to provide a statement;

     4.   The failure of the trial judge to appreciate the
          significance of certain evidence;

     5.   The failure of the trial judge to recognize the different
          versions of events given on different occasions by the
          respondent; and

     6.   The trial judge’s decision to allow into evidence a motion
          record relating to the appellant’s separation from his former
          wife in 1986.
</pre>
    <pre>1.   Victim Impact Assessment</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The Victim Impact Assessment prepared by Dr. Sas and Ms.
Poisson and filed in the proceedings dealt with the impact of the
alleged sexual abuse on the respondent.  The Victim Impact
Assessment also described the general behavioural and
psychological characteristics of child victims of sexual abuse.
[5]  The appellant argues that the trial judge could only use the
Victim Impact Assessment for the purpose of assessing damages
based on the impact of any abuse on the respondent.  The
appellant submits that the trial judge erred in using the Victim
Impact Assessment to establish liability against the appellant.
Specifically, the appellant points to that part of her reasons in
which the trial judge refers to the assessment of the respondent
by Dr. Sas and Ms. Poisson as consistent with the respondent’s
allegations of sexual abuse.
[6]  The admissibility of expert opinion evidence of this kind is
widely accepted.  See R. v. Olscamp (1995), 95 C.C.C. 466 at 474.
In the present case, the Victim Impact Assessment was filed on
consent, without any limitation as to its use by the trial judge.
Moreover, counsel for the appellant declined to cross-examine the
authors of the assessment.  We therefore see no basis for this
complaint.
[7]  As part of the argument dealing with the Victim Impact
Assessment, the appellant also argues that the trial judge erred
in relying on statements made by the appellant related to late
disclosure, which in his submission amounted to “oath helping”.
In particular, the trial judge relied on the Victim Impact
Assessment to explain the respondent’s delayed disclosure of the
alleged assaults as consistent with the general pattern of
behavior exhibited by child victims of sexual abuse where they
are closely related to the abuser.
[8]  In our view, the review of this evidence by the trial judge
was part of the narrative necessary to understand the appellant’s
conduct and the Victim Impact Assessment was not relied upon as a
prior consistent statement.</pre>
    <pre>2.   Consciousness of Guilt</pre>
    <pre>[9]  On May 16, 1988, after the alleged sexual abuse had stopped,
the respondent left the residence where she had been living with
the appellant.  The appellant made no effort to contact her after
this date.  Even when she sent him a letter in May of 1992, in
which she alleged the sexual misconduct, the appellant did not
respond.
[10] The appellant argues that the trial judge erred in taking
the appellant’s failure to keep in contact with his daughter and
his failure to respond to the letter as an indication of
consciousness of guilt.  The trial judge found the appellant’s
behaviour in this regard was consistent with the respondent’s
allegations.
[11] In our view, it was open to the trial judge to draw this
inference from the conduct of the respondent.
</pre>
    <pre>3.   Police Request for Statement</pre>
    <pre>[12] In her review of the evidence, the trial judge noted that
while Sergeant Bunting was at the appellant’s residence on
September 23, 1993, he asked the appellant for a statement in his
own time and in his own words and that the appellant never
responded to this request.
[13] The appellant argues that the trial judge must have drawn an
adverse inference against the appellant based on his failure to
provide the police with a statement.  Otherwise there was no
reason for the trial judge to refer to this evidence in her
reasons.
[14] This remark by the trial judge was clearly part of the
narrative and there is no indication that the trial judge used it
for any other purpose.
</pre>
    <pre>4.   Failure to Appreciate Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to
appreciate the significance of certain evidence.
[16] This evidence included a cheque for the waterbed replacing
the waterbed upon which the first sexual assault was alleged to
have occurred, and Ministry of Transportation documents as to the
ownership of the green Ford fan in which the “commuting” assaults
allegedly took place.  The appellant argues that this evidence
served to contradict the respondent’s allegations of sexual
abuse.
[17] The appellant also points to the respondent’s conduct in
wanting to go to Florida alone with the appellant, her sending
him greeting cards on two occasions and the respondent’s
demeanour during her initial interview with the Children’s Aid
Society as inconsistent with her allegations of sexual abuse.
[18] The trial judge dealt with each item of evidence.  She alone
was in the best position to evaluate this evidence and was alive
to the different inferences and conclusions that could be drawn.
We see no error with respect to this issue.
</pre>
    <pre>5.   Different Versions of Events</pre>
    <pre>[19] The appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to
recognize the different versions of the alleged incidents of
sexual abuse given by the respondent on different occasions.
[20] The trial judge fully considered the conduct of the
respondent.  She was aware of the inconsistencies in the
respondent’s different versions of events as told to the police
and the Children’s Aid Society, and her testimony under oath at
the preliminary hearing, during examination for discovery and at
the criminal and civil trials.  The trial judge properly
recognized the effect that the different versions could have in
assessing the respondent’s credibility.  We see no basis to
interfere.
</pre>
    <pre>6.   Admissibility of Motion Record</pre>
    <pre>[21] The appellant argues that the trial judge improperly
admitted a motion record relating to the appellant’s separation
from his former wife in 1986.
[22] The date of separation between the appellant and this former
wife was very important because it was after they separated that
the first sexual assault was alleged to have occurred.
[23] After the case had been closed but prior to argument, it
came to the attention of counsel for the respondent that a motion
record relating to the separation and containing the appellant’s
own affidavit could possibly assist the trial judge in
determining the date of separation.  The trial judge stated that
it would be an error on her part to conclude the trial without
this evidence.  She allowed the motion record, including the
appellant’s affidavit, to be filed.  The trial judge permitted
counsel for the appellant to call evidence dealing with these
documents and any issues that they raised, but he declined to so.
[24] A wide discretion is given to trial judges to re-open the
trial to allow a party to adduce further evidence in order to
prevent a possible miscarriage of justice.  In this case, the
issue of the date of separation was important.  The motion record
relating to the separation contained an affidavit sworn by the
appellant and counsel for the appellant was given the opportunity
to call evidence on it.  In these circumstances, the trial judge
was correct in her decision to re-open the proceedings and permit
this evidence to be adduced.
[25] The trial judge reviewed the evidence in great detail and
properly instructed herself on the applicable law.  After much
analysis, she found the preponderance of evidence consistent with
the respondent’s allegations of sexual abuse and inconsistent
with the appellant’s evidence of this abuse having not occurred.
The trial judge’s finding of liability was essentially based on
her assessment of the credibility and reliability of various
witnesses.  In our view, the evidence supports her findings of
fact and conclusions and we see no proper basis to interfere.
[26] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
