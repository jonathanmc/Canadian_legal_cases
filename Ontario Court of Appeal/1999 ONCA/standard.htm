    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Ferrier J. dated May 12, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>AUSTIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The plaintiff (&#147;Standard&#148;) loaned $2.5 million to Protective
Plastics Limited (&#147;PPL&#148;) taking a mortgage on real property as
security. PPL&#146;s principals, Paul George Szasz (&#147;Szasz&#148;) and
Robert Ernest Yeates (&#147;Yeates&#148;) guaranteed re-payment of the loan
to the extent of $250,000 each. PPL went into bankruptcy and its
Trustee sold the property to B. G. Schickedanz Investments
Limited (&#147;Schickedanz&#148;) and Timed Developments  Inc. (&#147;Timed&#148;)
for the amount outstanding on the mortgage. Schickedanz and Timed
entered into an agreement with Standard to assume responsibility
for payment of the mortgage. Schickedanz and Timed failed to pay
the money due on the mortgage. Standard sold the property. A
substantial deficiency remained owing on the mortgage. Standard
sued Szasz and Yeates for 250,000 each. Szasz and Yeates denied
liability but took the position that if they were liable, they
were entitled to recover over against Schickedanz and Timed. The
trial judge decided that Szasz and Yeates were liable to Standard
but had no right to recover over from Schickedanz and Timed.
Szasz and Yeates appeal from both decisions.
[2]  I have concluded that Szasz and Yeates are liable to
Standard for reasons broader than those relied upon by the trial
judge. I have also concluded that Szasz and Yeates are entitled
to recover over against Schickedanz and Timed.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The real property which was the security for the loan is 148
Market Street in downtown Brantford. From about 1877 until about
1942, it was the cite of Cockshutt Plough, a large manufacturer
of farm equipment. In 1942, plants were erected for the
manufacture of bomber aircraft wings. In 1960, White Farm
Equipment purchased the operation. In 1985, White Farm Equipment
began closing down its operations and selling the properties that
made up its manufacturing complex. PPL bought 148 Mohawk Street,
Brantford in December 1986 for $904,363. PPL manufactured plastic
resin/wood composite trailer sidings.
[4]  In late 1987 or early 1988, PPL applied to Standard for a
loan of $2.5 million. Standard agreed on terms which are set out
in four documents to which later reference will be made later.
Briefly, Standard agreed to advance $2.5 million on the security
of the property and the guarantees of Szasz and Yeates.
[5]  Szasz and Yeates were the principals of PPL. Their interests
were 52% and 48% respectively. The language of the charge
indicates that they were principal debtors and guarantors to the
extent of $250,000 each. The mortgage money was advanced
$2,200,000 in March and $300,000 in June 1988.
[6]  PPL got into financial difficulty soon after and Touche Ross
Limited (Touche) was appointed interim Receiver and Trustee in
bankruptcy on August 22, 1988.
[7]  By agreement dated January 17, 1989, Touche as Trustee of
PPL agreed to sell certain assets of PPL, including the real
estate subject to the charge, to CIC Industries Ltd. (CIC).
[8]  On March 13, 1989, Standard issued a Notice of Sale under
its charge, claiming payment from PPL, Szasz and Yeates of
$2,455,838.97.
[9]  By a further agreement dated April 19, 1989, PPL and Touche
as Trustee agreed to sell certain assets including the real
estate to CIC. A draft of the transfer was sent to Sheryl Seigel
of Campbell, Godfrey and Lewtas, solicitors, who advised that she
had consulted with the lawyers for Szasz and Yeates. She
requested, on their behalf, that the sale agreement be amended as
follows so as to release Szasz and Yeates from their guarantees:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is a condition of closing the transaction contemplated
          herein that the Purchaser obtain from Standard Trust Company,
          deliver to Robert Yeates and Paul Szasz, and register on title,
          releases of the personal covenants of Yeates and Szasz given to
          Standard Trust Company in paragraph 10.46 of the Charge/Mortgage
          of Land registered as Instrument No. A341631 in the Land Registry
          Office for the Registry Division of Brantford.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The sale agreement in its final form was signed on June 6,
1989 by Szasz and Yeates on behalf of PPL. This agreement did not
contain the release of Szasz and Yeates requested by Ms. Seigel.
The transfer was not from PPL to CIC but at the direction of CIC,
to Schickedanz and Timed. Also on June 6, 1989, a charge
assumption agreement was entered into between Schickedanz and
Timed on the one hand and Standard on the other.
[11] It was a term of the agreements of January 17 and April 19,
1989 between PPL and CIC that the price paid for the real estate
would be the amount outstanding on the Standard charge and that
the purchaser would assume that mortgage.
[12] On June 8, 1989, a transfer of the real property was
registered on title from Touche as interim Receiver and manager
to Schickedanz and Timed. Szasz and Yeates on behalf of PPL also
executed the transfer as &#147;additional transferors&#148;. By order of J.
M. Ferron, Registrar in Bankruptcy, dated June 29, 1989, title to
the property was vested in Schickedanz and Timed.
[13] Payments on the Standard mortgage were made by or on behalf
of Schickedanz and Timed until July 4, 1990. The outstanding
balance on the mortgage at that date was $2,339,498.56. This was
$116,340.41 less than the amount owing according to the March 13,
1989 Notice of Sale issued by Standard. By July 4, 1990, as well,
Schickedanz and Timed had made about $400,000 worth of repairs
and improvements to the real estate.
[14] On September 18, 1990, Standard sent out a second Notice of
Sale.
[15] On October 15, 1993, Standard wrote to Szasz and Yeates for
the first time demanding payment of $250,000 from each. Yeates
denied liability.
[16] On November 3, 1993, the City of Brantford sent out final
Notice of Sale for unpaid taxes which then totalled $501,340.35.
[17] In March 1994, Standard renewed its claim against the Estate
of PPL. In the result, Standard received $80,059.35 on its claim
for $2,341,012.76.
[18] Standard netted a further $133,287.50 on the sale of the
real estate.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION AT TRIAL</pre>
    <pre>[19] The trial judge summarized the issues before him as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               There are four issues which arise in considering whether
          Szasz and Yeates as guarantors should be liable for payment of
          their obligations under the charge, and if so, whether they have
          any right of indemnity against Schickedanz and Timed.
          </pre>
    <pre>                1.    Was there a material change that,
          without   consent,   would   discharge    the
          sureties?
          </pre>
    <pre>                2.   Should the guarantors be deemed to
          have consented to any material change related
          to  the  Assumption Agreement?  (or,  do  the
          actions    of    the   guarantor   constitute
          constructive consent?)
          </pre>
    <pre>                3.   Was there a novation?
          </pre>
    <pre>                4.    What  is the scope of  rights  to
          indemnity  enjoyed by guarantors  as  against
          mortgage principals who are also jointly  and
          severally liable?</pre>
    <pre>[20] The trial judge concluded that whether Szasz and Yeates were
principal debtors or guarantors, &#147;the addition of another co-
joint debtor is not an immaterial change to the principal
agreement&#148;, rather it &#147;is a substantive change to the mortgage
which has the potential to affect the risk of default, for better
or for worse&#148;. It is a change which is not &#147;necessarily
beneficial&#148;. Accordingly, the question arose whether Szasz and
Yeates consented to the change, either by &#147;pre-consent&#148; or
&#147;constructive consent&#148;.
[21] The trial judge went on to find that there was constructive
consent and that he did not have to decide whether or not there
was pre-consent. He gave the following reasons for these
findings:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Szasz and Yeates executed the Sale Agreement, on behalf of
          PPL, between PPL, Touche as Trustee for PPL, and CIC. The Sale
          Agreement was executed on the same date as the Assumption
          Agreement, between Standard Trust and Schickedanz and Timed.
          When, two days later, the Transfer of Title was registered by
          Touche as Trustee for PPL it was registered in the name of
          Schickedanz and Timed because of their liability for the debt.
          The Transfer was signed by Szasz and Yeates. Without considering
          the commercial motives for structuring the transaction this way,
          it remains clear that the Assumption Agreement and the Sale
          Agreement were different steps in a larger transaction, in which
          all of the named parties in this matter must have been
          participants.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In a case of this kind, where documents
          are  executed by the surety acting in another
          capacity, such as a principal of the  primary
          debtor, then the surety will be taken also to
          have approved of the material alteration.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Roberts J. in Grossman Holdings Ltd. v.
          Barden Investments Ltd. [1997] O.J. No.  4618
          held  that an individual guarantor,  who  was
          also a principal of the company which was the
          principal  debtor and who acted as  solicitor
          for  the company, knew of certain changes  to
          the  contract (an increase in interest  rate)
          and  that he had consented to the changes  by
          his  silence and actions. Master  Funduk,  of
          the  Alberta Court of Queen&#146;s bench, came  to
          the  same conclusion in Royal Bank of  Canada
          v.  338390 Alberta Ltd., [1997] A.J. No. 1000
          (Q.B.) at para 36-37:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     &#133;the overt act of the defendant in
               executing the documentation resulting in the
               changes complained of by them must be taken
               as constructive assent by them as guarantors
               to the changes in question. The defendants
               were not sitting passively on the side while
               the two other parties affected changes to the
               guaranteed   mortgage.   They   actively
               participated&#133; He can hardly divide his mind
               into  breach tight compartments, one  as
               signing officer and one as guarantor.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The execution of the Sale Agreement and
          Transfer  Agreement  by  Szasz  and   Yeates,
          albeit  as  officers of PPL,  must  be  taken
          to constitute approval.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  also note that Szasz and Yeates  had
          specifically   asked  to   be   released   as
          Guarantors when an earlier draft of the  Sale
          Agreement was circulated. The release was not
          incorporated  into  the  text  of  the   Sale
          Agreement,  which they executed. While  I  am
          precluded  by the parole evidence  rule  from
          relying on extraneous evidence of contractual
          intent,  I  may consider the fact that  Szasz
          and  Yeates had notice that Standard took the
          position that they would not be released from
          liability  as  Guarantors  by  the  sale  and
          transfer of financing of the lands.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Because there was constructive  consent
          in  this case, it is not necessary for me  to
          bring to bear the different presumptions that
          may   apply   if   Szasz  and   Yeates   were
          compensated or gratuitous sureties.</pre>
    <pre>[22] The trial judge also rejected the argument of Szasz and
Yeates that there had been novation. In my view, that conclusion
flows inevitably from a term of the Assumption Agreement that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Nothing herein stated shall alter or prejudice the rights,
          remedies and priorities of the Chargee as against the Chargor or
          as against any surety or covenantor named in the Charge or
          elsewhere, or as against any subsequent encumbrancer or other
          person whomsoever interested in the said lands or liable for the
          debt secured by the Charge or any part thereof, all of which
          rights, remedies and priorities are reserved by the Chargee.</pre>
    <pre>[23] As to the right of Szasz and Yeates, in the event they were
found liable, to recover over against Schickedanz and Timed, the
trial judge said simply:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Szasz and Yeates cross claim against Schickedanz and Timed
          for indemnity. They covenanted with Standard Trust under the
          mortgage in the following terms:  &#147;Paul Szasz and Robert
          Yeates&#133;do hereby covenant jointly and severally with the said
          Chargee as principal debtors and not as sureties&#148;. The Supreme
          Court of Canada, in Conlin, supra [Manulife Bank of Canada v.
          Conlin (1996), 139 D.L.R. (4th) 426 S.C.C.] has held that in such
          a case, the covenanters are liable as principal debtors and not
          sureties. There are no restrictions implied or express in the
          Supreme Court&#146;s decision that suggest they are principal debtors
          only with respect to the creditors and not with respect to their
          joint debtors. Accordingly, I find that Szasz and Yeates are
          principal debtors in this case. Consistent with the decision of
          this Court in Re: Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. (1997), 146
          D.L.R. (4th) 382, as principal debtors they are not entitled to
          the rights of contribution and/or indemnity to which they might
          be entitled as sureties, as against the defaulting debtors or
          between themselves. Accordingly, the cross claim is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[24] As noted earlier, I agree with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion
that Szasz and Yeates must be held liable to pay Standard the sum
of $250,000 each. I would put their liability on a somewhat
broader base than he did. For that purpose and in order to
examine more fully their claim over against Schickedanz and
Timed, it is necessary to examine their original position more
closely.



</pre>
    <pre>THE LOAN DOCUMENTS</pre>
    <pre>[25] Four documents are involved:  Standard&#146;s commitment letter
of January 15, 1988 approving the loan (the offer), PPL&#146;s
response of January 25, 1988 purporting to accept Standard&#146;s
offer with certain changes (the counter-offer), the non-merger
agreement between Standard and PPL signed March 1, 1988 and the
charge itself from PPL to Standard, signed March 1, 1988 and
registered March 4, 1988.
[26] These documents are not consistent with one another. The
following matters bear on the nature of the liability of Szasz
and Yeates:</pre>
    <pre>    (a)   Standard&#146;s commitment letter of  January  15,
     1988 sets out its requirements of Szasz and Yeates
     as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                   2.   COVENANTORS
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The personal covenants of Mr. Paul
               Szasz and Robert Yeates.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      The   Borrower  and   Covenantors
               jointly,  severally and  unconditionally
               covenant  and agree to satisfy  all  the
               terms,   conditions,  and   requirements
               herein contained before any advances are
               made. The Borrower and Covenantors shall
               jointly,  severally and  unconditionally
               guarantee   repayment   of   the    loan
               obligations as principal debtors and not
               as sureties.</pre>
    <pre>     (b)   PPL  responded to Standard&#146;s  &#147;offer&#148;  by  a
     &#147;counter  offer&#148; dated January 25, 1988. It  reads
     in part as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                         As discussed with you on Friday, January
               22, 1988, we would accept your offer with the
               following changes:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    1.   COVENANTORS
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Change to read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The personal covenants of Mr. Paul
               Szasz  and  Robert Yeates. The  Borrower
               and  Covenantors jointly, severally  and
               unconditionally covenant  and  agree  to
               satisfy  all  the terms, conditions  and
               requirements herein contained before any
               advances  are  made.  The  Borrower  and
               Covenantors    shall    severally    and
               unconditionally guarantee  repayment  of
               any  deficiency  of the loan  obligation
               limited  to  the  amount of  $250,000.00
               each for a total of $500,000.00
     </pre>
    <pre>     Szasz and Yeates are now guarantors, not principal
     debtors  &#150;  and  their guarantee is  only  to  the
     extent of $250,000 each.
     </pre>
    <pre>     This  letter is not signed by PPL, Szasz or Yeates
     but by R. J. Doucette, Director of Finance.</pre>
    <pre>     (c)   PPL, Standard and Szasz and Yeates  are  all
     parties to the non-merger agreement. Standard  did
     not  sign it. The others all did. It reads in part
     as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               AND  WHEREAS  THE Covenantors  did  each
               guarantee  the repayment of the  sum  of
               $250,000.00 to the Lender for a total of
               $500,000.00
          </pre>
    <pre>                     NOW  THEREFORE the parties  hereto
               agree    that    notwithstanding     the
               registration of the said Charge, and any
               advances  made  pursuant  thereto,   the
               terms and/or conditions of the Letter of
               Commitment  dated January  15,  1988  as
               amended  January 25, 1988 pertaining  to
               this   charge  loan  transaction   shall
               remain  binding  and  effective  on  the
               parties  hereto, and shall not merge  in
               the   said  Charge  nor  in  any   other
               document  executed and/or  delivered  on
               closing   or   any   advance   in   this
               transaction.   In  the  event   of   any
               discrepancy  between the  terms  of  the
               Letter   of  Commitment  and  the   said
               Charge,   it  shall  be  in   the   sole
               discretion  of  the Lender  which  shall
               prevail.
     </pre>
    <pre>     There is no suggestion in the non-merger
     agreement, that Szasz and Yeates are to be
     principal debtors. They are referred to as
     &#147;covenantors&#148; and they guarantee repayment of
     $250,000 each.
     </pre>
    <pre>     The   operative   paragraph  of   the   non-merger
     agreement  provides that the terms and  conditions
     of  the commitment letter of January 15 as amended
     by  the  letter of January 25 shall remain binding
     notwithstanding the terms of the  charge.  In  the
     event  of  discrepancy between the  terms  of  the
     letters   and   the  terms  of  the  charge,   the
     discretion of Standard is to govern.</pre>
    <pre>     (d)  The charge is signed by Szasz as Chairman  of
     the  Board  of  PPL as Chargor and  by  Yeates  as
     Secretary of PPL as well as by Szasz and Yeates as
     Covenantors.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Amongst  the  standard charge  terms  included  is
     s.10.05. It sets out six covenants of the chargor,
     the first of which is that:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    the Chargor will pay the principal sum
          herein&#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>     Szasz  and  Yeates are dealt with in Clause  10.46
     which reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    10.46     COVENANTORS
          </pre>
    <pre>                     PAUL SZASZ and ROBERT YEATES,  the
               Covenantors  named in  this  Charge,  in
               consideration of the Chargee making the said
               loan herein and the sum of One ($1.00) Dollar
               now paid to them by the said Chargee (the
               receipt of which is hereby acknowledged) do
               hereby covenant jointly and severally with
               the said Chargee as principal debtors and not
               as sureties that they will pay and truly
               cause to be paid to the said Chargee the
               principal monies and interest hereby secured
               as and when such monies fall due, all taxes,
               rates and assessments, municipal, local or
               parliamentary and otherwise which now or
               which may hereafter be imposed, charged or
               levied  upon  the  said  lands  and  the
               Covenantors will observe, keep and perform
               the conditions and covenants herein contained
               by and on the part of the said Chargor to be
               kept, performed and observed.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    AND the said Covenantors do further
               covenant  and  agree  to  and  with  the
               Chargee  that  should  default  be  made
               hereunder  so  often  as  the  same  may
               occur,    the   Covenantors    guarantee
               repayment of any deficiency of the  loan
               obligation to the Chargee.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     IT IS FURTHER AGREED that the said
               Chargee  may  at any time or  times  and
               from  time  to time extend or  agree  to
               extend  the time for payment of  any  or
               all the monies secured by this Charge or
               may   refrain  from  enforcing   payment
               thereof  and  may alter  the  terms  and
               times of payment thereof or the rate  or
               time of payment of interest thereon  and
               may  release any part of the said  lands
               or   any  other  person  liable  on  any
               covenant    or   any   other   security,
               collateral  or otherwise,  or  otherwise
               deal  with  this  Charge  and  with  the
               Chargor  in whatsoever manner  that  the
               Chargee shall think proper from time  to
               time  without notice to the  Covenantors
               and   without   the   consent   of   the
               Covenantors  and  notwithstanding  same,
               the   Covenantors  shall  remain   fully
               liable under the foregoing covenants  so
               long as any monies are remaining due  or
               unpaid to the Chargee on this loan.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    THE FOREGOING SHALL BE BINDING UPON
               THE  Covenantors their heirs, executors,
               administrators, and permitted assigns.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     NOTWITHSTANDING the  generally  of
               the  foregoing the maximum liability  of
               each of the Covenantors pursuant to this
               paragraph 10.46 shall be as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               PAUL SZASZ     -    $250,000.00
          </pre>
    <pre>               ROBERT YEATES  -    $250,000.00
          </pre>
    <pre>               Being a total liability of $500,000.00.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Here  Szasz  and  Yeates  are  described   as
     principal debtors contrary to the arrangement
     made  by the letter of January 25, 1988. They
     also   agree  to  guarantee;  this  was   the
     obligation agreed to.</pre>
    <pre>[27] These ambiguities are reflected in the Notices of Sale
issued by Standard. The first, dated March 13, 1989 refers to
Szasz and Yeates as &#147;covenantors&#148;. The second, dated September
18, 1990 refers to them as &#147;guarantors&#148;.
[28] It is not clear that these discrepancies and particularly
the one last mentioned were ever raised or brought to the
attention of the parties. Presumably, had they been raised,
Standard would have exercised its discretion to deal with Szasz
and Yeates as principal debtors. As between Szasz and Yeates on
the one hand and Schickedanz and Timed on the other, however,
that discretion was not available to be exercised.</pre>
    <pre>ISSUES ON APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[29] Szasz and Yeates appeal in two respects:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  against the trial judge&#146;s finding that they
          constructively consented to a material change in the contract
          performance of which they guaranteed, that change being the
          addition of Schickedanz and Timed as debtors; and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)   against the trial judge&#146;s finding
          that  Szasz  and  Yeates  having  been  found
          liable  to Standard for $250,000 each, cannot
          look    to   Schickedanz   and   Timed    for
          indemnification.</pre>
    <pre>[30] In my view, there is an issue preliminary to (a) above,
namely, was the trial judge correct in finding that Szasz and
Yeates would, but for their constructive consent, be relieved of
liability?  Standard raises this point in its factum, arguing
that the assumption of the mortgage by Schickedanz and Timed was
not a material or prejudicial alteration of the principal
contract and that Szasz and Yeates would not have been released
by such alteration.
[31] In deciding that the addition of Schickedanz and Timed as
debtors constituted a &#147;material change&#148;, the trial judge began
with a reference to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce v. Pax
Management Ltd. [1992] 2 S.C.R. 998 per Iacobucci J. at p.1019 as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               First, that the guarantor has undertaken a particular risk
          and should not have a materially different risk imposed upon him
          or her by the variation or breach of terms of the principal
          contract. In such situations, since it should be left to the
          surety to decide whether to continue as a surety and bear the new
          risk, he or she is entitled to be discharged absolutely if his or
          her consent was not obtained.</pre>
    <pre>[32] Later the trial judge referred again to Pax, supra at p.1020
for the proposition that if the assumption agreement is
considered an alteration in the principal agreement, rather than
a collateral agreement as argued by Standard, then the guarantees
would not be released if the changes in question were either
immaterial or were necessarily beneficial.
[33] The authority in this regard is Gardner v. Walsh (1855), 5
E. L. &amp; B. L. 83. In that case, a promissory note was made in
favour of merchants by Elizabeth Barton and another. Later, the
name of Alice Clarke was added. There was disagreement as to
whether it was part of the arrangement to have Clarke sign as
well. The jury found for Barton.
[34] On appeal, a new trial was directed. In the course of the
discussion, Lord Campbell C.J. said at p. 91:
          </pre>
    <pre>               But we must consider that a joint and several promissory
          note, although it contains two promises in the alternative, is
          one contract and one instrument, and that, if it is designedly
          altered in any part by the payee so as to alter the liability of
          the makers, it is entirely vitiated.</pre>
    <pre>[35] After reviewing Gardner, supra, the trial judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is my view that the law relating to the discharge of
          sureties is not as narrow as Standard Trust suggests. The policy
          concern is clearly that sureties should not be exposed to risks
          to which they did not agree. But a surety is not required to
          prove that the change was or would be prejudicial in order to be
          discharged. Instead, as the court held in Pax Management, supra:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     it now seems fairly clear that  an
               alteration of the principal contract which
               clearly is not material to the surety&#146;s risk
               and which therefore cannot prejudice the
               surety, or a departure from the terms of the
               principal  contract which is necessarily
               beneficial to the surety will not relieve the
               surety from liability (at 1020).
          </pre>
    <pre>                It  seems  clear that the  addition  of
          another   co-joint   debtor   is    not    an
          immaterial    change   to    the    principal
          agreement,  as  would  be  filling   in   the
          place   that   a  contract  is   signed,   or
          correcting  the  date  of  signing.  Addition
          of    another   debtor   is   a   substantive
          change   to  the  mortgage  which   has   the
          potential  to  affect the  risk  of  default,
          for  better  or  for worse. The  addition  of
          another  debtor  to  be  jointly  responsible
          for  paying  a  mortgage  with  the  original
          mortgagor   is   a   good  example   of   the
          difference   between   a   change   to    the
          principal    agreement    which    is     not
          necessarily    prejudicial,    as    distinct
          from   a   change   which   is   &#145;necessarily
          beneficial&#146;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Although adding a debtor to a  mortgage
          held by a company which is struggling to make
          its payments appears to be beneficial to that
          company,  it is still not the prerogative  of
          the   financial   institution   holding   the
          mortgage  to  make such a change without  the
          consent  of  the  guarantor.  What   if   the
          guarantor(s) had been engaged in a course  of
          negotiation   with   a  different   potential
          debtor,  whom  they regarded as somehow  more
          credit-worthy?   In such a case,  it  is  not
          farfetched  to  say  that a  guarantor  would
          consider  the  alteration  to  the  principal
          contract   to  be  prejudicial.   The   steps
          required for the lender to avoid discharge of
          the  guarantor and protect its interests  are
          simple  ones. It must merely seek the consent
          of  the  guarantors to any change.  In  these
          circumstances,  it  is  not  unreasonable  to
          refuse  to narrow the protection that current
          Supreme   Court   authority   offers   to   a
          guarantor,  that  is, relief  from  liability
          where  there is an alteration to the contract
          that  is not &#147;necessarily beneficial&#148; to  the
          guarantor.  When there exists a risk  that  a
          material change might not be to the advantage
          of  the  guarantor, that risk must be assumed
          by the lender who is best positioned to avoid
          it by seeking consent of the surety.</pre>
    <pre>[36] With respect, I disagree with the conclusion reached by the
trial judge. The possibility that the guarantor might have been
engaged in negotiations with a different potential debtor is,
with respect, irrelevant. In any event, no prospective
covenantors were turned down in favour of Schickedanz and Timed.
[37] The assumption agreement expressly provided that nothing in
it altered the rights of Standard as against PPL, Szasz or
Yeates. The acquisition of an additional debtor by Standard could
not, and did not, prejudice Szasz or Yeates. On the contrary,
Schickedanz and Timed contributed substantially to the value of
the property ($400,000) before they too defaulted. In addition,
they reduced the amount outstanding on the mortgage by
$116,340.41. There is no evidence which suggests that Standard,
Szasz or Yeates would have been better off had the property not
been sold to Schickedanz and Timed.
[38] Szasz and Yeates knew that they remained responsible to
Standard. When it was proposed on the sale to Schickedanz and
Timed that Szasz and Yeates be released, Schickedanz and Timed
made it clear that that was not to be. Notwithstanding this,
Szasz and Yeates cooperated in the sale to  Schickedanz and
Timed.
[39] In my respectful view, Gardner has no application to the
instant case. Nothing occurred to increase the risk or liability
of Szasz and Yeates.
[40] In the Law of Guarantee by Kevin Patrick McGuinness,
Carswell (2nd ed. 1996) at p. 535, it is stated with respect to
Gardner that &#147;It is doubtful such a case would be so decided
today&#148;. Whether or not that is true, it is difficult to regard
Gardner as persuasive in the context of the instant case. Gardner
involved a bill of exchange; it would now be governed by the
Bills of Exchange Act. The instant case involves a commercial
loan. Nothing occurred during its course, apart from the sudden
drop in the value of the real estate, that could not or should
not have been anticipated by all parties. In particular, apart
from declining real estate values, Szasz and Yeates suffered no
prejudice whatever.
[41] Quite apart from the assumption agreement, Standard acquired
rights against Schickedanz and Timed through the operation of
s.20 of the Mortgages Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.M-40. It is not
suggested that the operation of s.20 had any impact on the
contingent liability of Szasz and Yeates to Standard. In my view,
the sale to Schickedanz and Timed and their entering into the
assumption agreement had no such impact either.
[42] Accordingly, it is my view that there was no material change
to the loan agreement and that as a result, Szasz and Yeates are
liable to Standard in the amount of $250,000 each.</pre>
    <pre>CAN SZASZ AND YEATES LOOK TO SCHICKEDANZ AND TIMED FOR
INDEMNIFICATION?</pre>
    <pre>[43] In concluding that Szasz and Yeates cannot look to
Schickedanz and Timed for indemnification, the trial judge noted
that:  &#147;The Supreme Court of Canada, in Conlin, supra has held
that in such a case, [Conlin and his company covenanted jointly
and severally, as principal debtors and not as sureties], the
covenantors are liable as principal debtors and not as sureties&#148;.
The trial judge went on to state that:  &#147;There are no
restrictions implied or express in the Supreme Court&#146;s decision
that suggest they are principal debtors only with respect to the
creditors and not with respect to their joint debtors&#148;.
[44] That is true but it is not apparent from the report in
Conlin that there was any claim by Conlin against any other
person for indemnity which would make such &#147;restrictions&#148;
relevant. There is in the instant case. Nor does Conlin have the
same factual foundation as the instant case. There is no
suggestion in Conlin, as there is in the letter of January 25,
that the covenantors were essentially guarantors. Nor is there
any parallel in Conlin for the provision in the non-merger
agreement giving Standard the discretion to treat Szasz and
Yeates as principal debtors or guarantors as Standard saw fit.
[45] In dismissing the claim over of Szasz and Yeates against
Schickedanz and Timed, the trial judge also relied on the
decision of this court in Re: Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd.
(1997) 146 D.L.R. (4th) 382 for the proposition that, as
principal debtors, Szasz and Yeates &#147;are not entitled to the
rights of contribution and/or indemnity to which they might be
entitled as sureties, as against the defaulting debtors or
between themselves&#148;. In Olympia &amp; York, the issues involved only
the lender and the guarantors, the latter having agreed to be
regarded as principal debtors. That is not the situation in the
instant case; the issue here is between the guarantors and a
subsequent purchaser of the property.
[46] In Olympia &amp; York, Brooke J.A. speaking for the court said
at [1998] O.J. 3482, para [13]:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Furthermore, the principal debtor clause is different than
          the one found in the case dealt with by Cory J. [Conlin]  In that
          case, the appellants expressly covenanted to pay as principal
          debtors. In this case, the guarantor is deemed to be a principal
          debtor, but for a limited purpose &#150; the performance of its
          obligations. It is as though there is another or additional
          character, which is the deemed one. In these circumstances,
          particularly if there is any ambiguity, the clause should be
          interpreted so as to be most consistent with the substance of the
          agreement and the respective characters of the parties. If this
          approach is followed, then Resources&#146; characterization as
          principal debtor &#150; for the purpose of performance of its
          obligations &#150; is merely to ensure performance may be enforced and
          that Resources would have no defence available to it as
          guarantor, just as is provided in the sentence following the
          principal debtor clause.</pre>
    <pre>[47] That, on the evidence, is the situation here. In their
dealings with Standard, Szasz and Yeates are either principal
debtors or guarantors, in the discretion of Standard. Beyond
those dealings, however, what is the intention of the parties as
to the status of Szasz and Yeates?  In my opinion, as between PPL
and Szasz and Yeates, the latter are guarantors. The charge
refers to PPL as the &#147;chargor&#148;. All the other relevant documents,
the offer of January 15, the counter-offer of January 25 and the
non-merger agreement refer to PPL as the &#147;borrower&#148;. The counter
offer and the non-merger agreement refer to Szasz and Yeates as
&#147;guarantors&#148;. Szasz and Yeates are only principal debtors at the
request of and for the purposes of Standard.
[48] The exercise of discretion is limited to Standard; it is not
extended to PPL. As between PPL on the one hand and Szasz and
Yeates on the other, the latter surely are guarantors, and if
required to respond to a demand by Standard, they could have
sought, and if available, recovered indemnification from PPL.
[49] As noted in Bank of Montreal v. Negin et al (1996) 31 O.R.
(3d) 321 (C.A.) at p. 324, the split relationship, principal
debtor vis-à-vis the lender and guarantor vis-à-vis the borrower,
was express. In the instant case, the split relationship is
largely implicit.
[50] What then is the relationship between Szasz and Yeates and
Schickedanz and Timed?  When Timed was dealing with Standard with
a view to assuming the mortgage, it advised Standard that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Our [Timed and Schickedanz] offer is to assume the mortgage
          and to guarantee corporately this mortgage by these two
          corporations and that Standard Trust should leave the personal
          guarantees of the present guarantors [Szasz and Yeates] on title
          for the remainder of the term.</pre>
    <pre>[51] That is what happened; the liabilities of Szasz and Yeates
remained on title. Schickedanz and Timed recognized that Szasz
and Yeates were obligated as guarantors, rather than as primary
debtors.
[52] It also appears from the excerpt of Timed&#146;s letter to
Standard set out in paragraph 50, that Schickedanz and Timed
chose to have Szasz and Yeates remain in the picture as
guarantors.
[53] The assumption agreement between Schickedanz and Timed and
Standard is set out earlier in these reasons; it records a
transaction between Schickedanz and Timed and Standard. The
result of the transaction was that Schickedanz and Timed acquired
the real estate and in return, to all intents and purpose, added
themselves to the charge both as chargors and as assignors of
rents. Schickedanz and Timed thus became primary debtors along
with PPL.
[54] Szasz and Yeates were already guarantors of PPL. When
Schickedanz and Timed also became primary debtors, Szasz and
Yeates became their guarantors in effect as well, by reason of
the juxtaposition of their respective liabilities. Accordingly,
if called upon by Standard, Szasz and Yeates should not only be
able to look to PPL for indemnity, but to the parties who took
the real estate and assumed the mortgage, namely, Schickedanz and
Timed. Baxter, Law of Banking (4th ed. 1992) at p.129:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This right of indemnity does not rest on contract, since
          there is no privity between the debtor and surety, but to achieve
          justice, the court will imply an obligation on the debtor to make
          restitution to the surety in respect of his having paid the debt.</pre>
    <pre>[55] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal of Szasz and Yeates
with respect to their liability to Standard, with costs. I would
allow the appeal of Szasz and Yeates as against Schickedanz and
Timed, set aside the order below and in its place grant an order
that Schickedanz and Timed indemnify Szasz and Yeates to the
extent of any recovery by Standard against Szasz and Yeates. I
would also order that Schickedanz and Timed pay to Szasz and
Yeates their costs of this appeal and of the proceedings below.</pre>
