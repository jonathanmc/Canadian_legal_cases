    <pre>HEARD:         May 21, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Mandel,
dated November 13, 1996 made at Toronto, Ontario.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant seeks to set aside the damage award  on  the
counterclaim.  The trial judge granted judgment in the amount  of
$450,000 as damages for the appellant&#146;s breach of contract.   The
finding  of breach is in a single sentence in the reasons stating
that  the appellant &#147;improperly and without cause&#148; withdrew  from
the contract in May, 1992.  Implicitly the trial judge was of the
view  that the appellant had a contractual obligation to actively
sell the software system, regardless of its quality.
[2]  It is difficult to find a basis in either the pleadings or
the contract itself for this complaint and finding, but, putting
that issue aside, the critical flaw in the trial judge&#146;s
reasoning is that there is no evidence to support a damage claim
flowing from this breach.
[3]  The plaintiff (appellant) at trial attempted to establish
that the defendant (respondent) breached the contract by failing
to deliver a saleable product by a particular date.  In pursuing
that claim the plaintiff called an expert to show what would have
been earned if the competitive product had been marketed when it
was supposed to be available.  The parties agreed that the
software that was developed was not commercially competitive and
there was no evidence as to whether such a product could be
created, and, if so, when and at what cost.
[4]  When the trial judge found that it was the plaintiff who
breached the contract he used the plaintiff&#146;s expert evidence to
calculate a $450,000 loss of expected profits to the defendant.
The defendant called no evidence as to its loss, and if it had
done so, it could not have been premised, as was that of the
plaintiff, on the hypothetical of a competitive product, because
its allegation was abandonment, not delivery by a certain date.
[5]  The defendant, pursuing a complaint that the plaintiff
abandoned the project, would have to establish at least:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  that a competitive product could be achieved;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  what expenses would have to be
               incurred to accomplish that end;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  that it could not be achieved without
               the plaintiff&#146;s co-operation;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)  how many months or years it would take to create the
               product;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (e)  what the market conditions would be at that time; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (f)  the likely level of sales had the appellant actively
               marketed the product.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   This is very different from the evidence of the plaintiff&#146;s
expert  who  was  asked  to  assume a competitive  product  on  a
particular  date  and to assess the market loss from  failure  to
deliver.   The  plaintiff  failed  to  establish  its  claim   of
entitlement  and its expert&#146;s evidence thereby became  irrelevant
in the proceedings.
[7]  We therefore conclude that the trial judge erred in basing
his award of damages to the defendant on the evidence produced by
the plaintiff of its alleged damages.
[8]  The respondent called no evidence as to its damages and
this, together with the frailty of the pleadings and the words of
the contract to support the breach found by the trial judge,
leads us to the conclusion that the respondent should not be
given a second chance through a new trial.  The counterclaim
should be dismissed for want of proof of damages.
[9]  The trial judge awarded  costs to the respondent of
$100,000.  We make the rather arbitrary assessment that 2/3 of
the trial was devoted to the claim and 1/3 to the counterclaim.
On that basis the defendant is entitled at trial to 2/3 of the
total, offset by the plaintiff&#146;s entitlement to 1/3, for a total
cost assessment to the defendant of $33,000 (rounded).
[10] The costs of the appeal are to the appellant and the
judgment below will be varied in accordance with these reasons.</pre>
