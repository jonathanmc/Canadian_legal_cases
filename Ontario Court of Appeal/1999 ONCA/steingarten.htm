COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            LINDA STEINGARTEN, IN TRUST (Plaintiff /
               Respondent) and LEONARD STEINGARTEN, EXECUTOR OF
               THE ESTATE OF THE LATE EARL MORTON STEINGARTEN
               (Defendant / Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON and WEILER JJ.A. and MacPHERSON J. (ad
hoc)</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       P. Lepsoe, for the appellant
               E. Appotive, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 10, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Kealey J., dated June 17, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant is not the trustee of the fund in question. He
is the executor of the estate of the settlor. The trustee of the
fund is the wife of the settlor and the mother of the two
children who are the beneficiaries of the trust fund. They in
turn are 25 and 21 years of age respectively.
[2]  The matter of the accounting between the trustee and her
children has been carried on under the aegis of the court, in
particular, by the judge in appeal. In his reasons for judgment,
he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The within application for contempt, or an order directing
          the respondent to provide the accounting required by an earlier
          Court Order came before me on November 29, 1996. I ordered that
          Linda Steingarten, the trustee, provide a professional account of
          the funds in question on or before January 30, 1997. Since then,
          the matter has been before me on a number of occasions. Despite
          my directions, Ms. Steingarten&#146;s efforts to account, technically,
          do not comply with the requirements of the Order.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Presently, given the passage of
          time and her record keeping, the respondent
          cannot provide the appropriate accounting,
          despite efforts to do so with at least one
          chartered accountant. On reviewing the
          financial information provided and hearing
          the submissions of Ms. Steingarten, it seems
          clear that the money in question was expended
          directly or indirectly for the benefit of the
          boys.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In my view, this matter has
          developed into a &#147;serious family squabble&#148;
          and the interests of justice would not be
          served by finding the respondent in contempt.
          Indeed, based on the facts herein related in
          my opinion no contempt has been established.
          As such, the applications motion is
          dismissed. Further, given the history of the
          matter, the efforts to account and the
          information provided, and especially because
          of the family overtones, I make no order as
          to costs.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[3]  We find no error on the part of the judge below. The appeal
is dismissed.
[4]  We heard submissions as to the question of costs. In our
opinion, this appeal should never have been proceeded with and it
would be unfair to have the executor appellant recoup any of his
legal costs out of either the estate of which he is executor or
the funds which are subject to the trust. The appellant was put
on notice by one of the beneficiaries and by the respondent
trustee that costs would be an issue if this appeal proceeded.
Additionally, during a pre-hearing conference call, Osborne J.A.
of this court made clear that the executors should expect to have
this issue raised in the event the appeal was dismissed.
[5]  In our view, the appeal should be dismissed with costs
payable on a party and party basis to the respondent and to the
beneficiary Evan Steingarten by Leonard Steingarten personally.
