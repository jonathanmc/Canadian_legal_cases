    <pre>On appeal from the order of Wright J. dated August 5, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  The plaintiff appeals the decision of the Honourable Mr.
Justice Wright dismissing this action for delay.
[2]  The defendants moved to dismiss for delay.  Master Peppiatt
found that there was serious delay for which no explanation was
given and that, although there was not satisfactory evidence of
prejudice, a presumption of such arose from the length of the
delay and the passage of the limitation period.  He would have
granted the relief requested but for the fact that the defendant
was &#147;in default&#148; within the meaning of rule 24.01,not having
delivered an affidavit of documents.  Susin v. Harper (1992), 9
C.P.C. (3d) 135 (Ont. C.A.)
[3]  Mr. Justice Wright distinguished Susin upon its facts.  The
defendant here had sent to the plaintiff a draft affidavit of
documents in December, 1992, and had advised that a sworn copy
would be delivered on the examination for discovery and that in
the meantime copies of the documents would be provided on
request.  Although examinations for discovery have still not
taken place, they were discussed on a number of occasions
commencing in October 1991.  They were actually scheduled on
several occasions in 1992, 1993 and 1994.  Copies of some of the
documents listed in the draft affidavit were requested and
supplied.
[4]  Wright J. concluded that in these circumstances the
defendant was not in default. In our view, the defendant is in
default but only technically so.  It has substantially complied
with rule 30.03.  The objective of the rule, namely informing the
plaintiff, has been accomplished.  In these circumstances, we see
nothing to be achieved by insisting on an overly technical
compliance with the rule.  In Susin, the defendant had made no
attempt to comply with the rule.
[5]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.  We cannot
leave this case, however, without remarking that although the
same firm has acted for the plaintiff since 1989, counsel who
appeared on this matter today was unable to offer us any
explanation for the delay.
