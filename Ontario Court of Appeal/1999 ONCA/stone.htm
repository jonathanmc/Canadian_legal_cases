</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgments of McKenzie J. dated June 29, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  At the conclusion of the appellant's argument the court
dismissed this appeal but, in the circumstances, without costs.
We indicated that brief reasons for this disposition would
follow.  These are those reasons.
[2]  The appellant commenced this action pursuant to the Class
Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c. 6.  She alleged that she and
the other members of the proposed class suffered serious personal
injuries from exposure to toxic emissions from hazardous waste
allegedly lying below the city of Guelph.
[3]  Following the delivery of their statements of defence, each
respondent moved under Rule 20 to dismiss the action as against
it because of, inter alia, the limitation period contained in the
Public Authorities Protection Act.  When these motions were
heard, the plaintiff had not yet brought a motion for
certification but sought to adjourn these motions save for the
question of whether the motions could be brought at this stage,
prior to certification.
[4]  The motions judge, McKenzie J., declined to adjourn the
motions or to limit the argument.  Rather, he found the
appellant's claim as an individual to be statute barred as
against both respondents.  As a result, he dismissed the action
as against them both, but without prejudice to the parties,
including those persons described in the statement of claim as
putative class members.
[5]  The appellant raised only two issues on appeal.
[6]  First, it was argued that, at least at this stage of the
proceedings, prior to a motion for certification, an action
brought pursuant to the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 cannot be
dismissed solely on grounds personal to the representative
plaintiff.
[7]  We disagree.
[8]  Section 35 of the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 says: &quot;The
rules of court apply to class proceedings.&quot;.  Hence, the rules
apply to an action such as this as they do to any action.
Rule 20 permits these motions to be brought after the delivery of
the statements of defence.  That is precisely what happened here.
[9]  Moreover, the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 contemplates that
the claims of the class members raise common issues (s. 51(c))
and that the representative plaintiff who commences the action is
a member of the class (s. 2(1)).
[10] Where a representative plaintiff, for reasons personal to
that plaintiff, is definitively shown as having no claim because
of the expiry of a limitation period, he or she cannot be said to
be a member of the proposed class.  The continuation of the
action in those circumstances would be inconsistent with the
clear legislative requirement that the representative plaintiff
be anchored in the proceeding as a class member, not simply a
nominee with no stake in the potential outcome.
[11] For both these reasons we conclude that there is no bar to
the bringing of these motions, even at the pre-certification
stage of the proceedings.
[12] Second, the appellant argues that the motions judge erred in
refusing the request for an adjournment.  Again, we disagree.
The decision was an exercise of judicial discretion and we see no
error in principle that would justify our intervention.
[13] The appeal is therefore dismissed, but without costs.</pre></td>
