    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an application for release pending appeal following
the applicant&#146;s conviction on several sexual offences involving
two of his young cousins.  The applicant was sentenced to 34-½
months' imprisonment on April 14, 1998 and thus has been serving
this sentence for over one year.  The transcript has now been
prepared but the appeal has not been perfected.  The Crown
opposes the applicant&#146;s release on public interest grounds.
[2]  In R. v. Farinacci (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.) at
p. 48, Arbour J.A. explained the application of the public
interest criterion as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The &quot;public interest&quot; criterion in s. 679(3)(c) of the Code
          requires a judicial assessment of the need to review the
          conviction leading to imprisonment, in which case execution of
          the sentence may have to be temporarily suspended, and the need
          to respect the general rule of immediate enforceability of
          judgments.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Public confidence in the administration
          of justice requires that judgments be
          enforced. The public interest may require
          that a person convicted of a very serious
          offence, particularly a repeat offender who
          is advancing grounds of appeal that are
          arguable but weak, be denied bail. In such a
          case, the grounds favouring enforceability
          need not yield to the grounds favouring
          reviewability.
          </pre>
    <pre>               On the other hand, public confidence in
          the administration of justice requires that
          judgments be reviewed and that errors, if
          any, be corrected. This is particularly so in
          the criminal field where liberty is at stake.
          Public confidence would be shaken, in my
          view, if a youthful first offender, sentenced
          to a few months' imprisonment for a property
          offence, was compelled to serve his or her
          entire sentence before having an opportunity
          to challenge the conviction on appeal.
          Assuming that the requirements of s.
          679(3)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Code are
          met, entitlement to bail is strongest when
          denial of bail would render the appeal
          nugatory, for all practical purposes. This
          same principle animates the civil law dealing
          with stays of judgments and orders pending
          appeal. It is a principle which vindicates
          the value of reviewability.  [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In the emphasized portion, Arbour J.A. has delineated the
two extremes on the continuum that a court may face on an
application for bail pending appeal.  Most applications fall
somewhere along this continuum.  The stronger the grounds of
appeal and the shorter the sentence, the more likely that the
release will not be contrary to the public interest because the
value of reviewability takes precedence over the interest in
immediate enforceability.
[4]  This application presents a somewhat unusual problem.  The
applicant has delayed bringing his application until the
transcript was available.  In the result, the applicant has been
incarcerated for fourteen months.  He may soon be eligible for
parole, if he is not already so eligible.  As a result, to grant
release at this stage can only marginally advance the interest in
reviewability.  As well, since the transcript is prepared there
is no reason why this appeal cannot be heard within a relatively
short time, perhaps during the summer sittings of this court.
[5]  On the other hand, I have carefully reviewed the portions of
the transcript that have been placed before me.  It is not my
function to finally determine the merits of the appeal, but
merely to make a preliminary assessment.  The Crown concedes that
the appeal is not frivolous.  In my view, the grounds of appeal
concerning the ruling under s. 715.1 of the Criminal Code and the
admission of the note are strong grounds of appeal.  While those
grounds relate only to one of the complainants, there is much to
the argument of applicant&#146;s counsel that an error affecting one
complainant would affect the conviction with respect to the other
complainant because of the similar fact ruling.
[6]  Counsel for the Crown has pointed out certain features of
this case that he argues suggest that the applicant&#146;s release
would undermine public confidence in the administration of
justice.  He points out that one of the very serious incidents
occurred at a time when the applicant knew that he was under
investigation.  He also points out that the applicant was
unresponsive to probation and has done little by way of
rehabilitation while serving his sentence.
[7]  On the other hand, the applicant was released on an
undertaking prior to trial and for some two years was in the
community without incident.  I do not think it right to attribute
to the applicant what appears to be misbehaviour by some of the
applicant&#146;s family in the course of the trial.  I take the
Crown&#146;s point that two of the proposed sureties were specifically
referred to by the trial judge in her warning but it appears that
this conduct stopped once the trial judge warned the family
members.  I also do not think it is fair to hold the applicant in
custody because, of necessity, he will have to return to a small
and apparently deeply divided community.  To attribute undue
weight to that factor would unfairly disadvantage first nations
and other persons living in small rural communities.
[8]  The applicant is 25 years of age.  He had no record at the
time these offences were committed.  He suffers from severe
environmental allergies and bronchial asthma.  He proposes to
live at home with his mother and not leave his residence except
in the company of his mother or one of his sureties.
[9]  On balance, it is my view that the interest in reviewability
outweighs the value of enforceability.  The application for
release pending appeal is granted in terms of the attached draft
order.  This is an appropriate case to expedite the hearing of
the appeal.  To that end, the applicant is to perfect the appeal
by June 26, 1999.</pre></td>
