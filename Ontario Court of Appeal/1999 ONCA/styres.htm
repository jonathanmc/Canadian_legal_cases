    <pre>HEARD:         September 22, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Edward R. Browne dated
December 16, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This application was brought pursuant to s. 24(5) of the
Tobacco Tax Act (the &quot;Act&quot;).  The primary issue was whether the
applicant was the owner of the tobacco within the meaning of the
Act.  The motions judge never addressed this issue and made no
finding of ownership.
[2]  Throughout the period of time on September 30, 1998 during
which the vehicle was stopped and the tobacco was seized, nothing
was said or produced that would indicate that the applicant was
the owner of the tobacco.  The invoices that were produced
demonstrated that the tobacco had been sold by &quot;Allind
Distributors Ltd./Harper's Wholesale Division&quot; to &quot;Herman Styres
c/o Styres Lumber &amp; Building Material&quot;.  The circumstances
surrounding the seizure of the tobacco were suspicious.
[3]  It would appear from the record that the first indication of
a claim of ownership by the applicant is contained in the Notice
of Application dated October 29, 1998, approximately two months
after the date on which the tobacco was seized.
[4]  The Crown has always contested the issue of ownership.
[5]  In the circumstances, it was incumbent upon the applicant to
bring cogent evidence of ownership.  There is nothing from the
indicated seller or buyer according to the invoices produced.
There is nothing but the bald statement of the applicant, which
is not in any way corroborated, that he is the owner of the
tobacco and which is contrary to the documentary evidence.
[6]  In our view, the evidentiary burden required to establish
ownership of the tobacco in these circumstances has not been met.
[7]  The appeal is allowed, the order of Browne J. is set aside,
and the application is dismissed with costs fixed at $2,500.  We
can find no basis for any other order on this record.</pre></td>
