    <pre>                         On appeal from the judgment of Lederman
J., dated February 27, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Duca Community Credit Union, appeals from the
judgment of Lederman J. dated February 27, 1998 (reported at 38
O.R. (3d) 429 (Gen. Div.)). Lederman J. held that the respondents
were entitled to receive the sum of $662,274.04 plus all interest
accrued thereon. This sum was the net proceeds of the sale by the
appellant to Joseph Brant Memorial Hospital (&#147;Brant Hospital&#148;) of
whatever interest the appellant had in a licence to operate 48
nursing home beds at the Durham Nursing Home.</pre>
    <pre>     Overview of the facts as found by the applications judge</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Hugh J. MacLean (&#147;MacLean&#148;) controlled SRNHL, which owned
and operated the Durham Nursing Home. The Director of the
Ministry of Health licensed SRNHL, under s.4 of the Nursing Homes
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.N.7, as amended, to operate the Durham
Nursing Home.
[3]  In February 1990, the appellant loaned $1,000,000 to
MacLean. The $1,000,000 advance was secured by a first
charge/mortgage on MacLean&#146;s land, upon which was situated the
Durham Nursing Home.  The mortgage was dated February 5, 1990 and
registered on February 9, 1990.  It was guaranteed by SRNHL, but
no security was requested nor provided to secure the guarantee.
The appellant concedes that it did not request nor obtain any
special security interest in the Durham Nursing Home licence
because it was under the impression that no such security was
obtainable as a matter of industry practice.
[4]  MacLean started having serious financial difficulties.  In
March 1992, Central Guaranty Trust Company (&#147;Central Guarantee&#148;)
moved before the Ontario Court (General Division) to have Coopers
&amp; Lybrand appointed receiver and manager of certain assets of
MacLean, MacLean&#146;s spouse and SRNHL. The appellant did not appear
to be aware of the receivership proceedings, nor the subsequent
orders. The orders did not affect any interest of the appellant
in respect of its mortgage and rights thereunder nor, directly,
the guarantee of SRNHL.
[5]  The respondents are the successors in title to the security
held by Central Guarantee authorising the appointment of the
receiver and manager.  That security consisted of two security
agreements between Central Guarantee (as secured party) and SRNHL
(as debtor) both of which were dated January 28, 1991.  In the
first, a General Security Agreement granted Central Guarantee a
continuing security interest in all licenses issued to SRNHL
(irrespective of whether SRNHL had a property therein) including
any nursing home licenses issued under the Nursing Homes Act.
The second security agreement granted Central Guarantee a
continuing security interest in the Durham Nursing Home licence
specifically. Central Guarantee&#146;s security interests (which were
later assigned to the respondents) were properly perfected by
registration under the Personal Property Security Act, R.S.O.
1990, c.P.10, as amended (&#147;P.P.S.A.&#148;).
[6]  During the summer of 1995, MacLean&#146;s mortgage to the
appellant went into default, and thereafter remained in default.
MacLean allowed the appellant to send a monitor to attend at the
Durham Nursing Home. The monitor reported that, in his view, the
best course of action was liquidation. The monitor further
reported that his information was that the Ministry was either
going to stop funding the facility entirely, dramatically reduce
funding, or take steps to recover funds already paid.
[7]  On September 14, 1995, the Ministry met with the appellant
and advised that SRNHL had received an overpayment of between
$250,000 and $400,000 on payments relating to its nursing home
license. The Ministry also advised the appellant that the
employees of the Durham Nursing Home were owed approximately
$32,000 and were prepared to stop work. The Ministry had a
concern about the safety of the residents and was prepared to
cancel the Durham Nursing Home licence and take over the
operation of the home. The appellant was apprehensive that it
would lose its security unless it made a deal with the Ministry.
[8]  The Ministry was unable to realise any proceeds from the
licence covering the Durham Nursing Home with which to satisfy
the indebtedness of SRNHL to the Ministry.  The Ministry was
therefore prepared to refrain from cancelling the license if the
appellant would introduce a purchaser to whom the Ministry could
grant a licence in substitution for the licence covering the
Durham Nursing Home. In return, the appellant was to agree to
share the proceeds of the sale with the Ministry. The Ministry
and the appellant entered into an agreement, the relevant terms
of which are:
          </pre>
    <pre>1.      The appellant would advance approximately $32,000 to fund
        the Durham Nursing Home;
2.      the Ministry would not revoke the present license;
3.      the appellant would attempt to sell the current licence as
	soon as possible; and
4.      upon disposition of the license, the appellant would share
	the proceeds with the Ministry in accordance with a negotiated
	formula.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[9]  The respondents were not represented at the meeting nor were
they involved in the negotiation of the agreement with the
Ministry.  Additionally, despite the fact that Central Guarantee
had registered security interests against SRNHL under the
P.P.S.A. at the time of this agreement, neither the appellant nor
the Ministry contacted it or its successors.
[10] The agreement between the Ministry and the appellant was
implemented. On September 15, 1995, the appellant advanced
sufficient funds to meet SRNHL&#146;s payroll deficiency and entered
into an Operating Loan Agreement and a General Security Agreement
with SRNHL. The General Security Agreement given by SRNHL to the
appellant provided for the grant by SRNHL of a security interest
in SRNHL&#146;s assets, including the Durham Nursing Home license. On
September 18, 1995, the appellant registered a Financing
Statement against SRNHL (to reflect the General Security
Agreement) by which it perfected its security interest in the
Durham Nursing Home license.
[11] By letter dated October 11, 1995, the predecessor to the
respondents informed the appellant that, as of January 29, 1991,
it had a perfected security interest in the Durham Nursing Home
license, which ranked in priority to any other security interest
in this collateral.
[12] In December 1995, a meeting was held between representatives
of the appellant and the respondents, whereby it was agreed that
the appellant would proceed to carry out its agreement with the
Ministry and the net proceeds of the transaction would be held in
trust pending termination of these proceedings.
[13] The appellant succeeded in finding a buyer. On June 13,
1996, it entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with the
Brant Hospital. The agreement provided that the appellant would
sell to Brant Hospital the &#147;Assets&#148; for a purchase price of
$888,000.  &#147;Assets&#148;, in the agreement, was defined as the right
to apply to the Ministry for the issuance of a new license
authorizing Brant Hospital to operate the nursing home in place
of the licence of the Durham Nursing Home previously issued to
SRNHL under the Nursing Homes Act. This agreement was silent as
to the agreement between the appellant and the Ministry.
[14] The Ministry of Health approved the issuance of a
&#147;replacement license&#148; to Brant Hospital, upon which the appellant
released all of its claims against the existing licence to the
Durham Nursing Home. As agreed with the Ministry, the appellant
directed the sum of $178,617 to the Ministry. The balance of
$662,270.04, together with interest thereon, is held in trust.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues</pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellant and the respondents are competing claimants to
the $662,274.04 plus all interest which has accrued thereon. In
substance, a resolution of the dispute depends on whether Central
Guarantee acquired a security interest in the Durham Nursing Home
licence issued to SRNHL by the Ministry under the Nursing Homes
Act.  I agree with the finding of Lederman J. that it did.  I
also agree with his finding rejecting the appellant&#146;s alternative
argument that receiving the proceeds of the agreement between the
appellant and the Ministry unjustly enriches the respondents.</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[16] The Nursing Homes Act provides this definition of &#147;security
interest&#148;:
               1.&#150;(1) In this Act,
                                  &#133;
               &#147;security interest&#148; means an agreement
          between a person and a licensee that secures
          the licensee&#146;s payment or performance of an
          obligation by giving the person an interest
          in the license.</pre>
    <pre>[17] The P.P.S.A. provides a different definition:
               1.&#150;(1)    In this Act,
                                  &#133;
               &#147;security interest&#148; means an interest in
          personal property that secures payment or
          performance of an obligation, and includes,
          whether or not the interest secures payment
          or performance of an obligation, the interest
          of a transferee of an account or chattel
          paper;</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appellant agrees that the Nursing Homes Act recognises
that a security interest can be taken in a licence to operate a
nursing home. However the appellant then trivialises the
significance of the recognition by stating that it appears
&#147;merely to be a means of confirming that the reality in the
market place is that people &#145;deal&#146; in licences, subject totally
to the control of the Director and that such licences are not
transferable&#148;.  The appellant forcefully submits that no such
security interest can be taken pursuant to the P.P.S.A. because
the licence is not an interest in personal property and cannot
constitute collateral.
[19] &#147;Personal property is defined in the P.P.S.A. as:
               &#147;personal property&#148; means chattel paper, documents of title,
          goods, instruments, intangibles, money and securities and
          includes fixtures but does not include building materials that
          have been affixed to real property;</pre>
    <pre>[20] &#147;Collateral&#148; in the P.P.S.A. is defined as follows:
               &#147;collateral&#148; means personal property that is subject to a
          security interest;</pre>
    <pre>[21] I find it difficult to accept that the Legislature would
expressly recognize a security interest in a nursing home licence
without being aware that the case law has taken a restrictive
view of what constitutes personal property in the context of
various financing arrangements.  The definition of &#147;security
interest&#148; in the Nursing Home Act has no significance except in
connection with the P.P.S.A. In my opinion, the references to
&#147;security interest&#148; in the Nursing Homes Act are a recognition of
the realities of the market and are intended to clarify that the
interest of a licensee in a nursing home licence can constitute
collateral under the P.P.S.A. and that the enforcement of such
security interest is subject to the approval of the Director.
[22] Additionally and alternatively, I accept the analysis of the
case law set out in the reasons of Lederman J. in which he
concludes that a nursing home licence is in the nature of a
property right and can be the subject of a security interest
under the P.P.S.A.  His reasons accept that such a licence is
embraced by a regulatory framework that, while restricting its
transfer, protects it from arbitrary revocation and/or non-
renewal such that the licence is neither transitory nor
ephemeral.
[23] The appellant raises two arguments in its factum that it did
not stress in oral argument and do not appear to have been
addressed by the applications judge.  One is estoppel by
representation.  The other is that the appellant entered into a
contract with the Ministry that was separate and apart from any
interest of the respondents in the nursing home licence and it
was entitled to the proceeds of that separate arrangement.  I
agree with the respondents&#146; factum that there appears to be no
basis in fact or law for either argument in this case.  There
were no representations by the respondents that caused the
appellant to act to its detriment and there is no basis in law
upon which the Ministry could have authorized the appellant to
realise upon the security interest of the respondents in the
Durham Nursing Home license.
[24] As to the other principal argument that was raised in this
Court, namely that it would be unconscionable to have the
respondent retain the proceeds of the arrangement between the
appellant and the government, I feel that that is disposed of by
Lederman J. at p.447:
               As outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in Soulos v.
          Korkontzilas, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 217, 9 R.P.R. (3d) 1, the rationale
          underlying the law of constructive trusts is to prevent unjust
          enrichment and to allow for the imposition of equitable remedies
          by which the &#147;conscience of equity&#148; may resolve any injustices or
          unfair results.  Here, both Duca and the Ministry of Health were
          aware of the applicants&#146; perfected security interest.  They,
          nevertheless, made no inquiries of the applicants but chose to
          act in secrecy and to realize on the licence, in complete
          disregard of the prior security interest.  In the circumstances,
          the granting of equitable relief in Duca&#146;s favour is not
          warranted.</pre>
    <pre>[25] The record amply supports this finding.  Additionally, I
feel compelled to comment that there is a curious irony in the
appellant appealing to equity for relief in the circumstances of
this case.  The appellant&#146;s legal position was that no one had a
property interest in the Durham Nursing Home licence and yet it
was prepared to enter into an agreement with the Ministry in
which in substance it arranged for the sale of the licence to
Brant Hospital for a substantial amount of money, the net
proceeds of which it proposed to keep in priority to all other
creditors that were claimants in the MacLean receivership.
[26] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
