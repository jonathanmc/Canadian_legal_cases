[1]  This was a first offence. The appellant is otherwise of good
character.  Moreover, only one machine was involved. Even  taking
into  account  the  previous warning,  in  our  view,  the  moral
culpability   for   this  offence  was  minimal.   In   all   the
circumstances,  we think that the interests of justice  would  be
served by substituting a conditional discharge for a fine.

[2]  As the appellant has already completed the term of his
probation under his original sentence, the conditions attaching
to the discharge have been satisfied. Leave to appeal sentence is
granted, the appeal is allowed and a conditional discharge is
substituted for a fine.</pre></td>
