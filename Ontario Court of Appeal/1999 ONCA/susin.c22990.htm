    <pre>[1]  This appeal is in relation to a trial which took
approximately 33 days to be heard. The issue of credibility was
of paramount importance in the determination of the issues
pleaded by the appellants. The onus of proof was, of course, on
the appellants to satisfy the trial judge as to the facts related
to the claims advanced. The very experienced trial judge made the
following general comment in relation to the appellant John
Susin's credibility:</pre>
    <pre>          I reached the point where I did not believe
          he had any respect for the truth and that his
          sole purpose was to win the lawsuit before me
          and that he would say and do anything that
          would in his opinion advance his case.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In her conclusions, the trial judge found that she was not
persuaded that the facts essential to the appellants' claims had
been proven on the balance of probabilities.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  As to the legal issue of res judicata or issue estoppel, we
see absolutely nothing in the appellants' arguments as there is
no privity between the parties in the earlier proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In the conclusion, we are not persuaded that the trial judge
made any palpable or overriding error in reaching her
conclusions. The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
