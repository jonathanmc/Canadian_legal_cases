    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellants say that the trial judge was wrong to find
that John Susin Construction Co. Limited had no entitlement to
the funds paid into court. They argue that this finding should be
reversed either because Susin Construction did the construction
work for Romano Construction Co. and held the beneficial interest
in the contractual relationship between Romano and Frid
Construction Co. or because Susin Construction was an unpaid sub-
contractor of Romano.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  We disagree.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Both issues were squarely put before the trial judge and,
given his decision, were necessarily rejected by him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  On this record it was open to the trial judge to find that
the appellant John Susin Construction Co. Limited had not
established a beneficial interest in the construction contract
held by Romano with Frid.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  It was equally open to the trial judge to find that despite
the admission that it did construction work on the site, the
appellants had not demonstrated that Susin Construction Co.
Limited was an unpaid sub-contractor of Romano Construction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  We therefore see no basis for interfering with the
determination that John Susin Construction Co. Limited was not
entitled to the money paid into court to the credit of this
action.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  However, the parties are agreed that the appeal should be
allowed to the following extent:
     The order that the monies in court be paid out to Settlers
     Savings and Mortgage Corporation should be set aside.
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     An accounting is directed to determine the entitlement of
     Settlers Savings and Mortgage Corporation to the full sum
     presently in court to the credit of this action ($62,740.22
     together with accrued interest).
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     If this entitlement is less than the amount in court, the
     balance is to be paid out to Phyllis Susin or otherwise as
     the court shall direct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  To this limited extent the appeal is allowed. We would make
no order as to costs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  We should not leave this matter without indicating how
helpful to the court it was to have the assistance of counsel.</font></pre></td>
