    <pre>[1]  The outcome of this appeal turns on new evidence  admitted
on consent respecting dealings between trial counsel immediately
before the trial.
[2]  Before the trial began, counsel for the husband wrote to the
wife’s counsel (not counsel on the appeal) enclosing a cheque for
$9,500 a very substantial portion of the existing arrears. The
letter asked the wife's counsel for consent to re-instate the
husband’s pleadings, a request the wife’s counsel declined. At
that time, the appellant remained approximately $3,000 in arrears
of child support. Counsel for the husband then sent a further
letter of June 23rd stating that he intended to bring a motion
before Walsh J. on July 3rd, but he did not do so. Instead on
July 2nd, the second day of the trial, he served a notice of
motion for an order to re-open the husband’s pleadings, the
motion being returnable on July 8th.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  It is clear from the transcript of the trial that the trial
judge was most concerned to ensure fairness and, in particular,
that the appellant husband, who did not appear in person or by
counsel, did not intend to attend the trial. The trial judge
indicated on the record that she had read the trial record and a
letter dated June 24th, written by counsel for the wife to
Justices Walsh and Benotto asking for an expedited trial and
setting out the history. That letter enclosed the endorsements of
O'Connell J. of April 8, 1997 and Benotto J. of June 16, 1997 and
provided as follows in its entirety:</pre>
    <pre>          Please  consider the following in the  wife's
          plea for an immediate one day trial:</pre>
    <pre>          Chronology:</pre>
    <pre>          April 8, 1997: Husband's pleadings struck due
               to  non-payment of support. Husband  was
               given  until  April  23,  1997  to   pay
               otherwise pleadings struck.</pre>
    <pre>          May 29, 1997:  Motion in the Divisional Court
               for  leave  to appeal the Order  of  Mr.
               Justice  O'Connell dismissed with  costs
               by Mr. Justice Borins.</pre>
    <pre>          June 12, 1997: Mr. Justice Walsh held a trial
               management meeting with counsel and  set
               the  matter for trial. Mr. Justice Walsh
               indicated that the preliminary issue  of
               whether the husband would be allowed  to
               participate at the trial at all  and  if
               so,  to what extent to be determined  by
               the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>          June 16,  1997: Trial management meeting with
               Madam   Justice  Benotto.   Order   made
               striking the husband's pleadings. It was
               admitted that the arrears of support had
               not   been  paid.  Counsel  advised   to
               standby  for  an  undefended  trial  for
               Thursday or Friday (June 19th or 20th).</pre>
    <pre>          June 18,   1997:       Telephone   calls   to
               inquire re: status not returned.</pre>
    <pre>          June 19,  1997: Conversation with Sabrina  at
               Family  Law  Office. Ms. Bortolussi  was
               advised  that Steve Cameron was  not  in
               that  day and if we had not been called,
               &quot;no  one would start a trial on Friday&quot;.
               Inquiry as to whether we were on standby
               for  the  week of June 23, 1997 answered
               positively.</pre>
    <pre>          June 20,  1997:  Telephone  voice  mail  left
               requesting  a  response  re:  status  of
               being called for trial. No answer.</pre>
    <pre>          June 24,  1997: Barbara Petrone finally  gets
               through  and  speaks  to  Carol   DePiro
               (spelling  of name is phonetic)  at  the
               trial co-ordinator's office. She advised
               that  the trial would not go ahead until
               the  fall and that Steve Cameron advised
               all  parties last week. Ms. Petrone said
               that we were NOT advised and told to  be
               on  standby  for the week of June  23rd.
               Ms.  Petrone urged her to try  and  move
               the  date up if possible as this  is  an
               undefended  trial, extensive preparation
               was  done so that the evidence could  be
               adduced  very  efficiently  by  way   of
               document  briefs,  factum  and  book  of
               authorities.  There would  be  only  one
               witness called.</pre>
    <pre>               We  were  advised that the  schedule  is
               tight  and  there are not enough  judges
               but  she  would speak to Steve  when  he
               returned in three weeks to see what they
               could  do and suggested that we  contact
               him at that time.</pre>
    <pre>          It  is critical that we be allowed to proceed
          with  the trial as soon as possible.  If  the
          trial    judge   disallows   the    husband's
          participation, the trial will be completed in
          one  day  (or less). If his participation  is
          allowed,     then    completely     different
          preparation is required and an up-date of the
          assessment   by   Dr.   Butkowsky   will   be
          necessary. This will bring the matter to  the
          fall.</pre>
    <pre>          The husband has already indicated that he  is
          bringing  a motion for July 3, 1997  for  the
          same relief that has been before the court in
          the  Divisional  Court,  before  Mr.  Justice
          Walsh and before Madam Justice Benotto.</pre>
    <pre>          This is a situation where the delays and  the
          continuation of the proceedings is simply  an
          extension   of   the  husband's   abuse   and
          determination  to  carry out  his  threat  to
          leave  the wife with nothing and take custody
          of  the child. It is critical that the  judge
          hearing   the   trial  make  the  preliminary
          determination as soon as possible and if  the
          judge  finds in favour of the wife,  to  hear
          the  matter now. If the judge finds in favour
          of allowing the husband's participation, then
          the  necessary work can be done for trial  in
          the fall.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  It appears from this letter that the wife's trial counsel
understood that the trial judge would first be determining if and
to what extent the husband could participate in the trial on the
basis that she would not be able to proceed on the expedited date
if the husband was given leave to participate. Unfortunately,
although the letter informs the court of the husband's intention
to seek leave to re-instate his pleadings, it neglects to mention
that on June 20th, he had paid the $9,500 in arrears ordered by
O'Connell J. on April 8th.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  After stating on the record that she had read this letter,
the trial judge asked counsel for the wife &quot;Have you had any
indication from the petitioner husband directly or indirectly
about whether he was going to show up today?&quot; The following
response and further exchange took place:</pre>
    <pre>          COUNSEL:  I don't even know if they're  aware
          of  today's date. And my position is, they're
          not  entitled to any further notice  and  the
          trial  should proceed on an undefended basis.
          That issue has been resolved four times.</pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:  So  I take it I need  not  worry
          about  the time, the fact that we're starting
          before 10:30, in the sense we need to see  if
          he might show up.</pre>
    <pre>          COUNSEL:  I  would think that wouldn't  be  a
          concern today. But I'm in your hands. If  you
          think  it's  prudent to wait till 10:30,  I'm
          more than happy to do so.</pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:  What  are the chances  that  the
          petitioner might know of today's date?</pre>
    <pre>          COUNSEL:  I think slim. I don't know  whether
          they  have  -- I know that they had  been  in
          contact  in  the  past with  the  Family  Law
          Office. So probably if they called they would
          know. And in correspondence I've said to  Mr.
          Chambers who acts for husband, my position as
          of  April 23rd, which was the deadline to pay
          support   arrears  under  Justice  O'Connel's
          order,  that I was going to treat the  matter
          is if they didn't exist. That -- then we went
          to the Divisional Court for motion for leave.
          It  was  dismissed then in front  of  Justice
          Walsh,  then  we  were at a trial  management
          meeting  in  front  of Justice  Benotto.  She
          confirmed the pleadings were struck and  this
          was undefended. I don't know how much clearer
          it could be.</pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:  What I'm going to do  is  simply
          rise for five minutes to call the Family  Law
          Office  to  see  if they have heard  anything
          from  the petitioner. Obviously going  to  go
          ahead  and have the trial today, but I  would
          be  remiss  if I didn't check every available
          source in terms of what the husband may  have
          indicated  to  that office. I would  hate  to
          have   anybody  challenge  these  proceedings
          after  all of this. So I will call the Family
          Law  Office and expect to be back here within
          five minutes.</pre>
    <pre>          --- short break:</pre>
    <pre>          --- on resumption:</pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT: I have conducted a thorough check
          and we have had no communication at all, that
          we   are   able   to  ascertain,   from   the
          petitioner, and it's now 10:30 anyway. So  we
          will proceed.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Finally, at 2:15 on July 2nd, which was the second day of
the trial, counsel for the wife informed the court that that day
she had been served with a notice of motion returnable July 8th.
Counsel said the following upon resumption:</pre>
    <pre>          COUNSEL:   I'll try to recall my witness  and
          make it as succinct as possible. Before I  do
          that,  I feel I should, as an officer of  the
          court,  -- served this morning with a  motion
          record  by  Mr. Chambers, who  acts  for  the
          husband. And this is a motion returnable July
          8,  essentially for the same thing we've been
          dealing  with the last four times  in  court.
          Got a neat chronology on the front, statement
          of  prior  legal proceedings, but same  thing
          he's asked for the last four times.</pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:  Does  he know the  trial  is  in
          progress?</pre>
    <pre>          COUNSEL: No, I have not called him.</pre>
    <pre>          THE  COURT:  Whoever has  to  deal  with  the
          motion  when it is returnable can  deal  with
          it,  but  I  intend to continue on  with  the
          trial.</pre>
    <pre>[7]       It would appear from the above history that trial
counsel for the wife never specifically informed Epstein J. that
in late June the husband had paid the arrears of $9,500 as
quantified in April and therefore had complied, albeit long after
the deadline date, with the order of O'Connell J. and now on that
basis was seeking to re-instate his pleadings. Although the trial
judge had been told in evidence on June 30th that $9,500 had been
paid earlier that month, it does not appear to have been made
clear that that payment formed the basis of the husband's stated
intention to seek an order to re-instate his pleadings.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  We believe that had Epstein J. been made fully aware of the
situation, she would likely have allowed the husband the
opportunity to participate in the trial, perhaps on terms.
Although he was still in arrears of child support, his income had
been reduced because of a strike at his place of employment.
[9]
[10] Because the trial judge does not appear to have been aware
of the full facts and in particular the fact that the $9,500
required by O'Connell J. had been paid prior to trial, in all the
circumstances, proceeding with the trial without giving the
husband an opportunity to attend and seek leave to participate
resulted in procedural unfairness, particularly where the result
was an unequal division of family property and reduction in the
husband's access to the child.</pre>
    <pre>[11] In the circumstances, we are satisfied that the husband
should be given the opportunity to participate in the trial. The
appeal is therefore allowed and a new trial ordered on the
following terms:</pre>
    <pre>          1.   the husband shall immediately pay all arrears of child
               support and maintain all child support payments until
               such time as the child support order may be varied;
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   the husband shall make full financial disclosure and
               if the wife chooses to examine him for discovery with
               respect to that disclosure, he shall submit to such
               examination;</pre>
    <pre>          3.   the husband shall pay the costs of the
               trial and the costs of this appeal.</pre></td>
