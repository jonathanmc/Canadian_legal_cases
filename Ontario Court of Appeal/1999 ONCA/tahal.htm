    <pre>On appeal from the conviction and sentence by Farley J. with  a
jury dated March 28, 1996 and April 2, 1996 respectively</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted by a jury of one count of
trafficking in crack cocaine and one count of possession of
crack cocaine for the purpose of trafficking contrary to
ss 4(1) and 4(2) of the Narcotic Control Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-
1.  He received a sentence of 15 months&#146; imprisonment plus two
years&#146; probation on the trafficking charge and 6 months plus
two years&#146; probation concurrent on the possession for the
purpose charge.  The appellant appeals from conviction and
sentence.</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On the evening of January 20, 1993, Constables Campbell
and Mori were working in an undercover capacity in the downtown
Toronto core.  Their purpose was to detect drug traffickers and
if possible, make undercover drug purchases.
[3]  At around 7:20 p.m., they parked their unmarked police
vehicle on Dundas Street near Jarvis and took up surveillance
of a restaurant known as Woody&#146;s.  From their location, they
could see the appellant and his co-accused, Fitzroy Allen,
inside the restaurant.  On four separate occasions, they
observed people entering the restaurant and engaging in what
appeared to be drug transactions with the appellant.  As a
result, Constable Campbell decided to attempt a drug purchase
from the appellant.
[4]  Before entering the restaurant, Constable Campbell
retrieved some &#147;buy&#148; money he had brought with him and recorded
the serial numbers in his notebook.  He then entered the
restaurant and after speaking to Allen and the appellant, he
used the &#147;buy&#148; money to purchase .16 grams or $70.00 worth of
crack cocaine from the appellant.  Shortly thereafter,
accompanied by his partner and several other police officers,
Constable Campbell returned to the restaurant and arrested the
appellant and Allen.  In the course of the arrest, the
appellant was seen to throw some kleenex and money onto the
floor.  The kleenex was later found to contain 1.12 grams of
crack cocaine.  The appellant and Allen were each found to be
in possession of a portion of the &#147;buy&#148; money used by Campbell
to make the purchase.
[5]  The appellant testified on his own behalf and denied
selling drugs to Campbell.  He admitted being in the restaurant
and he recalled Campbell approaching him and asking if he could
purchase $30.00 worth of crack cocaine.  Knowing that Campbell
was an undercover officer, he told Campbell that he did not
sell crack cocaine and that Campbell would be better off
drinking alcohol.  The appellant denied tossing kleenex or
money onto the floor prior to his arrest.  In short, it was his
position that he and Allen had been framed by Constable
Campbell.</pre>
    <pre>CONVICTION APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appellant raises four grounds of appeal against
conviction.</pre>
    <pre>     Challenge for Cause</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellant is black and he sought to challenge each
prospective juror for cause as follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>(a)       Would your ability to judge the evidence in the case
without partiality be affected by the fact that the person
charged is black and the offences are narcotic related? and
(b)       Are police officers by virtue of the fact that they
are police officers automatically more credible to you, or
would you evaluate the testimony of a police officer the same
as you would an ordinary citizen?
     </pre>
    <pre>     </pre>
    <pre>[8]  The trial judge permitted the first question insofar as it
related to the appellant&#146;s race but not the nature of the
crime.  He disallowed the second question.
[9]  For reasons which will be fully developed in R. v. Barnes,
File No. C26957, heard together with this appeal, we are of the
view that while it would have been open to the trial judge, in
the exercise of his discretion, to allow the first question in
its entirety, he did not err in refusing to do so.  With
respect to the second question, we are satisfied that the trial
judge did not err in refusing to permit it.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial judge erred in refusing to permit the defence to
     cross-examine Constable Campbell on &#147;prior acts of
     discreditable conduct&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[10] In one of several pre-trial motions, defence counsel [not
Mr. Tanovich] sought permission to cross-examine Constable
Campbell on four unrelated undercover drug purchases (none of
which involved the appellant) where it was alleged that he had
planted evidence and framed the accused. In three of those
cases, the accused were acquitted by juries; in the fourth, the
charges were withdrawn before trial.
[11] It was the position of the defence that the proposed
evidence was relevant for two purposes:
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    as similar fact evidence to show that the methods used by
          Campbell in this case, such as failing to photocopy the &#147;buy&#148;
          money or have his partner witness and sign off on the serial
          numbers recorded in his notebook, were consistent with
          practices he had employed in the past to frame innocent
          accused; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    to challenge his credibility by asking him why, in the
          face of three acquittals and a withdrawal, he continued to use
          the same methods.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The trial judge, in the exercise of his discretion,
refused to permit this line of questioning.  In essence, it was
his view that the prejudicial effect of the proposed evidence
substantially outweighed its probative value. In this regard,
he observed that as an undercover officer, Constable Campbell
had been involved in hundreds of other drug purchases and the
proposed cross-examination could potentially open the door to
&#147;a minute examination of each arrest Campbell had been involved
in over his entire career.&#148;  This would inevitably complicate
and prolong the trial and deflect the jury&#146;s attention away
from the main issue.  In addition, the trial judge noted that
in respect of the three jury trials, there was nothing in the
material before him to indicate that in acquitting, the juries
were satisfied that Campbell had framed the accused as opposed
to simply entertaining a reasonable doubt on all of the
evidence. Likewise, with respect to the withdrawn charges,
there was nothing to indicate that the decision to withdraw was
based on anything other than &#147;innocent&#148; factors.
[13] The trial judge provided cogent reasons for refusing to
permit the proposed line of questioning and we have not been
persuaded that he erred in the exercise of his discretion. Any
possible doubts we may have had were put to rest in oral
argument when, as a result of questions from the bench, counsel
for the appellant made inquiries and discovered, for the first
time, that the three jury acquittals and the withdrawal of
charges occurred after, not before, the investigation giving
rise to the instant offences.  This only reinforces the trial
judge&#146;s conclusion that the proposed evidence had little, if
any, probative value.</pre>
    <pre>     The trial judge erred in not allowing the jury to view
     Constable Campbell&#146;s notebook</pre>
    <pre>[14] Constable Campbell testified that he was seated in his
vehicle outside of Woody&#146;s restaurant when he recorded the
serial numbers of the &#147;buy&#148; money used to purchase drugs from
the appellant.
[15] The appellant, on the other hand, maintained that Campbell
had written all of his notes, including the serial numbers, at
the police station following the appellant&#146;s arrest.  To
substantiate this, the appellant requested that the jury be
permitted to view Campbell&#146;s notebook in order to compare the
handwritten notes, allegedly made before his arrest, with those
made after his arrest.  It was the position of the defence that
if Campbell truly recorded the serial numbers in the car, his
handwriting, under those conditions, would have been different
from his handwriting at the station.  From the  defence
perspective, the handwriting appeared to be uniform throughout.
[16] The trial judge refused, correctly in our view,  to accede
to this request.  Being unfamiliar with Constable Campbell&#146;s
handwriting, the jury had no way of knowing whether it would
change depending on the writing conditions.  Absent expert
testimony or a proved or admitted standard against which the
jury could make the necessary comparison, it would have been
speculation on the jury&#146;s part to draw the inference, suggested
by the defence, that the writings were made on a single
occasion as opposed to two separate occasions.</pre>
    <pre>     Unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[17] The appellant submits that the verdicts are unreasonable
and that the only reasonable conclusion on the evidence was
that Constable Campbell framed the appellant.  We disagree.
[18] Unquestionably, there were issues of credibility and
reliability that the jury had to come to grips with.  However,
the trial judge properly instructed the jury on these issues
and the evidence amply supported the verdicts.</pre>
    <pre>SENTENCE APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[19] The trial judge imposed a sentence of 15 months&#146;
imprisonment.  At the time of sentencing, the conditional
sentencing regime was not in force.
[20] Counsel for the appellant concedes the sentence of 15
months was fit.  He maintains, however,  that in view of the
background and history of the appellant and the inordinate
length of time that has passed since the commission of the
offences, this court should exercise its discretion and
substitute a conditional sentence.
[21] In the particular and somewhat unusual circumstances of
this case, despite the seriousness of the offences, we are
satisfied that the interests of justice would best be served by
imposing a conditional sentence.  The appellant was 22 years
old at the time of the offences and apart from a youth record
that ended when he was 17 years old, he had no adult criminal
record.  This case comes to us more than 6 years after the date
of the offences, during which time the appellant has been on
bail.  He has faithfully abided by the terms and conditions of
his release orders and he has not re-offended.  This is cogent
evidence of his rehabilitation and it leads us to believe that
the appellant does not pose a continuing danger to the
community.
[22] Manifestly, the principle of general deterrence must take
precedence over the other recognized principles of sentencing
in cases of this nature.  However, in all of the circumstances,
that principle is adequately met by the imposition of a
conditional sentence.
[23] In view of the fact that the appellant has already served
one month in custody, leave to appeal sentence is granted and
the sentence on the trafficking count is varied from one of 15
months to 14 months, to be served in the community pursuant to
s. 741.2 of the Criminal Code.  The sentence of 6 months for
possession for the purpose of trafficking will remain the same
but it too shall be served in the community.  In addition to
the statutory conditions under s. 742.3(1) of the Code, the
appellant shall perform 100 hours of community service prior to
the completion of his sentence.  He shall also refrain from the
use or possession of non-medically prescribed drugs.
[24] We are also of the view that there is no need for the
appellant to be on probation following the completion of his
conditional sentence. Accordingly, the two year probationary
term is deleted.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[25] In the result, the appeal against conviction is dismissed;
the appeal against sentence is allowed and the sentence is
varied in accordance with these reasons.
