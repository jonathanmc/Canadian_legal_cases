    <pre>                                
[1]  The appellants, Stock Mechanical Inc. (&#147;Stock&#148;), Michael
Cannone and Arrow Bookkeeping Services Limited (&#147;Arrow&#148;), appeal
from the judgment of Ground J. dated November 13, 1998, in which
the respondent Tam-Kal was awarded damages for breach of a
construction contract and breach of trust by the appellants.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The action arises out of the construction by York University
of a building on which Daicon Contractors Ltd. (&#147;Daicon&#148;) was the
general contractor for the project; Stock was the mechanical
contractor; and Tam Kal, the sheet metal contractor.
Of the several grounds of appeal advanced, we find it necessary
to comment on only three specifically.
</pre>
    <pre>1.   Was written authorization for extras required?
       </pre>
    <pre>[3]  The differences between the parties originated in a dispute
over whether Tam-Kal was entitled to payment for extra work that
it carried out on the project without written authorization from
Stock.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The appellants submit that they did not have to pay Tam-Kal
for work that was extra to that originally contracted because
written authorization was required for the payment of extras and
Tam-Kal did not obtain prior written authorization for the
changes.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Ground J. found that Tam-Kal did not typically receive
written authorization for changes or extras, but rather received
verbal authorization from Mr. Sartisson, a senior Stock
representative, to proceed with the work prior to the receipt of
any written authorization.  Thus, the requirement for written
authorization for extras was waived by the course of conduct
between the parties.  He stated:</pre>
    <pre>          Mr. Sartisson was the senior Stock
          representative on site and had ostensible
          authority to authorize the work to be done.
          The evidence was clear that the project was
          to be completed on a &#147; fast track&#148; basis and
          that in many instances work had to be done so
          that work of other subcontractors could
          proceed in order to keep the project on track
          and that in many instances it took several
          weeks to obtain a CCO for a particular change
          or extra.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In considering all of the evidence before me
          with respect to the Disputed Extras, I am
          satisfied that oral authorization was
          received for Tam-Kal to complete the work on
          the following Disputed Extras at the
          following prices, exclusive of G.S.T&#133;.
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  On the evidence before him, it was open to the trial judge
to come to his conclusion that, based on the course of conduct
between the parties, the requirement for written authorization
for extras was waived. This ground of appeal is dismissed.
</pre>
    <pre>2.   Did Tam-Kal interfere with Stock's contractual relations
     with York University?</pre>
    <pre>[7]  On July 26, 1993, Tam-Kal&#146;s solicitors wrote York
University, Daicon and Stock advising that Tam-Kal was owed
approximately $196,000, which led to York University withholding
$100,000 at the time.  The amount was eventually paid to Daicon
who did not pay it to Stock.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellants assert that the letter sent by Tam-Kal to
York University, Daicon and Stock on July 26, 1993 constituted
wrongful interference with Stock&#146;s contractual relations,
resulting in damage to Stock.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The trial judge concluded that, in light of the outstanding
disputes between Daicon and Stock, Daicon would have refused to
pay the $100,000 to Stock, regardless of the letter from Tam-Kal.
Again, there was an evidentiary basis for the trial judge&#146;s
conclusion and we cannot interfere.   We also note that the
University did not comply with the letter in any event; after a
year they paid Daicon and, as a result, no damages flowed from
Tam Kal&#146;s letter. This ground of appeal is dismissed.
</pre>
    <pre>3.   Were the appellants in breach of their trust obligations?
  </pre>
    <pre>[10] Out of the trust fund set up for the project under s.13 of
the Construction Lien Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. 30 (the &#147;Act&#148;),
Michael Cannone paid certain amounts, which the trial judge
classified as overhead expenses, to himself and to Stock and
Arrow, both companies owned by him.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The trial judge held Michael Cannone personally liable for
breach of trust under s.13(1) of the Act.  In reaching this
conclusion, he found that Cannone ought to have known, given his
position as C.E.O. of Stock and his years of experience in the
construction industry, that a number of payments made out of the
trust funds received by Stock from Daicon were improper.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The appellants make two submissions in respect of this
ground of appeal. The first relates to the classification of the
payments by Ground J.; the second to the imposition of personal
liability on Cannone for repayment.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The appellants concede that, subsequent to the trial, this
court&#146;s decision in Dietrich Steel Ltd. v. Shar-Dee Towers (1987)
Ltd. , (1999), 170 D.L.R. (4th) 475  (Ont. C.A.) does away with
any argument that the trial judge incorrectly categorized certain
payments as overhead and that these payments should not have been
made out of the trust funds.  The appellants submit, however,
that other payments should not have been classified as overhead
payments. It is the position of the appellants that these
payments were not part of overhead because they were specific to
the project. As such, the appellants say the payments were for
services in respect of an improvement.  Pursuant to the
Construction Lien Act, services in respect of an improvement are
eligible for reimbursement out of trust funds and the appellants
submit that these payments were just that.  The payments were to
Cannone&#146;s company, Arrow, for the services of a bookkeeper and
estimator; for salary to Mr. Cannone in relation to his time on
the project; for employee vehicle and gas expenses; for liability
insurance premiums and for rent for storage space for material
prior to its being needed on the project. The amount totals
$301,368.11.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Although Ground J. may not have used precisely the same test
as in Dietrich, supra, he applied the correct principle.  He
found as a fact that these were overhead expenses. We would not
interfere with his conclusion.  Having regard to the scheme of
the Act as a whole, and the purpose of the trust, it would not be
appropriate to create an artificial distinction between general
overhead expenses and site specific overhead expenses.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellants further submit that the trial judge erred in
finding that Mr. Cannone was liable under s.13 for breach of
trust.  In our opinion, Ground J. did not err in his application
of this section to the facts of this case.
</pre>
    <pre>Other Matters</pre>
    <pre>[16] The other matters raised in the appellants&#146; factum have no
merit in our opinion and are also dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[17] The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent.</pre>
