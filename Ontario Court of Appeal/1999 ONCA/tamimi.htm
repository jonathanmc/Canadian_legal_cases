</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent operated on the appellant in May 1993 to
resolve the appellant&#146;s problem of excessive sweating.  The
procedure is referred to in the material as a &#147;sympathectomy.&#148;
The surgery resolved the appellant&#146;s sweating disorder, however,
following the surgery the appellant developed and complained of
pain and discomfort that was physiologically not connected with
the surgery.  It is not suggested that from the appellant&#146;s
perspective that the pain is anything other than real.  There is
no issue raised with respect to the respondent&#146;s performance of
the surgery itself.
[2]  The appellant does, however, submit that the respondent was
negligent in that he failed to give the appellant sufficient pre-
operative advice about the risks and benefits of the surgery.
The appellant submits that in light of his pre-existing
psychological problems, the respondent should have consulted the
appellant&#146;s psychiatrist and, with the benefit of that
consultation, given the appellant some pre-operative advice that
he did not receive in the circumstances.  There is no evidence
that discloses directly, or by implication, what the consultation
that the appellant says should have taken place would have
revealed.  Thus, there is no evidence on the issue of what
additional advice about the risks of this surgery should have
been given by the respondent to the appellant before the surgery
was undertaken.  The respondent filed two expert reports in which
the two experts expressed the opinion the respondent did not fall
below the appropriate standard of care in the manner in which he
dealt with the appellant before the surgery.  The appellant filed
no expert reports on that or any other relevant issue.  The
motions judge, Rivard J., found that on the material before him
on the respondent&#146;s summary judgment motion there was no evidence
of negligence which could support a finding of liability against
the respondent.  We see no error in that conclusion.  Thus, the
appeal is dismissed with costs if requested.</pre></td>
