    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Cameron J. dated September 2, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>SHARPE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal arises from the award of a contract following a
call for tenders by the appellant municipality for excavating,
blasting and grading a road to the gravel base.  The respondent
was the lowest bidder. The appellant awarded the contract to the
second lowest bidder.  Following a one-day trial, Cameron J.
found the appellant liable for failing to act fairly or in good
faith in connection with the respondent&#146;s bid.
[2]  The tender documents contained a &#147;privilege clause&#148; in the
following terms:</pre>
    <pre>               The Region reserves the right to reject any or all
          bids submitted or any part  and the lowest of any bid will not
          necessarily be accepted.[sic]</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
rejecting the contention that its decision to award the contract
was justified in view of this clause and in view of this Court&#146;s
decision in Acme Building &amp; Construction Ltd. v. Newcastle (Town)
(1992), 2 C.L.R. (2d) 308.
[4]  The invitation to tender required that all bidders be pre-
qualified in accordance with Ministry of Transportation
standards.  Bidders were to submit bids on a unit price basis.
The trial judge found that there was no scope for variation of
the work, of the method of doing the work, or of the nature or
quality of the materials to be used.  The only variable permitted
by the tender documents was the price. Bids had to remain
irrevocable for 60 days following the opening of bids and
tenderers were required to post a bond of $200,000.  Six bids
were submitted.  The respondent&#146;s bid of $8,507,056.12 was
$19,689.50 lower than the next lowest bid submitted by Dufferin
Construction Company, (&#147;Dufferin&#148;) a local contractor.  The
appellant&#146;s Director of Roads, the official responsible for
administering the tender process and for analyzing the bids,
recommended that the contract be awarded to the respondent as the
lowest bidder.  However, representations were made by Dufferin to
the Chairman and Members of the Transportation and Services
Committee of Hamilton-Wentworth.  Dufferin pointed out that it
paid taxes in the Region and that it employed local workers, many
of whom were presently laid off.  The tender documents did not
indicate that preference might be given to local contractors or
to those employing local workers.  The Transportation and
Services Committee referred the matter to Council which awarded
the contract to Dufferin.  The Council gave no reason for its
decision.  At trial, counsel for the appellant took the position
that there was no reason for the decision.
[5]  Following the principles established in The Queen in Right
of Ontario and the Water Resources Commission  v. Ron Engineering
Construction (Eastern) Ltd., [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111, the trial judge
found that the submission of the respondent&#146;s bid in response to
the invitation to tender established a unilateral contract in
accordance with the tender documents.  The trial judge found that
&#147;the law implies an obligation on the owner [the appellant
municipality] of fairness in exercising its rights under the
privilege clause&#148;.  He concluded on the evidence that:</pre>
    <pre>               &#133; the plaintiff has established on the balance of
          probability that the defendant did not act fairly or in good
          faith when it awarded the contract to a tenderer who was not the
          low bidder, and no basis of possible decision on other grounds
          was disclosed in, nor can one be implied, from the tender
          documents or any published policy or the defendant.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In coming to that conclusion, the trial judge took into
account the failure of the appellant to give any reason for its
decision.  He noted that while Acme Building and Construction,
supra, states there is no obligation to give reasons, &#147;in the
absence of possible grounds in the tender documents or a
published policy&#133;the defendant risks an adverse finding of fact
by the court&#148;.
[7]  I can see no reason to interfere with the findings of the
trial judge or with the conclusion he reached.
[8]  It is well-established that tenderers and owners have
reciprocal obligations that arise from the contract that is
created by the submission of a bid.  Under this contract,
referred to as &#147;Contract A&#148; in Ron Engineering, supra, the
tenderer is bound not to revoke its bid for the specified period
and is bound to accept &#147;Contact B&#148;, the contract for the work, if
its bid is accepted by the owner.
[9]  There is a long line of authority for the proposition that,
in turn, the owner is obliged to treat all bidders fairly and in
good faith and that the owner is in breach of contractual
obligations under Contract A where it awards the contract on the
basis of considerations or criteria extraneous to those
identified in the tender documents: See eg Chinook Aggregates
Ltd. v. Abbotsford (Municipal District) (1989) 35 C.L.R. 241
(B.C.C.A.) at 248:</pre>
    <pre>               By adopting a policy or preferring local
          contractors whose bids were within 10 per cent of the lowest bid,
          the appellant in effect incorporated an implied term without
          notice of that implied term to all bidders, including the
          respondent. In so doing, it was in breach of a duty to treat all
          bidders fairly and not to give any of them an unfair advantage
          over the others.

[11] The decision of this Court in Acme Building &amp;Construction,
supra, is consistent with this line of authority.  In that case,
there was a similar privilege clause.  The tender documents
required the bidders to specify a completion date.  The
successful bidder was not the lowest, but it did specify an
earlier completion date.  The owner relied on the privilege
clause and gave reasons for its decision. Those reasons included
the earlier date for completion specified by the successful
bidder, and consequent costs saved by the town. In upholding a
judgment dismissing the claim of the lowest bidder, this Court
stated that the completion date was a material term specified by
the tender documents and that the owner was entitled to base its
decision on that element of the bids.  As the owner&#146;s decision
was based upon a factor or criterion identified by the tender
documents, there was no breach of the obligation to act fairly
when invoking the privilege clause.
[12] In Acme Building &amp; Construction, supra at 310, the Court
observed that the privilege clause &#147;gave the respondent [owner]
the right to reject the lowest bid and accept another qualifying
bid without giving any reasons&#148;.  The appellant submits that as
it was not required to give reasons for its decision to award the
contract to Dufferin, the trial judge erred in taking into
account its failure to give reasons.  I reject that submission.
While the appellant was not required to give reasons, in failing
to do so, it ran the risk that the trial judge would draw an
adverse inference from its silence.  In my view, in the
circumstances of this case, particularly in light of the
Council&#146;s failure to give reasons, the recommendation of the
Director of Roads, and the representations made by Dufferin, and
the fact that the only variable permitted by the tender documents
was the price, the trial judge was entitled to find that the
appellant breached its contractual obligation to treat the
respondent&#146;s bid fairly.  There is no basis for this Court to
interfere with that finding.
[13] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.  The court was advised
that the parties agreed that costs, fixed at $10,000, should
follow the event and I so order.
