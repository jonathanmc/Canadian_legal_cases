    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Sutherland dated
January 15, 1997</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant raised three grounds of appeal before us.
[2]  First, it is argued that the trial judge exhibited bias.
The appellant has the challenge of showing that the conduct of
the trial judge would demonstrate to a reasonable objective
person fully informed of the circumstances a state of mind in
some way predisposed to a particular result or closed with regard
to a particular issue.  This is a high threshold and depends on
the particular facts of each case.  See R. v. S. (R.D.), [1997] 3
S.C.R. 484.
[3]  In our view, the cumulative effect of the judicial comments
relied on by the appellant does not reach this threshold.  While
a counsel of perfection might have suggested a less pointed
choice of language by the trial judge in some cases, our
examination of the record persuades us that the trial judge
properly considered the issues before him and came to a properly
reasoned conclusion.  This ground of appeal must fail.
[4]  As to the evidence of Mr. Pacevicius, the weight to be
attached to it was a matter for the trial judge.  We see no error
in principle in his according it the weight which he did.
[5]  As to the finding of contempt, it was not necessary for the
trial judge to recite in his reasons all the evidence relevant to
that issue nor to set out explicitly the appropriate standard of
proof to be applied.  This ground of appeal must also fail.
Hence, there is no need to examine the scale of costs applied
below.
[6]  In the result, the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
