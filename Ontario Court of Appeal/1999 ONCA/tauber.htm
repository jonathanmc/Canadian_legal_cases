    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant  Jeffrey Tauber moves  for  a  partial  stay
pending  appeal  of the order for child support  of  $17,000  per
month  made  by  the trial judge, Jennings J. In  my  opinion,  a
partial stay is warranted.

[2]  The parties&#146; marriage was short-lived &#150; it lasted only 18
months &#150; but it produced one child, Samuel Tauber, who is now 19
months old. The trial judge refused to order spousal support,
concluding he could not find that Mrs. Tauber had suffered an
economic disadvantage because of the marriage. Indeed, he found
that her capital position and standard of living had improved
because of and since the marriage.

[3]  Mr. Tauber enjoys an annual income of $2.5 million. The
order for child support in the amount of $17,000 per month was
mandated by the application of the Federal Child Support
Guidelines1 to his income and by the decision of this court in
Francis v. Baker2.  The trial judge was of the view that $17,000
per month was excessive. He observed that this amount exceeded
Mrs. Tauber&#146;s proposed monthly expenses for herself, her
housekeeper and the child. Had he the authority to do so, the
trial judge would have awarded &#147;considerably less&#148;. He was bound,
however, by Francis v. Baker, which interpreted the word
&#147;inappropriate&#148; in s. 4(b) of the Guidelines to mean
&#147;inadequate&#148;. This interpretation precluded the trial judge from
awarding less child support than the amount prescribed by the
Guidelines.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Mr. Tauber filed his notice of appeal on February 22, 1999.
To obtain a stay pending appeal Mr. Tauber must show that there
is a serious question to be tried, that he would suffer
irreparable harm if a stay were refused and that the balance of
convenience favours a stay: Circuit World Corporation v.
Lesperance3.

[5] Mr. Tauber&#146;s appeal turns mainly on the correctness of this
court&#146;s decision in Francis v. Baker. As Ms. David pointed out,
Francis v. Baker is the law of this province and therefore
Jennings J. had no choice but to apply it in awarding child
support. It does not follow, however, that Mr. Tauber&#146;s appeal
does not raise a serious issue. The Supreme Court of Canada has
granted leave to appeal in Francis v. Baker on the  issue of the
interpretation of s.4(b) of the Guidelines (the appeal is to be
heard on April 27, 1999). The Supreme Court seldom grants leave
in family law cases and the granting of leave by itself shows
that there is at least a serious question about the correctness
of Francis v. Baker. I note as well that other trial courts have
disagreed with this court&#146;s reasoning in Francis v. Baker4.  I am
therefore satisfied that Mr. Tauber has met the first criterion
for a stay.

[6]  A party seeking a stay can show irreparable harm by showing
that the harm &#147;cannot be cured, usually because one party cannot
collect damages from the other.&#148;  That is the case here. Should
Mr. Tauber succeed on his appeal in having the amount of child
support reduced &#150; because, for example, the Supreme Court
disagrees with this court&#146;s reasoning in Francis v. Baker &#150; he
would likely be unable to recover any overpayment from Mrs.
Tauber. Ms. David did not suggest otherwise. On the other hand,
to set off any overpayment against ongoing child support would
harm the child. Mr. Tauber has therefore shown irreparable harm.

[7]  Finally, the balance of convenience favours granting a stay.
Even acknowledging that at least for some expenses, child support
and spousal support cannot easily be divided, Mrs. Tauber does
not require $17,000 per month to meet Sam&#146;s needs, no matter how
luxurious those needs might be. I can protect the interests of
Mrs. Tauber and Sam by ordering a generous amount for child
support, albeit less than $17,000 per month, and by ordering that
Mr. Tauber pay the balance into an interest bearing trust account
pending the appeal. If Mrs. Tauber succeeds on the appeal, the
full amount of $17,000 per month will be readily available to her
and Sam.

[8]  I am then left with the task of deciding on a figure for
child support pending appeal. In my view, an appropriate figure
is $11,000 per month. Taking Mrs. Tauber&#146;s proposed budget at
face value and discounting expenses solely for her benefit such
as clothing, $11,000 per month seems to me to be a generous
amount, an amount that probably exceeds what the trial judge
would have ordered had he the authority to reduce the Guidelines
figure. It also that accords with the confidential interim
agreement made by the parties in May 1998.

[9]  Therefore, pending the disposition of this appeal or a
further order of this court, the child support order of Jennings
J. is partially stayed on the following terms:
     </pre>
    <pre>(i)  Mr. Tauber will make monthly payments of $11,000 to Mrs.
     Tauber for child support.
(ii) Mr. Tauber will make monthly payments of $6,000 into an
     interest bearing trust account. If counsel cannot work out the
     details of this trust, they may re-attend before me.
(iii)The costs of this motion are reserved to the panel
     hearing the appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] I am grateful to both counsel for their helpful submissions.
