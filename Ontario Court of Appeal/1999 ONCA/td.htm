               BANK (Defendant/Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, LABROSSE and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Edward Del Grande,
               personally</pre>
    <pre>               A.  S. Halpert,
               for the corporate appellants</pre>
    <pre>               David D. Rosenbaum,
               for the respondent The Toronto-Dominion Bank</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         July 13, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice N. Douglas Coo, dated
July 4, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge concluded that the Bank's claims against the
appellants were established.  This is not in dispute.
[2]  The trial judge made a detailed review of the evidence.  He
dealt with each allegation raised by Edward Del Grande, an
experienced and sophisticated businessman who had his expert
advisers.  He made crucial findings of fact that there was no
misconduct by bank officials and his conclusion is amply
supported by the evidence.
[3]  This was a long trial, essentially &quot;fact driven&quot;.  As the
trial judge remarked, the unfortunate results of the business
dealings between the parties came to be generated by the
horrendous downturn in the real estate market and the recession.
[4]  We see no basis to interfere.  The appeal is dismissed with
costs.
[5]  With respect to the cross-appeal of The Toronto-Dominion
Bank seeking solicitor-and-client costs, we would grant leave to
appeal.  In our view, the decision of the trial judge to award
party-and-party costs was a proper exercise of his discretion.
[6]  The cross-appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
