    <pre>BEFORE:  FINLAYSON, ROSENBERG and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL: J. Douglas Crane, Q.C., for the appellant Daniel A. Chrusz</pre>
    <pre>         Jeffrey A.L. Kriwez, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:   November 19, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Kozak dated April 20, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]   The appellant is restricted on appeal to the grounds he
raised before the motions judge.  The first ground was that he
did not give his consent to the assignment of his guarantee.  The
answer to that is that his consent was not required.  The second
ground was that the respondent bank did not accept a compromise
offered to it by the appellant.  The answer to that is that the
bank was not obliged to do so.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs on a
solicitor-and-client basis.</pre>
