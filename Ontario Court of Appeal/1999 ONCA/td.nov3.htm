      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant Emix Holdings Limited appeals from the
decision of Cumming J. granting summary judgment to the
respondent the Toronto-Dominion Bank and awarding the Bank
damages of $1,970,000 for breach of the option to sell agreement.</pre>
      <pre>[2]  The rather complicated chronology leading to the parties’
signing of the option to sell agreement is fairly set out in the
reasons of the motions judge.  In our view, however, the motions
judge erred in holding that the evidence before him did not show
a genuine issue for trial.  We think that the motion material
raises at least the following three issues that should be tried.
     </pre>
      <pre>     (1)  Whether Mr. Lumsden, the Bank’s representative on the
          transaction, made deliberate and material misrepresentations that
          led Emix to believe the branch would be built and thus led Emix
          to sign an agreement – the option to sell agreement – it would
          not otherwise have signed.  On this issue we take account of Mr.
          Hepfer’s evidence summarized in Emix’s factum in the following
          terms:
               </pre>
      <pre>                    In making his decision, Hepfer also relied on
               representations by Lumsden that the Bank had already
               made its decision to build on the property.  During
               Lumsden’s various conversations with Hepfer, he had
               always led Hepfer to believe that the Bank had already
               made its decision to build on that property.  At no
               time did he ever advise Hepfer that in fact the Bank
               had not made such a decision.  In asking Hepfer to sign
               a buy back agreement, he convinced Mr. Hepfer that
               there was little, if any, chance of construction not
               occurring in time.  Confirmation of this discussion
               occurs in Lumsden?s notes to file.  Furthermore, he led
               Hepfer to understand that the only need for such a
               clause was as an expanded force majeure clause to
               protect the Bank in the event that some unpredictable
               event prevented the Bank from commencing it’s [sic]
               construction in time.</pre>
      <pre>     (2)  Whether the option to sell agreement was made without valid
          consideration.  On this issue we note that when the Bank insisted
          on the option to sell agreement as the price of closing the
          transaction, it was already legally obligated to close under the
          original agreement of purchase and sale, which subjected it to
          the unfavourable option in favour of Bramalea.
     </pre>
      <pre>     (3)  Whether Emix has a defence of economic duress available to
          it.  On this issue, we take into account Emix’s evidence that
          though the Bank claimed it had not appreciated the terms of
          Bramalea’s option, an internal Bank memorandum from Mr. Lumsden
          dated January 8, 1990 suggests otherwise; and that the Bank
          threatened to renege on the transaction unless Emix signed the
          option to sell agreement, at a time when Emix had already
          committed the closing money to pay out the Bramalea mortgage
          (which was already overdue) and had no other source of funds.</pre>
      <pre>[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of Cumming
J. is set aside and the Bank’s motion for summary judgment is
dismissed.  Emix is entitled to its costs of the motion on a
party-and-party basis (not on a solicitor-and-client basis)
because, in our view, bringing the motion was reasonable.  Emix
is also entitled to its costs of the appeal.
