      <pre>               John R. Morrissey and Ms. Nancy P. Pei, for the respondent</pre>
      <pre>HEARD:         October 5, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the order of Ground J. dated July 8, 1999.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
      <pre>[1]  In our view, the motions judge erred in concluding that this
was a proper case for applying Rule 21.01(1)(a).
[2]  The question whether a term should be implied into a
contract is a mixed question of fact and law.  This is clear from
the direction of the motions judge that the details or content of
the term can only be determined after a trial.  At the trial
there will be evidence on the issue of the content of the term
which will augment the pleadings.  That evidence may well affect
the conclusion as to the nature of the implied term and, in
particular, which party was to receive the legal benefit of Mr.
Wolda’s inventions.  The evidence may also indicate that no term
should be implied. The early decision of the question answered
here will simply inhibit the trial judge.
[3]   The appeal is therefore allowed, and the order of Ground J.
is set aside.
[4]  The motion is dismissed with costs here and below.</pre>
