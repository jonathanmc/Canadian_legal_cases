    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice A. Rosenberg dated
December 17, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Pursuant  to Rule 22 of the Rules of Civil Procedure,  Teck
Corporation  brought  a motion on an agreed  statement  of  facts
seeking an answer to the following question: &quot;Can Teck claim  the
[tax]  exemption afforded to a 'major expansion  of  an  existing
mine' if the mine is not in operation for the five calendar years
preceding the year of the expansion?&quot;
[2]  On December 17, 1998, Rosenberg J. answered this question in
the negative on the basis of his interpretation of the relevant
provisions of the Mining Tax Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.15 (the
&quot;Act&quot;) and the regulation made thereunder, Regulation 769 R.R.O.
1990 (the &quot;Regulation&quot;).
[3]  Teck appealed, arguing first that the Act gave it this
exemption and, second, that there were no technical defects in
its filing that could deny Teck the exemption.
[4]  At the conclusion of Teck's argument, the court indicated
that it agreed with the statutory interpretation of Rosenberg J.,
that the appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs, and as a
consequence, the court need not address the technical defects
said by the Minister of Finance to deprive Teck of the exemption
it asserts. The court also indicated that it would issue reasons
for its decision. These are those reasons.
[5]  The provisions of the Act and the Regulation that are
relevant to this matter are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Section 1(1) of the Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>                &quot;mine&quot; means any opening in the ground,
          any  working  of the ground and any  tailings
          source from or by which any mineral substance
          is  taken,  and  comprises the mining  claim,
          mining location and the whole parcel of  land
          in which any such tailings source does or did
          exist  or  such  workings are  or  have  been
          carried on in Ontario;
          </pre>
    <pre>                3(6)  If  the operator so  elects,  the
          operator's profit for the taxation year shall
          not include the operator's profit, if any, as
          determined   under  subsection  (b),   earned
          during that portion of the exempt period that
          falls within the taxation year,
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  from a new mine that has come into
                    existence after the 20th day of May, 1987; or
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)   from a major expansion of  an
                    existing  mine  that  has  occurred
                    after the 20th day of May 1987,
          </pre>
    <pre>                 in   which   the   operator   has   an
          interest,    upon    the    filing    of    a
          declaration    in    the   prescribed    form
          with     the    operator's    return    under
          subsection     7(1)     for     the     first
          taxation   year  in  which   a   portion   of
          the exempt period occurs.
          </pre>
    <pre>                3(9)  In subsection (6), (8) and  (11),
          &quot;exempt  period&quot; means, in respect of  a  new
          mine  that has come into existence or a major
          expansion  of  an  existing  mine  that   has
          occurred,   the  thirty  six   month   period
          commencing  with the month during  which  the
          new  mine  or the major expansion  came  into
          production     in    reasonable    commercial
          quantities.
          </pre>
    <pre>                3(10)     For the purpose of subsection
          (9),  a new mine or a major expansion  of  an
          existing  mine shall be deemed to  have  come
          into   production  in  reasonable  commercial
          quantities,
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  in the case of a new mine, on the
                    first day of the month when the operator
                    thereof first becomes entitled to receive
                    proceeds from the output of the mine; and
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)    in  the  case  of  a   major
                    expansion of an existing  mine,  on
                    the  first  day that  the  rate  of
                    production  of  mineral  substances
                    from the expanded mine exceeded  by
                    at  least  30 per cent the  average
                    daily rate of production of mineral
                    substances  from  the  mine  during
                    each  of  the  five calendar  years
                    ending   immediately   before   the
                    calendar  year in which  the  first
                    outlay was made to expand the mine.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Subsection 7(2) of Regulation 769:
          </pre>
    <pre>                For the purposes of subsection 3(6)  of
          the  Act,  a  major expansion of an  existing
          mine  shall be considered to occur after  the
          20th day of May, 1987 where,
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  as a result of an investment in an
                    existing mine, the daily rate of production
                    of mineral substances from the mine exceeds
                    by at least 30 per cent the average daily
                    rate of production of the mine during each of
                    the five calendar years ending immediately
                    before the calendar year in which the first
                    outlay was made to expand the mine;</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The facts germane to this matter are these.
[7]  The claim for exemption was made by Teck as the operator of
the Williams mine situated on a property in Northern Ontario. The
plan of development for the mine was settled on in 1984. However,
ore production did not commence until October 1985. Hence, the
parties agreed that prior to 1985 the property was not a mine for
the purposes of the Act.
[8]  In July of 1987 the first expenditures were made to
significantly expand the mine. The first day on which production
from the mine, including the expansion, exceeded by 30 per cent
the average daily rate of production from the mine for each of
the years 1985, 1986, and 1987 occurred in September 1988.
[9]  Teck first claimed an exemption for the major expansion of
an existing mine in its return under the Act for 1988. Teck
defined the &quot;average daily rate of production&quot; of the mine during
each of the five calendar years ending immediately before the
calendar year in which the first outlay was made to expand the
mine as follows:
                         1982      0
                         1983      0
                         1984      0
                         1985      2,208 tonnes per day
                         1986      3,369 tonnes per day</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The Minister disallowed Teck's claim for exemption  on  the
basis  that  Teck  could not undertake a major  expansion  of  an
existing  mine within the meaning of the Act unless the mine  had
been  in  production  for the five calendar years  preceding  the
commencement  of the expansion. Following this disallowance,  the
case was stated to Rosenberg J.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[11]  Given  this context, what is the appropriate interpretation
to  be  given  to  the relevant provisions of  the  Act  and  the
Regulation?   As  Professor Sullivan states in  Driedger  on  the
Construction of Statutes, 3rd ed., at p. 131:
          </pre>
    <pre>             An appropriate interpretation is one that can be justified
        in terms of (a) its plausibility, that is, its compliance with
        the legislative text; (b) its efficacy, that is, its promotion of
        the legislative purpose; and (c) its acceptability, that is, the
        outcome is reasonable and just.</pre>
    <pre>[12] I turn first to the ordinary meaning of the legislative text
because,  as Professor Sullivan says at p. 7 of her book,  it  is
presumed  that this is the most appropriate meaning  and  in  the
absence of a reason to reject it, the ordinary meaning prevails.
[13] The critical pre-condition for the exemption is set out in
s. 3(10)(b) of the Act and repeated almost precisely in s. 7(2)
of the Regulation: a major expansion of an existing mine occurs
once the daily rate of production from the mine &quot;exceeds by at
least 30 per cent the average daily rate of production from the
mine during each of the five calendar years ending immediately
before the calendar year in which the first outlay was made to
expand the mine&quot;.
[14] The first outlay to expand the Williams mine was made in
1987. Teck argues that by 1988 the daily production from the
mine, including the expansion, exceeded by at least 30 per cent
the relevant numbers for each of the five years preceding 1987,
namely 0, 0, 0, 2,208 tonnes per day, and 3,369 tonnes per day.
[15] The Minister argues that the exemption requires the mine to
be operating in each of the five relevant years, because only
then can the required comparison be made with the average daily
rate of production during each of those five years.
[16] In my view, the ordinary meaning of the legislation sustains
the Minister's position. The legislation conditions the exemption
on a comparison between the daily production post-expansion and
the average daily rate of production for each of the five years
preceding the first outlay for the expansion. For there to be an
average daily rate of production from a mine for each of those
five years, there must be a mine in existence in each of those
years. Only an existing mine can have a daily rate of production
which can be averaged. In this case, it is acknowledged that
there was no mine in existence for three of those five years,
namely 1982, 1983 and 1984. The exemption was therefore
unavailable.
[17] The position of Teck would, I think, necessitate rather
different legislative language, such as language that required
the expanded production to exceed the production during &quot;any&quot; of
the prior five years. Such language would not indicate a
legislative intention that the mine be in existence in each of
the five relevant years. This is not, however, the wording of
this Act and this Regulation.
[18] Moreover, it does no violence to the legislative purpose to
interpret this legislation as requiring that the major expansion
exemption be available to a mine only if it has been in operation
for the five years preceding the year of expansion. This
legislation is designed to encourage new mines and major
expansions of existing mines, but also to raise tax revenue. A
mine in the position of the Williams mine receives an exemption
in its first three years of operation as a new mine. It must then
pay taxes for two years before it can then commence a major
expansion which will entitle it to a further three-year
exemption. This outcome is true to the legislative purpose.
[19] In summary, the statutory interpretation given by
Rosenberg J. reflects the ordinary meaning of the Act and the
Regulation. It is consistent with the legislative purpose and
achieves a reasonable and balanced outcome. In my view, it is the
correct interpretation.
[20] The major expansion exemption is, therefore, not available
to the appellant. The appeal must be dismissed with costs.
