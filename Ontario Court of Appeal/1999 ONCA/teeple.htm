    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. KEVIN TEEPLE
               (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        OSBORNE A.C.J.O., WEILER and FELDMAN JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Michael Lomer
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Randolv Schwartz
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         July 9, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Douglas
Belch dated June 12, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We do not think that given the narrow scope of certiorari,
the motions judge erred in dismissing the application.  There was
nothing in the circumstances of this case to require a Provincial
Court judge to conduct an inquiry concerning the appellant&#146;s
waiver, through counsel, of the preliminary inquiry.  Thus, the
committing judge, in our view, committed no jurisdictional error.
[2]  The issue of the ineffective assistance of counsel raised in
the appellant&#146;s affidavit can be dealt with on appeal if the
appellant is convicted, or perhaps by way of an application
seeking Charter relief at trial.
[3]  Thus, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
