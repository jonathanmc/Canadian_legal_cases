    <pre>HEARD:         November 10, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of The Honourable Mr. Justice
Ewaschuk dated October 27, 1995.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  There are three grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The Charge of Incapacity to Consent</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge charged the jury that there could be no
legitimate consent to the sexual activities involving two of the
complainants if they were incapable of consenting.  The charge
was necessary with respect to count 5 which involved one of the
two complainants.  There was ample evidence from which the jury
could infer that the complainant was incapable of consenting when
the appellant initiated the sexual assault against her.  She
testified that she was in a &#147;light sleep&#148; when the appellant
commenced the assault.  The trial judge&#146;s instructions were
appropriate.
[3]  With respect to the other complainant (counts 7, 8 and 9),
it may be that the evidence did not raise the question of her
incapacity to consent.  Her position was that she did not
consent.  In our view, however, the trial judge&#146;s brief
references to the question of incapacity could not have
distracted the jury from the true issue in these counts &#150; did the
complainant consent?  The references to incapacity caused no
prejudice to the appellant on these counts.</pre>
    <pre>Evidence of prior complaints by one of the complainants</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The complainant on counts 1 through 5 told several people
about the assault on the evening of the assault and the next
morning.  The Crown led evidence that she told these people she
was assaulted but did not lead evidence of the details of the
complaints.  The Crown also led evidence of a diary entry made by
the complainant on the night of the assault.
[5]  The evidence went in without objection.  The defence alleged
recent fabrication and also made an all-out attack on the
credibility of this young complainant.  Given this approach by
the defence, the evidence of the prior consistent statements was
admissible.  To the extent that the evidence of the complaints
came to dominate this complainant&#146;s evidence, it was a direct
result of defence counsel&#146;s decision to attack her credibility by
eliciting details of those prior complaints and her failure to
make complaints to other persons.</pre>
    <pre>Reply Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Whatever significance the evidence called on reply may have
had, it derived that significance from the appellant&#146;s testimony
concerning his involvement in the marijuana use in the apartment.
We see no error in admitting this evidence on reply and also no
prejudice to the appellant.  The evidence went in without
objection.  This ground of appeal fails.
[7]  The appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
