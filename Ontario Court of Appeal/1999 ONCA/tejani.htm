    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Grossi J. dated December 11, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal raises an important point about the mens rea for
the  offence of money laundering:  whether the Crown  must  prove
only  that  the  accused intended to convert  one  currency  into
another  or  whether the Crown must also prove that  the  accused
intended to disguise the origin of the money.
[2]  The appellant, Roshan Ali Tejani, was a currency exchange
dealer. He was asked by a former drug dealer, turned police
agent, to exchange $100,000 Canadian into U.S. funds. The money
had been given to the agent by the police. The appellant accepted
the money but before he could convert it, he was arrested and
charged with attempted money laundering under s. 19.2 of the
Narcotic Control Act.1  He was tried and convicted by a jury, but
on appeal this court set aside the conviction and ordered a new
trial.2
[3]  On his second trial, this time before a judge alone, Grossi
J., the appellant was again convicted of attempting to launder
money. He was sentenced to two years&#146; imprisonment and ordered to
pay a $20,000 fine. He appeals to this court against both his
conviction and his sentence. On his conviction appeal, he submits
that the trial judge made several errors of law concerning the
mens rea for money laundering and, alternatively, that the
verdict was unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  appellant  owned and operated  the  &#147;Toronto  Currency
Exchange&#148;, a chain of currency exchanges in the Toronto area.  In
1989,  he  began doing business with Vincent Debellis.  Debellis,
then  a drug dealer, who later became an undercover police agent,
was the Crown&#146;s main witness at trial.
[5]  By 1988, Debellis had become a large scale cocaine dealer.
He imported up to 300 to 400 kilograms of cocaine a month from
Florida and distributed it in Canada. He testified that the U.S.
dollar is the currency of choice in the drug world. Between
February 1989 and June 1989, Debellis regularly used the
appellant&#146;s currency exchanges to convert Canadian currency into
U.S. funds so that he could pay off his cocaine suppliers in
Florida. He exchanged up to $250,000 every week.
[6]  Debellis testified that the appellant never asked him his
name, his line of business, or the source of his money. Nor did
the appellant, or any of his employees, ask Debellis to fill out
any forms. By June 1989, Debellis had exchanged approximately $4
million at the appellant&#146;s currency exchanges. With his service
charge of 2%, the appellant would have made about $80,000 from
Debellis&#146; business.
[7]  In June 1989, Debellis switched to another currency exchange
dealer, which had a lower service fee. In 1991, Debellis was
arrested and charged with several drug offences. He then
approached the police and offered to act as a police agent in
exchange for immunity. Debellis was never prosecuted for any of
his offences.
[8]  In October 1991, Debellis re-established contact with the
appellant, this time as an undercover agent. His job was to find
out whether the appellant knew the source of Debellis&#146; money. He
met with the appellant twice &#150; on October 1 and October 24, 1991.
Both times he wore a body pack and a microphone to record his
conversations. These two meetings form the basis of the charge
against the appellant.
[9]  When Debellis entered the appellant&#146;s exchange on October 1,
1991, the appellant took him into a private cubicle. Debellis
explained that for the past two years he had been using another
exchange because the appellant&#146;s commission rate was too high. He
told the appellant that he had to change $200,000 Canadian into
U.S. funds. He asked if he could pick up the U.S. funds in
Buffalo. Debellis testified that the appellant had suggested this
arrangement to him in 1989 and that he now asked if he could take
him up on his suggestion. The appellant, however, said no.
Debellis testified that he pushed the appellant on this issue,
but he would not budge.
[10] However, the appellant did say that if Debellis left the
$200,000 he could pick up his money the next day and that his
service fee was now 1%, the industry standard in 1991. According
to Debellis, the appellant said that he would use the money to
purchase U.S. dollars and that he would receive a locked-in rate
if he exchanged the money that day. Debellis also testified that
the appellant asked him:  &#147;Where is everybody?&#148;, to which
Debellis replied:  &#147;They are in the United States.&#148;  The
appellant laughed and said:  &#147;Oh, investing.&#148;  The appellant also
asked Debellis why he had decided to return to his store.
Debellis said that he had a lot of money to exchange and that the
other exchange he had been using could not handle a volume of a
half million dollars every week. The appellant replied that he
would handle this volume if Debellis would deal exclusively with
him.
[11] On October 24, 1991, Debellis returned to the appellant&#146;s
exchange with $100,000 of police money. He was told to make it
&#147;crystal clear&#148; to the appellant that the money came from the
drug trade. The appellant again took Debellis into a private
room, which had a glass partition separating them. On the
appellant&#146;s side of the partition was a counter and a counting
machine. Money could be passed through a slot under the
partition. Debellis&#146; microphone was on his side of the partition.
The transcript of the recorded conversation does not disclose
that the appellant had any difficulty hearing Debellis.
[12] Debellis told the appellant he was late because some friends
of his had been &#147;busted on the road for drugs&#148; and consequently
he had lost $300,000. The appellant asked:  &#147;on the road, at
home?&#148;, and Debellis replied:  &#147;yah, on the road&#148;. Debellis
described his friends but did not name them. The appellant then
asked Debellis to fill out a form, stating his name, birth date
and social security number and the source of his funds. Debellis
argued with the appellant over the form and told him that he did
not want to get his fingerprints on it and that he did not want
to create a paper trail because he did not want to get busted.
The appellant said that he would keep the form in a file.
Debellis told him to fill out the form himself. Debellis could
not recall what he and the appellant finally decided about the
form.
[13] However, Debellis testified that while they were discussing
the form, the appellant took the $100,000, counted it in the
machine and gave Debellis a receipt for the money less his 1%
fee. Debellis told the appellant he would be back that afternoon
to pick up the U.S. funds. That concluded Debellis&#146; evidence. The
trial judge found his evidence to be credible. He commented:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find Mr. Debellis&#146; evidence to be credible. He
          acknowledges his extreme involvement in the use, sale and
          importation of drugs and the large amounts of money handled. He
          admitted that he was aware, if convicted of the charges he faced,
          he would be imprisoned for a lengthy period of time. He agreed
          that he approached the police on arrest and he cooperated with
          them to alleviate his fear for his family&#146;s lives and for being
          allowed to keep his house.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Detective  Perkins also testified for  the  Crown.  Perkins
confirmed  that  Debellis had been acting as a police  agent  and
that  he had observed Debellis enter the appellant&#146;s exchange  on
October 1 and October 24, 1991. Perkins testified that on October
24,  Debellis was inside the appellant&#146;s exchange for 12 minutes.
After Debellis left, the police executed a search warrant on  the
exchange.  The appellant was later arrested and charged.  He  did
not testify at trial.</pre>
    <pre>A.   THE MENS REA ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The  appellant was charged with money laundering  under  s.
19.2 of the former Narcotic Control Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>               19.2(1)   No person shall use, transfer the possession of,
          send or deliver to any person or place, transport, transmit,
          alter, dispose of or otherwise deal with, in any manner and by
          any means, any property or proceeds of any property with intent
          to conceal or convert that property or those proceeds and knowing
          that all or part of that property or those proceeds was obtained
          or derived directly or indirectly as a result of
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)  the commission in Canada of an
                    offence under section 4, 5 or 6; or
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)    an  act  or  omission
                    anywhere  that, if it had  occurred
                    in  Canada,  would have constituted
                    an offence under section 4, 5 or 6.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (2)   Every person who contravenes subsection (1)
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (a)   is  guilty  of an  indictable
                    offence and liable to imprisonment for a term
                    not exceeding ten years; or
          </pre>
    <pre>                          (b)   is guilty of an offence
                    punishable on summary conviction.</pre>
    <pre>[16]  The  Crown  alleged that the appellant  believed  Debellis&#146;
funds were obtained as a result of the commission in Canada of an
offence under s. 4 or s. 5 of the Act. Section 4 prohibited  drug
trafficking and s. 5 prohibited drug importing and exporting.3
[17] The Narcotic Control Act was repealed in 1996 and replaced
by the Controlled Drugs and Substance Act,4 which combined the
Food and Drugs Act5 and the Narcotic Control Act. Section 9 of
the new Act is essentially the same as s. 19.2 of the Narcotic
Control Act.
[18] The mens rea for money laundering under s. 19.2 of the
Narcotic Control Act and under the similar provision in of the
Criminal Code,6 was discussed extensively by the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Dynar.7  Dynar establishes that the mens rea of
money laundering is belief not knowledge. Thus, to prove the
offence of attempting to launder the proceeds of crime, the Crown
need only show that the accused believed the money was derived
from the commission of illegal drug dealing. The Crown does not
have to show that the accused&#146;s belief was correct. Justices Cory
and Iacobucci made this point in Dynar:8
          </pre>
    <pre>               Both s. 462.31(1) of the Criminal Code and s. 19.2(1) of the
          Narcotic Control Act require knowledge that the property being
          laundered is the proceeds of crime. It is tempting to think that
          knowledge is therefore the mens rea of these offences. But &#147;mens
          rea&#148; denotes a mental state. Mens rea is the subjective element
          of a crime. Knowledge is not subjective, or, more accurately, it
          is not entirely subjective.
          </pre>
    <pre>                As we have already said, knowledge, for
          legal  purposes,  is true  belief.  Knowledge
          therefore  has  two components  &#150;  truth  and
          belief  &#150; and of these, only belief is mental
          or  subjective.  Truth is  objective,  or  at
          least  consists  in the correspondence  of  a
          proposition  or  mental  state  to  objective
          reality. Accordingly, truth, which is a state
          of  affairs in the external world  that  does
          not  vary  with the intention of the accused,
          cannot be a part of mens rea. As one Canadian
          academic has said, [translation] &#147;[t]he truth
          of  the  accused&#146;s belief is not part of  the
          mens  rea  of  s. 24(1) Cr.C.&#148;. Knowledge  as
          such  is not then the mens rea of the  money-
          laundering  offences. Belief  is.  [citations
          omitted]</pre>
    <pre>[19]  Following  Dynar, s. 462.31 of the Code and  s.  9  of  the
Controlled Drugs and Substances Act were amended to read &#147;knowing
or  believing&#148;,  thus making explicit the belief requirement  for
the mens rea of the offence.
[20] In light of Dynar, the appellant acknowledges the trial
judge correctly held that the Crown need only prove that the
appellant believed Debellis&#146; money was derived from illicit drug
dealing, not whether this belief was correct. However, the
appellant submits that the trial judge&#146;s finding of mens rea was
flawed by three errors in law:
          </pre>
    <pre>      (i)   most importantly, the trial judge erred by failing
            to hold that &#147;the intent to convert&#148; in s. 19.2 includes an
            intent to disguise the origin of the money;
          </pre>
    <pre>      (ii)  the trial judge erred by holding that the appellant had the
            required mens rea even though he believed only that Debellis&#146;
            money was derived from some unspecified criminal activity;
          </pre>
    <pre>       (iii) the trial judge erred by applying a reasonable person
             standard in finding that the appellant was wilfully blind to the
             source of Debellis&#146; money.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>                    1.   The Intent to
Conceal or Convert</pre>
    <pre>[21]  This is the main point in the appeal. Section 19.2  of  the
Narcotic Control Act requires the Crown to prove the accused  had
the &#147;intent to conceal or convert&#148;. The appellant submits that if
the  Crown is relying on an intent to convert, as it is  in  this
case,  then  it  must also prove the accused had  the  intent  to
disguise or hide the origin of the money. Interpreting convert to
mean  merely exchanging money, the appellant argues, does no more
than  repeat  the  actus reus of the offence and  will  have  the
effect  of  trapping  legitimate  currency  exchange  traders  in
criminal liability.
[22] The trial judge rejected this submission. He concluded that
changing money from one currency to another can amount to money
laundering and indeed that &#147;exchanging Canadian currency for
American is a standard technique of money launderers&#148;. I agree
with the trial judge that the intent to convert in s. 19.2 of the
Narcotic Control Act does not have to be accompanied by an intent
to disguise.
[23] The appellant&#146;s argument turns on a question of statutory
interpretation, and thus on ascertaining Parliament&#146;s intention.
As with all questions of statutory interpretation, the court must
interpret the relevant legislative provision in its total
context. The court&#146;s interpretation should take into account the
words used, the purpose of the provision, the Act as a whole and
any relevant and admissible indicators of what the legislature
meant.
[24] Section 19.2 of the Narcotic Control Act and s. 462.31 of
the Criminal Code were added to their respective statutes on
January 1, 1989 by Bill C-61, commonly referred to as the
Proceeds of Crime Act.9  Bill C-61 originated in the 1988 Vienna
Convention. In 1984 the United Nations General Assembly began
efforts to promulgate a treaty that targeted drug trafficking.
Its efforts succeeded four years later, in December 1988, when
the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic
Drugs and Psychotropic Substances was completed in Vienna. Canada
is a party to the Convention, which requires all signatories to
prohibit laundering and permit confiscation of the proceeds of</pre>
    <pre>drug  trafficking. Parliament passed Bill C-61 to  meet  Canada&#146;s
obligations under the Convention.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Bill  C-61 focused on the profits of criminal activity.  It
recognized  that not only had illegal drug trafficking  become  a
grave  societal problem, so too had the laundering of drug money.
It  recognized that the profits of crime had reached unacceptable
levels.  And  it recognized that the existing provisions  of  the
Criminal  Code  and  other federal statutes  had  not  adequately
curtailed  the  increasingly sophisticated methods of  laundering
money.
[26] I think it evident from Bill C-61&#146;s origin and purpose, and
from the broad language of s. 19.2, that Parliament intended to
cast a wide net over the laundering of the proceeds of illicit
drug dealing. The actus reus of the offence may be committed by
dealing with any property or the proceeds of any property in an
exhaustive list of ways &#150; by using, transferring the possession
of, sending, delivering, transporting, transmitting, attaining,
disposing of, or otherwise dealing in any manner and by any
means. This broad actus reus responds to the concern that money
can be laundered in many different ways: through financial
institutions that take deposits, through currency exchange
businesses, in the securities and insurance industries, through
the use of real estate or corporations, and by buying precious
gems or expensive commodities.
[27] The mens rea of s.19.2 requires both an intent to conceal or
convert property or proceeds, and knowledge that the property or
proceeds were obtained by committing an offence under sections 4,
5 or 6 of the Act. At the time Bill C-61 was passed, legislation
in many American states made money laundering an offence only on
proof of an intent to conceal or disguise the origin of the
money.10  The 1988 Vienna Convention11 includes similar
terminology: the &#147;concealment or disguise of true nature&#148; and the
&#147;conversion or transfer of property&#148; for the &#147;purpose of
concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the property&#148;.
Parliament, however, did not use this narrower language, and I
think it plausible that Parliament deliberately chose not to do
so. Indeed, a parliamentary committee considering Bill C-61
rejected a proposal to replace the words &#147;conceal or convert&#148;
with the word &#147;disguise&#148;.12
[28] The words &#147;conceal&#148; and &#147;convert&#148; are not synonymous.
Conceal does mean to hide. But convert has a broader meaning; it
means to change or transform.13  By using the broader word
&#147;convert&#148;, Parliament no doubt recognized that a good deal of
money laundering is effected by simple currency exchanges, by
simple conversions from Canadian to U.S. dollars. In other words,
although the purpose of laundering money is to disguise the
source of the funds, this disguising is often accomplished by a
mere currency exchange. To prohibit money laundering by simple
currency exchanges, Parliament used the word &#147;convert&#148;.
[29] In doing so, Parliament has not simply re-stated the actus
reus of the offence or set a trap for innocent currency traders.
The mens rea of s. 19.2 has two parts: to support a conviction
the intent to conceal or convert must be accompanied by the
knowledge or belief that the money was derived from the
commission of an offence under ss. 4, 5 or 6 of the Act. The two
parts of the mens rea must be read together, not separately. A
person who converts money from one currency into another
believing the money was obtained from drug trafficking should be
criminally liable. That person is not engaged in legitimate
currency trading.
[30] Moreover, the appellant&#146;s submission asks the court to read
additional words into s. 19.2. To give effect to his submission,
the court must interpret &#147;convert&#148; to include &#147;disguise&#148;. Absent
a good reason, I do not think that the court should read words
into a criminal statute. I do not find any good reason to read
the word &#147;disguise&#148; into s. 19.2. The section is not ambiguous
and, as drafted, gives effect to what I consider to be
Parliament&#146;s obvious intention.
[31] I find support for my conclusion in Dynar, which was an
extradition case. In that case, Mr. Dynar intended to launder
money he believed was derived from drug trafficking by converting
American funds into Canadian currency through various financial
institutions. Cory and Iacobucci JJ. accepted that Dynar could be
guilty of money laundering merely by converting the American
funds which, as in this case, were the government&#146;s money:14
          </pre>
    <pre>               In this case, it is almost certainly true that Mr. Dynar
          would have been content to convert the United States Government&#146;s
          money even if he had known that it had nothing to do with the
          sale of drugs. Presumably his only concern was to collect his
          percentage. The provenance of the money must have been, for him,
          largely irrelevant. But, from the point of view of the criminal
          law, what is important is not what moved Mr. Dynar, but what Mr.
          Dynar believed he was doing. &#147;We have to say that a person
          intends his act in the circumstances that he knows or believes to
          exist.&#148;  And the evidence is clear that Mr. Dynar believed that
          he was embarked upon a scheme to convert &#147;drug money&#148; from New
          York City.</pre>
    <pre>[32]  I  recognize that in R. v. Bouchard15 Pinard J.C.S. of  the
Quebec  Superior Court accepted the argument put forward  by  the
appellant.  Pinard J.C.S. defined the French verb &#147;convertir&#148;  to
mean  &#147;transform  to  conceal its origin&#148; or  &#147;disguise  to  hide
unlawful source&#148;. The facts in Bouchard were unusual.16   But  if
Pinard J.C.S. meant that in all cases changing Canadian funds  to
U.S.  currency cannot amount to conversion under s. 19.2  of  the
Narcotic Control Act, then I respectfully disagree with him.
[33] I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>          2.   Derivation of the Proceeds</pre>
    <pre>[34] The Crown agrees that it cannot obtain a conviction under s.
19.2  of  the  Narcotic Control Act merely by  showing  that  the
appellant   believed  Debellis&#146;  money  was  derived  from   some
unspecified criminal activity. To support a conviction  under  s.
19.2,  the  appellant&#146;s belief must be more specific.  The  Crown
must prove that the appellant believed the money he was asked  to
exchange  was derived from drug trafficking or drug importing  or
exporting contrary to s. 4 or s. 5 of the Act.17
[35] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law by
holding that this specific belief was not required. He relies on
the following passage from the trial judge&#146;s reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The Defence submits that there is a specific element of
          knowledge. In other words, the accused had to know that the
          proceeds were derived from trafficking, possession for the
          purpose of trafficking and importing of narcotics. In my view, it
          is not necessary in this offence to establish the specific
          knowledge of the above offences.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  purpose  of  Section  19.2  is  to
          prosecute  persons  who  conceal  or  convert
          property  or  proceeds of  drug  dealing.  It
          would be unreasonable to hold the Crown to  a
          standard of proving that the accused knew the
          narcotic or narcotics involved and the manner
          or   manners  in  which  the  proceeds   were
          derived.</pre>
    <pre>[36] I  do  not  agree  with  the appellant&#146;s submission.  Immediately
following  this  passage, the trial judge correctly  stated  that
&#147;The mens rea of laundering consists of both the intent to either
conceal  or  convert  the  property and the  knowledge  that  the
property  is  proceeds of an offence under  ss.  4,  5  or  6  of
Narcotic  Control Act.&#148;  In the passage the appellant relies  on,
the  trial judge simply indicated, correctly in my opinion,  that
the  Crown did not have to prove the appellant knew what specific
narcotics were trafficked or how the trafficking was carried out.
In other words, although the Crown was required to prove that the
appellant   believed  Debellis&#146;  money  was  derived   from   the
commission  of an offence under s. 4 or s. 5 of the Act,  it  was
not  required to prove that the appellant knew or had any  belief
about  the details of the offence. The trial judge was  aware  of
what  the Crown was required to prove and found that it had  done
so.
[37] A subsidiary point arises under this ground of appeal, not
canvassed in the trial judge&#146;s reasons. Because the appellant was
charged under s.19.2(1)(a) of the Act, he must have believed not
just that Debellis&#146; money was derived from the commission of an
offence under s. 4 or s. 5, but also that the offence was
committed in Canada. In my view, one can reasonably infer that
the appellant had this belief. He was asked to exchange Canadian
funds into U.S. funds, the preferred currency in the drug trade.
I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>          
          3.   Wilful Blindness</pre>
    <pre>[38]  The  mens rea of the offence of money laundering  under  s.
19.2  of the Narcotic Control Act can be satisfied not only by  a
finding  of  belief  but also by a finding of  wilful  blindness.
Counsel  for the appellant submits that the trial judge erred  in
finding  that the appellant was wilfully blind to the  origin  of
the  money  he  was asked to exchange. I need not  consider  this
submission because I have already concluded the trial  judge  was
correct in finding that the appellant believed the funds  he  was
asked  to  exchange  were the proceeds of illegal  drug  dealing.
Nonetheless,  because the trial judge addressed the  argument  on
wilful blindness, so will I.
[39] Mr. Gold argues that the trial judge erred in applying an
objective standard &#150; the reasonable person &#150; as the measure of
wilful blindness instead of considering the appellant&#146;s
subjective state of mind.18  The trial judge set out the test for
wilful blindness approved by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.
Sansregret:19
          </pre>
    <pre>               A court can properly find wilful blindness only where it can
          also be said that the defendant actually knew. He suspected the
          fact, he realized its probability but he refrained from obtaining
          the final confirmation because he wanted in the event to be able
          to deny knowledge.</pre>
    <pre>[40]  He then applied the test in the following passage on  which
Mr. Gold relies:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, the conduct of the accused constitutes wilful
          blindness. Here, we find the accused familiar with Debellis
          having in the past converted large sums of money to U.S. dollars,
          being asked to convert a hundred thousand dollars to U.S.
          dollars, Debellis is reluctant to sign a form and he explains
          that he doesn&#146;t want his signature or fingerprints on any paper,
          he doesn&#146;t want to provide identification, he talks about a
          person being charged with drug trafficking and a friend being
          arrested for drugs. Surely, the above combined would trigger in
          the mind of a reasonable person that Debellis was a drug dealer
          and these funds are the proceeds of drug deals. Instead, the
          accused accepts the money from Debellis.</pre>
    <pre>[41]  Although  the  trial  judge referred  to  &#147;the  mind  of  a
reasonable  person&#148;, this reference has to be considered  in  its
context.  The  test in Sansregret, which the trial judge  quoted,
contains   the  subjective  requirement  for  wilful   blindness.
Therefore,  I  think  that  the trial judge  was  alive  to  this
requirement.  Moreover,  on  the evidence,  he  could  reasonably
conclude  that  the  appellant shut his eyes  to  the  source  of
Debellis&#146;  money because the appellant knew or strongly suspected
that  inquiring would fix him with the knowledge the  funds  were
the  proceeds of illicit dealing in drugs. Accordingly, the trial
judge  did  not  err in finding that the appellant  was  wilfully
blind. On this alternative basis, the Crown has met the mens  rea
required by s. 19.2 of the Narcotic Control Act.</pre>
    <pre>B.   IS THE VERDICT UNREASONABLE?</pre>
    <pre>[42]  The appellant attacks the reasonableness of the verdict  on
three separate grounds, each of which in my view fails.
[43] First, he submits that his actions did not reasonably amount
to an attempt. He argues that accepting the $100,000 and telling
Debellis to come back later did not go beyond mere preparation.
The Supreme Court of Canada has said numerous times, most
recently in Dynar,20 that &#147;the law of attempt is engaged only
when&#133;the mens rea of the completed offence is present entirely
and the actus reus of it is present in an incomplete but more-
than-merely-preparatory way&#148;. The trial judge applied these
principles and concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find that the accused&#146;s acceptance of the one hundred
          thousand dollars, the discussion with respect to a procedure to
          convert the moneys to U.S. dollars, the counting of the money and
          the agreement for Debellis to return and pick up the moneys did
          amount to an offence under Section 463(b). There was an attempt
          to convert the money and there was an act, more than merely
          preparatory, taken in furtherance of the attempt.</pre>
    <pre>[44] This conclusion is reasonably supported by the evidence. The
actus  reus  of  the  offence is incomplete  because  the  police
intervened  before the appellant could exchange Debellis&#146;  money.
But the appellant&#146;s actions go beyond those of an innocent person
conducting a legitimate currency exchange business. The  previous
dealings  between the appellant and Debellis in  1989,  Debellis&#146;
concern about leaving his fingerprints on the form, the arrest of
Debellis&#146;  friends  for  drug dealing, the  appellant&#146;s  question
&#147;Where  is  everybody?&#148; and his laughing comment &#147;Oh investing.&#148;,
together  show that he took the $100,000 intending to launder  it
for   Debellis  and  that  his  actions  were  more  than  simply
preparatory.
[45] Second, the appellant submits that the verdict is
unreasonable because he had no intent to conceal or convert the
proceeds. This submission fails because of my conclusion that the
Crown does not have to prove an intent to disguise.
[46] Third, the appellant submits the trial judge could not
reasonably conclude he believed or was wilfully blind to the fact
that Debellis&#146; money was derived from Narcotic Control Act
offences. The appellant argues that Debellis&#146; testimony is
evidence of what he heard and understood, not what the appellant,
who was on the other side of the glass partition, could hear and
understand. I do not agree. Although some of the appellant&#146;s
words are not audible on the tape, nothing on the tape suggests
he could not hear and understand Debellis, especially when
Debellis disclosed his involvement in drug trafficking. For
example, the appellant questioned Debellis about what happened to
Debellis&#146; friends who were &#147;busted&#148;:
          </pre>
    <pre>               T:   So what happened to him?
          </pre>
    <pre>               D:   They arrested them for drugs&#133;you
          know which one I&#146;m talking about the blonde
          guy with the moustache, the one that went to
          Bloor, he got arrested and a couple of other
          people.
          </pre>
    <pre>               T:   On the road, at home?
          </pre>
    <pre>               D:   Yeah&#133;on the road.
          </pre>
    <pre>               T:   Yeah.
          </pre>
    <pre>               D:   &#133;so that&#146;s why I didn&#146;t, I didn&#146;t
          come back for two weeks I didn&#146;t know what
          was going on.
          </pre>
    <pre>               T:   Hmm&#133;okay.</pre>
    <pre>[47] The appellant&#146;s words do not show that he had any difficulty
hearing or understanding Debellis.
[48] For these reasons, I conclude that the verdict was
reasonably supported by the evidence. Accordingly, I would
dismiss the conviction appeal.</pre>
    <pre>C.   THE APPEAL AGAINST SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[49]  The  trial  judge  sentenced the appellant  to  two  years&#146;
imprisonment and a $20,000 fine. If the appellant did not pay the
fine within two years, he was to serve a further eight months  in
jail.  At the time of trial, the appellant was 50 years  old  and
had no previous criminal record.
[50] In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge emphasized
general deterrence:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, the major concern in imposing sentence is to
          deter others in the community who might be tempted to participate
          in the laundering facet of the drug trade, a facet that is
          necessary to facilitate the availability of narcotics.</pre>
    <pre>[51]  In  fixing the length of the custodial term,  however,  the
trial  judge  twice  referred to the appellant&#146;s  willingness  to
continue  to  launder  money, &#147;to do future business  for  larger
sums&#148;.  In my view, the trial judge erred in principle by  taking
into  account  what  he  perceived to be the  appellant&#146;s  future
course  of  conduct.  The appellant was  convicted  of  a  single
offence  of  attempting to launder money  and  should  have  been
sentenced  for  that offence. What the trial  judge  thought  the
appellant  might do in the future should have been irrelevant  to
his  sentence.  The  trial judge&#146;s error permits  this  court  to
review the sentence.
[52] Ordinarily, a money laundering offence will attract a
custodial sentence for the very reasons emphasized by the trial
judge. In this case, however, I think the interests of justice
will be served by substituting a conditional sentence of two
years less a day for the two-year jail term. The appellant has
been on bail and thus had his liberty restricted for virtually
this entire decade; he has not breached any of his bail
conditions; he was convicted only of an attempt; his profit on
the single transaction would have been only $1,000; and except
for this offence, he has no record.
[53] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal against sentence. In
place of the two-year jail term, I would order that the appellant
serve a sentence of two years less a day in the community on the
mandatory statutory conditions in s.742.3(1) of the Code. The
fine of $20,000 imposed by the trial judge shall remain. The
appellant shall have two years from the date of the release of
this judgment to pay the fine, failing which he shall, as
directed by the trial judge, serve eight months in jail.
