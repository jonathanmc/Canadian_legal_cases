</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the Order of Wilkins  J. dated November 26, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant sued the respondent Kruger, an RCMP officer,
and others for malicious prosecution. The appellant moved for pre-
trial production by Kruger, or in the alternative by the RCMP, of
all the RCMP files relating to a criminal investigation and an
unsuccessful prosecution of the appellant for a number of charges
of fraud.
[2]  Master Schreider made an order under Rule 30.10 of the
Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure requiring that the RCMP, which
was not a party in the action, produce all of the files and
documents in its possession relating to the investigation and
prosecution of the appellant.
[3]  On an appeal brought by the respondents, Wilkins J. set
aside the order of the Master, holding that Rule 30.10 does not
apply to the RCMP because, as an agent of the federal Crown, the
RCMP cannot be compelled to make pre-trial production of
documents in proceedings in the Ontario court in which it is not
a party. This appeal is from that order. For the reasons set out
below I would allow the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In 1979 the appellant was a lawyer practising in Sudbury. As
a result of complaints made by two of his former clients, one of
whom is the respondent Wright, the police began an investigation
into certain land transactions. Kruger, who was a corporal in the
fraud section of the RCMP detachment in Sudbury at the time,
conducted the investigation with other officers from the RCMP,
the Ontario Provincial Police and the Sudbury Regional Police
Force.
[5]  Informations charging the appellant with fraud were sworn in
November of 1982 and March 1983. In February of 1984, after a
trial in the District Court in Sudbury, the appellant was
acquitted on all charges.
[6]  In 1985, the appellant brought an action claiming damages
for malicious prosecution against several defendants including
the Commissioner of the RCMP, the Commissioner of the O.P.P., the
Chief of the Sudbury Regional Police Force, the Crown in right of
Ontario and a number of individual defendants, among them the
respondents Kruger and Wright.
[7]  The action against the Commissioner of the RCMP was
discontinued in 1986. Subsequently, for reasons that are not
germane to this appeal, the action was also terminated against
all of the other defendants except the two respondents.
[8]  In defending the action, the respondents have been
represented by a counsel from the Department of Justice,
presumably because Kruger was an RCMP officer and Wright was a
secretary employed by the RCMP, and the conduct complained of by
the appellant arose in the course of their duties as employees of
the Crown.
[9]  In 1991, during the course of the examination for discovery
of Kruger, the appellant requested production of Kruger&#146;s files
and any other investigation files of the RCMP.
[10] The files were not produced. Shortly afterwards the
appellant began an extensive campaign pursuing every possible
avenue to gain access to these documents. In late 1992 he filed a
motion seeking to compel production by the RCMP of its
investigation files, only to withdraw that motion upon being
advised by counsel from the Department of Justice that the RCMP
had no documents except those that were created for the
appellant&#146;s 1984 trial.
[11] Subsequently the appellant was advised that Kruger was
unable to locate his own notes of the investigation. In the years
following, the appellant made repeated inquiries attempting to
locate these notes. He had correspondence with the Department of
Justice, the federal Solicitor General and the RCMP. He contacted
the Ontario Ministry of the Attorney General, which had conducted
the prosecution, and the Law Society of Upper Canada, where a
discipline file had been opened. He had no success.</pre>
    <pre>[12] In January 1997 the appellant filed the motion that gives
rise to this appeal. After service of the motion record, counsel
from the Department of Justice, who was representing the
respondents, produced some of Kruger&#146;s notes that covered only a
limited period of time during the investigation. In addition, he
advised, for the first time, that there were 10 bankers&#146; boxes of
documents relating to the investigation in the possession of the
RCMP. However, he refused to produce the 10 boxes of documents
claiming federal Crown immunity from pre-trial production and
discovery obligations.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Mr. LeBlanc, who represented the respondents on the appeal
before Wilkins J. and in this court, was not involved in the
communications that preceded the motion before the Master nor did
he appear on that motion.</pre>
    <pre>THE PROCEEDINGS</pre>
    <pre>     The Motion before the Master</pre>
    <pre>[14] The relief sought on the motion before the Master included:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)       An order under Rule 30.06 requiring Kruger to deliver a
          further and better affidavit of documents, including all files
          and documents in the possession of the RCMP for the period from
          1979 to 1984 relating to the investigation and prosecution of the
          appellant; or
(b)       In the alternative, an order under Rule 30.10 requiring
Her Majesty The Queen in right of Canada as represented by the
RCMP to produce the same files and documents.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Although the RCMP was served with the motion materials, it
did not appear on the return of the motion. Counsel representing
the respondents assured the court that exhaustive searches had
failed to turn up any of Kruger&#146;s notes other than those that had
been produced after the appellant had served his motion material.
[16] The Master granted the alternative relief and ordered that
the RCMP produce all of its files relating to the investigation
and prosecution. In his reasons, the Master found that the
documents were relevant to the material issues in the action and
that it would be manifestly unfair to require the appellant to
proceed to trial without those documents. It is implicit that the
Master was of the view that he could make an order under Rule
30.10 that would be binding on the federal Crown, represented by
the RCMP.
[17] The Master made no reference in his reasons or in the formal
order to the appellant&#146;s request for an order that Kruger provide
a further and better affidavit of documents, including all of the
files in the possession of the RCMP.</pre>
    <pre>     The Appeal to the General Division</pre>
    <pre>[18] The respondents appealed to a single judge of the Ontario
Court (General Division). The appellant did not cross-appeal the
failure of the Master to make an order against Kruger under Rule
30.06.
[19] On the argument on the appeal, Mr. LeBlanc, who represented
the respondents, also appeared as agent for the Attorney General
of Canada to represent the interests of the RCMP. He argued that
Rule 30.10 did not bind the RCMP because, as an agency of the
federal Crown, it is immune from pre-trial non-party production
obligations.
[20] Wilkins J. allowed the appeal and set aside the Master&#146;s
order (reported at (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 597 (Ont. Gen. Div.)).
In doing so, he reasoned that at common law a stranger or non-
party to a proceeding was not compellable for the purpose of
providing pre-trial documentary or oral discovery. He held that
the language of Rule 30.10 did not expressly bind the Crown and
that in the absence of express legislation, the Crown remained in
the same position as all non-parties at common law and was
therefore not compellable for pre-trial production and discovery.
Having reached this conclusion, Wilkins J. did not find it
necessary to determine whether a provincial enactment, such as
Rule 30.10, as a matter of constitutional law could bind the
federal Crown. Wilkins J. ordered the appellant to pay the costs
of the motion before the Master and of the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     The Appeal to this Court</pre>
    <pre>[21] On this appeal, the appellant seeks to set aside the order
of Wilkins J. and to have the order of the Master reinstated. In
addition, the appellant asks this court to make an order under
Rule 30.06 that Kruger produce all relevant documents, including
his own notes and records and those of all other investigating
officers from the RCMP. In this court, Mr. LeBlanc also
represented both the respondents and the Attorney General of
Canada.
[22] At the conclusion of the hearing of this appeal, the court
requested that the parties file additional written argument
addressing the applicability of the 1990 amendments to the Crown
Liability and Proceedings Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50, (&#147;CLPA&#148;) as
amended by S.C. 1990, c. 8, s. 31 to the issues in this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant&#146;s arguments can be reduced to three points:
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.        The Master&#146;s order should be reinstated because Wilkins
          J. erred in holding that Rule 30.10 does not bind the federal
          Crown.
2.        Alternatively, s. 27 of the CLPA constitutes the
necessary federal statutory authority to render Rule 30.10
binding on the federal Crown.
3.        This court should make an order requiring Kruger to
produce his own notes and those of the other investigating
officers from the RCMP.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[24] A number of matters are not in issue.
[25] First, it is accepted that the RCMP is a federal Crown
agency and that it enjoys all the immunities, prerogatives and
privileges of the Crown in right of Canada:  R. v. Eldorado
Nuclear Ltd., [1983] 2 S.C.R. 551. In the discussion that
follows, I will often refer to the federal Crown without
repeating the point that, in this case, it is the federal Crown
represented by the RCMP.
[26] Second, the respondents did not appeal the Master&#146;s findings
that the RCMP is in possession of documents that are relevant to
material issues in the action and that it would be unfair to
require the appellant to proceed to trial without discovery of
those documents.
[27] Further, the parties are in agreement that an order
compelling the RCMP to produce documents would be subject to
claims of privilege including those that may be made under s. 37
of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, based on the
public interest. This appeal therefore addresses issues of
compellability, not of privilege.
[28] Finally, it is clear that the federal Crown is not a party
to the appellant&#146;s action. It was for that reason that the
appellant sought an order against the RCMP under Rule 30.10 which
applies to non-parties. The fact the appellant is suing two Crown
employees does not constitute this as an action against the
federal Crown.</pre>
    <pre>     Issue 1 &#150; The Application of Rule 30.10</pre>
    <pre>[29] Rule 30.10 provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               30.10 (1)  The court may, on motion by a party, order
          production for inspection of a document that is in the
          possession, control or power of a person not a party and is not
          privileged where the court is satisfied that,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the document is relevant to a
          material issue in the action; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) it would be unfair to require the
            moving party to proceed to trial without
            having discovery of the document.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[30] The appellant argues that the common law does not recognize
Crown immunity from pre-trial discovery when the Crown is not a
party to the proceeding within which the production or discovery
is sought. The appellant submits that as a result Rule 30.10,
which applies to &#147;a person not a party,&#148; without more, is binding
on the federal Crown.
[31] The short answer to this argument is that this case involves
the Crown in right of Canada. It is well established that the
provincial legislature cannot validly enact legislation that
affects the federal Crown in a compulsory manner. See Her Majesty
The Queen in right of Alberta v. Canadian Transport Commission,
[1978] 1 S.C.R. 61. Rule 30.10 is a provincial enactment that, if
applicable, would have a compulsory effect on the federal Crown.
For that reason alone, this argument of the appellant must fail.
[32] Moreover, I agree with Wilkins J. that the language in Rule
30.10 which permits the court to make an order compelling
production &#147;by a person not a party,&#148; does not expressly or by
necessary implication bind the Crown. In the absence of
legislation that has the effect of binding the Crown to Rule
30.10, the Crown, like all non-parties to a proceeding at common
law, would not be compellable for purposes of pre-trial
production or discovery.1
[33] For both of these reasons, I am satisfied that Rule 30.10 of
the Ontario Rules, standing alone, does not permit the court to
make an order that is binding on the federal Crown.</pre>
    <pre>     Issue 2 &#150; Section 27 of the Crown Liability and Proceedings
Act</pre>
    <pre>[34] The appellant then argues that s. 27 of the CLPA constitutes
the necessary federal legislative authority to bind the federal
Crown to Rule 30.10 of the Ontario Rules. This argument was not
made before Wilkins J.
[35] Section 27 provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Except as otherwise provided by this Act or the Regulations,
          the rules of practice and procedure in the court in which
          proceedings are taken apply in those proceedings.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[36] The issue is one of statutory construction. It seems to me
that the interpretation of this section is best approached by
asking two questions:
     ·    Does s. 27 have the effect of binding the federal Crown to
       the rules of practice and procedure referred to in the section?
     </pre>
    <pre>     ·    If so, do the &#147;proceedings&#148; referred to in s. 27 include
       proceedings in a court of a province in which the federal Crown
       is not a party?

</pre>
    <pre>     Does s. 27 bind the federal Crown?</pre>
    <pre>[37] In my view, the answer to this question is clearly &#147;yes.&#148;
At common law the Crown could only be bound to legislation by
express language or by necessary implication:  Province of Bombay
v. Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay et al., [1947]
A.C. 58 at 61 (P.C.).
[38] The common law rule has been codified in s. 17 of the
Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 which was first enacted
in its present form in 1967 and reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her
          Majesty or Her Majesty&#146;s rights or prerogatives in any manner,
          except as mentioned or referred to in the enactment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[39] In Alberta Government Telephones v. Canadian Radio-
television and Telecommunications Commission et al., [1989] 2
S.C.R. 225 at 281, Dickson C.J. speaking for the majority set out
a three-part test for interpreting s. 17:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It seems to me that the words mentioned or referred to in s.
          16 [now s. 17] are capable of encompassing: i) expressly binding
          words (&#147;Her Majesty is bound&#146;); ii) a clear intention to bind
          which &#133; &#147;is manifest from the very terms of the statute&#148;, in
          other words, an intention revealed when the provisions are read
          in the context of other textual provisions &#133;; and iii) an
          intention to bind where the purpose of the statute would be
          &#147;wholly frustrated&#148; if the government were not bound, or, in
          other words, if an absurdity (as opposed to simply an undesirable
          result) were produced.</pre>
    <pre>[40] More recently in Friends of the Oldman River Society v.
Canada (Minister of Transport), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 52-53, the
Supreme Court described the test for applying s. 17 to include
legislation that binds the Crown by &#147;necessary or logical
implication.&#148; [Emphasis added.]  The Court in Oldman River
reasoned that the analysis under s. 17 should include the
circumstances that led to the enactment of the statute and the
purpose to which the statute is directed. It is clear, therefore,
that something short of express words binding the Crown will
satisfy the requirements of s. 17.
[41] Section 27 does not expressly state that the rules of
practice and procedure in the proceedings to which it refers
apply to the Crown. However, I am satisfied that the necessary
and logical inference is that s. 27 is intended to do just that.
In general terms, the purpose of the CLPA is to create liability
on the federal Crown for certain causes of action where none
existed at common law and to expand the jurisdiction of the
courts of the provinces for proceedings involving the federal
Crown. The entire thrust of the Act, as its title suggests, is to
affect the rights and interests of the federal Crown. The
statutory scheme makes it clear that s. 27 is intended to apply
to the federal Crown.
[42] Moreover, there is no possible purpose for s. 27 other than
to make the rules referred to in the section apply to the Crown.
If the section is not interpreted to do that, it would be an
unnecessary statement of the obvious.
[43] Thus, I am satisfied that s. 27 ought to be interpreted as
if it read, &#147;except as otherwise provided by this Act or the
Regulations, the rules of practice and procedure in the court in
which proceedings are taken apply to the federal Crown in those
proceedings.&#148;  [my words added]</pre>
    <pre>     To what proceedings does s. 27 refer?</pre>
    <pre>[44] The word &#147;proceedings&#148; is not defined in the CLPA. The
language of s. 27 does not limit the proceedings to which the
section applies. There is no dispute that the word &#147;proceedings&#148;
includes actions for damages and that it includes, as well,
proceedings brought in the courts of the provinces. A major
change in the 1990 amendments to the CLPA, that came into force
in 1992, was to extend to the courts of the provinces concurrent
jurisdiction with the Federal Court for proceedings brought
against the federal Crown. The many references to &#147;proceedings&#148;
in the Act very plainly mean proceedings in the courts of the
provinces.
[45] The respondents argue, however, that the &#147;proceedings&#148;
referred to in s. 27 are limited to proceedings brought by or
against the federal Crown and do not include proceedings, such as
the appellant&#146;s action, in which the Crown is not a party. The
ordinary meaning of the language of the section does not contain
this limitation. It would therefore be necessary to read into the
section the limitation contended for by the respondents.
[46] In determining the scope of the &#147;proceedings&#148; to which s. 27
refers, it is helpful to consider the other provisions in the Act
that also refer to &#147;proceedings.&#148;  In some instances, the
application of a specific section is limited to &#147;proceedings
against the Crown.&#148;  See ss. 22(1), 23, 24, 25 and 26. Other
sections have a broader application but are nevertheless limited.
For example, s. 28 applies to &#147;proceedings to which the Crown is
a party&#148; and s. 34(a) gives the Governor in Council authority to
make regulations in respect of &#147;proceedings by or against the
Crown.&#148;  In contrast, there are no words limiting the scope of
the proceedings to which s. 27 applies. The inference, therefore,
often called the presumption of consistent expression, is that it
was the intent to include in s. 27 more than &#147;proceedings against
the Crown&#148; and more than &#147;proceedings to which the Crown is a
party.&#148;
[47] The presumption of consistent expression has been described
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is presumed that the Legislature uses language carefully
          and consistently so that within a statute or other legislative
          instrument the same words have the same meaning and different
          words have different meanings. Another way of understanding this
          presumption is to say that the Legislature is presumed to avoid
          stylistic variation. Once a particular way of expressing a
          meaning has been adopted, it is used each time that meaning is
          intended. Given this practice, it then makes sense to infer that
          where a different form of expression is used, a different meaning
          is intended.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>     See R. Sullivan, ed., Driedger on the
Construction of Statutes, 3d ed., (Toronto:
Butterworths 1994) at 163.</pre>
    <pre>[48] The presumption of consistent expression leads to the
broader interpretation of s. 27 that is consistent with the
ordinary meaning of the language of the section. To read into the
section the words &#147;in which the Crown is a party&#148; would be
inconsistent with what appears to be a careful pattern of
expression in delineating to what proceedings particular sections
of the CLPA apply.
[49] This interpretation is also in keeping with the modern
legislative trend to remove Crown immunity from pre-trial
production and discovery obligations and to move towards putting
the Crown on an equal footing with everyone else.2
[50] Indeed, the desirability of narrowing or removing Crown
immunity from pre-trial discovery obligations is demonstrated by
the facts of the present case. The appellant is suing two
employees of the RCMP based on allegations of conduct carried out
in the course of their employment. The Master found that the
documents in the possession of the RCMP are relevant to the
appellant&#146;s action and that it would be unfair to require the
appellant to go to trial without discovery of these documents.
Given that it is open to the RCMP to assert privilege, including
public interest privilege, over these documents, there does not
appear to be any reasonable policy argument against production.
Although the reasonableness of a result is not determinative of
how a statutory provision should be interpreted, the
acceptability of a particular interpretation is a factor that may
weigh in favour of one interpretation rather than another.
[51] I would also note that there is nothing in the wording of s.
27 that limits the rules that apply to a proceeding to only those
rules that affect the parties to the proceeding. If the section
applies to proceedings in which the Crown is not a party, the
clear meaning of the language of the section includes those
rules, like Rule 30.10, that apply to non-parties.
[52] I recognize that an interpretation of the word &#147;proceedings&#148;
in s. 27 that includes proceedings in which the Crown is not a
party goes beyond what is described in the long title of the CLPA
which is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               An Act respecting the liability of the Crown and proceedings
          by or against the Crown.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[53] The long title may be used to suggest the purpose or scope
of legislation but it is not determinative of the interpretation
to be attached to any particular provision in the Act. The long
title is one of many factors that may be considered and in the
end, &#147;the weight to be attached to a title and how it should be
used depend on the circumstances of the case&#148;: Driedger, supra,
at 258.
[54]
Greater weight may be attached to the long title in those cases
where the language of the section, or the language of the section
when viewed in the context of the legislation as a whole,
produces an ambiguous or uncertain result or a result that is
unreasonable or unfair:  Schiell v. Morrison, [1930] 4 D.L.R. 644
at 667 (Sask. C.A.).
[55] That is not this case. The language of s. 27, particularly
when viewed in light of the language of other sections in the
Act, is clear and an interpretation that includes proceedings in
which the Crown is not a party produces a reasonable and fair
result. In my view, the long title of the CLPA ought not to be
used to change what I otherwise consider to be the proper
interpretation of s. 27.</pre>
    <pre>     The case law</pre>
    <pre>[56] In arguing that s. 27 does not include proceedings in which
the Crown is not a party, the respondents rely on the decision of
the Alberta Court of Appeal in Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. v.
Oland [sub. nom. Canada Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Prisco]
(1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 509 (Alta. C.A.). There, the federal
Crown brought an action in the Alberta Court of Queen&#146;s Bench
against the former officers and directors of the Northland Bank
to recover losses sustained after the collapse of the bank. Prior
to trial one of the defendants sought an order under Alberta Rule
200 compelling Ms. Barbara McDougall, a former minister of the
federal Crown, to attend on an examination for discovery.3 In
holding that Ms. McDougall was not compellable, the Court of
Appeal considered s. 27 of the CLPA and observed that &#147;it may be
that Rule 200 does apply.&#148;  However, the court pointed out that
Rule 200 was directed at requiring officers or directors of a
corporation to attend for discovery in proceedings in which the
corporation was a party to the litigation. The court reasoned
that because the federal Crown was not a corporation and the
former minister was not an officer or director, Rule 200 had no
application. The court went on to hold that s. 11 of the
Proceedings Against the Crown Act, R.S.A. 1980, c. P-18, which
provided that, for purposes of the Alberta Rules, a minister of
the Crown is in the same position as an officer or director of a
corporation, did not apply to the federal Crown because of the
constitutional principle that a provincial enactment cannot bind
the federal Crown.
[57] Unlike the situation in Prisco, if s. 27 of the CLPA binds
the federal Crown to the rules that apply to non-parties to a
proceeding, there is no additional legislation required to make
Rule 30.10 apply. As a result, in my view, the reasoning of the
court in Prisco does not assist the respondents.
</pre>
    <pre>[58] In addition, cases that were decided before the current s.
27 came into effect in 1992 are not helpful:  see Canada (A.G.)
v. Rhode (1957), 8 D.L.R. (2d) 89 (Sask. Dist. Ct.). By express
language, the predecessor section applied only to proceedings
brought against the federal Crown.4  The limiting language was
not carried forward into the present section. Moreover, cases
that rely on the common law principle that the Crown is not
compellable for pre-trial non-party production and discovery do
not assist in interpreting the meaning of s. 27: see Thornhill v.
Dartmouth Broadcasting Ltd. (1981), 45 N.S.R. (2d) 111 (S.C.) and
Re Mulroney and Coates (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 353 (H.C.J.).
[59] Finally, in Rutherford v. Swanson (1993), 139 A.R. 34, 18
C.P.C. (3d) 182, the Alberta Court of Queen&#146;s Bench dealt with a
factual situation that was very similar to the case before this
court. There, the plaintiff sought production of documents from
the RCMP, which was not a party, under Alberta Rules 266 and 209
(which is similar to Ontario Rule 30.10). In refusing the orders,
the court held that the Alberta Rules did not contain language
that either expressly or by necessary implication bound the
Crown. However, the court did not consider the effect of s. 27 of
the CLPA and the decision does therefore not assist the
respondent&#146;s argument in this case.</pre>
    <pre>     Section 8(2) of the Regulations</pre>
    <pre>[60] In their submissions both parties referred to s. 8(2) of the
Crown Liability and Proceedings (Provincial Court) Regulations
(SOR/91-604), October 24, 1991 (&#147;Regulations&#148;) enacted under the
CLPA. Section 8(2) provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               8. (2) Where, under provincial rules, a party would be
          entitled to obtain production for inspection of any document or a
          copy of any document as against or from the Crown, if the Crown
          were a private person, such production for inspection or copy may
          be had, subject to sections 37 to 39 of the Canada Evidence Act,
          under order of the court after consideration has been given to
          any objection that would be available to the Crown if the Crown
          were a private person.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[61] Section 8(2) appears to make an order under Rule 30.10
unnecessary because the wording does not limit production by the
Crown to proceedings in which the Crown is a party. The
difficulty, however, is that the scope of s. 8(2) is restricted
by s. 34(a) of the CLPA under which the authority to enact
regulations is restricted to, &#147;prescribing rules of practice and
procedure in respect of proceedings by or against the Crown.&#148;
[Emphasis added.]  Section 34(a) cannot be interpreted to apply
more broadly than the regulation-making authority contained in
the CLPA. The federal Crown is not a party to the proceedings in
this case and as a result s. 8(2) would have no application to a
request by the appellant for production of the documents from the
RCMP.</pre>
    <pre>     Section 17 &#150; Interpretation Act</pre>
    <pre>[62] Next, I turn to the question of what effect if any s. 17 of
the Interpretation Act has on the interpretation of the word
&#147;proceedings&#148; in s. 27. For convenience, I will set out s. 17
again:
          </pre>
    <pre>               17. No enactment is binding on Her Majesty or affects Her
          Majesty or Her Majesty&#146;s rights or prerogatives in any manner,
          except as mentioned or referred to in the enactment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[63] I accept, without deciding, that once it is determined that
a statutory enactment applies to the Crown, s. 17 has a further
role in interpreting the breadth of the enactment. That said, I
am satisfied that as a matter of necessary or logical inference,
the intention of s. 27, read in the context of the other textual
provisions in the CLPA, is to bind the federal Crown to the rules
of practice and procedure in all proceedings, including those in
which it is not a party. That being the case, s. 17 does not
restrict the type of proceedings to which s. 27 refers.</pre>
    <pre>     Retroactivity s. 27 CLPA</pre>
    <pre>[64] Finally, the respondents argue that if s. 27 is interpreted
to apply to proceedings in which the Crown is not a party, it
does not apply in this case because of the presumption against
the retroactive application of legislation.
[65] The appellant&#146;s action was commenced in 1985. Prior to the
amendment that became effective in 1992, s. 27 did not bind the
Crown to rules in proceedings in which the Crown was not a party.
The respondents contend that the amendment altered the Crown&#146;s
right to be free from pre-trial production and discovery
obligations in a proceeding that was started before the amendment
and that the amendment should therefore not apply to that
proceeding.
[66] I disagree. The presumption against retroactivity applies
only to &#147;substantive&#148; as opposed to &#147;procedural&#148; legislation.
Acts or amendments concerned with procedure are presumed to have
a retroactive effect, which means that they apply immediately to
pending actions:  Angus v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co., [1988] 2
S.C.R. 256 at 262.
[67] In Angus, La Forest J. expressed this distinction as
follows, at p. 265:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A provision is substantive or procedural for the purposes of
          retrospective application not according to whether or not it is
          based upon a legal fiction but according to whether or not it
          affects substantive rights. &#133;Normally, rules of practice do not
          affect the content or existence of an action or defence (or
          right, obligation, or whatever else is the subject of the
          legislation), but only the manner of its enforcement or use.
          [Emphasis in original.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[68] Section 27 of the CLPA refers only to procedural as opposed
to substantive law and the amendment that came into effect in
1992 expanding the scope of the proceedings to which the section
applied was a purely procedural, not a substantive amendment.
Similarly, Ontario Rule 30.10, which requires the production of
documents from a non-party, is strictly a procedural rule. Thus,
the presumption against the retroactive effect has no application
to the amendment to s. 27.</pre>
    <pre>     Summary</pre>
    <pre>[69] For all of the above reasons, I am satisfied that s. 27
constitutes the necessary federal legislative authority to make
Ontario Rule 30.10 binding on the federal Crown. The respondents
have not challenged the Master&#146;s findings that the documents in
the possession of the RCMP are relevant and that it would be
unfair to require the appellant to proceed to trial without
discovery of those documents. The requirements of Rule 30.10 have
been satisfied.
[70] I would therefore reinstate the order of the Master. In
doing so I would emphasize again that the obligation to produce
documents is subject to claims of privilege, including those
based on the public interest under s. 37 of the Canada Evidence
Act.</pre>
    <pre>     Issue 3 &#150; Order Against Kruger</pre>
    <pre>[71] In his factum, the appellant asks this court to make an
order compelling the respondent Kruger to provide a further and
better affidavit of documents and to produce all of his notes and
records and all other notes and records of other investigating
officers from the RCMP for the period from 1979 through 1984. The
appellant sought a similar order before the Master. He did not
appeal to the General Division from the Master&#146;s failure to make
an order in this regard, nor did he seek this relief in the
notice of appeal filed with this court. In these circumstances, I
am satisfied that it would not be appropriate for this court to
grant the relief sought.
[72] Having said that, even if the appellant had brought a proper
appeal, I would not have made the order that he now requests. The
appellant seeks production of two kinds of documents. First, he
seeks an order that the respondent Kruger produce all of his own
notes and records relating to the investigation and prosecution.
It appears that counsel from the Department of Justice, who
represented Kruger before the Master, assured the court that all
of Kruger&#146;s notes that could be located had been produced. The
Master, though it was requested of him, did not make any order
against Kruger. This court is not in a position to inquire into
the adequacy of the effort that had been made to locate those
notes nor to determine if there are additional notes, not yet
produced. I would therefore not make an order relating to
Kruger&#146;s notes.
[73] The appellant also seeks production from Kruger of all of
the notes and records of the other RCMP officers who were
involved in the investigation. In view of the order that I would
make compelling the RCMP to produce these documents, there would
be no need for this order.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[74] I would therefore allow the appeal and would reinstate the
order of the Master. I would direct that the respondents pay the
appellant&#146;s costs of the appeal and of the proceedings in the
courts below.

_______________________________
1     I   discuss  the  legal  principles  that  are  applied  to
determine if legislation is binding on the Crown in paragraphs 37
to 40 below.
2     In  proceedings in the Federal Court, the federal Crown  is
bound  to  rules  providing for discovery  of  parties  and  non-
parties: see Federal Court Rules, C.R.C. 1978, c. 663 as  amended
by  SOR/90-846, s. 15, Rules 454, 456(3).   Also,  it  is  beyond
dispute  that  the  provisions of Part II of  the  CLPA  and  the
regulations made thereunder render the federal Crown  subject  to
pre-trial production and discovery obligations when it is a party
to proceedings in the courts of the provinces.
3    For purposes of the issues in this case, there is no
difference between documentary and oral discovery.  The
principles that apply to each are the same.
4     The  predecessor section read as follows: s. 27 &#147;Except  as
otherwise  provided by the Act or the regulations, the  rules  of
practice  and procedures of the court in which proceedings  under
this  Part  are  taken  apply  in those  proceedings.&#148;  [Emphasis
added.] Section 27 was in Part III of the Act.  Part III  of  the
Act  included only proceedings brought against the Crown.   Prior
to the amendments, the Act was called the Crown Liability Act.</pre></td>
