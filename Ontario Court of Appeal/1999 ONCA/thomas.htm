    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Dyson J. with a jury dated 
February 2 and 19, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Bell Helmets, Inc. (&#147;Bell&#148;) appeals from a judgment finding
it 25% liable for injuries sustained by the respondent, Steven
Michael Thomas (&#147;Thomas&#148;), as a result of a motor vehicle
accident. In support of its position that a new trial should be
ordered, Bell has raised numerous grounds of appeal relating to
evidentiary issues and alleged errors in the charge to the jury.
[2]  Bell also appeals from the order of Dyson J., the trial
judge, that Bell pay to Thomas and his mother and committee,
Caroll Thomas (collectively, &#147;the plaintiffs&#148;) their costs of the
action on a party-and-party basis from February 22, 1990 (the
date of settlement of the action against the defendant Terry
Harding) to December 23, 1992 (the date of the plaintiffs&#146; first
settlement offer) and thereafter on a solicitor-and-client basis.
It accepts that leave to appeal is required for this appeal under
s.133(b) of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.43
because, for the reasons given below, its appeal has failed in
all other respects.
[3]  The plaintiffs cross-appeal from Dyson J.&#146;s judgment which
awarded Thomas $2,782,336.56 and Caroll Thomas damages of
$109,891.43.  These damages were based on the pre-trial
settlement of all aspects of the plaintiffs&#146; damage claims and
the jury&#146;s finding that Bell&#146;s degree of negligence was 25%.  In
their cross-appeal, they contend that the plaintiffs&#146; various
damage claims were agreed to on an item by item basis by counsel
and were incorrectly totalled at $8,026,303.  The correct total
of the plaintiffs&#146; various damage claims, including Caroll
Thomas&#146;s Family Law Act claim, is $8,834,421.21, that is
$808,117.00 more than the stated total of the damages. The
plaintiffs, in their cross-appeal, contend that the trial judge
erred in not finding that the parties settled damages at
$8,834,421.21, not $8,026,303 and that the judgment in favour of
the plaintiffs should be based on 25% of $8,834,421.21, in light
of the jury&#146;s finding that Bell&#146;s degree of negligence was 25%.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Thomas suffered serious and permanent brain damage as a
result of a collision between his motorcycle and another vehicle
driven by Terry Harding.  At the time of impact, Thomas was
wearing an &#147;M2&#148; motorcycle helmet which he had purchased second
hand several months before the accident.  The helmet had been
manufactured by Bell in 1985.
[5]  Upon impact, Thomas was thrown a considerable distance in
the air before coming to rest in a ditch.  While he was airborne,
his helmet flew off, leaving his head unprotected when it struck
the ground.
[6]  Thomas was rendered mentally incompetent as a result of his
brain injuries.  His committee commenced an action against Bell
and others, including Harding, alleging negligence and seeking
substantial damages.  By the time of trial, Thomas had settled
with each of the defendants except Bell.
[7]  The claim against Bell proceeded to trial before Dyson J.
and a jury.  Because the parties had essentially resolved the
issue of damages before trial the jury was only called upon the
decide whether Bell was liable for the injuries sustained by
Thomas and, if so, to what extent. .1</pre>
    <pre>Finding of Liability Against Bell</pre>
    <pre>[8]  After a lengthy trial involving 42 days of evidence, the
jury found Bell 25% liable for Thomas&#146;s injuries on the basis
that the warning label which Bell had affixed to its M2 helmet
failed to provide prospective users with important safety
information, referred to as the &#147;roll-off fit check&#148;, needed to
ensure a secure and proper fit.  By their answers to the
questions put to them, the jury rejected Thomas&#146;s alternate
theories of liability, all of which related to alleged defects in
the manufacture and design of the helmet.
[9]  In ascribing liability to Bell, the jury found that there
was negligence on the part of Bell that caused or contributed to
the loss of Thomas&#146;s motorcycle helmet, the particulars being
&#147;failed in their duty to the consumer by not passing on their
safety knowledge directly onto their product which is
transferable.&#148;  In coming to this conclusion, the jury
necessarily made the following findings of fact:
     </pre>
    <pre>1.        the warning label affixed to the M2 helmet worn by
Thomas was inadequate because it failed to include safety
information (the roll-off fit check) needed to ensure a secure
and proper fit;
2.        Bell knew or ought to have known of this deficiency in
the warning label by 1985, when the M2 helmet was manufactured;
3.        if Thomas had received the benefit of adequate safety
information, he would not have purchased a helmet that was too
large;
4.        the chin straps on Thomas&#146;s helmet were securely
fastened at the time of impact and his helmet flew off in mid air
because it was too large; and
5.        Thomas&#146;s brain injuries were not caused by the violent
rotation of his head upon sudden deceleration but rather, as a
result of his unprotected head striking the ground.</pre>
    <pre>QUANTUM OF DAMAGES</pre>
    <pre>[10] As noted above, the parties had essentially resolved the
issue of damages prior to trial.  From about June 1995, counsel
for the parties attempted to reach a settlement of the quantum of
the plaintiffs&#146; claims for damages.  Serious discussions began in
late June 1995 at a meeting at the offices of counsel for the
plaintiffs.  At that meeting counsel discussed and reviewed all
of the plaintiffs&#146; damage claims.  At that time, they did not
reach an agreement on the quantum of the plaintiffs&#146; various
damage claims. Following the June 1995 meeting, counsel for Bell
wrote to counsel for the plaintiffs.  His letter contained a two-
page document titled, &#147;Preliminary Settlement Calculations.&#148;
This set out the defence assessment of all of the plaintiffs&#146;
damage claims; it was accompanied by some notes and calculations
to explain how certain figures were reached.
[11] On September 26, 1995, counsel for the plaintiffs responded
to Bell&#146;s damage position by forwarding a document titled, &#147;The
Plaintiffs&#146; Settlement Calculations&#148; to Bell&#146;s counsel. This
document was in the same general format as Bell&#146;s &#147;Preliminary
Settlement Calculations.&#148;
[12] The &#147;Plaintiffs&#146; Settlement Calculations&#148; listed and
quantified all of the plaintiffs&#146; damage claims except for the
subrogated claim of the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (&#147;OHIP&#148;),
which was not quantified.  At that time, OHIP had not told
counsel for the plaintiffs what the quantum of OHIP&#146;s claim would
be.  At that point in the settlement discussions, counsel had
agreed on the quantum of several heads of damages, but not on all
of them.
[13] Unfortunately, counsel for the plaintiffs totalled the
damages as set out in &#147;The Plaintiffs&#146; Settlement Calculations&#148;
incorrectly.  The correct arithmetic total was $7,678,759.87,
that is $808,117.87 more than the incorrectly added total. At
this time neither counsel was aware of the $808,117.87
calculation error.
[14] By October 5, 1995, OHIP&#146;s interest was known.  Thus,
counsel for the plaintiffs prepared an updated version of the
&#147;Plaintiffs&#146; Settlement Calculations.&#148; This updated list of
damages was the same as the September 1995 &#147;Plaintiffs&#146;
Settlement Calculations,&#148; except that OHIP&#146;s claim was
quantified.  Unfortunately, the OHIP claim of $1,044,356.97 was
added to the incorrect total of $6,870,642.  Thus, the
$808,117.87 error was carried forward.
[15] Counsel for the plaintiffs enclosed his updated list of
damages in a letter to counsel for Bell dated October 17, 1995.
The letter referred to the heads of the plaintiffs&#146; damage claims
and the incorrect total of those claims:
          </pre>
    <pre>      This follows our telephone conversation this morning.  The
      plaintiffs offered to settle the issue of damages between our
      clients on the basis your client shall pay its adjudged
      percentage of liability to the plaintiffs in the amounts per head
      of damage on the enclosed list of damages totalling $8,026,303,
      on the understanding the plaintiffs further entitlement to
      damages for gross up will be determined by the trial judge
      immediately following the liability verdict. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[16] After counsel for Bell received the plaintiffs&#146; offer to
settle damages, and before Bell accepted that offer, the
plaintiffs&#146; damage calculations were forwarded to Bell&#146;s head
office in California. Counsel for Bell was eventually instructed
to accept the plaintiffs&#146; offer to settle the quantum on all
aspects of the plaintiffs&#146; damage claims.
[17] Thus, on October 20, 1995, counsel for Bell wrote to counsel
for the plaintiffs and accepted the plaintiffs&#146; offer to settle
the plaintiffs&#146;  damage claims.  The letter stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I have instructions to settle the damages issue in
          accordance with the terms of your offer.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               I enclose a copy of my letter to Mr.
          Justice Dyson, advising him of the damages
          settlement and my request for a two-week
          postponement.</pre>
    <pre>[18] In the result, the trial judge was told before the trial
commenced that damages had been settled.  He was not told then
what the breakdown of the settlement was.
[19] The trial before Dyson J. and a jury commenced in November
1995. Since the quantum of all of the plaintiffs&#146; various damage
claims had been settled, liability was the only issue, apart from
gross-up which counsel agreed should be dealt with after the jury
had determined the issue of liability.
[20] It was only after the jury determined that Bell was liable
to the extent of 25% that counsel for the plaintiffs realized
that an error had been made in the totalling of the various heads
of damages at $8,026,303.  The error came to counsel&#146;s attention
when he was preparing to deal with the issue of gross-up.
Counsel for the plaintiffs immediately informed counsel for Bell
and the trial judge of the $808,117.87 calculation error.  The
plaintiffs sought to rectify the settlement so that the judgment
would reflect the correct total of the plaintiffs&#146; settled damage
claims.  How the motion was framed is not entirely clear.  As
counsel for the plaintiffs put it:
          </pre>
    <pre>      ... what it really is as part of the process of moving for a
      judgment, the plaintiff wishes to move for a judgment on the
      basis of the proper total.</pre>
    <pre>[21] On February 2, 1996, the trial judge dealt with the issue of
gross-up and adjourned the plaintiffs&#146; motion concerning the
damage settlement and the calculation error.   He heard evidence
on that latter issue on April 4, 1996 and on April 22nd found
that the parties had settled damages for $8,026,303, not
$8,834,421.21.</pre>
    <pre>COSTS ORDER</pre>
    <pre>[22] The costs order was made under rule 49.10(1) and was based
on three offers made by the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs&#146; first
offer was made on December 23, 1992, in which they offered to
settle for $850,000 inclusive of pre-judgment interest. The
plaintiffs made a second offer on August 18, 1995 in which they
offered to settle for $450,000 inclusive of pre-judgment
interest.  This was followed by a third and final offer on
November 10, 1995 in which the plaintiffs offered to settle for
$800,000 inclusive of pre-judgment interest.  This offer
concluded with this paragraph:
      </pre>
    <pre>      This offer to settle shall remain open for acceptance until
      two minutes following the commencement of trial and any previous
      written or oral offers are hereby withdrawn.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The judgment at trial was substantially greater than any of
the three plaintiffs&#146; offers.
[24] The trial judge&#146;s reasons for his costs order, given orally
following submissions to him by counsel, are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>      Yes, I agree with [counsel for the plaintiffs] that the
      spirit of the Rule, the spirit and intent of the Rule [49.10(1)]
      has been met by the plaintiff.  There was an offer December 23rd,
      1992, to settle the matter for $850,000.  The matter of course
      could be settled for $850,000 at any time prior to trial.  The
      express withdrawal of all offers in the last offer of November
      10th, 1995, in my view, is a matter of form and not substance and
      will refer only to the lower offer of the $450,000.
         </pre>
    <pre>      Therefore, it is my view that the time
      from which the Rule should operate would be
      December 23rd, 1992.
          </pre>
    <pre>      And with respect to the Rule, I see no
      reason why the Rule simply just shouldn&#146;t
      apply.  The plaintiff is entitled to party
      and party costs from the date of this offer,
      and on the solicitor and client basis from
      that date.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>Appeal from Finding of Liability</pre>
    <pre>Grounds of Appeal Abandoned</pre>
    <pre>[25] In oral argument, counsel for Bell withdrew his submission
that the jury&#146;s verdict was perverse.  He also abandoned two
other grounds of appeal, the first being that the trial judge
erred in excluding evidence of roll-off testing conducted by
bell, the second that the trial judge erred in his post-verdict
gross-up calculation of damages.</pre>
    <pre>Grounds of Appeal Not Argued</pre>
    <pre>[26] Other grounds of appeal were not pursued in oral argument.
These involved various evidentiary rulings which, for convenience
sake, are summarized under the following heads:
     </pre>
    <pre>1.        the trial judge erred in refusing to permit Mr. Fisher,
a defence expert, to test the fit of Thomas&#146;s helmet;
2.        the trial judge applied an unduly restrictive
interpretation to rule 53.03 in refusing to admit certain expert
evidence which the defence sought to lead from Drs. McElhaney,
Thibault and Mendelsohn;
3.        the trial judge erred in refusing to allow Drs.
Thibault and Mendelsohn to express an opinion about the
protective capabilities of the M2 helmet because they were not
qualified to do so;
4.        the trial judge erred in admitting medical
illustrations which were misleading and prejudicial;
5.        the plaintiff&#146;s cross-examination of the defence expert
Mr. Thornley was unfair and should not have been permitted;
6.        the trial judge erred in refusing to allow the defence,
in re-examination, to produce a different copy of an out-of-court
statement made by the witness Harding; and
7.        the trial judge erred in refusing to admit into
evidence the entire out-of-court statement made by the witness
Mitchell.</pre>
    <pre>[27] It is unnecessary to analyze these grounds of appeal in
detail.  Recognizing that these grounds were not pursued, in our
view, it is sufficient to say that it was open to the trial
judge, in the exercise of his discretion, to rule as he did on
each of the evidentiary issues raised.  In any event, even if it
could be said that he erred in some instances, having regard to
the whole of the record, the rulings occasioned no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice to the appellants.</pre>
    <pre>Grounds of Appeal Pursued</pre>
    <pre>[28] The grounds of appeal that Bell did pursue fall into two
categories, one relating to additional evidentiary issues, the
other to alleged errors in the charge to the jury.</pre>
    <pre>EVIDENTIARY ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>(i)  The 1974 and 1979 Studies Authored by Dr. Newman</pre>
    <pre>[29] The trial judge admitted two articles written in 1974 and
1979 by Dr. Newman, a professor of mechanical engineering.   Bell
objected to the admissibility of these studies on the basis that
they were hearsay and not admissible for the truth of their
contents.
[30] In the 1979 article, Dr. Newman called into question the
protective capabilities of motorcycle helmets due to a concern he
identified as &#147;the roll-off&#148; phenomenon.  According to Dr.
Newman, testing revealed that motorcycle helmets, otherwise
affording a comfortable fit to wearers, had a tendency to roll-
off the head on high impact, leaving the wearer without
protection.
[31] As indicated, at the time of the accident, Thomas was
wearing an M2 motorcycle helmet which Bell had manufactured in
1985.  The label on the inside of the helmet did not contain a
warning designed to address the roll-off phenomenon.
[32] Because of the position taken by Bell at trial with respect
to the adequacy of the warning label in its 1985 M2 labels, one
of the issues the jury had to decide was when, in relation to
1985, Bell had become aware of the roll-off phenomenon.  Evidence
led at trial revealed that the Newman studies had come to Bell&#146;s
attention as early as 1981, if not sooner.
[33] Accordingly, even though the Newman studies were not
admissible for the truth of their contents, they were clearly
relevant to the issue of Bell&#146;s knowledge and the trial judge did
not err in admitting them.</pre>
    <pre>(ii)  The 1990 Manual</pre>
    <pre>[34] The trial judge permitted the plaintiffs to introduce a 1990
owner&#146;s manual prepared by Bell, which contained a description of
the &#147;roll-off fit check&#148;, a test designed to address the
phenomenon identified by Dr. Newman.  Bell objected to the
introduction of the manual on the basis that it was not relevant
to the issue of liability.  Furthermore, Bell submitted that the
manual was highly prejudicial because the jury would view it as
an admission on Bell&#146;s part that it had in fact been negligent in
failing to include similar information on the warning label of
its 1985 M2 helmets.
[35] In our view, it is unnecessary to finally decide whether the
trial judge erred in admitting the manual.  Assuming that he did,
Bell suffered no prejudice given that the information contained
in the manual was virtually identical to information that Bell
had disseminated to its distributors in a 1984 pamphlet, well
before the manufacture date of the M2 helmet worn by Thomas.
[36] In view of this, the 1990 manual was essentially
superfluous.  It added little or nothing to the plaintiffs&#146; case
and, in the circumstances, there was no real danger that the jury
would use it for the improper purpose suggested by Bell.</pre>
    <pre>(iii)  Constable Robertson&#146;s Notes</pre>
    <pre>[37] Constable Robertson is the police office who attended at the
scene of Thomas's accident.  Counsel for the plaintiffs cross-
examined Constable Robertson at length on the accuracy of her
notes with a view to discrediting her notebook reference that the
chin straps on Thomas&#146;s helmet were undone when she located the
helmet at the scene.
[38] Given the nature and extent of the cross-examination,
counsel for Bell requested that the Constable&#146;s notes be marked
as an exhibit in order to permit the jury to view them in their
entirety.
[39] The trial judge refused this request and we are not
persuaded that he erred in doing so. The officer used her
notebook to refresh her memory and, as a general rule, notes used
for that purpose are not primary evidence and are not made
exhibits.  In exercising his discretion as he did, the trial
judge obviously felt that the jury had a firm grasp of the notes,
both in terms of their content and structure.  He was uniquely
positioned to make that assessment and we see no basis for
interfering with it.</pre>
    <pre>(iv)  Ms. Bristow&#146;s Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[40] David Bender and Alexander Allan are accident reconstruction
engineers who were originally retained by the insurer of Terry
Harding.  After the claim against Harding was settled, Bender and
Allan were retained by Bell, and they were called by Bell to
testify as expert witnesses. Counsel for the plaintiffs was
permitted to cross-examine both Bender and Allan about a
statement that they had received from one of Bender&#146;s employees,
Noreen Bristow, to the effect that Constable Robertson had told
her that the chin straps on Thomas&#146;s helmet were fastened at the
scene.  The trial judge permitted this questioning on the
undertaking of plaintiffs&#146; counsel that Ms. Bristow would be
called in reply.  Ms. Bristow was called in reply and she was
cross-examined effectively by counsel for Bell.
[41] Contrary to the submission of Bell, we see nothing wrong
with the procedure followed by the trial judge.  Although he
permitted the two insurance investigators to give hearsay
evidence, this defect was cured when Ms. Bristow was called as a
witness.
[42] With respect to Ms. Bristow&#146;s evidence, we are satisfied
that it was relevant and admissible.  The deficiencies in her
testimony went to the issue of weight, not admissibility.</pre>
    <pre>THE CHARGE TO THE JURY</pre>
    <pre>[43] Bell submits that the trial judge committed numerous errors
in his charge to the jury.  Before addressing the individual
submissions, we wish to point out that in most instances, the
issues raised on appeal were not brought to the attention of the
trial judge.  For sake of convenience, in addressing the various
issues, unless otherwise specified, it can be taken that trial
counsel for the defence (not Mr. Percival) did not object.</pre>
    <pre>(i)  The Charge Was Unfair and Biased in Favour of the plaintiff</pre>
    <pre>[44] This ground of appeal includes a general attack on the
charge as a whole, as well as specific instances of alleged bias
and unfairness.
[45] On a general level, Bell contends that the charge was unduly
favourable to the plaintiffs and that the trial judge emphasized
the evidence and arguments of the plaintiffs over those of Bell.
[46] We disagree.  Read as a whole, the charge was even-handed
and balanced.  Far from attempting to influence the jury, the
trial judge set forth the positions of the plaintiffs and Bell in
an objective and neutral fashion.  For the most part, he
refrained from expressing his personal opinion about the evidence
but to the extent that he did express what the jury may have
viewed to be his personal opinion, he made it clear that it was
the jury&#146;s opinion that counted, not his.  In sum, this ground of
appeal is entirely without merit.
[47] Turning to the specific complaints, Bell submits that the
trial judge prejudiced the defence by instructing the jury that
counsel for the plaintiffs had accurately summarized the law of
products liability in his closing address.
[48] In his summation, counsel for the plaintiffs traced the
development of the law of products liability from its inception.
He referred to a number of authorities by name, indicated the
court which gave the decision, summarized the underlying facts
and identified the relevant legal principles.
[49] In raising this ground of appeal, counsel for Bell does not
suggest that plaintiffs&#146; counsel misled the jury or that he
failed to summarize the law accurately.  Nor does he submit that
the trial judge misdirected the jury on the law.  Rather, he
contends that the trial judge&#146;s endorsement of the legal analysis
undertaken may well have left the jury with the impression that
plaintiffs&#146; counsel was also correct in his analysis of the case
as a whole.
[50] In our view, when the charge is read as a whole, Bell&#146;s
concerns are not borne out. While it is true that the trial judge
endorsed the legal submissions made by plaintiffs&#146; counsel, he
also endorsed Bell&#146;s counsel&#146;s submissions on the law of
negligence.  Moreover, he took issue with one of the submissions
made by counsel for the plaintiffs in respect of a case cited to
the jury, albeit one referable to the issue of driver negligence.
[51] That said, we do not wish to be taken as approving the form
of advocacy engaged in by plaintiffs&#146; counsel.  While he was
entitled to refer generally to relevant legal principles, he was
not at liberty to deliver a treatise on the law of products
liability.  In doing so, counsel for the plaintiffs overstepped
the bounds of his proper role and the trial judge might well have
intervened to remind him of this.  However, his failure to do so
in this case did not result in any prejudice to Bell.
[52] Bell further submits that, in addressing the issue whether
Thomas&#146;s helmet was fastened at the time of impact, the trial
judge favoured the plaintiffs&#146; position over that of Bell.  In
particular, it is submitted that on the one hand, the trial judge
failed to adequately review the evidence favouring the defence
theory that the chin straps were undone, while on the other, he
detailed the evidence supporting the plaintiffs&#146; theory that they
were securely fastened.  Bell&#146;s counsel objected to this aspect
of the charge but the trial judge refused to provide further
instruction to the jury.
[53] In his instruction on the &#147;chin straps&#148; issue, the trial
judge drew the jury&#146;s attention to the most significant evidence
favouring the defence theory. That evidence came from the
investigating officer, Constable Robertson, who testified that
when she located the helmet at the scene shortly after the
accident, the chin straps were undone.  On the other side of the
coin, the trial judge referred to two items of circumstantial
evidence which favoured the plaintiffs&#146; position, one being the
evidence of a witness who had seen Thomas fasten the chin straps
about a half hour before the accident, the other relating to the
unlikelihood that the chin straps would have been unfastened,
given their tendency to flap in the wind at high speeds and slap
the face and neck of the wearer.
[54] In deciding whether to recall the jury on this issue, the
trial judge took into account submissions from both counsel.
Apart from Constable Robertson&#146;s evidence, counsel for Bell
pointed to several additional features in the evidence which
tended to support Bell&#146;s position.  On the other hand,
plaintiffs&#146; counsel referred to a host of additional features
that the trial judge had failed to mention to the jury, all of
which supported the plaintiffs&#146; position.
[55] Given that the &#147;chin straps&#148; issue had been fully canvassed
by counsel in their closing addresses, and bearing in mind the
plaintiffs&#146; submission that if any further instruction was to be
given, a detailed review of the entire body of evidence would be
required, the trial judge chose to leave matters where they
stood.  In coming to this conclusion, he no doubt considered that
the issue in question was uncomplicated and factual and that the
jury had a good grasp of the evidence.  His inclinations in this
regard are borne out by an insightful question posed by the jury
on this issue.  In addition, the trial judge no doubt took into
account the fact that further instructions likely would have
inured to the benefit of the plaintiffs more than Bell.
[56] In all of the circumstances, while it might have been
preferable had the trial judge reviewed the relevant evidence in
more detail, we are not persuaded that he erred in failing to do
so.  Moreover, we reject the submission that his instructions
favoured one side over the other.
[57] The final submission relating to trial fairness concerns the
trial judge&#146;s recharge to the jury.  In the recharge, the trial
judge referred the jury to evidence, given by the plaintiffs&#146;
expert Dr. Mills, to the effect that, had Thomas&#146;s helmet been in
place when his head struck the ground, it would have provided
some protection against the type of brain injury caused by sudden
deceleration.
[58] Bell submits that the trial judge erred in the recharge by
failing to remind the jury of the conflicting evidence on this
subject given by its expert Dr. McElhaney.
[59] We see no merit in this submission.  The trial judge covered
Dr. McElhaney&#146;s position on this issue in the charge proper and
he was not required to repeat it.  Accordingly, we see no
unfairness in the recharge.</pre>
    <pre>(ii)  The 1990 Manual</pre>
    <pre>[60] Bell submits that the trial judge erred in failing to warn
the jury that they could not use the safety instructions in the
1990 manual as an admission by Bell that it had been negligent in
failing to provide similar instructions on the warning label of
the M2 helmet worn by Thomas.
[61] Although we agree that the trial judge should have provided
this instruction, in the circumstances, his failure to do so was
not fatal.  As we have already observed, the 1990 manual was
essentially superfluous to the plaintiffs&#146; case and there was no
realistic danger that the jury would use it for the improper
purpose suggested.</pre>
    <pre>(iii)  Dr. Mill&#146;s Opinion</pre>
    <pre>[62] Dr. Mills, an professor of engineering with special
expertise in motorcycle accidents and helmets, testified for the
plaintiffs.  Having reconstructed the accident, it was his
opinion that the brain injuries suffered by Thomas did not occur
from sudden deceleration, as Bell alleged, but as a result of
Thomas&#146;s unprotected head striking the ground.  In support of his
opinion, he relied in part on the roll-off phenomenon which Dr.
Newman had identified in his 1979 study.
[63] Dr. Newman was not called to give evidence at trial and the
parties agreed that his studies were not admissible for the truth
of their contents.  The trial judge brought this to the jury&#146;s
attention in the recharge.
[64] Bell submits that the trial judge should have gone further
and warned the jury that to the extent Dr. Mills relied upon the
Newman studies to form his opinion, the jury should take this
into account in assessing the weight of his opinion.
[65] With respect, we doubt that such an instruction was
necessary.  The evidence was overwhelming that by 1984, if not
sooner, Bell had recognized the legitimacy of the roll-off
phenomenon.  Assuming, however, that a limiting instruction
should have been given, in our view, the trial judge&#146;s failure to
do so occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice
to Bell.</pre>
    <pre>(iv)  Ms. Bristow&#146;s Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[66] Bell submits that the trial judge should have alerted the
jury to the frailties in Ms. Bristow&#146;s evidence in assessing
whether her testimony could be relied upon to rebut Constable
Robertson&#146;s testimony concerning the chin straps on Thomas&#146;s
helmet.
[67] While it might have been preferable had the trial judge
given such an instruction, his failure to do was not fatal.  Ms.
Bristow was cross-examined effectively by counsel for Bell and
the frailties in her evidence would have been very apparent to
the jury.  To the extent that the trial judge erred in failing to
bring these frailties to the jury&#146;s attention, the error
occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice to
Bell.
[68] In the result, the appeal against liability is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>APPEAL FROM COSTS ORDER</pre>
    <pre>[69] Rule 49.10(1) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where an offer to settle,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  is made by a plaintiff at least
          seven days before the commencement of the
          hearing;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  is not withdrawn and does not
          expire before the commencement of the
          hearing; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  is not accepted by the defendant,
          </pre>
    <pre>               and the plaintiff obtains a judgment as
          favourable as or more favourable than the
          terms of the offer to settle, the plaintiff
          is entitled to party and party costs to the
          date the offer to settle was served and
          solicitor and client costs from that date,
          unless the court orders otherwise.</pre>
    <pre>[70] One of the conditions for the application of Rule 49.10(1)
is that the offer &#147;is not withdrawn&#148;.  We think that the trial
judge erred in referring to the withdrawal of the earlier offers
as &#147;a matter of form and not substance and will refer only to the
lower offer of the $450,000.&#148;  We think that both matters of form
and substance are involved and that the trial judge&#146;s conclusion
is contrary to the clear wording of the offer.
[71] Having regard to the submissions made to him by the
plaintiffs, it appears that the trial judge relied upon the
judgment of this court in Mortimer v. Cameron (1994), 17 O.R.
(3d) 1, leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused
(1994), 19 O.R. (3d) xvi (note).  In Mortimer, an award of
solicitor-and-client costs was based on a plaintiffs&#146; offer to
settle dated March 20, 1989.  The plaintiffs made subsequent
offers in lower amounts.  The defendant submitted that these
subsequent offers withdrew the earlier offer.  Robins J.A., for
the court, dealt with this submission at p. 22 as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>       In my opinion, solicitor-and-client costs were properly
       awarded under rule 49.10.  The plaintiffs obtained a judgment
       more favourable to them than the offer to settle which they made
       to the city and Stingray on March 20, 1989.  The city and
       Stingray contend that this offer was withdrawn by subsequent
       offers and, therefore, the plaintiffs had not complied with rule
       49.10.  I agree with the trial judge&#146;s analysis of the subsequent
       offers and his conclusion that they did not operate so as to
       implicitly withdraw the March 20 offer.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In some circumstances a subsequent offer
          may, by necessary implication, constitute the
          withdrawal of a previous offer.  This will
          occur where, for instance, the subsequent
          offer requires payment of a greater sum than
          the sum stipulated in the previous offer.  In
          this case, however, the subsequent offers
          were more favourable to the defendants than
          the offer of March 20, 1989.  While one would
          not expect the defendants to accept an
          earlier offer over a later one which was more
          beneficial to them, I do not think it can be
          implied that the earlier offer had been
          withdrawn.
          </pre>
    <pre>               On its face, the March 20 offer was open
          for acceptance until after the commencement
          of the trial.  There were no circumstances
          which should have led the trial judge to
          infer that it had been withdrawn.  The
          plaintiffs' recovery was substantially
          greater than their offer to settle.  They
          fulfilled the letter and spirit of rule 49.10
          and are entitled to the solicitor-and-client
          costs awarded to them.</pre>
    <pre>[72] It can be seen from this that the court rejected the
argument based on withdrawal by implication.  In the case before
us, implication is not in issue because the third plaintiffs&#146;
offer expressly withdrew the two earlier offers.
[73] With respect to the application of Rule 49.10(1), the issue
before us has been decided by the judgment of this court in
Diefenbacher v. Young (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 641.  In that case,
the court held that a plaintiff&#146;s second offer to settle, which
was for a lower amount than the first offer and which did not
refer to the first offer, had the effect of withdrawing the first
offer by implication.  Carthy J.A. for the court said, at p.647:
          </pre>
    <pre>       &#133; The question is whether the second offer implicitly
       withdraws the plaintiff&#146;s earlier higher offer.  In technical
       semantics it does not do so, yet in the ordinary understanding of
       litigants proceeding towards a trial the earlier offer would be
       considered a piece of history and off the table.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Examining the issue at the level of the
          purpose which Rule 49 serves, it is certainly
          salutory to encourage the plaintiffs to be
          flexible as realities change through
          production and discovery and interviews with
          witnesses, and to lower their demands as may
          be appropriate from time to time.  On the
          other side, defendants should be encouraged
          to increase offers as circumstances dictate.
          Both these tendencies would be encouraged by
          offering the benefit of a costs award to the
          date of the earliest offer that was more
          beneficial to the opposite party than the
          judgment awarded.
          </pre>
    <pre>          On the other hand, the offer to settle
          is intended to be a simple and
          straightforward gesture to the opposite party
          calling upon that party to make a decision
          based upon the then apparent risks of
          litigation, to accept or proceed forward and
          bear the risk of costs consequences from that
          day forward.  If a plaintiff offers
          successively to accept $40,000, $20,000 and
          then $10,000 in settlement, the defendant can
          accept the $10,000 and pay party-and-party
          costs to that date.  If the earlier offer is
          considered to remain effective, then the risk
          involved in refusal is different than the
          consequences of acceptance.  Acceptance may
          involve a costs obligation of $4,000, while
          rejection may impose a risk of solicitor and
          client costs to an earlier date that may be
          $8,000.  This is arguably fair as a lever to
          encourage settlement, but is a compounding
          complication which detracts from the
          simplicity of looking at a single offer and
          assessing a risk at a single point in time.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Conceding that the answer is elusive, I
          lean to adopting the parlance and normal
          understanding of a litigant that a decreasing
          offer by a plaintiff and an increasing offer
          by a defendant, without reference to the
          earlier offer, is by implication a withdrawal
          of the earlier offer.  Its reality has
          disappeared in the ongoing negotiations and
          dealings between the parties and, prior to
          the present judicial debate of the issue, it
          is not sensible to consider that the parties
          would give thought to the earlier offer, in
          the context of costs consequences, after the
          second offer.</pre>
    <pre>[74] This passage shows that the court was alive to the competing
considerations involved in giving rule 49.10(1) solicitor and
client costs effect from the time of the earlier offer.  For the
reasons indicated in his analysis, Carthy J.A. held that &#147;&#133; it is
not sensible to consider that the parties would give thought to
the earlier offer, in the context of costs consequences, after
the second offer.&#148;  It is regrettable that the court in
Diefenbacher was not aware of the contrary judgment in Mortimer
on the issue of withdrawal by implication, but this aspect of the
decision does not detract from the force of its holding in so far
as it relates to an expressly withdrawn earlier offer.  If an
earlier offer is expressly withdrawn, it is, as far as costs
consequences of rule 49.10(1) are concerned, &#147;off the table&#148;.
Accordingly, as we have said, we think that the trial judge erred
in his application of rule 49.10(1).
[75] In the alternative, the plaintiffs seek to justify the trial
judge&#146;s costs order on the basis of rule 49.13 which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>       49.13    Despite rules 49.03, 49.10 and 49.11, the court, in
       exercising its discretion with respect to costs, may take into
       account any offer to settle made in writing, the date the offer
       was made and the terms of the offer.</pre>
    <pre>[76] Rule 49.13 may apply in circumstances where rule 49.10(1)
does not.  The opening part of rule 49.13 makes this clear.  In
our view, rule 49.13 gives  the trial judge a residual discretion
in making an order with respect to costs to take into account any
(even a revoked) written offer to settle, the date of the offer
and its terms.  This discretion is separate from the discretion
to award solicitor-client costs under rule 49.10(1) and the
discretion referred to by Robins J.A. in Mortimer v. Cameron,
supra, which has &#147;traditionally governed the award of solicitor
and client costs.&#148; 2 In the context of this case, rule 49.13
permitted the trial judge to consider all three plaintiffs&#146;
offers even though the first two offers were revoked and were
thus not open to consideration under rule 49.10(1).
[77] The three settlement offers made by the plaintiffs were
written offers.  Although the first two offers were revoked with
the result that Bell could reasonably conclude that those offers
were, &#147;off the table,&#148; for rule 49.10(1) purposes, Bell could
not, in our view, reasonably conclude that the costs implications
of those offers were at an end in light of the provisions of rule
49.13.
[78] In our opinion, when the three plaintiffs&#146; offers, their
dates and their terms are taken into account in accordance with
rule 49.13, those offers provide a basis upon which the trial
judge&#146;s award of solicitor and client costs from the date of the
first offer, December 23, 1992 is justified.
[79] All three of the plaintiffs&#146; written offers to settle would,
if accepted, have resulted in a resolution of this action on
terms more favourable to Bell than the trial judgment.  There was
no time from December 23, 1992, the date of the first offer, to
November 20, 1995, when the trial began when there was not a
written plaintiffs&#146; offer on the table substantially more
favourable to Bell than the trial judgment.   Thus, throughout
that period, it was open to Bell to settle this action by paying
substantially less than the judgment required it to pay.
[80] This application of rule 49.13 is consistent with the policy
objectives of Rule 49.  These objectives include providing an
incentive to plaintiffs and defendants to make settlement offers
which represent some reasonable element of compromise:  see
Walker Estate v. York-Finch General Hospital (1999), 43 O.R. (3d)
461 (C.A.).   As circumstances change during the litigation, the
settlement positions of the parties may change.  That is what
caused the plaintiffs to make their three settlement offers.
[81] We do not wish to be taken to have concluded that in all
cases where rule 49.10(1) does not apply, sequential offers to
settle, if less than the judgment in the case of plaintiffs
offers, or more than the judgment in the case of defence offers,
will automatically lead to an award of solicitor and client costs
from the date of the first offer.  Each case will have to be
considered having regard to its relevant features and the
provisions of rule 49.13, assuming, of course, that rule 49.10(1)
does not apply.
[82] Further, we note that the decision of this court in Walker
Estate, referred to above, is not inconsistent with the approach
taken in this case.  In Walker Estate, the court refused to apply
rule 49.10 because the offer in that case did not reflect any
real element of compromise.  This important consideration of
fairness was equally material to the application of rule 49.10(1)
(specifically the residual discretion clause in it) and of rule
49.13.
[83] We would, therefore, grant leave to Bell to appeal costs;
however, we would dismiss  the appeal.
[84] In the result, Bell&#146;s appeals are dismissed with costs.</pre>
    <pre>CROSS-APPEAL FROM QUANTUM OF DAMAGES</pre>
    <pre>[85] The gross arithmetic error was, as we have said,
$808,117.87.  Since the finding respecting the degree of fault
limited the plaintiffs&#146; recovery and Bell&#146;s liability to 25%, the
net effect of the error was $202,029.47.  Thus, the plaintiffs
recovered $202,029.47 less than they submit was their settlement
with Bell.
[86] On the plaintiffs&#146; motion concerning the &#147;settlement&#148; lead
counsel for both Bell and the plaintiffs gave evidence.  We see
no need to review the evidence in detail, mainly because there is
very little dispute about it.
[87] The evidence established that the various heads of damage
were negotiated on a line by line, not global basis. Indeed, the
first list of damages, a list which was prepared by counsel for
Bell, contained eight headings under which damages were listed
and discussed on an item by item basis.  The plaintiffs&#146; list of
damage claims followed essentially the same format.  At no time
did Bell seek to settle damages by offering a lump sum that
differed from the total of the various heads of damages that
counsel reviewed separately in their settlement discussions.  Nor
did the plaintiffs attempt to settle the quantum of the listed
damages in an amount that was less than what their counsel
thought (wrongly as it turned out) was the arithmetic total of
the listed damage claims.
[88] In the end, both Bell and the plaintiffs proceeded on the
basis of the same incorrect assumption &#150; that the $8,026,303
total of the listed damage claims represented the correct total
of the listed and quantified heads of damage.
[89] When the trial judge dealt with the issue whether the
judgment should reflect what counsel for the plaintiffs contended
was the correct damage settlement figure, he found as a fact that
counsel for Bell was unaware of the calculation error.  There is
evidence to support that finding.  The trial judge then
considered the question whether counsel for Bell should have
known of the error.  In answering this question the trial judge
said:
          </pre>
    <pre>       I find in these circumstances that it was not unreasonable
       for [counsel for Bell at trial] to rely on the figures set out in
       the letter of October 17th.</pre>
    <pre>     He went on to find that:
          </pre>
    <pre>       Both parties believe that the matter had been settled for
       $8,026,303, and it was this total amount that was the fundamental
       aspect of the agreement and not the &#145;heads of damages&#146; aspect.</pre>
    <pre>[90] The trial judge added that he saw no reason why Bell should
bear the burden of the error which &#147;represents less than 10% of
the whole.&#148;
[91] The evidence is clear that the plaintiffs&#146; damage claims
were itemized from the outset.  Each item was considered by
counsel in their settlement discussions, some at greater length
than others.  By October 1995, counsel agreed on the quantum of
all of the constituent parts of the plaintiffs&#146; damage claims.
In settling damages both Bell and the plaintiffs thought that
they had settled damages for the total of the separate damage
claims set out in the enclosure in the October 17, 1995 letter to
Bell&#146;s counsel.  Neither counsel realized that the total of the
damage items which counsel had negotiated was wrong since it did
not accurately reflect the settlement counsel had reached.
[92] In these circumstances, the expectations of the parties,
particularly Bell, should be taken into account.  See Waddams,
The Law of Contracts, 4th ed. (1999) at p. 287.  Bell reasonably
expected to pay the total of the various damage claims made by
the plaintiffs.  To the extent that Bell relied on the accuracy
of the total of the plaintiffs&#146; listed damage claims, we do not
think that its reliance was reasonable.  That is to say, having
agreed on the quantum of the constituent elements of the
plaintiffs&#146; damage claims, Bell&#146;s counsel (or Bell) should have
verified the total of those claims.  Bell&#146;s counsel&#146;s failure to
do that was not reasonable.  If the arithmetic error in totalling
the separately negotiated claims had resulted in Bell being
exposed to paying $800,000 more, instead of $800,000 less, than
the correct total of the negotiated claims that settlement could
not be enforced.  Consistent with its reasonable expectations,
Bell could, in our view, assert that its liability was limited to
the correct total of the damage items agreed to.  Similarly, the
plaintiffs could not enforce a &#147;settlement&#148; that was $800,000
higher than the total of the separately negotiated heads of
damage, even if Bell&#146;s counsel was responsible for the
calculation error.
[93] As we have noted, the trial judge referred to the fact that
the net calculation error was &#147;less than 10% of the whole.&#148;  In
our view, this is not a proper basis upon which to refuse to
grant the plaintiffs the relief they sought on the motion.  The
amount involved was substantial, not de minimus.  Its percentage
relationship to the entire judgment is a matter of no
consequence.
[94] There is a further basis upon which the trial judge should
have given effect to the plaintiffs&#146; position with respect to the
settlement.   As we have said, the respondent Thomas is a
mentally incompetent person so declared. Thus, the settlement of
damages had to be approved, once the jury found some liability on
the part of Bell.  The basic issue in the approval process is
whether the settlement is reasonable in the sense that it is in
the best interests of Thomas. The approval process is the same as
the process required on an infant settlement.  In Tsaoussis
(Litigation Guardian of) v. Baetz (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 257 (C.A.)
at 267, Doherty J.A. wrote, in commenting on the infant
settlement process:
          </pre>
    <pre>     There can be no doubt that a court is obliged to look to and
     protect the best interests of minors who are parties to legal
     proceedings.  This obligation, sometimes referred to as the
     court&#146;s parens patriae jurisdiction, requires that the court
     abandon its normal umpire-like role and assume a more
     interventionist mode.  &#133; The supervisory powers of the court are
     most clearly evinced by the requirement that the court approve
     any consent judgment to which a minor is a party.</pre>
    <pre>[95] To the extent that the hearing which concerned the
calculation error could be viewed as the trial judge&#146;s approval
of the &#147;settlement,&#148; we question how it can be said that an item
by item settlement which, because of a calculation error, short-
changes a mentally incompetent plaintiff of over $200,000 is a
settlement which is in the best interests of the person that the
court must protect.
[96] The trial judge may have considered the reasonableness of
the settlement in a general way when he dealt with the
plaintiffs&#146; motion to have the judgment reflect the &#147;proper
total&#148; of the damages.  However, it does not appear that the
issue whether the settlement at either $8,026,303 or
$8,834,421.21 was in Steven Thomas&#146;s best interest was ever dealt
with.  In that regard, the record before us does not contain the
affidavits required by Rule 7.08(4).  Nor does the formal
judgment reflect that the settlement of damages was approved.  We
think, therefore, that the approval of the settlement of damages
in the amount of $8,834,421.21 should be referred to the trial
judge (or another Superior Court judge) for approval.  Once the
settlement is approved the judgment should be varied in
accordance with these reasons.
[97] For these reasons, subject to the approval of the damage
settlement, we would allow the cross-appeal with costs and amend
paragraph 1 of the judgment by substituting the figure of
$2,984,366.00 for the figure of $2,782,336.56 together with pre-
judgment interest on the additional damages.  We leave it to
counsel to work out the quantum of the pre-judgment interest.
Since counsel for the plaintiffs was responsible for the
incorrect addition of the damage claims, and since that error
necessitated the &#147;mistake&#148; motion before the trial judge, we do
not think that the plaintiffs should recover any costs in respect
of the motion.</pre>

jury was also asked to determine whether he was negligent in  the
operation  of  his motor vehicle and if so, to  what  extent  his
negligence  caused  or contributed to Thomas&#146; injuries.   Counsel
consented to this somewhat unusual procedure and also agreed that
there would be no joint liability.

the defendant is frequently awarded solicitor and client costs.</pre></td>
