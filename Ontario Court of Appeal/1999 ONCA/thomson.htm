    <pre>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   At  the conclusion of the oral argument the court dismissed</pre>
    <pre>this  appeal  and  indicated that written reasons  would  follow.</pre>
    <pre>These are the reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellants are unpaid suppliers of Consumers
Distributing Inc. (&#147;Consumers&#148;).  After Consumers went bankrupt,
the appellants brought an application for an order that they be
permitted, pursuant to s. 81.1 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended (the &#147;BIA&#148;), to repossess
goods sold and delivered to Consumers during the 30-day period
preceding their written demands for repossession.  This appeal is
from the judgment of Farley J. dismissing that application.
Farley J. held that the appellants did not have a right of
repossession under s. 81.1 of the BIA because neither the trustee
of Consumers&#146; bankrupt estate, nor the receiver appointed by
Consumers&#146; secured lenders, had possession of the goods in issue
as required by the section.  For the reasons set out below, I
agree with that result.
[3]  Farley J. also held that the appellants&#146; claims would have
failed because the goods which they sought to repossess had not
been adequately identified as being the goods that had been
delivered by the appellants within the 30-day period as required
by s. 81.1 of the BIA.  Because the court has dismissed this
appeal on the basis of the &#145;possession issue&#146;, it is not
necessary to address this alternative issue in these reasons.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The goods that the appellants sold to Consumers prior to its</pre>
    <pre>bankruptcy  and receivership on September 6, 1996 were  delivered</pre>
    <pre>to  a warehouse in Cambridge, Ontario, operated by the respondent</pre>
    <pre>Tibbett  &amp;  Britten Group Canada Inc., through its  wholly  owned</pre>
    <pre>subsidiary, the respondent Storcare Supply Chain Management  Inc.</pre>
    <pre>(collectively   &#147;Tibbett&#148;).    Tibbett   provided   comprehensive</pre>
    <pre>warehousing,  inventory management and distribution  services  to</pre>
    <pre>Consumers  across  Canada  pursuant  to  three  Warehousing   and</pre>
    <pre>Distribution  Agreements  entered into  in  1992  and  1993  (the</pre>
    <pre>&#147;warehousing  agreements&#148;).   As  a  result  of  the  warehousing</pre>
    <pre>agreements,   Consumers  ceased  providing  its   own   warehouse</pre>
    <pre>facilities  and  Tibbett  became Consumers&#146;  exclusive  warehouse</pre>
    <pre>services provider.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In addition, Consumers entered into a General Security
Agreement (the &#147;GSA&#148;) granting Tibbett a continuing security
interest over all of Consumers&#146; existing and future property,
assets and inventory to secure payment of all amounts owing, from
time to time, under the warehousing agreements.  Upon the
occurrence of one of the events of default under the GSA, which
events included the failure to pay the amounts owing under the
warehousing agreements and also the insolvency or bankruptcy of
Consumers, Tibbett was given the right to dispose of the
collateral secured by the GSA and to credit payments received
against outstanding obligations.  At the same time that Tibbett
entered into the GSA, Tibbett executed an agreement to
subordinate and postpone its security interest under the GSA to
the interest of Consumers&#146; secured lenders (the &#147;postponement
agreement&#148;).
[6]  The rights created by the GSA were in addition to any other
rights or remedies of Tibbett at law or under any statute.
Specifically, the rights under the GSA did not replace Tibbett&#146;s
rights to a possessory lien under s. 4(1) of the Repair and
Storage Liens Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.25 (the &#147;RSLA&#148;) which
creates a lien on articles stored in favour of the storer for the
amount agreed upon for the storage and entitles the storer to
retain possession of the articles stored until the amount is
paid.1
[7]  On July 29, 1996, Mr. Justice Houlden made an order under
the Companies Creditors Arrangement Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36
(the &#147;CCAA&#148;) declaring that Consumers was a company to which the
Act applied and imposing a broad stay of proceedings by creditors
against Consumers and its property (the &#147;CCAA order&#148;).  Section
31 of the CCAA order provided that in the event of the bankruptcy
or receivership of Consumers, the period of time between the date
of the CCAA order and the date of the bankruptcy or receivership
of Consumers would not be counted in determining the 30-day
period referred to in s. 81.1 of the BIA.
[8]  By July 29, 1996, Consumers was more than $1.6 million in
arrears in paying the storage fees provided for in the
warehousing agreements.
[9]  Clause 9C of the CCAA order recognized and provided
protection for Tibbett&#146;s possessory interest in the merchandise
stored in its warehouses.  Clause 9C read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               9C.  THIS COURT ORDERS that notwithstanding anything herein
          contained, Tibbett shall not be obliged to release any
          Merchandise unless it is paid for all services provided and
          amounts accruing due in respect thereof from the date of this
          Order forward in an amount and on terms to be agreed upon between
          the applicant [Consumers] and Tibbett.2
</pre>
    <pre>[10]  On August 2, 1996, Consumers wrote Tibbett terminating  the</pre>
    <pre>warehousing   agreements  and  advising  that   it   was   making</pre>
    <pre>alternative arrangements for the storage and distribution of  its</pre>
    <pre>goods.  The letter put Tibbett on notice that Consumers would  be</pre>
    <pre>attending   at  Tibbett&#146;s  Cambridge  warehouse  to  remove   all</pre>
    <pre>merchandise  stored  by Tibbett on behalf of  Consumers  in  that</pre>
    <pre>warehouse (the &#147;merchandise&#148;).</pre>
    <pre>[11] After Consumers terminated the warehousing agreements,
Tibbett refused to release the merchandise to Consumers asserting
claims against Consumers totalling approximately $10 million,
which amount was greater than the value of the merchandise.
Tibbett&#146;s claim included approximately $6.6 million for
obligations resulting from the termination of the warehousing
agreements, $1.6 million for pre-CCAA storage payment arrears and
further amounts relating to the closing of its Quebec warehouse
and certain post-CCAA costs and fees.  Although the court on the
application brought by the appellants was not asked to determine
the exact amount owing by Consumers to Tibbett, there is no
dispute that the amount was substantial, that it was secured by
the merchandise under the terms of the GSA and that at least a
portion of the amount owing gave rise to a possessory lien under
s. 4(1) of the RSLA.
[12] The attempted re-organization by Consumers pursuant to the
CCAA was unsuccessful.  On September 6, 1996 the stay of
proceedings imposed by the CCAA order was lifted, Consumers was
adjudged bankrupt and KPMG Inc. was appointed as trustee of its
bankrupt estate (the &#147;trustee&#148;).  In addition, on the same date,
the secured lenders of Consumers, which included the Royal Bank
of Canada and certain other banks (the &#147;banks&#148;), appointed
Coopers &amp; Lybrand as receiver and manager under their security
instruments (the &#147;receiver&#148;).  The appointment of the receiver
provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Events of default under the Security having occurred and the
          security interests therein having become enforceable pursuant to
          the provisions thereof, the Agent, on behalf of the Banks, hereby
          appoints Coopers &amp; Lybrand Limited (&#147;Coopers&#148;) as Receiver and
          Manager to take possession of and sell the Collateral with each
          and every power and authority specified in that regard by the
          Security and instructs Coopers to seize and sell the Collateral
          pursuant to the terms of the Security. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  After  the  appointment of the receiver,  Tibbett  and  the</pre>
    <pre>receiver  took  conflicting positions about  entitlement  to  the</pre>
    <pre>merchandise.  Tibbett (whose claim by now was approximately $10.8</pre>
    <pre>million) claimed that its security interest under the GSA and its</pre>
    <pre>possessory lien under the RSLA had first priority.  The receiver,</pre>
    <pre>on  the other hand, asserted that the merchandise formed part  of</pre>
    <pre>the  collateral over which the banks held security and  that  the</pre>
    <pre>banks  were  entitled to priority by virtue of  the  postponement</pre>
    <pre>agreement.  Although Tibbett allowed the receiver access  to  the</pre>
    <pre>Cambridge  warehouse for the purpose of inspecting and taking  an</pre>
    <pre>inventory  of  the  merchandise, it prevented the  receiver  from</pre>
    <pre>removing any of the merchandise from its warehouse.</pre>
    <pre>[14] On the days immediately following the bankruptcy and
receivership of Consumers, the appellants presented written
demands to the receiver, the trustee and Tibbett pursuant to s.
81.1 of the BIA.  The appellants demanded access to and
repossession of goods sold and delivered by them to Consumers
during the 30-day period preceding the presentation of the
demands.  Because s. 31 of the CCAA order provided that the
period between July 29 and September 6 would not count in
calculating the 30-day period referred to in s. 81.1 of the BIA,
the appellants&#146; demands reached back to include goods delivered
before July 29, 1996.  The written demands presented by the
appellants did not offer to pay any of the amounts owing by
Consumers to Tibbett.
[15] By letter dated September 24, 1996, the receiver informed
the appellants that it was not in possession of the merchandise
located at the Cambridge warehouse and that such goods were under
the control of Tibbett, the operator of the warehouse.  The
receiver also indicated that such goods might be subject to a
claim by Tibbett for storage charges pursuant to the RSLA and
that Tibbett had taken the position that it had possession of the
goods at the time of the presentation of the appellants&#146; written
demands and that it therefore had no obligation to permit
repossession of such goods or remit any proceeds from their sale.
[16] On September 27, 1996, the receiver and Tibbett entered into
an agreement to settle their dispute over the priority of their
respective claims to the merchandise (the &#147;settlement
agreement&#148;).  The settlement agreement provided that Tibbett
would release all of the merchandise to the receiver, other than
goods which the receiver had identified as being goods delivered
to the Cambridge warehouse within the 30-day period referred to
in s. 81.1. of the BIA, taking into account s. 31 of the CCAA
order (the &#147;30-day goods&#148;).  The value of the goods that Tibbett
agreed to release to the receiver was approximately $7 million.
In exchange, the receiver paid Tibbett $1,550,000 and agreed not
to assert any claim pursuant to the banks&#146; security over the 30-
day goods.  Further, the settlement agreement provided that as
between the receiver and Tibbett, Tibbett would be solely
responsible for dealing with the appellants in relation to their
claims for repossession of the 30-day goods.  The 30-day goods
had a value of approximately $1.5 million.
[17] The appellants demanded that Tibbett release the 30-day
goods claiming they had a right to repossess those goods under s.
81.1 of the BIA.  Tibbett disputed this claim maintaining its
position that the 30-day goods were not in the possession of
Consumers, the trustee or the receiver at the time the appellants
had presented their written demands and as a result the
appellants had no right to repossess the 30-day goods under s.
81.1.
[18] On September 30, 1996, the receiver entered into an
agreement with a liquidator for the sale of the inventory and
other assets owned by Consumers.  This agreement included the
sale of the merchandise, other than the 30-day goods.   The
amount owed by Consumers to the banks exceeded the value of the
inventory and assets to be sold by the liquidator and as a result
there would be no surplus available from the sale by the
liquidator for distribution to Consumers&#146; unsecured creditors
including the appellants.   Accordingly, the only possible source
of recovery for the appellants&#146; claims against Consumers would be
the claims asserted to repossess the 30-day goods under s. 81.1
of the BIA.
[19] On September 30, 1996, the appellants commenced this
proceeding against Tibbett and against the receiver.  The relief
sought against Tibbett included an order permitting the
appellants to repossess the 30-day goods.   On October 14, 1996,
Farley J. dismissed the appellants&#146; claims against Tibbett.  The
claims against the receiver were adjourned and are not in issue
on this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION
</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The  appellants contend that they are entitled to repossess</pre>
    <pre>the  30-day  goods  on  any one of four separate  grounds.   They</pre>
    <pre>assert claims based upon:</pre>
    <pre>     
     1.   The possession of the 30-day goods by the trustee;
2.   The possession of the 30-day goods by the receiver;
3.   The priority created by s. 81.1(6) of the BIA; or
4.   The payment by the appellants of the storage charges
relating to the 30-day goods.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  Before  addressing each of these claims, I will  make  some</pre>
    <pre>general  observations about s. 81.1 which apply to the first  two</pre>
    <pre>of the appellants&#146; claims, that are based on possession by either</pre>
    <pre>the trustee or the receiver.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Section 81.1 of the BIA, which was first enacted in 1992,
gives unpaid suppliers a right to repossess goods sold and
delivered to a purchaser who has been adjudged bankrupt or who
has been placed in receivership, provided the suppliers&#146; claims
meet the requirements set out in the section.  This preferential
claim for unpaid suppliers is an exception to the general rule in
bankruptcy proceedings that unsecured creditors share equally in
the bankrupt estate.3
[23] The requirements of s. 81.1 which are relevant to the first
two claims are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               81.1 ... the supplier ... may have access to and repossess
          the goods ..., if ...
          </pre>
    <pre>                (a)   the  supplier presents a  written
          demand  for  repossession to  the  purchaser,
          trustee  or receiver, in prescribed form  and
          containing  the  details of the  transaction,
          within  a  period of thirty  days  after  the
          delivery of the goods to the purchaser;
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (b)   at  the  time  when  the  demand
          referred to in paragraph (a) is presented,
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (i)  the purchaser is bankrupt, or
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (ii)  there is a receiver,  within
          the meaning of subsection 243(2), in relation
          to the purchaser;
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (c)   at  the  time  when  the  demand
          referred  to  in paragraph (a) is  presented,
          the goods
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (i)  are in the possession of  the
          purchaser, trustee or receiver.
          </pre>
    <pre>               [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>        The   full   text   of   s.   81.1   is   set   out    in</pre>
    <pre>an appendix to these reasons.

</pre>
    <pre>[24]  On  September  6, 1996, Consumers, a purchaser  within  the</pre>
    <pre>meaning  of  s.  81.1,  was adjudged bankrupt,  the  trustee  was</pre>
    <pre>appointed and the receiver, a receiver within the meaning  of  s.</pre>
    <pre>243(2) of the BIA, was appointed privately by the banks.  On  the</pre>
    <pre>days   immediately  following  the  bankruptcy   the   appellants</pre>
    <pre>presented  written  demands  to the  trustee,  the  receiver  and</pre>
    <pre>Tibbett  for repossession of the 30-day goods for which they  had</pre>
    <pre>not been paid.</pre>
    <pre>[25] The only issue to be decided with respect to each of the
appellants&#146; first two claims is whether the trustee4 or the
receiver, as the case may be, was in possession of the 30-day
goods after the bankruptcy and receivership when the appellants
presented their written demands for repossession.  If not, those
claims must fail.
[26] The appellants argue that Farley J. erred in interpreting
the requirement for possession in s. 81.1 too narrowly to include
only physical possession by a purchaser, trustee or receiver.
Although physical possession would obviously fall within the
ambit of the possession that is required by the section, I do not
read Farley J.&#146;s reasons as necessarily limiting possession to
only physical possession. In any event, it is the appellants&#146;
submission that the requirement for possession in s. 81.1 should
be interpreted broadly and liberally to include one or both of
the two relationships discussed below that existed after the
bankruptcy and receivership of Consumers.
[27]
I now turn to address each of the specific claims raised by the
appellants.</pre>
    <pre>     1.  Possession of the trustee: possession by a warehouseman
</pre>
    <pre>[28]  First,  the  appellants  argue  that  the  trustee  was  in</pre>
    <pre>possession  of the 30-day goods because Tibbett was  holding  the</pre>
    <pre>goods as a storer or warehouseman on behalf of Consumers prior to</pre>
    <pre>the bankruptcy and on behalf of the trustee after the bankruptcy.</pre>
    <pre>An   interpretation   that   recognizes   possession   in   these</pre>
    <pre>circumstances,  they submit, accords with the  modern  commercial</pre>
    <pre>reality  that businesses commonly contract out their  warehousing</pre>
    <pre>and  storage  requirements to third parties, in the  same  manner</pre>
    <pre>that  Consumers  had  done  in this case.   They  argue  that  an</pre>
    <pre>interpretation  of  s. 81.1 that ignores this  reality  would  be</pre>
    <pre>unreasonable  and unfairly limit the preferential right  that  s.</pre>
    <pre>81.1 is intended to create for unpaid suppliers.</pre>
    <pre>[29] In support of this argument, the appellants rely upon a
number of cases that hold that possession by a third person may
constitute possession in another when the goods in issue are
being held by the third person on behalf of the person whose
possession is material.  In City Fur Manufacturing Company, Ltd.
v. Fureenbond (Brokers) London, Ltd., [1937] 1 All E.R. 799
(K.B.), Branson J. expressed the principle as follows at p. 802:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I think it is perfectly plain by a reference to the Factors
          Act, 1889, s. 1(2), that it is sufficient in that Act that
          possession is possession by another person on behalf of the
          person whose possession is material, and I see no reason why the
          same kind of construction should not be put upon the words &#147;in
          possession of the goods&#148; in sect. 25 (1) of the Act of 1893.
          Possession by an agent, possession by a warehouseman or
          mercantile agent, is a perfectly well known form of possession in
          the business world, and I can see no reason for confining the
          meaning of it to personal possession or actual possession of the
          person who has sold the goods.
</pre>
    <pre>[30]  Although there is considerable appeal to this argument,  in</pre>
    <pre>my  view,  it does not assist the appellants in this  case.   The</pre>
    <pre>difficulty  they  face is that on the date  that  the  appellants</pre>
    <pre>presented  their written demands, Tibbett not only  had  physical</pre>
    <pre>possession of the 30-day goods but also had two legitimate  bases</pre>
    <pre>for  retaining  possession and refusing to deliver possession  to</pre>
    <pre>the  trustee.   Under  the GSA, Consumers granted  to  Tibbett  a</pre>
    <pre>continuing security interest over goods stored in its warehouses,</pre>
    <pre>including  the Cambridge warehouse, where the 30-day  goods  were</pre>
    <pre>being  held.   Upon  an  event  of default  occurring  under  the</pre>
    <pre>warehousing  agreements, Tibbett was entitled to dispose  of  the</pre>
    <pre>goods  stored in its warehouses, including the 30-day goods,  for</pre>
    <pre>purposes of satisfying the obligations then owing by Consumers to</pre>
    <pre>Tibbett.  There  is  no dispute that by the date  the  appellants</pre>
    <pre>presented  their written demands, events of default had occurred.</pre>
    <pre>Consumers owed Tibbett a substantial amount of money and  neither</pre>
    <pre>Consumers, nor the trustee after the bankruptcy, had offered  nor</pre>
    <pre>were  they in a position to be able to pay Tibbett the money then</pre>
    <pre>owing.   In  addition  to the security interest  under  the  GSA,</pre>
    <pre>Tibbett  had a possessory lien under s. 4(1) of the RSLA to  hold</pre>
    <pre>the  merchandise stored in its warehouse until the amount  agreed</pre>
    <pre>upon for storage had been satisfied.</pre>
    <pre>[31] Although it may be said that Tibbett held the merchandise in
its warehouses on behalf of Consumers before the default under
the warehousing agreements that was no longer the situation at
the time the appellants presented their written demands.
Tibbett&#146;s security interest under the GSA and its possessory lien
had priority over any claim of Consumers or the trustee.  Until
the amounts owing were paid, Tibbett held the merchandise for its
own account.
[32] The claim of the trustee to possession of the merchandise,
including the 30-day goods, was conditional upon payment of the
substantial amount of money then owing by Consumers to Tibbett.
The trustee had not offered nor was it able to pay the amount
owing.  In presenting their written demands for repossession, the
appellants did not propose to pay the amounts necessary to
discharge Tibbett&#146;s security interest under the GSA or its
possessory lien under the RSLA.  I am satisfied that s. 81.1 is
not intended to create a greater interest for suppliers in 30-day
goods than the interest of the party upon whose possession their
claims are based.  For those reasons, I am of the view that the
trustee was not in possession of the 30-day goods on the dates
that the appellants presented their written demands and that the
appellants&#146; claims for repossession founded on the trustee&#146;s
possession must fail.</pre>
    <pre>     2.  Possession of the receiver: the right to possession
</pre>
    <pre>[33]  Next,  the appellants argue that on the date the appellants</pre>
    <pre>presented  their written demands, the receiver was in  possession</pre>
    <pre>of  the  30-day goods within the meaning of s. 81.1 of  the  BIA.</pre>
    <pre>The receiver is in a different position than the trustee because,</pre>
    <pre>under  the  postponement agreement, Tibbett had subordinated  its</pre>
    <pre>GSA  security  interest  to  the  security  interest  created  by</pre>
    <pre>Consumers in favour of the banks.  Thus, it is argued that on the</pre>
    <pre>date   of  the  appellants&#146;  written  demands,  Tibbett  had   no</pre>
    <pre>legitimate basis for denying a claim by the receiver for delivery</pre>
    <pre>of those goods.  The receiver, the appellants say, had a right to</pre>
    <pre>take  possession  and  because s. 81.1 is  a  remedial  provision</pre>
    <pre>creating a special protection for suppliers, possession should be</pre>
    <pre>interpreted broadly to extend to situations in which  the  person</pre>
    <pre>whose possession is material has a right to take possession.</pre>
    <pre>[34] The short answer to this argument appears to be that the
postponement agreement only subordinates Tibbett&#146;s security
interest under the GSA to the interest of the banks, but does not
postpone Tibbett&#146;s possessory lien under s. 4(1) of the RSLA.
Assuming that to be the case, then the same reasons that lead me
to conclude that the trustee was not in possession of the 30-day
goods would also defeat the argument that the receiver was in
possession at the relevant time.   However, because the extent of
the postponement agreement is not entirely clear and because we
did not have the benefit of the receiver&#146;s submissions on this
point, I think it is important to outline why this argument of
the appellant, based on the possession of the receiver, must fail
in any event.
[35] On September 6, 1996, the banks appointed the receiver to
take possession of the collateral secured by this loan agreement
with Consumers.  The collateral referred to in the appointment
included the 30-day goods.
[36] The 30-day goods were in the physical possession of Tibbett.
Throughout, Tibbett asserted that it had a prior claim to
possession and refused to allow the receiver to remove the goods
from its warehouse.  The receiver took no steps to take
possession; indeed, in its letter to the suppliers of September
24, 1996 it advised that it was not in possession of the
merchandise at the Cambridge warehouse.  Although the receiver
entered into negotiations with Tibbett in which it claimed the
right to possession, it did nothing to enforce that right and on
September 27, 1996 the receiver entered into the settlement
agreement by which it agreed not to assert any claim on behalf of
the banks to the 30-day goods.  Therefore, the position of the
appellants, at its highest, is that the receiver had an
unexercised right to take possession.
[37] The wording of s. 243(2) of the BIA, which was first enacted
at the same time as s. 81.1, makes it clear that a receiver who
has been appointed to take possession of goods is not in
possession of those goods simply by virtue of that appointment.
Section 243(2) defines a receiver as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>     243(2) .... &#147;receiver&#148; means a person who has been appointed
 to take, or has taken, possession or control ... of ... the
 inventory .... of an insolvent person or a bankrupt.
</pre>
    <pre>         If the appointment to take possession constitutes     
possession, the inclusion of the words &#147;or has  taken possession&#148;    
would be unnecessary. The ordinary meaning of the language of    
s. 243(2) suggests that something in addition to the appointment    
of a receiver is required to constitute possession by the
receiver. This interpretation of s. 243(2) is also supported by
the principles of statutory  construction which require that
meaning should be attributed to all words in a statutory provision
and that different words should be  given  different  meanings. 
R. v. Bauer, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 1124, per Estey J. at pp. 113l5-6 
and Driedger on the Construction  of  Statutes, 3d. ed.  (1994),
at p. 165.

</pre>
    <pre>[38]  The appellants are not assisted in their argument that  the
receiver had possession by cases such as City Fur Manaufacturing,
supra,  which  hold that possession by an agent or a warehouseman
may  constitute  possession  in the person  whose  possession  is
material.  Tibbett was not the agent of the receiver nor  had  it
contracted   to  hold  the  goods  for  the  receiver.    Indeed,
throughout the relevant period, Tibbett asserted a claim that was
contrary  to  the  claim  of the receiver.   The  rationale  that
underlies the agent or warehouseman cases does not apply  to  the
relationship between Tibbett and the receiver in September  1996.
On  these facts, I am satisfied that Tibbett was not holding  the
goods  on  behalf of the receiver. This conclusion  may  well  be
different  in  the situation in which a receiver  actually  takes
possession  and arranges with another to store or  warehouse  the
goods on its behalf.  That is not this case.</pre>
    <pre>[39] The appellants are also not helped by those cases which hold
that possession may include a right to possession:  R. v. Martin,
[1948] O.R. 962 (C.A.); Towers &amp; Co., Ltd. v. Gray, [1961] 2 All
E.R. 68 (Q.B.).  None of the cases relied upon by the appellants
involved an interpretation of the BIA or similar legislation, nor
did any of those cases arise in the context of a receiver having
an unexercised right to take possession.  Clearly, the BIA must
be interpreted on the basis of the specific language used in the
statute and in the context in which the language is used.  As I
set out above, the language of s. 243(2) leads to the conclusion
that a receiver&#146;s unexercised right to take possession is not
possession within the meaning of the BIA.  In my view, this
interpretation makes sense in the context of s. 81.1.  It avoids
the prospect of unwieldy litigation in which a supplier seeks to
enforce a receiver&#146;s right to take possession of 30-day goods in
circumstances in which the receiver had not sought to enforce the
right.
[40] The appellants argue that if s. 81.1 is interpreted in this
manner, then a receiver may defeat claims of unpaid suppliers by
delaying taking possession of 30-day goods until 30 days after
the date of bankruptcy or receivership or by bargaining away its
right to take possession of 30-day goods in exchange for other
benefits.
[41] That may be the result, but there is nothing necessarily
unfair to unpaid suppliers if that occurs.  In many cases, the
receiver&#146;s claim to possession will be the same as the
purchaser&#146;s or the trustee&#146;s, no better or worse.  In these
situations, if a receiver does not exercise a right to take
possession, the suppliers will have a claim based on the
possession of either the purchaser or the trustee.  In this case,
however, the appellants argue that, because of the postponement
agreement, the receiver had a better claim to possession than
either Consumers or the trustee.  The practical effect of their
argument is that they would receive the benefit of the
postponement agreement because they would have a claim to
repossession based on the receiver's possession in circumstances
in which they had no claim based on the possession of Consumers
or the trustee.
[42] However, it seems to me that it is the receiver on behalf of
the banks, not the appellants, who should primarily be entitled
to the benefit of the postponement agreement; it was the banks
whose interests the agreement was intended to benefit in the
first place.  If the receiver chose not to take possession of the
30-day goods or to bargain away its claim for the 30-day goods
for reasons that it considered to be in the best interests of the
banks, it was be entitled to do so and if the result is that the
suppliers did not obtain the benefit of the postponement
agreement, then so be it.
[43] The receiver was, of course, constrained by its obligations
under s. 247 of the BIA to act in good faith.5  There is no
evidence in this record to suggest that the receiver in
conducting its negotiations with Tibbett and entering the
settlement agreement breached its duties under s. 247.   If the
appellants felt aggrieved or unfairly treated in this respect,
their remedy was against the receiver not against Tibbett.
[44] For these reasons, I am satisfied that the receiver was not
in possession of the 30-day goods on the dates the appellants
presented their written demands for repossession.  The
appellants&#146; claims based on the possession of the receiver must
fail.</pre>
    <pre>     3.  Claims based on priority in s. 81.1(b) of the BIA
</pre>
    <pre>[45]  The appellants argue that s. 81.1(6) of the BIA gives  them
claims  to  the 30-day goods that are superior to the  claims  of
Tibbett.  Section 81.1(6) provides as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
      81.1 (6) Notwithstanding any other federal or provincial Act
   or law, a supplier&#146;s right to repossess goods pursuant to this
   section ranks above every other claim or right against the
   purchaser in respect of those goods, other than the right of a
   bona fide subsequent purchaser of the goods for value without
   notice that the supplier had demanded repossession of the goods.
</pre>
    <pre>[46]  The  priority  created by s. 81.1(6)  only  arises  if  the</pre>
    <pre>supplier  has a right to repossess under s. 81.1.   I  have  held</pre>
    <pre>that  the  appellants  had  no such rights  and  accordingly  the</pre>
    <pre>priority created by s. 81.1(6) has no application.
</pre>
    <pre>     4.  Claims based on payment of storage charges
</pre>
    <pre>[47]  Finally,  the  appellants argue, as an alternative  to  the
argument that they have a right to repossess under s. 81.1,  that
they  ought  to  be  entitled to repossess upon  payment  of  the
storage charges relating to the 30-day goods.  This proposal  was
not  made  at  the  time the appellants presented  their  written
demands.  As I have held that the requirements for possession  in
s.  81.1  have  not  been met, the appellants have  no  right  of
repossession.   The  BIA  makes  no  alternative  provision   for
repossession  upon payment of specific amounts  such  as  storage
costs  relating  to  the goods over which  the  30-day  claim  is
asserted.    Accordingly,  I  would  give  no  effect   to   this
alternative request for relief.
Physical Possession &#150; s. 81.1 of the BIA
</pre>
    <pre>[48]  Because of the basis on which I have dealt with the  issues
raised by this appeal, it is not necessary to decide whether  the
requirement  for  possession in s. 81.1 is  limited  to  physical
possession.   However, Farley J. addressed  this  issue  in  some
detail and I wish to make it clear that these reasons should  not
be  taken  as  agreeing with an interpretation that  narrows  the
requirement for possession in s. 81.1 to only physical possession
by the purchaser, trustee or receiver.</pre>
    <pre>[49] The primary argument in support of the narrow interpretation
is that the word &#147;possession&#148; is used in conjunction with the
words &#147;power&#148; and &#147;control&#148; in other sections of the BIA.6  Thus,
it is argued, possession, which often includes things over which
one exercises control in addition to those things in one&#146;s
physical possession, must when used in s. 81.1 without those
words, be limited to physical possession.
[50] It seems to me, however, that the language and purposes of
the BIA may be capable of supporting an interpretation of the
word &#147;possession&#148; in s. 81.1 that includes some third party
possessions closely akin to physical possession and where the
control exercised by the owner (or receiver or trustee) is
virtually exclusive.
[51] Further, I would observe that a narrow interpretation of the
meaning of &#147;possession&#148; in s. 81.1 that excludes all third party
possessions ignores the commercial reality that some purchasers
and certainly some trustees and receivers will take possession of
goods and arrange to have the goods held on their behalf by third
party warehouses.  While I agree with Farley J. that s. 81.1 is
an exception to the general rule that unsecured creditors share
equally in the bankrupt estate, an interpretation of the meaning
of &#147;possession&#148; in s. 81.1 which excludes possession in these
types of circumstances may unnecessarily restrict the rights that
parliament intended to confer on unpaid suppliers.
[52]For all of the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with
costs to the respondents.
