    <pre>On appeal from the award of costs in the judgment of Mr. Justice
Nordheimer dated June 18, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The Toronto Harbour Commissioners (&#147;the T.H.C.&#148;) seek leave
to  appeal  an award of costs made by Nordheimer J. on  June  18,
1999.  Notwithstanding  that the T.H.C.  was  successful  in  its
application  for declaratory relief in relation to a  lease  with
T.H.C.  Parking Inc. (&#147;Parking&#148;), the applications judge  awarded
solicitor and client costs against T.H.C. payable to Parking. The
order was made on the basis that T.H.C. had made allegations of a
serious nature that were not substantiated.
[2]  T.H.C. brought an application for a declaration that Parking
was a year-to-year periodic tenant of the parking area associated
with the premises situated at 30 Bay Street  and that the tenancy
expired on September 30, 1999. In defence to this application,
Parking asserted that T.H.C. was bound by the terms of a 1993
lease and that the tenancy was for a longer term. As a response
to this defence, T.H.C. argued, amongst other things, that there
was good reason to doubt that the 1993 lease had been entered
into in good faith. More specifically, T.H.C. argued that
Parking&#146;s own evidence indicated that the lease was a fraud on
the creditors of Parking&#146;s predecessor company, and that the
lease had not been disclosed to the trustee in bankruptcy of
Parking&#146;s predecessor. T.H.C. sought to invoke the principle that
a court should not enforce an illegal agreement.
[3]  The allegations were first made in T.H.C.&#146;s factum as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               at paragraph 3:
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  THC maintains that it is not bound
          by the sublease for the following reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)   the sublease is illegal, by reason
               of it being a fraud on the creditors and
               trustee in bankruptcy of Canada Auto Parks
               Corporation (&quot;Canada Auto Parks&quot;), and the
               court  should not enforce an illegal  or
               criminal transaction;
          </pre>
    <pre>               at paragraph 7:
          </pre>
    <pre>                The existence of the 1991 Sublease,  or
          its  surrender  one month  earlier,  was  not
          disclosed to creditors, or to the trustee  in
          bankruptcy.
          </pre>
    <pre>               and at paragraph 17:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The 1993 Sublease was created as a fraud
          on the creditors and trustee in bankruptcy of
          Canada   Auto  Parks,  and  the  failure   to
          disclose  the  1993 Sublease was  an  offence
          pursuant  to  s.  198 of the  Bankruptcy  and
          Insolvency  Act.  The courts do  not  enforce
          illegal, criminal or unlawful transactions.</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  applications judge rejected the  defence  advanced  by
Parking and granted the relief sought by T.H.C. on grounds  other
than  the  alleged illegality of the 1993 lease. The applications
judge was of the view that it had been unnecessary for T.H.C.  to
advance this additional argument. In his view, the allegations of
fraud  and  of  improper conduct made in support of the  argument
were  serious in nature and not substantiated on the  record.  He
concluded  &#147;that  the  evidence  proffered  in  support  of  such
allegations  was  so  thin as to be virtually non-existent&#148;.  The
applications judge therefore found it appropriate to exercise his
discretion  under Rule 57.01(2) of the Rules of  Civil  Procedure
and  award  costs  against  T.H.C. despite  its  success  on  the
application.
[5]  Counsel for T.H.C. on appeal disputed the applications
judge&#146;s finding that there was no evidence to substantiate the
argument made in first instance. Alternatively, she argued that
any deficiency in the record was caused by Parking&#146;s own failure
to fulfill its undertakings. Finally, she sought to introduce
fresh evidence to further substantiate the argument that no
disclosure of the lease had been made to the trustee in
bankruptcy by Parking&#146;s predecessor.
[6]  The fresh evidence is inadmissible. Much of it could have
been obtained prior to the hearing of the application with the
exercise of due diligence and none of it is conclusive on any of
the issues raised. Hence, I do not think it likely that the fresh
evidence would have affected the result.
[7]  The applications judge was correct in finding that
allegations of fraud and misconduct are serious in nature. And,
in my view, his finding that the allegations were not
substantiated by the record is supported by the evidence. Despite
the scant record, T.H.C. nonetheless chose to advance the
argument at its own risk. In these circumstances, it was clearly
within the applications judge&#146;s discretion to impose cost
consequences to T.H.C.&#146;s failure to prove the allegations.
[8]  However, I see no basis for such a drastic remedy as that
imposed. Save and except for its failure to prove the additional
allegations made in its factum, T.H.C. was wholly successful on
its application. There is no doubt that it would otherwise have
been entitled to its costs of the application. The allegations,
although serious in nature, were not the most egregious of their
kind and did not go beyond what was necessary to advance the
argument sought to be advanced. Finally, although the ultimate
burden rested on T.H.C. to prove the allegations and to take
whatever action was necessary to obtain the required information,
Parking cannot, on the face of the record before the court,
assert without equivocation that it has fulfilled all its
undertakings.
[9]  I would therefore grant leave to appeal, set aside the order
on costs and make no order as to costs both in first instance and
on the appeal.
