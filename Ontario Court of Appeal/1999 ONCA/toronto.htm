    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The City of Toronto leases the land for Union Station to the
Toronto Terminals Railway Company (&#147;TTR&#148;) by a perpetual series
of 21-year leases.  The rent for each lease is either agreed to
by the parties or set by arbitration.  The parties could not
agree on the rent for the lease term 1968-89 and the new rent was
not set by a panel of arbitrators until 1996.  The City claimed
interest on the difference between the old rent and the new rent
from the beginning of the term of the lease.  The arbitration
panel held that it had no jurisdiction to award interest, relying
on this court&#146;s decision in Sapra v. Frank Stollery Ltd,1 which
holds that the new rent is not due until it is determined by the
arbitrators.  The City&#146;s appeal to the Divisional Court was
dismissed.2
[2]  The City now appeals to this court.  The City submits that
the arbitration panel had jurisdiction to award interest on any
one of three bases: by implying a term in the lease for the
payment of interest, by resorting to the Judicature Act, which
permitted an award of interest on a judgment for the payment of
money, or by exercising an equitable jurisdiction.  In advancing
these submissions, the City asked us to overrule our decision in
Sapra.
[3]  I would not overrule Sapra, and I agree with the arbitration
panel that it had no jurisdiction to award interest.
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND FACTS</pre>
    <pre>(a)  History of the Lease</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In 1904, the Grand Trunk Railway Company of Canada (&#147;GTR&#148;)
applied to the Board of Railway Commissioners of Canada (the
&#147;Board&#148;) to expropriate land owned by the City of Toronto between
Yonge Street and York Street in order to build a station and
terminal facilities for its railway.  GTR&#146;s application was made
shortly after the great fire, which had destroyed or damaged most
of the buildings on this land.  The land is now the site of Union
Station.</pre>
    <pre>(b)  The 1905 Order and the 1905 Agreement</pre>
    <pre>[5]  On February 23, 1905, the Board issued an order authorizing
GTR to expropriate the land.  Following the Board&#146;s order, on
April 22, 1905, GTR and the City agreed that the City would give
GTR a lease &#147;subject to renewal for all time to come&#148; for Union
Station at rents to be varied at 21 year intervals.  All the
subsequent leases, including the lease in issue on this appeal,
were based on this 1905 Agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The 1905 Agreement provided that for the first 21-year
period, 1905-1926, the annual rent was to be $14,000.  For the
second 21-year period, 1926-1947, the annual rent was to be
$20,000.  For all future 21-year periods &#147;forever&#148; after, leases
were to be &#147;at such annual rental as may be agreed upon, and in
default of agreement as shall be determined by arbitration&#148;.  The
1905 Agreement also provided that the leases to be negotiated
between GTR and the City &#147;shall&#148; include a &#147;covenant to pay
rent&#148;, a covenant &#147;for re-entry on non-payment of rent and such
other covenants as may be necessary and proper to carry out this
agreement&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>(c)  The 1905 Lease (for the period 1905-1926)</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The City and GTR signed the 1905 Lease in 1915.  The
parties, however, intended that rent be payable throughout the
term of the lease.  Thus, the 1905 Lease provided for the rent
set out in the 1905 Agreement, and also provided that the rent
would be payable in &#147;equal consecutive half-yearly sums &#133; on the
Twenty-third day of February and the Twenty-third day of August
in each and every year during the said term.&#148;
[8]  The 1905 Lease confirmed that the rent for the period 1926-
47 would be $20,000 and that future leases would be at a rent
agreed on by the parties or, failing agreement, as determined by
the arbitration of three arbitrators.
[9]  Although the 1905 Agreement provided that the lease &#147;shall&#148;
contain &#147;such other covenants as may be necessary and proper to
carry out this agreement&#148;, the parties chose not to include in
the 1905 Lease any provision for interest on any rent increase
determined by arbitration after the beginning of the term of the
lease.
[10] In 1915, GTR assigned the lease to Union Station to the
respondent TTR.  TTR is a federally incorporated company, created
by special statute in 1906, to run Union Station.</pre>
    <pre>(d)  The 1926 Lease (for the period 1926-47)</pre>
    <pre>[11] The lease to Union Station was first renewed in 1926.  The
1926 Lease between the City and TTR was signed in 1930.  It
contained substantially the same terms as the 1905 Lease, and it
provided for the earlier agreed on annual rental of $20,000,
payable in equal half-yearly instalments on February 23 and
August 23 during the lease term.  Again, the parties chose not to
include any provision for interest on increased rent determined
by arbitration after the beginning of the term of the lease.</pre>
    <pre>(e)  The 1947 Lease (for the period 1947-68)</pre>
    <pre>[12] The 1947 Lease was the first lease for which the rent had
not been stipulated under the 1905 Agreement.  TTR and the City
eventually did agree on an annual rent of $55,000 but their
negotiations were not concluded and the 1947 Lease was not signed
until October 1949, 20 months into the lease term.  Still, the
parties did not include any provision for interest on the rent
increase.  The absence of an interest provision in the 1947 Lease
was an important consideration in the arbitration panel&#146;s refusal
to imply a term for the payment of interest in the 1968 Lease.
[13] The 1947 Lease was much like the previous leases.  Rent was
again payable in half-yearly instalments on February 23 and
August 23; the covenants were similar; and express provision was
made for another 21-year lease for the period 1968-89 at an
agreed upon rent or as determined by arbitration.</pre>
    <pre>(f)  The 1995 Arbitration</pre>
    <pre>[14] Although the term of the 1947 Lease expired in 1968, no new
lease was finalized in the 1968-89 period.  Rent negotiations
were delayed while the City dealt with a proposal to redevelop a
large segment of the railway lands, including the Union Station
land.  The rent negotiations that did take place failed to
produce an agreement and, therefore, the annual rent to be paid
by TTR had to be arbitrated.  The City, however, did not even ask
for arbitration to set the new rent until June 1983, 15 years
into the lease term, when it appointed its first nominee to the
arbitration panel.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The parties subsequently signed an arbitration agreement in
which they agreed that the issue to be arbitrated was: what is
the annual rent to be paid by TTR to the City under the 1905
Agreement and the Leases, for the 21-year period that began on
February 23, 1968.  The parties acknowledged that they were
unable to agree on the arbitrators&#146; jurisdiction to award
interest, or if the arbitrators had jurisdiction, on whether the
City was entitled to interest.
[16] The arbitration hearing was scheduled to begin on the merits
in October 1989.  However, before the hearing began, the City
alleged that the entire arbitration panel was biased.  In 1990,
the City launched a judicial review application to remove all
three arbitrators for alleged bias.  The City abandoned its
application in September 1994 and the arbitration hearing began
in 1995.  The panel gave its decision the following year.
Throughout the entire 28 years from the beginning of the lease
term in February 1968 to the arbitrators&#146; decision in April 1996,
the City invoiced TTR every six months for $27,500, the rent
payable under the 1947 Lease.  The City never claimed any
additional amount in these invoices either for increased rent or
for interest.  Nevertheless, whether the City is entitled to
interest for the 28 years on the increased rent awarded by the
arbitration panel is the issue on this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>(g)  The Arbitration Award</pre>
    <pre>[17] The arbitration panel concluded that the annual rent for the
21-year period 1968-89 should be $300,000 plus an additional
$8,400 per year for TTR&#146;s use of parking space.  These amounts
are not in issue on this appeal.
[18] On the question of interest, the panel did not blame the
City, or for that matter TTR, for the delay in arbitrating.
Instead, the panel concluded that &#147;if we as arbitrators have
jurisdiction to award interest it would be immaterial which of
the parties has been responsible for the delay.&#148;
[19] The panel then considered three possible jurisdictional
bases for awarding interest &#150; contractual, statutory, and
equitable &#150; and rejected each of them.
[20] The panel was of the view that it was not justified in
implying a contractual term requiring TTR to pay interest.  It
noted the delay in finalizing the 1947 Lease and observed that,
in settling its terms, the City &#147;could well have foreseen that
there might be similar delays in the future and could have
negotiated an obligation to pay interest.&#148;
[21] The panel found no statutory jurisdiction to award interest
because, under the Judicature Act,3 interest could be ordered
only on &#147;a judgment for the payment of money&#148; and, in the panel&#146;s
view, an award determining the amount of rent to be paid during a
lease term is not a judgment for the payment of money.
[22] Finally, the panel considered whether it had equitable
jurisdiction to award interest.  The arbitrators recognized that
TTR had the economic advantage of paying only $55,000 per year
for over 27 years.  &#147;As a matter of equity&#148; they thought interest
should be awarded on the increased rent.  They noted that &#147;today
interest is not looked on as a penalty exacted for the wrongful
withholding of a payment.  It is no more than the amount one pays
for the use of someone else&#146;s money &#133;  If one person has the use
of another&#146;s money, he normally expects to pay interest.&#148;  But
&#147;with some regret&#148; the arbitrators considered themselves bound by
the decision of this court in Sapra, and the decision of the
Divisional Court in Re Revenue Properties Co. and Victoria
University,4 which, in their view, precluded an award of interest
on the increased rent determined by arbitration.  The arbitrators
also rejected adding to the rent an amount for the loss of
purchasing power or the loss of opportunity, which they saw as
tantamount to an award of interest.  They held that they could
not do indirectly what they had no jurisdiction to do directly.
Had they decided they did have jurisdiction to award interest,
they would have applied a rate of 7.5%.</pre>
    <pre>(h)  The Decision of the Divisional Court</pre>
    <pre>[23] The City appealed the panel&#146;s decision on interest to the
Divisional Court, under the terms of the arbitration agreement,
which permitted either party to appeal on an issue of law.  On
September 9, 1998, in a one-paragraph endorsement, the Divisional
Court (O&#146;Leary, Corbett and Swinton JJ.) dismissed the City&#146;s
appeal, holding that they were prevented from awarding interest
by the decision in Sapra.
[24] Leave to appeal to this court was granted on September 9,
1998.  The court convened a 5-judge panel because the City asked
us to overrule Sapra.5

</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[25] TTR acknowledges that arbitrators have the same jurisdiction
to award interest as does a court.6  The panel correctly
concluded that, like courts, arbitrators have three possible
jurisdictional bases to award interest: by contract, under a
statute, or in equity.</pre>
    <pre>1.   Did the Arbitrators Have Jurisdiction to Award Contractual
     Interest?</pre>
    <pre>[26] None of the lease agreements between the City and TTR
expressly provided for the payment of interest.  The City submits
that the arbitrators ought to have implied a term requiring TTR
to pay interest on the additional rent determined by arbitration
to give &#147;business efficacy&#148; to the lease.  I do not agree with
this submission for three reasons.
[27] First, I doubt the City can even appeal on this issue.  The
arbitration agreement provides for appeals only on issues of law.
The City asks to imply a term in the lease, not by law or even by
custom, but, in fact, by asking the court to determine the
presumed intention of the parties had they considered the
question of interest at the beginning of the lease term in 1968.
This is an issue of fact or, at best, mixed fact and law, for
which no appeal is provided.7
[28] Second, as Iacobucci J. points out in the recent case of
M.J.B. Enterprises Ltd. v. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.,8 &#147;&#133;
the implication of the term must have a certain degree of
obviousness to it &#133; if there is evidence of a contrary intention,
on the part of either party, an implied term may not be found on
this basis&#148;.  Here, the best evidence of the parties&#146; presumed
intention is their previous lease negotiations.  The City and TTR
(or its predecessor) negotiated three leases, the 1905 Lease, the
1926 Lease and the 1947 Lease.  The 1905 Agreement, the
foundation for all three leases, permitted the parties to include
&#147;such other covenants as may be necessary and proper to carry out
this agreement&#148;, yet in none of the leases did the parties choose
to provide for interest.  Indeed, as the arbitration panel
pointed out, from its negotiations over the 1947 Lease, the City
could reasonably have foreseen the very situation it now faces
but it did not then insist on including a provision for interest.
I do not see how it can insist on including one now.
[29] Third, the City&#146;s business efficacy argument, though
superficially attractive, is effectively answered by TTR&#146;s
submission that, by implying a term for the payment of interest,
the court would be improving on the landlord&#146;s bargain, when the
landlord neither insisted on providing for interest nor pressed
on with arbitration.  Like the arbitration panel, I find
persuasive the reasons of Fox J. in Trust House Forte Albany
Hotels Ltd. v. Daejan Investments Ltd.9  That case also dealt
with a lease that provided for periodic rent review but did not
provide for interest between the review date and the date when
the revised rent was decided by arbitration.  The landlord argued
that the court ought to imply an obligation on the tenant to pay
interest &#147;to give business efficacy to the terms of the
contract&#148;.  Fox J. rejected this argument.  He acknowledged that
it would be commercially reasonable for the parties to include a
term for the payment of interest but found no reason for the
court to improve on the landlord&#146;s bargain.  He wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>               To say that the parties must inevitably
          have accepted the introduction of an interest
          provision to give sensible business effect to
          their dealing is, in my view, going
          altogether too far in the context of this
          case.  The tenant, it seems to me, might well
          have said to the landlord: &#147;You can have your
          rent review clause, and I will pay you what
          the surveyor decides when he decides it, but
          I will not pay you any more.  If there is
          some delay, it is something, against the
          background of this case and the rent which I
          am paying, that you must put up with&#148;.   The
          landlord could have stipulated for an
          interest provision as a term of entering into
          the transaction (at, I may say, a rate of
          interest which I could no more than guess at,
          since there are many possibilities which
          would have been open to the parties).  The
          landlord did not do so, and I can see no
          reason why the court should now improve upon
          the landlord&#146;s bargain.  In my judgment,
          there is no ground for the implication of the
          provision contended for by the landlord.10</pre>
    <pre>[30] A delayed rent review ordinarily advantages the tenant
because, until the higher rent is set, the tenant has the use of
the money representing the difference between the old rent and
the new higher rent.11  At the same time, the tenant can protect
itself by getting an appraisal to estimate an amount of money to
set aside pending the determination of the new rent.  But the
parties could reasonably contemplate the tenant&#146;s economic
advantage.  Rent review by negotiation or arbitration inevitably
takes time.  Frequently, the amount of rent is not set until
after the commencement date of the lease.  Indeed, delay is
inherent in the process for fixing rent set out in the 1905
Agreement and was borne out by the negotiations over the 1947
Lease.  Thus two commercially sophisticated parties agreed to a
process that produces delay.  They must be taken to be aware that
delay was likely.  The City could have protected itself in one of
two ways: either by insisting on a term in the lease for the
payment of interest or by proceeding quickly to arbitration.  It
did neither.  It is not for this court to come to its aid.
Therefore, I would not imply a term in the lease for the payment
of interest.</pre>
    <pre>2.   Did the Arbitrators Have Statutory Jurisdiction to Award
     Interest?</pre>
    <pre>[31] The arbitration proceedings began in 1983 when the City
appointed its first nominee.  The applicable and only possible
statutory authority to award interest was s.36(3) of the now
repealed Judicature Act.12  Subsection 36(3) states that &#147;a person
who is entitled to a judgment for the payment of money is
entitled to claim and have included in the judgment an award of
interest thereon&#148;.  The arbitrators concluded that their ruling
was not a &#147;judgment for the payment of money&#148;.  Instead, they
were merely &#147;determining the amount of rent payable during the
lease term&#148;.  I agree with their conclusion.
[32] Arbitrators can decide only the questions referred to them.
Here, the arbitrators were not asked to decide whether TTR owed
the City a debt or whether TTR had breached a term of the lease
or what, if any, compensation TTR should pay.  The parties only
asked the arbitrators to declare the rent to be paid by TTR to
the City for Union Station.  The arbitrators answered this
question.  They declared the annual rent to be $300,000.  They
were not asked to and they did not make an order directing TTR to
pay the City.
[33] A long line of cases in Canada and in England has
distinguished between a declaration of rent to be paid on a rent
review arbitration and a judgment for the payment of money.  The
two are not the same.  The distinction, though seemingly
technical, is sound.  The arbitrators declare the rent.  The
lease then determines what obligations flow from that
declaration.13  Thus, the arbitrators&#146; award does not entitle the
City to a judgment for the payment of money.  The calculation of
what the City was owed depended on the terms of the lease and how
much TTR had already paid.  I therefore agree with the
arbitrators that they had no statutory jurisdiction to award
interest.</pre>
    <pre>3.   Did the Arbitrators Have an Equitable Jurisdiction to Award
     Interest?</pre>
    <pre>[34] The arbitrators concluded that they had no free-standing
jurisdiction to award interest in equity.  In so concluding, they
held that no breach of fiduciary duty had been made out and that
they were bound by this court&#146;s decision in Sapra, later followed
by the Divisional Court in Re Revenue Properties.
[35] The City submits that interest should be awarded in equity.
It makes three arguments in support of this submission.  First,
it argues that Sapra is wrong and should be overruled.  Second,
it argues that interest ought to be awarded as compensation for
the improper withholding of a just debt.  And third, it argues
that TTR should pay interest for its use and occupation of the
City&#146;s property during the term of the lease.  I would not give
effect to any of these arguments.
[36] Sapra raises the same issue as the case before us.  In
Sapra, the tenant had the right to renew its lease at a rent to
be negotiated or determined by arbitration.  The tenant exercised
its right of renewal but the parties could not agree on the new
rent.  Three years into the lease term, an arbitrator fixed the
rent, substantially increasing the old amount.  The landlord
claimed interest on the difference between the old rent and the
new rent from the beginning of the term of the lease to the date
of the arbitration.  The parties had not stipulated for interest
on this difference in their lease.  On an application to
interpret the lease, Maloney J. refused to award interest,
finding no equitable basis to do so because the new rent was not
due until it was determined by the arbitrator.  He wrote: 14
          </pre>
    <pre>               It seems to me that a common sense
          interpretation of the applicable clauses of
          the lease would indicate that the amount due
          by reason of the increased rate of rental set
          by the arbitrator, not being known or even
          ascertained until the arbitration process had
          been completed, could not be said to be due
          until the amount was known.  I am not
          inclined to award interest on an amount which
          was not due and thus no question of any
          equitable principle arises.  I conclude,
          therefore, that the respondent landlord is
          not entitled to payment of the interest
          contended for.</pre>
    <pre>[37] An appeal from his decision was dismissed by this court
(Jessup, Thorson and Weatherston JJ.A.) without written reasons.15
[38] Sapra was followed by the Divisional Court in Re Revenue
Properties, which expressly approved the reasoning of Maloney J.
Admittedly, in Boots Drug Stores (Canada) Ltd. v. Ritt, Callaghan
J. confirmed an arbitrator&#146;s award of interest on increased rent
determined on a rent review arbitration.16  But in Boots, the
arbitrator&#146;s jurisdiction to award interest was conceded.
[39] In my opinion, Sapra was correctly decided.  The principle
underlying Sapra is that interest is awarded from the date a
cause of action accrues, and in a rent review, the cause of
action does not accrue until the arbitrator sets the new rent.17
In other words, where parties provide in a rent review clause in
a lease that the new rent is to be set by arbitration, the new
rent is due only when it is declared by the arbitrator.  Once
declared, the new rent is effective from the beginning of the
lease term but it is not payable until after the arbitrator&#146;s
decision.  Until then, the landlord cannot sue for rent arrears.
Equally, the tenant cannot be in default in paying the new rent
until it is fixed by the arbitrators.  Here, the City had no
cause of action for rent arrears in 1970, 1980, 1989 or at any
time before the arbitration decision in April 1996.  And TTR had
no obligation to pay the new rent until April 1996.
[40] In Sapra itself, the landlord could assert no equitable
basis for interest other than the delay in fixing the new rent.
No other evidence was led to suggest unfairness in refusing to
award interest.  The delay resulted from the contractual
machinery the parties had established to fix rent, and could have
been avoided had the landlord invoked arbitration sooner.  Thus,
there was no unfairness to be remedied and no basis in equity to
award interest.  This case is similar.  No evidence was led and
no finding was made of any unfair conduct by TTR to justify an
award of interest.
[41] Although this court has departed from its previous decisions
in appropriate circumstances &#150; for example, when a previous
decision no longer accords with current commercial practice &#150; I
see no need, commercial or otherwise, to overrule Sapra.  The
principle underlying Sapra is sound and has been followed in many
other jurisdictions.18  As TTR points out, overruling Sapra would
have several undesirable consequences.  It would collapse the
distinction between a declaration and an order to pay money.  It
would mean departing from the accepted understanding of when a
cause of action occurs.  It would put Ontario out of step with
other jurisdictions without good reason.  And, it would undermine
freedom of contract by not requiring landlords who want interest
to bargain for it in their leases.  I would reject the City&#146;s
argument to overrule Sapra.
[42] The City next argues that interest should be awarded as
compensation for a debt improperly withheld since 1968, though
the amount of the debt was not known until 1996.  That the amount
of the debt is unknown does not stop interest from running
provided a cause of action has arisen and it can thus be said the
debt has been improperly withheld.  An example of this principle
is the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Prince Albert
Pulp v. Foundation Company of Canada,19 a case relied on by the
City.  In that case, the Supreme Court of Canada allowed
prejudgment interest on the balance owing on a construction
contract, from the date the final certificate of completion was
issued, even though the amount owing was unknown when the
certificate was issued.  The Court held that the balance became
due when the contractor issued the certificate and thus a debt,
albeit unascertained at the time, had been improperly withheld.
[43] The case before us differs from Prince Albert because here
the rent did not become due until declared by the arbitrators.
Therefore, the City could not claim for a debt improperly
withheld before April 1996.  This result is consistent with how
the parties treated the payment of rent in the 1947 Lease.  That
lease, as I have said, was not signed until October 1949, 20
months into the 21-year term.  The parties agreed that the rent
payable during the term of the lease would be $55,000 payable in
two equal semi-annual payments and that the new rent would have
retrospective effect for the first 20 months.  Most important,
the 1947 Lease provided that &#147;the first of such payments [were]
to become due and be made on the twenty-third day of February
1950 (all previous payments of rent to be adjusted between the
Lessor and the Lessee).&#148;  Thus the parties themselves did not
view the new rent as being due until they agreed on the amount.
The City may not now claim that the new rent for the 1968 Lease
became due before the decision of the arbitrators.  I therefore
find no merit in this second argument of the City.
[44] The City&#146;s last argument in support of an equitable
jurisdiction to award interest rests on the proposition that TTR
should pay interest for its use and occupation of Union Station,
and relies on the judgment of the Privy Council in International
Railway Company v. Niagara Parks Commission. 20  In that case, the
Niagara Parks Commission took possession of a railway under a
contract but did not pay for the railway until several years
later when the price was determined by an arbitration board.  The
contract &#150; for what amounted to a compulsory purchase &#150; provided
that the International Railway Company, whose property was taken,
&#147;should be duly compensated&#148;, that the property &#147;shall become the
property of the Commissioners, subject to the payment of
compensation&#148;, and that &#147;such compensation&#148; is &#147;to be fixed by
mutual agreement, or in the case of difference, by arbitration&#148;.
[45] The Privy Council held that interest was payable on the
amount found due by the arbitrators from the date the Parks
Commission took possession until the date of payment.  In
ordering interest, the Privy Council invoked an equitable
principle developed in vendor and purchaser and expropriation
cases: 21
          </pre>
    <pre>               The equitable rule was established many
          years before the decision in Birch v. Joy [3
          H.L. Cas. 365], which was decided in 1852.
          The true rule is that if in cases where
          courts of equity would grant specific
          performance the purchaser obtains possession
          of the subject-matter of the contract before
          the payment of the purchase price, he must,
          in the absence of express agreement to the
          contrary, pay interest on his purchase money
          as from the date when he gets possession
          until the date of payment, because it would
          be inequitable for him to have the benefit of
          possession of the subject-matter of the
          contract and also of the purchase money.</pre>
    <pre>[46] In Sapra, Maloney J. referred to the International Railway
case and wrongly distinguished it.  Maloney J. held that it was
distinguishable because it concerned a &#147;refusal to pay a debt of
a sum certain&#148;, unlike the case before him where the amount &#147;was
not ascertained until the arbitrator had handed down his award&#148;.
That distinction is incorrect.  In the International Railway
case, the price of the railway was not ascertained until the
decision of the arbitrators, but interest was still awarded from
the date of possession.
[47] The International Railway case is, however, properly
distinguishable from the case before us on several other grounds.
First, in the International Railway case the arbitrators were
asked to determine the &#147;compensation&#148; to be paid to the company.
The word &#147;compensation&#148; implicitly gave the arbitrators authority
to award interest, because without interest the company could not
be made whole or properly compensated.22  In the present case, the
arbitrators were asked only to determine the new rent.
[48] Second, the contract between the railway company and the
Parks Commission contemplated that payment would be made on the
date of compulsory purchase when the Commission took possession.
Therefore the Commission was justly indebted to the company from
the date of possession, though the amount of the debt was not
known until set by the arbitrators.  In the case before us, no
just debt was created until the award of the arbitrators.
[49] Third, here unlike the International Railway case, TTR
continued to pay the old rent, as invoiced by the City,
throughout the period from 1968 to the date of the arbitrators&#146;
decision in 1996.
[50] Fourth, the equitable principle invoked by the Privy Council
makes far more sense in the vendor-purchaser or expropriation
contexts than in the context of a lease renewal under a rent
review clause.23  In the vendor-purchaser context, delay in
payment ordinarily is not reasonably foreseeable and thus in
fairness when it occurs, the purchaser should pay interest on the
purchase money from the date of possession.  In the expropriation
context &#150; and the International Railway case itself was a case of
compulsory purchase, akin to an expropriation &#150; the taking is not
consensual and the person whose property is expropriated
ordinarily has no opportunity to insist on interest.  In the
lease renewal context, delay in determining rent is reasonably
foreseeable, and the landlord has an opportunity to insist on
interest or to avoid delay by going quickly to arbitration.
[51] By this discussion, however, I do not intend to say that
interest could never be awarded under a rent review provision
like the one in the 1905 Agreement.  Unfortunately, I think that
the decision in Sapra has been taken to preclude an award of
interest on a delayed rent review unless the parties provide for
interest in their lease.  However, I read Sapra more narrowly: on
its facts, no case was made out for an award of interest in
equity.  In principle, I see no reason why the equitable
jurisdiction of a court to award interest should be restricted to
vendor-purchaser or expropriation cases.  But it is an equitable
jurisdiction and before exercising it, the court must be
satisfied after considering the conduct of the parties and the
surrounding facts, that imposing an obligation to pay interest is
equitable.24  The court must consider the economic advantage to
the tenant and any unfairness to the landlord from a delayed rent
determination and assess whether, in equity, interest should be
awarded.
[52] In the present case, nothing in the surrounding facts or in
the conduct of the parties or in the findings of the arbitrators
warrants imposing on TTR an equitable obligation to pay interest.
The arbitrators were not asked to decide the broad question of
the compensation payable by TTR but only the narrow question of
the rent payable.  The arbitrators did not find TTR responsible
for the delay in arbitrating the new rent.25  Moreover, the delay
was reasonably foreseeable.  The City had the benefit of its
experience negotiating the 1947 Lease yet still did not protect
itself against the risk of delay by insisting on a provision for
interest.  Further, the City could have reduced or eliminated its
claim for interest by exercising its contractual right to
arbitrate far sooner than it did.  And no debt was wrongfully
withheld because TTR did not owe the increased rent until the
arbitration award.
[53] The arbitrators expressed &#147;some regret&#148; that they lacked
jurisdiction to award interest.  Their regret implicitly arose
from their concern that TTR was being unjustly enriched by their
decision.  Undoubtedly, the delay in setting the new rent
enriched TTR.  It also resulted in a corresponding deprivation to
the City.  But there was a simple &#147;juristic reason&#148; for the
enrichment: the arbitration clause in the lease.
[54] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
