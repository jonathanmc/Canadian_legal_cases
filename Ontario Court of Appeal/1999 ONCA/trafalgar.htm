    <pre>On appeal from the orders of Mr. Justice Bernard J. Manton dated
June 11, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]        This is an appeal from the order of Manton J.  setting
aside  service ex juris of the statement of claim and  dismissing
the action and cross-claim against Her Majesty the Queen in Right
of   Québec  and  The  Commission  Hydro-Électrique  du   Québec,
collectively referred to as &quot;Québec&quot;.
[2]   On  January  2,  1943, Her Majesty the Queen  in  Right  of
Ontario  (&quot;Ontario&quot;),  the  Hydro-Electric  Power  Commission  of
Ontario  and Québec entered into an agreement in connection  with
the  development of hydro electric power resources of the  Ottawa
River.  Under  the  agreement, any disputes between  Ontario  and
Québec  are  to be submitted to arbitration. The same  year,  the
Legislatures  of  Ontario  and  Québec  passed  reciprocal   acts
adopting and ratifying the terms of the agreement.
[3]  In 1964, Ontario purchased property along the shoreline of
the Ottawa River pursuant to its obligations under the agreement.
Subsequently, a portion of the shoreline property was declared
surplus in connection with the power project. Ontario agreed to
enter into a long-term lease of the property to the plaintiffs,
collectively referred to as &quot;Trafalgar Pointe&quot; but no lease was
ever entered into. Trafalgar Pointe sued Ontario for damages that
allegedly resulted from Ontario&#146;s failure to complete the lease
agreement.
[4]  Despite the arbitration clause, Ontario brought a motion to
add Québec as a necessary party defendant to the action and the
motion was granted.  In its affidavit in support of the motion,
Ontario&#146;s solicitor swore that Ontario would be in a position to
deliver its statement of defence and cross-claim to the action
within twenty days of Québec being added as a party.  Ontario
issued a defence and cross-claim but it has never been served.
Trafalgar Pointe amended and served its statement of claim on
Québec.
[5]  Québec brought a motion to set aside service ex juris on it
of Traflagar Pointe&#146;s amended statement of claim, to dismiss the
action against it, and to dismiss Ontario&#146;s cross-claim. The
motion proceeded on the assumption that Ontario would proceed
with its cross-claim.  Manton J. granted the motion on the basis
that Québec had sovereign immunity and could not be sued in any
Court unless expressly provided by statute. He further concluded
that because the issues raised between the defendants were to be
submitted to arbitration, this was the appropriate forum in which
to raise any dispute between the provinces. Trafalgar Pointe did
not appeal. Ontario has.
[6]  Ontario concedes that any disputes between it and Québec are
to be resolved by arbitration.  Consequently, Ontario has no
basis on which to appeal the dismissal of its cross-claim against
Québec. Ontario&#146;s position is, however, that it is entitled to
appeal the portion of Manton J.&#146;s order dismissing the entire
action against Québec.  Consequently, Ontario submits that it is
necessary for us to decide whether Québec is acting in a public
capacity and, if not, whether Québec can assert sovereign
immunity with respect to a commercial transaction.
[7]  We do not agree that this should be the result. The sole
purpose advanced by Ontario for making Québec a party defendant
was so that Ontario could serve a cross-claim against it.  It is
now conceded that Ontario&#146;s cross-claim against Québec was
inappropriate. The language of the 1943 agreement is mandatory
and the courts should respect that agreement. Trafalgar Pointe
did not choose to sue Québec initially; it did not appeal the
dismissal of its action against Québec and it took no part in
this appeal. Ontario should not be able to use an inappropriate
procedural step taken by it to force the court to decide an
important substantive issue that is of no interest to Trafalgar
Pointe.
[8]  In the result, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
