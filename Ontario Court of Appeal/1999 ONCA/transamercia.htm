    <pre>OSBORNE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In November 1994, the plaintiffs sued the respondent, The
Toronto Dominion Bank (&#147;TD&#148;) for knowing assistance in a breach
of trust and for negligent misrepresentation. After pleadings
were exchanged and examinations for discovery were held, TD moved
under Rule 20 for summary judgment dismissing the plaintiffs&#146;
action. After four days of argument, on March 27, 1998, the
Honourable Mr. Justice Sharpe concluded that there were no
genuine issues for trial. Accordingly, he dismissed the
plaintiffs&#146; action with costs. The plaintiffs appeal from that
judgment.1
[2]  The appellants submit that the motions judge, in determining
that there was no genuine issue for trial, erred by weighing
evidence, drawing inferences from evidence, selecting competing
inferences arising from the evidence and making findings of
credibility. They contend that they were given a &#147;paper trial.&#148;
[3]  TD submits that the motions judge did no more than take a
hard look at the evidence before he correctly concluded that
there was nothing in it giving rise to a genuine issue for trial.
[4]  TD has cross-appealed from the motion judge&#146;s order that the
appellants&#146; obligation to  pay costs be limited to party and
party costs. It contends that in light of its offer to settle it
is entitled to party and party costs to April 5, 1998, the date
of the  settlement offer, and solicitor and client costs after
that date.</pre>
    <pre>THE EVIDENCE</pre>
    <pre>[5]  I intend to refer to the extensive evidentiary record only
to the extent that I think is required to place the issues in
some reasonable context. For convenience, I will refer to
Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company as &#147;Transamerica&#148;,
to Symons General Insurance Company as &#147;Symons&#148; and to
Transamerica and Symons collectively as the &#147;Insurers&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>(i)  The Parties</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Transamerica is an American insurer which carries on
business in Ontario. It underwrites a wide range of insurance
risks. The insurance product involved in this action is accident,
health and life credit insurance. This insurance provides
protection to those who purchase motor vehicles on credit in the
event of their disability or death.
[7]  Symons is also an American insurer which carried on business
in Ontario. The plaintiff Granite Insurance Company is a
successor to Symons. Symons, at times that I will set out later,
provided accident and health credit insurance to purchasers of
motor vehicles, much in the same way as Transamerica did.2
[8]  Guardall Administrative Services (&#147;GAS&#148;) was part of a group
of companies known as the Guardall Group. GAS was in the business
of marketing, selling and administering life, health and accident
credit insurance policies issued by the Insurers to purchasers of
automobiles. GAS had established a network of automobile dealers
throughout Canada and was thus able to provide business to the
Insurers, since credit insurance was arranged through dealers at
the time of purchase. Seymour Ravinsky (&#147;Ravinsky&#148;) was the
chairman of the board of &#147;the Guardall Group&#148; and GAS.</pre>
    <pre>(ii)  The Agreements Between GAS and the Insurers</pre>
    <pre>[9]  On June 1, 1987, Transamerica and GAS entered into an
agreement titled, Credit Insurance Marketing Consultant Agreement
(&#147;CIMC&#148;). Under this agreement GAS was appointed to act on behalf
of Transamerica in the selling and servicing of Transamerica
credit insurance policies in Canada. The CIMC agreement referred
to GAS as Transamerica&#146;s &#147;insurance marketing consultant.&#148;  Under
the CIMC agreement, GAS was specifically authorized to carry out
certain duties:
          </pre>
    <pre>(a)       solicit and promote Transamerica&#146;s credit insurance products;
(b)       negotiate and sell Transamerica&#146;s credit insurance products;
(c)       prepare and print individual Transamerica insurance certificates;
(d)       collect insurance premiums from automobile dealers from the
	  sale of Transamerica insurance policies;
(e)       remit net premiums to Transamerica;
(f)       transmit Transamerica insurance policies to Transamerica;
(g)       prepare reports on all Transamerica policies including
	  the name, amount, and premium paid;
(h)       administer and service the Transamerica credit
	  insurance policies including investigation and payment of 
	  claims pursuant to the Transamerica policies;
(i)       generally represent Transamerica&#146;s interests in the
	  credit insurance business in Canada;
(j)       receive applications for insurance from automobile
	  dealers; and
(k)       prepare and issue the actual insurance policies to the
	  individual insureds.</pre>
    <pre>[10] By the spring of 1988, credit insurance underwritten by
Transamerica was generating about $2 million in premium revenue
each month. All of these premiums were remitted by the dealers to
GAS. Because of the volume of business and other factors, some
lag time was required between remittance of the premiums to GAS
and their transfer to Transamerica. Accordingly, the CIMC
agreement provided that GAS had 90 days to verify the accuracy of
information provided by dealers, enter the information into its
data system, prepare reports and remit premiums to Transamerica.
The dealer&#146;s commission was 34% and GAS&#146;s commission was 16%.
Thus, in the end, Transamerica received 50% of each premium
dollar.
[11] Under the CIMC agreement, the premiums that GAS remitted to
Transamerica were net of GAS&#146;s  commission. In addition, GAS
deducted claims that it paid to financial institutions and
premium refunds paid to insureds as a consequence of early
cancellation or termination of policies. All of this was
specifically authorized by the CIMC agreement.
[12] The CIMC agreement authorized GAS to nominate agents in
Canada since GAS was not a licensed agent in Ontario. GAS
nominated Paul Michael Lane Insurance Agencies Limited (&#147;Lane&#148;)
to be the licensed agent of record for Transamerica. Consistent
with the CIMC agreement, Transamerica confirmed the appointment
of Lane as its licensed agent. Although Lane was in the picture
as Transamerica&#146;s licensed agent, and received a 1% commission
for its troubles, it is difficult to determine from the record
what Lane did. GAS, not Lane, carried out the day-to-day duties
involved in the promotion, sale and administration of
Transamerica credit insurance, apparently without Lane&#146;s
assistance. It also collected premiums from automobile dealers
and remitted the premiums to Transamerica. Lane had no
involvement in that part of GAS&#146;s business.
[13] On November 1, 1988, Symons and GAS entered into an
agreement to sell and service insurance. On November 11, 1998,
Transamerica terminated its arrangements with GAS. Although
dealings between GAS and Symons were structured in a manner
somewhat different from the GAS-Transamerica CIMC arrangement,
GAS&#146;s duties on Symons&#146; behalf were generally similar to those it
undertook for Transamerica.
[14] The relationship between GAS and Symons was defined in a
Master Insurance Policy which described GAS as the
&#147;policyholder&#148;. As with Transamerica, GAS facilitated the sale of
accident and health credit insurance for Symons through GAS&#146;s
network of automobile dealers. The consumer paid the premium to
the dealer who took a percentage and then remitted the balance to
GAS. The master policy obligated GAS to remit to Symons the gross
premium less claims paid, premiums returned and GAS&#146;s commission.
The premiums remitted to Symons had to be remitted within 60 days
after the premiums were received from the dealer. Lane was also
the designated agent of record for Symons&#146; business.
[15] Neither the Transamerica CIMC agreement nor the Symons
policy required GAS to deposit premiums in a separate account.
Nor did either agreement provide that the premiums in GAS&#146;s hands
were trust funds.</pre>
    <pre>(iii)  The Banking Arrangements</pre>
    <pre>[16] TD provided banking services for GAS and other companies in
the Guardall Group at its Rexdale and Kipling Branch in Toronto.
Dealers who sold credit insurance to purchasers of automobiles
forwarded the premiums to GAS which deposited them in its TD
account.
[17] In 1986, GAS (then operating under another name) and TD
agreed to new banking arrangements. The new arrangement was
referred to as a &#147;Mirror Accounting System.&#148;  As described in the
affidavit of James C. McCarthy, a TD employee, the Mirror
Accounting System involved a number of Guardall Group companies,
including GAS&#146;s predecessor company. The Guardall companies
agreed with TD to participate in a &#147;cash management banking
system&#148;. As TD&#146;s witness put it, &#147;the business purpose of the
Guardall Mirror Accounting System was to enable the Guardall
participating companies to pool their funds in an
administratively convenient manner.&#148;  It also gave TD a direct
and uncomplicated degree of control over lines of credit extended
to the participating Guardall companies.
[18] The 1986 agreement required each Guardall company to
establish a &#147;Designated Account&#148; and a separate account referred
to in the agreement as an &#147;offset&#148; account (the &#147;Mirror
Account&#148;). At the end of each business day, the debit or credit
positions in the participating companies&#146; designated accounts
were matched by an equal and opposite entry in that company&#146;s
Mirror account.
[19] The Mirror Accounting arrangements also required the
participating Guardall companies to open one collective account -
- the &#147;Concentration Account&#148;. This account was intended to be
the vehicle for pooling the moneys deposited or withdrawn by all
of the participating Guardall companies through their designated
accounts.
[20] The result of these banking changes was that at the end of
each banking day credit or debit balances in each participating
company&#146;s designated account were transferred to the Guardall
Concentration Account. The balance in the Concentration Account
at any given time was dependent on transactions in the designated
accounts of all of the participating Guardall Group companies.
Although premiums were initially deposited in GAS&#146;s designated
account, the Mirror Accounting System resulted in the premiums
being mingled with other funds in the Guardall Group&#146;s
concentration account and used for the general business purposes
of the participating Guardall companies. TD had access to the
concentration account to transfer funds to satisfy loans of all
of the participating Guardall companies.
[21] Each participating Guardall company received statements for
its designated and mirror accounts and the Guardall Group&#146;s
concentration account. The designated account bank statements did
not reflect the corresponding deposit or withdrawal in the mirror
account or the pooling of funds in the concentration account.</pre>
    <pre>(iv)  Transamerica&#146;s Audit, GAS&#146;s Bankruptcy and Ravinsky&#146;s
Criminal Charges</pre>
    <pre>[22] When William Hansen, a Transamerica employee, undertook an
audit of GAS in May 1988, he reviewed GAS&#146;s designated account
statement. He was never told about the existence of the Mirror
Accounting arrangements with TD. Thus, Transamerica&#146;s audit did
not reveal that premiums paid by motor vehicle purchasers and
remitted by dealers to GAS did not remain in a GAS account
established for that purpose.
[23] Hansen stated in his affidavit that he wanted to examine
GAS&#146;s bank statements for two reasons. First, he wanted to
confirm that GAS was depositing premiums it received in &#147;the GAS
insurance premium account at the Toronto Dominion Bank.&#148;  Second,
he wanted to confirm that the premiums &#147;were still in the
account.&#148;  At Hansen&#146;s request, GAS provided bank statements for
his audit. The bank statement that Hansen reviewed was GAS&#146;s
designated account statement as at April 19, 1988. Hansen said
that the bank statement that he reviewed &#147;... indicated that
there was in excess of $9.5 million in the GAS insurance premium
account.&#148;  According to Hansen, at that time GAS owed
Transamerica about $5 million in unremitted premiums. Hansen&#146;s
audit revealed that GAS had not withdrawn its commissions from
the account. It is Transamerica&#146;s position that if Hansen&#146;s May
1988 audit had revealed what Transamerica learned a few months
later, that is that premiums were not deposited in a separate GAS
premium account, Transamerica would have terminated its agreement
with GAS immediately.
[24] By 1989, the Guardall companies, including GAS, were
bankrupt. In the bankruptcy, the Insurers took the position that
premiums were trust funds.  The trustee, Thorne Ernst &amp; Whinney,
proceeded on the basis that premiums held by GAS were trust
funds. In the end, premiums that the trustee collected were split
between the Insurers. No premiums were paid to the general
creditors. The Insurers rely on this evidence in support of their
basic position that all premiums received by GAS were impressed
with a trust.
[25] On May 2, 1991, Ravinsky was charged with 6 counts of fraud
and 3 counts of theft. He was committed for trial on all counts.
On April 15, 1993, after some plea bargaining, he pled guilty to
2 counts of fraud, one of them alleged that he:
          </pre>
    <pre>           [B]y deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent means defrauded
     Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Company of money, property
     or valuable security of a value exceeding $1,000 by receiving
     premium money as an agent for Transamerica Occidental Life
     Insurance Company and failing to remit that premium money and
     using that money for his own purposes. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[26] The Insurers submit the respondent&#146;s guilty plea constitutes
evidence that Ravinsky  (that is GAS) held the premiums as the
Insurers&#146; agent.</pre>
    <pre>(v)  The Insurers&#146; Loss and their Claim</pre>
    <pre>[27] As I have said, GAS mingled the Insurers&#146; premiums with
other funds in the Guardall Concentration Account and used the
premiums in its general business operations. As a result of the
concentration account aspect of the Mirror Accounting System, the
Guardall Group (including GAS), used the Insurers&#146; premiums to
pay its creditors, including TD. In addition, Ravinsky, who
effectively controlled GAS and the Guardall Group, used the
premiums deposited by GAS for his personal purposes.
[28] The Insurers&#146; claim against TD for knowing assistance in a
breach of trust requires that they establish a trust, that is
that GAS held the premiums at relevant times in trust for
Transamerica, and later Symons. Thus, evidence from both sides
centered on the threshold issue of the relationship between GAS
and the Insurers. The Insurers also claimed damages for what they
contended were TD&#146;s negligent misrepresentations.3  This is a
discrete claim with which I will deal separately.</pre>
    <pre>[29] In general terms, the Insurers&#146; position is that GAS was the
Insurers&#146; agent and that consistent with insurance industry
practice it held premiums remitted to it in trust for
Transamerica or Symons.  Transamerica&#146;s main evidence on its
agency-trust position came from George Henning, its former vice-
president. He stated in his affidavit, and cross-examination on
it, that GAS was Transamerica&#146;s &#147;general agent.&#148;  He acknowledged
that the words &#147;general agent&#148; did not appear in the CIMC
agreement, however, he explained, &#147;... but the agreement is the
type of agreement that you would expect to see for a general
agent.&#148;   Henning also stated that Transamerica always assumed
that the premiums that GAS received would be kept in a separate
account. He accepted that the CIMC agreement said nothing about
GAS&#146;s obligation to deposit premiums in a separate account. On
that subject, he said,
          </pre>
    <pre>          I believe that it&#146;s maybe not specifically applied to, but I
      think the whole way in which the agreement is drafted makes it
      very clear that there&#146;s a very specific responsibility there, and
      this was certainly understood by all parties. ... But it was
      certainly understood that all premiums went into a separate
      account, and we were reassured by Guardall in confirmations that
      I had with Seymour [Ravinsky] and Jeff Dickson [President of
      Guardall U.S.A.] that this was the case.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[30] Henning further noted that when Transamerica&#146;s audit was
undertaken in May 1988, there was nothing to suggest that
premiums were not being deposited in a separate account.
[31] Transamerica&#146;s agency-trust position was generally confirmed
by the evidence of Jeffrey Dickson, President of Guardall U.S.A.
He stated in a disposition that, &#147;all funds were supposed to be
deposited in a premium trust account.&#148;  He acknowledged that he
did not know if that happened. Dickson&#146;s evidence is consistent
with Transamerica&#146;s position that the premiums were to be
deposited in a separate premium account and that the premiums
were trust funds.
[32] As I have said, the Insurers submitted that Ravinsky&#146;s
guilty plea and the position that Transamerica took in the GAS
bankruptcy constituted evidence that supported their trust
position. They also relied on other evidence to which I will
refer shortly.
[33] Like Transamerica,  Symons assumed that GAS held its
premiums in trust. It too was of the view that it was an axiom in
the insurance industry that premiums held by a third party are
held in trust for the insurer. Symons&#146; principal evidence came
from Bruce Dwyer, a chartered account who joined Symons in March
1991. In his cross-examination, he referred to GAS as Symons&#146;
administrator. He agreed that in the 60-day remittance period,
there was nothing in the agreement that restricted GAS&#146;s use of
premiums that it held. Symons position is that GAS&#146;s authority to
deal with premiums was limited to the authority that GAS
specifically set out in the agreement (the policy). Transamerica
shares that position. The Insurers contend that neither agreement
authorized GAS to use the premiums for its general business
purposes.
[34] Symons also relied on a 19854 memorandum that it sent to all
relevant automobile dealers to instruct them on appropriate
procedures relevant to accident and health credit insurance. The
memorandum stated, in part, that the predecessor company of GAS
was &#147;... the Administrator of the program and are holding
premiums in trust for the insurance company ...&#148;  There was no
evidence that Ravinsky, or anyone at GAS, took issue with this
memorandum. Indeed, Ravinsky seems to have agreed with the
memorandum. He noted &#147;ok&#148; on it, and initialled it.
[35] Symons also led evidence that on March 22, 1989, it informed
the automobile dealers that its relationship with GAS had been
terminated and that the premiums paid to GAS were deemed to be
held in trust.</pre>
    <pre>(vi)  TD&#146;s Defence</pre>
    <pre>[36] TD submits that there was no evidence that GAS and the
Insurers formed an intention to create a trust in respect of
premiums that were remitted to GAS by dealers. There were two
main prongs in TD&#146;s position. First, TD relies on the CIMC
agreement and the Symons&#146; policy, neither of which explicitly
required GAS to establish a separate account for the premiums or
refer to the premiums in GAS&#146;s hand as trust funds. TD further
emphasizes that neither agreement restricts GAS&#146;s use of premiums
in the remittance periods. TD also contends that the fact that
GAS was entitled to keep interest earned on the premiums in the
remittance periods supports its &#145;no trust&#146; position.5
[37] Second, as part of its evidence on the summary judgment
motion, TD filed parts of transcripts and depositions for an
Ontario action in which Transamerica was the defendant and a
California action in which it was the plaintiff. TD contends that
Transamerica&#146;s evidence, and the positions it took, and did not
take, in those actions are inconsistent with its contention that
GAS and Transamerica formed an intention that the premiums GAS
held were trust funds.
[38] GAS and other Guardall companies commenced the Ontario
action to which I have referred in October 1988, after
Transamerica terminated the CIMC agreement.  The Guardall
companies alleged that Transamerica failed to provide funds
required by reinsurance agreements.6  In that action,
Transamerica moved for an order requiring GAS to pay the premiums
which Transamerica contended were owing into a third party trust
account. On the motion, Transamerica contended that the premiums
in question were subject to a constructive trust. It did not lead
evidence, or contend, that the premiums were subject to an actual
trust. Thus, according to TD, Transamerica&#146;s failure in the
Ontario action to assert the existence of an actual trust  was
persuasive evidence that there was no actual trust relationship
between GAS and Transamerica. In addition, in the Ontario action,
GAS&#146;s president Mandell and its chairman Ravinsky, swore that the
premiums GAS held were not subject to a trust. TD submits that
Transamerica&#146;s failure to refute this evidence is significant.
[39] The 1991 California litigation was between Transamerica and
its fidelity insurer. In it Transamerica sought to recover some
of its GAS-related losses. In that action, Transamerica
acknowledged that there were no restrictions in the CIMC
agreement on how GAS could use the premiums in the 90-day
remittance period. TD submitted that Transamerica&#146;s evidence in
the California action and the positions it asserted in that
action were inconsistent with the premiums being trust funds.
[40] Transamerica&#146;s response is that the issue in the Ontario
action was whether GAS owed any premiums to Transamerica, not
whether the premiums were trust funds. In addition, Transamerica
contends that it asserted in the Ontario action that GAS was its
agent and that the agency relationship was fiduciary in
character. With respect to the California action, Transamerica
contends that its former vice-president, Henning, did no more
than acknowledge that it would have been impractical to place the
premiums in a trust account in the remittance period.</pre>
    <pre>THE MOTIONS JUDGE&#146;S REASONS</pre>
    <pre>[41] In his reasons, the motions judge held that the intention to
create a trust must be clear. He found no provision in the CIMC
agreement or the Symons policy that explicitly stated the
premiums would be held in trust for the Insurers. He noted in
particular that the CIMC agreement and the Symons policy imposed
no restrictions on GAS&#146;s use of premiums in the 90 and 60 day
remittance periods. He concluded that there was nothing in either
agreement from which an intention to create a trust might be
inferred.
[42] The motions judge found that it was difficult to reconcile
the &#147;unambiguous&#148; agreements with the evidence given on behalf of
Transamerica in the California action. He found that the evidence
in this action clearly pointed to the conclusion that
Transamerica knew there were no restrictions on GAS&#146;s use of
premiums in the remittance period. He viewed this evidence to be
inconsistent with the express trust position advanced by
Transamerica in this action. He also concluded that
Transamerica&#146;s position in the 1988 Ontario action supported TD&#146;s
submission that there was no intention to establish a trust.
[43] Although the motions judge stated in one part of his reasons
that the agreements between GAS and the Insurers were
&#147;unambiguous&#148;, he nonetheless looked outside the two agreements
to evidence of surrounding circumstances to determine what the
intention of the parties was.
[44] The motion judge also concluded that Ravinsky&#146;s guilty plea
provided &#147;slender support&#148; for the Insurers&#146; trust position since
Ravinsky could have pled guilty for a number of reasons and his
guilt could be established in the circumstances, in the absence
of a trust:  See R. v. Zlatic, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 29. The motions
judge almost seems to draw an adverse inference from the fact
that the Insurers relied on the guilty plea as evidence. He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>           In my view, in light of all the circumstances of the case,
      the guilty plea provides slender support for the existence of a
      trust. Indeed, it is telling that in the context of a commercial
      relationship between sophisticated parties, the plaintiff is
      driven to place such heavy reliance on evidence of this kind and
      is unable to supply any evidence of any discussion or agreement
      between its officers and Ravinsky or anyone else at GAS regarding
      the alleged trust arrangement it now asserts.</pre>
    <pre>[45] The motions judge found that the Insurers&#146; witnesses were
not experts on industry practice in Ontario and that, in any
case, industry practice was not a &#147;substitute&#148; for intention. He
concluded that the affidavit evidence of Henning and Dwyer, that
it was axiomatic in the insurance industry that premiums held by
a third party are trust funds, was self-serving and that it did
not raise a genuine issue for trial.
[46] He did not answer the question whether GAS was the Insurers&#146;
agent. He concluded that even if there was a genuine issue for
trial on this issue, it did not necessarily follow that if GAS
was the Insurer&#146;s agent, it held the premium funds in trust for
the Insurers. In dealing with the agency issue, the motions judge
put it in this way:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Accordingly, it is difficult to see how GAS can be said to
      have acted as Transamerica&#146;s agent. Moreover, even if there was
      an agency relationship, it does not follow that there was a trust
      with respect to the premiums. It is still necessary to look to
      the intention of the parties, as reflected by their agreement and
      conduct, to determine whether there was a trust.</pre>
    <pre>[47] The motions judge gave no weight to the evidence that
Dickson, Guardall&#146;s U.S. president, acknowledged that the
premiums were supposed to be deposited in a separate premium
trust account. When he dealt with this evidence he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Dickson, however, was neither an officer or employee of GAS.
      Dickson's statement was also not based on direct knowledge but
      what he gathered from conversations with others. He never saw any
      bank statements, cheques or anything else dealing with money
      going in or out of any of the Guardall Group of Companies&#146;
      accounts and admitted that he did not know whether or not such a
      premium account actually existed. This evidence is hearsay upon
      hearsay.

    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[48] The relevant parts of Rule 20 are:
          </pre>
    <pre>           20.01 (3)  A defendant may, after delivering a statement of
      defence, move with supporting affidavit material or other
      evidence for summary judgment dismissing all or part of the claim
      in the statement of claim.
          </pre>
    <pre>               20.02  An affidavit for use on a motion
          for summary judgment may be made on
          information and belief as provided in subrule
          39.01(4), but on the hearing of the motion an
          adverse inference may be drawn, if
          appropriate, from the failure of a party to
          provide the evidence of persons having
          personal knowledge of contested facts.
          </pre>
    <pre>               20.04 (1)  In response to affidavit
          material or other evidence supporting a
          motion for summary judgment, a responding
          party may not rest on the mere allegations or
          denials of the party&#146;s pleadings, but must
          set out, in affidavit material or other
          evidence, specific facts showing that there
          is a genuine issue for trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (2)  Where the court is satisfied
          that there is no genuine issue for trial with
          respect to a claim or defence, the court
          shall grant summary judgment accordingly.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (3)  Where the court is satisfied
          that the only genuine issue is the amount to
          which the moving party is entitled, the court
          may order a trial of that issue or grant
          judgment with a reference to determine the
          amount.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    (4)  Where the court is satisfied
          that the only genuine issue is a question of
          law, the court may determine the question and
          grant judgment accordingly, but where the
          motion is made to a master, it shall be
          adjourned to be heard by judge.</pre>
    <pre>[49] The purpose of Rule 20 and the limitations on its scope are
now well-established. See Irving Ungerman Ltd. v. Galanis (1991),
4 O.R. (3d) 545 (C.A.). On all summary judgment motions, the core
question is: has the moving party established that there is no
genuine issue for trial. Rule 20.04(1) makes it clear that the
party responding to a summary judgment motion, in this case the
Insurers, may not rest on the pleadings, but must provide
evidence from which the motions judge can conclude that there is
a genuine issue for trial. See 11061590 Ontario Ltd. v. Ontario
Jockey Club (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 547 (C.A.).
[50] A motions judge, on a Rule 20 summary judgment motion,
should not resolve issues of credibility, draw inferences from
conflicting evidence, or from evidence that is not in conflict
when more than one inference is reasonably available. As Borins
J. (ad hoc) for this court, succinctly put it in Aguonie v.
Gallion Solid Waste Material (Ontario) Inc. (1998), 38 O.R. (3d)
161 (C.A.), at p. 173:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Evaluating credibility, weighing evidence, and drawing
          factual inferences are all functions reserved for the trier of
          fact.</pre>
    <pre>[51] Borins J.&#146;s observations in Aguonie serve to reinforce
Morden A.C.J.O.&#146;s statements in Ungerman which makes it clear
that the mere existence of an issue of credibility will not
defeat a motion for summary judgment. The issue of credibility
must be a genuine issue. Morden A.C.J.O. said in Ungerman at pp.
551-52:
          </pre>
    <pre>         It is safe to say that &#145;genuine&#146; means not spurious and,
     more specifically, that the words for trial assist in showing the
     meaning of the term. If the evidence on a motion for summary
     judgment satisfies the court that there is no genuine issue of
     fact which requires a trial for its resolution, the requirements
     of the rule have been met. It must be clear that a trial is
     unnecessary. The burden is on the moving party to satisfy the
     court that the requirements of the rule have been met. Further,
     it is important to keep in mind that the court&#146;s function is not
     to resolve an issue of fact but to determine whether a genuine
     issue of fact exists.
          </pre>
    <pre>               ...
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is a sensible general proposition
          that, if there is an issue of credibility, a
          trial is required and summary judgment should
          not be granted. ...the proposition that an
          issue of credibility precludes the granting
          of summary judgment applies only when what is
          said to be an issue of credibility is a
          genuine issue of credibility.</pre>

</pre>
    <pre>[52] The principal issue before the motions judge was whether by
law, equity or statute, the premiums held by GAS represented
trust funds. In dealing with one part of the trust issue &#150; the
existence of a common law (express) trust, only one of the three
required trust &#147;certainties&#148;,  the certainty of intention to
create a trust, was in issue. I think that the motions judge was
correct in looking at evidence of the relationship between GAS
and the Insurers that clearly fell outside the four corners of
the Transamerica CIMC agreement and the Symons Master Policy. The
CIMC agreement provided that Transamerica could prescribe new
&#147;rules and regulations&#148; with respect to the business GAS carried
on for Transamerica. Manifestly, the relationship between GAS and
Transamerica was not totally controlled by the CIMC agreement.7
[53] In a threshold submission, the Insurers contend that the
motions judge erred by not drawing an adverse inference from TD&#146;s
failure to provide evidence from witnesses with first hand
knowledge of the facts. There is no doubt that much of TD&#146;s
evidence was not first hand. However, a significant part of that
evidence consisted of the sworn evidence of representatives of
Transamerica in other litigation. Since much of the impugned
information and belief evidence was the sworn testimony of
Transamerica representatives, I am not prepared to find that the
motions judge was wrong in not drawing the adverse inference that
the Insurers submit he should have drawn.
[54] The evidence to which the Insurers look in support of their
position that the premiums which GAS held were subject to an
actual trust seems to me to fall into three general compartments.
[55] First, the Transamerica-CIMC agreement and the Symons Master
Policy set out GAS&#146;s authority in an itemized way. The
agreements, the Insurers emphasize, do not authorize GAS to use
the premiums for its general business purposes. Thus, consistent
with the theme that GAS&#146;s authority is limited to that which the
agreements specifically authorize, the Insurers submit that GAS
was not entitled to use the premiums for its general business
purposes and that the failure of the agreements to specifically
provide that premiums remitted to GAS by dealers are trust funds
is not determinative.
[56] Second, the Insurers rely on evidence of a general nature
that centred on their intention to create a trust, industry
practice and evidence of a relationship with GAS that would
compel the conclusion that GAS was their agent.
[57] Third, the Insurers rely on evidence of past events and
conduct which includes:
     </pre>
    <pre>         Ravinsky&#146;s guilty plea to committing fraud by taking funds
          that he held as Transamerica&#146;s agent;
     </pre>
    <pre>    In the Guardall bankruptcy, the Insurers took the position
     that premiums were held by GAS in trust. The evidence disclosed
     that the trustee in bankruptcy accepted that position.
    Symons sent a notice to all of its automobile dealers in
     March 1989 in which it advised the dealers that the premiums the
     dealers had remitted were held in trust.
    The previous agreement between Symons and GAS provided that
     the premiums would be held in trust;
    Jeffrey Dickson, the president of Guardall U.S.,
     acknowledged that premiums were supposed to be deposited in a
     trust account.</pre>
    <pre>[58] In his reasons, the motions judge did not refer to Symons&#146;
notice to its dealers which informed them that premiums were held
in trust or to the evidence of the positions taken by
Transamerica and the trustee in the Guardall bankruptcy. He did
refer to all the other aspects of the evidence to which I have
referred above. He considered all of the above listed features of
the evidence separately against the background of the two
agreements and Transamerica&#146;s evidence, and the positions it
took, in the Ontario and California actions.
[59] The Insurers&#146; evidence, given mainly by Henning and Dwyer,
was that they thought, consistent with industry practice, that
the premiums GAS held were trust funds. The motions judge
concluded that their evidence was a mere reiteration of the
Insurers&#146; trust position. As I have said, he further stated that
Henning and Dwyer were not experts on industry practice in
Canada. He concluded that, in any case, industry practice was not
a substitute for intention.
[60] The Insurers carried on business in Canada and the U.S.A.
Both Henning and Dwyer had an extensive insurance background and
were familiar with industry practices. It might have been better
had evidence of industry practice come from some outside source
familiar with the Canadian insurance industry. However, I think
that the motions judge erred in almost completely discounting
this evidence because Henning and Dwyer were not experts on
industry practice in Canada. In my opinion, Henning and Dwyer
were qualified to speak to industry practice and the CIMC
agreement and the Symons&#146; policy manifestly did not deal with all
aspects of the relationship between GAS and Transamerica. I think
that the motions judge erred in setting the evidence of industry
practice (and the evidence that the Insurers intended that the
premiums were to be held in trust) against the Insurers&#146;
agreements with GAS (which, as I have said were silent on the
trust issue) and Transamerica&#146;s stance in the Ontario and
California actions. In  proceeding as he did, the motions judge
weighed evidence which could support different findings of fact.
This is the work of a trial judge.
[61] I think that the Insurers provided some admissible evidence
that, consistent with industry practice, premiums held by an
agent (I use that term generally in respect of GAS) represented
trust funds in the agent&#146;s hands. This might be of some
significance in determining the meaning and scope of the two
agreements and it could explain the absence of any formal trust
references in the agreements. These are matters for the trial
judge.
[62] As already noted, the motions judge concluded that
Ravinsky&#146;s guilty plea provided &#147;slender support&#148; for the
Insurers&#146; position because it was Ravinsky&#146;s, not GAS&#146;s plea and
there could have been plea-bargain related reasons for the plea.
That may be; however, Ravinsky&#146;s guilty plea constitutes his
prima facie admission of what he pleaded to. Like any admission,
his guilty plea is capable of explanation. See English v.
Richmond, [1956] S.C.R. 383; Re Charlton (1969), 1 O.R. 706
(C.A.).
[63] In my opinion, Ravinsky&#146;s guilty plea, if accepted as his
admission that he held the premiums as agent, provides some
support for the Insurers&#146; general submission that it was an axiom
in the insurance industry that premiums held by a third party
represent trust funds. This evidence should be considered with
all of the other evidence material to the actual trust issue. The
weight to be given to this evidence is for the trial judge.
[64] As I have said, there was evidence that, in a previous
relationship, Symons and GAS agreed that GAS held premiums in
trust for Symons. The motions judge concluded that the previous
Symons-GAS agreement, which expressly provided that premiums in
GAS's hands were trust funds, could not assist Symons since the
1988 policy, which defined the current relationship between
Symons and GAS, made no reference to trust funds or the
obligation to deposit premiums GAS received in a separate
account.
[65] The insurance product that was the subject matter of the
earlier Symons-GAS agreement was the same as the accident, health
credit insurance Symons sold after November 1, 1988. This is
evidence that should be considered with all of the evidence and
given appropriate weight by the trial judge who will have the
advantage of seeing and hearing the witnesses and considering all
relevant documentation. Once this evidence is accepted as having
some weight, it is for the trial judge to determine what, if any,
weight to give it. Depending on the response of the trier of
fact, this could be evidence that is material to the intention of
the parties and their reasonable expectations. The motions judge
may be correct in his assessment of the earlier agreement,
however, the weighing of evidence is a function reserved for the
trier of fact.
[66] When he dealt with the agency issue, the motions judge
concluded that it was &#147;difficult to see how&#148; GAS was the
Insurers&#146; agent. He added that even if there was an agency
relationship it did not follow that there was a trust established
with respect to the premiums. This was his response to
Transamerica&#146;s submission that since GAS was its agent, it owed a
fiduciary duty to Transamerica, and a trust could be inferred.
[67] Henning said in his cross-examination that although the CIMC
agreement did not use the word &#147;agent&#148; to describe GAS&#146;s role, &#147;&#133;
the agreement is the type of agreement you would expect to see
for a general agent.&#148;  This seems to me to be a reasonable
assessment of the relationship of GAS and Transamerica.
[68] In addition, there is a somewhat oblique reference in the
CIMC agreement to GAS being Transamerica&#146;s agent. Section 2(e) of
the agreement refers to &#147;other agents&#148; in a way that appears to
me to mean agents other than GAS.
[69] In my view, the relationship between GAS and the Insurers is
manifestly capable of supporting a conclusion that GAS was the
Insurers&#146; (unlicensed) agent at relevant times. See the
definition of agency in Bowstead and Reymonds on Agency, 16th ed.
1996 Sweet &amp; Maxwell, at p. 1. I agree with the motions judge
that this evidence does not establish a trust relationship; it
does, however, provide some evidentiary support for it.
[70] I think that characterizing the Symons-GAS relationship as
one of insurer-policyholder represents a triumph of form over
substance. Symons, for reasons that are not clearly explained,
chose to define its arrangements with GAS in a Master Policy. The
&#147;policy&#148; is a policy in name only. It seems to me to be no more
of an insurance policy than the CIMC agreement is. Thus, I see no
reason to distinguish between Transamerica and Symons on the
basis of the form of their agreements with GAS. Both are capable
of giving rise to a conclusion that GAS was the Insurers&#146; agent.
[71] By way of summary and conclusion, although I accept the
Insurers&#146; submission that the evidence discloses some credibility
issues, I do not view credibility to be a significant issue in
this case. In my opinion, the primary feature of the evidence,
which, apart from the two agreements, consists for the most part
of indirect or circumstantial evidence, is what inferences that
are not speculative or conjectural will be drawn from the
evidence. That determination largely depends upon the weight that
is given to the evidence.
[72] Here, significant evidence is reasonably capable of
supporting competing inferences. Therefore, the central
determination in the fact-finding process, the weight to be given
to the evidence &#150; and the findings of fact to be made from the
evidence, necessarily by inference, should be done at trial and
not a paper record.
[73] For these reasons, I think there is a genuine issue for
trial on the common law (actual) trust issue.</pre>
    <pre>The Statutory Trust</pre>
    <pre>[74] Section 402(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8
(formerly s. 359, R.S.O. 1980, c. 218) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               402. (1)  An agent or broker who acts in negotiating, or
          renewing or continuing a contract of insurance, other than life
          insurance, with a licensed insurer, and who receives any money or
          substitute for money as a premium for such a contract from the
          insured, shall be deemed to hold such premium in trust for the
          insurer, and, if the agent or broker fails to pay the premium
          over to the insurer within fifteen days after written demand made
          upon the agent or broker therefor, less the commission of the
          agent or broker and any deductions to which, by the written
          consent of the company, the agent or broker is entitled, such
          failure is proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary,
          that the agent or broker has used or applied the premium for a
          purpose other than paying it over to the insurer.</pre>
    <pre>[75] The Insurers submit that GAS was its agent within the
meaning of s. 402(1) of the Insurance Act. They take the position
that the fact that Lane was the Insurers&#146; licensed agent does not
preclude a finding that the insurers and GAS were in a principal-
agent relationship, in spite of the fact that GAS was not
licensed as an agent in Ontario. The Insurers further submit that
since GAS held premiums as their agent, s. 402(1) applies and GAS
is deemed to hold the premiums in trust.
[76] TD submitted that s. 402 did not apply because GAS was not a
licensed agent and because the premiums were for &#147;life
insurance&#148;, as defined in the Insurance Act, with the result that
s. 402(1)&#146;s deemed trust provision do not apply.
[77] The motions judge accepted TD&#146;s position on this issue.
First, he concluded that the &#147;agent&#148; as referred to in s. 402(1)
had to be licensed, notwithstanding the fact that the word
licensed does not appear in s. 402(1) to qualify &#147;agent.&#148;  He
also found that the insurance contracts in issue came within the
Insurance Act definition of life insurance and therefore, s. 402
did not apply.
[78] Whether s. 402(1) applies to create a statutory trust is an
issue of law. Rule 20.04(4) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>       20.04 (4)  Where the court is satisfied that the only
   genuine issue is a question of law, the court may determine the
   question and grant judgment accordingly, but where the motion is
   made to a master, it shall be adjourned to be heard by judge.</pre>
    <pre>[79] Since I am of the view that there are genuine issues for
trial, it follows that the question of law &#150; the application of
s. 402(1) of the Insurance Act, is not the &#147;only&#148; genuine issue
to be determined. Thus, summary judgment should not be granted on
the statutory trust issue. It will be for the trial judge to deal
with this issue along with all of the other issues that are
presented in this case.</pre>
    <pre>Constructive Trust</pre>
    <pre>[80] Constructive trust represents the third prong in the
Insurers&#146; trust position and is only of importance if the
Insurers do not establish an actual or a statutory trust. To
succeed in establishing a constructive trust, the Insurers must
establish that:
     </pre>
    <pre>         GAS was under an equitable obligation arising out of the
          activities giving rise to its receipt of the premiums;
     </pre>
    <pre>         GAS received the premiums as part of its agency activities
          and withheld them from the Insurers;
     </pre>
    <pre>         the Insurers are able to show a legitimate reason for
          seeking a proprietary remedy; and
     </pre>
    <pre>         there are no factors which would cause the imposition of a
          constructive trust to be unjust in all of the circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>See Soulos v. Korkontzilas, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 217.
</pre>
    <pre>[81] Since this action is against TD, not GAS, the insurers have
a further problem. They must also establish that TD can, in law,
assist in the breach of a constructive trust on the basis of
actions that took place before the constructive trust was
declared to exist. This aspect of the case requires an inquiry
into TD&#146;s knowledge of the underlying facts. Counsel seem to
agree that the nature and extent of TD&#146;s knowledge of GAS&#146;s
activities in respect of the use of premiums was not an issue on
the motion. The constructive trust issue is fact dependent and
not all of the evidence material to it was before the motions
judge. Accordingly, I do not think that it would be appropriate
to grant summary judgment on this part of the Insurers&#146; claim.
Whether, in all the circumstances, GAS held the premiums as a
constructive trust is an issue that should be determined at
trial.</pre>
    <pre>Negligent Misrepresentation</pre>
    <pre>[82] The Insurers also claimed against TD for negligent
misrepresentation. This part of the Insurers&#146; claim is based upon
the premise that TD owed them a duty of care to ensure that GAS&#146;s
bank statements (particularly its designated account statement)
and other bank communications were accurate and not misleading.
More particularly, the Insurers contend that TD breached the duty
it owed to them:
     </pre>
    <pre>    when it issued bank statements concerning the GAS designated
     account which were silent about the existence and implications of
     the Mirror Accounting System and its implications;
     </pre>
    <pre>    when a TD employee gave information to a Transamerica
     employee about the GAS designated account, but did not mention
     that the designated account was subject to the Mirror Accounting
     System;
     </pre>
    <pre>    when  TD contacted Symons about three postdated cheques that
     it had certified in error, it failed to tell Symons that the GAS
     designated account was subject to the Mirror Accounting System.</pre>
    <pre>[83] The GAS designated account statement was part of a package
that also involved the GAS Mirror Account statement and the
participating Guardall companies&#146; Concentration Account
statement. In the end, as TD&#146;s customer, GAS would have received
a monthly record of deposits and withdrawals in its designated
account, a record of the offsetting entries in its mirror account
and a statement showing the state of the consolidated Guardall
concentration account.
[84] TD did not give any of GAS&#146;s bank records to Transamerica.
Hansen, who did the May 1988 audit for Transamerica, had no
contact with anyone at TD to verify the state of any GAS bank
account. TD had no knowledge or information that statements
relating to the GAS designated account would be shown to third
parties, particularly without GAS also providing information
about the Mirror Accounting System that it had in place with TD.
[85] There is no evidence of a misrepresentation for which TD is
responsible that would support Transamerica&#146;s claim for negligent
misrepresentation. The bank statements that Hansen reviewed did
not constitute a representation by TD that there were funds in
the designated account to cover premiums owing to Transamerica.
If this was a misrepresentation of the actual balance, the
misrepresentation was by GAS, not TD.
[86] Finally, there is no evidence of reliance. In May, 1988,
Hansen took no steps to determine the balance of the GAS
designated account, apart from his review of GAS&#146;s April 19, 1988
bank statements. He did not contact TD during his review to
verify the information that GAS had provided. He did not know, or
inquire, if GAS had removed funds from the designated account
after April 19, 1988. He admitted that in September 1988 he did
not know what, if anything, was in the GAS designated account.
[87] All that we have to support the Insurers&#146; negligent
misrepresentation claim is Hansen&#146;s evidence that if the
particulars of the Mirror Accounting System had been disclosed on
the bank statements he reviewed, he would have gone further and
examined all of the relevant accounts. This, in my opinion, does
not provide an evidentiary basis for the Insurers&#146; claim of
negligent misrepresentation. In my opinion, the evidence does not
reveal a genuine issue for trial on Transamerica&#146;s negligent
misrepresentation claim.
[88] Symons never saw, or asked to see, GAS&#146;s bank statements.
Its motion to amend the statement of claim to assert that it
relied on these bank statements to its detriment was dismissed as
being devoid of merit.
[89] Symons alleged in its amended statement of claim that it
relied on the bank&#146;s mistaken certification of three postdated
cheques on February 28, 1989, and discussions about those
cheques, to its detriment. Symons contends that the bank&#146;s
failure to advise it that the GAS designated account was subject
to the Mirror Accounting System constituted negligent
misrepresentation (non-disclosure), since Symons, to its
detriment, continued to permit GAS to act as its Canadian agent.
[90] There are a number of problems with Symons&#146; negligent
misrepresentation claim. TD had no duty at any relevant time to
Symons to advise Symons of particulars of the GAS designated
account, or any other GAS account. Nor did TD have a duty to
disclose details of, or even the existence of, the Guardall
Mirror Accounting System. On the contrary, TD had a duty of
confidentiality in respect of its customer, GAS. Furthermore, TD
had no duty to tell Symons that there were insufficient funds in
the GAS designated account (the account on which the three
postdated cheques were drawn) on February 28, 1989 to cover the
three cheques, which were dated March 3, March 10 and March 17,
1989. The total of these three cheques was $269,432.54. In any
case, there is uncontradicted evidence that on March 1, 1989, as
part of the mistakenly certified postdated cheques episode, a TD
employee told Symons that had the three cheques been dated March
1, 1989, they would not have been certified. Thus, Symons knew
that as at March 1, 1989 there were insufficient funds in GAS&#146;s
premium account to cover the three cheques totalling $269,432.54.
This is significantly less than the many millions Symons now
claims from TD.
[91] Finally, Symons relationship with GAS ended on February 28,
1989. Thus, the alleged non-disclosure connected with the
mistakenly certified cheques occurred in March 1989 after the
Symons-GAS relationship ended.
[92] Rule 21.01(3) provides for a summary judgment that dismisses
&#147;part of&#148; a claim. The dismissal of the Insurers&#146; negligent
misrepresentation claim will remove from the trial an issue that
would otherwise have to be resolved at trial. See Ford v. Ontario
Municipal Retirement Board (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 384. This is
consistent with the purpose of Rule 20 as referred to in cases
such as Ungerman and Jockey Club, supra.
[93] For the reasons set out above, I think that TD established
that there is no genuine issue for trial in respect of the
Insurers&#146; negligent misrepresentation claim. I would, therefore,
dismiss that part of the Insurers&#146; appeal.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[94] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal in part, with
costs to the appellants. I would set aside the motions judge&#146;s
order and dismiss TD&#146;s motion for summary judgment with costs,
except as it relates to the Insurers&#146; negligent misrepresentation
claim.
[95] TD&#146;s cross-appeal on the issue of the costs of the motion is
premised on the appellants&#146; action being dismissed. Since I would
allow the appeal in respect of three of the four main issues,
there is no foundation for the cross-appeal. I would dismiss it
without costs.

_______________________________
1    The lower court decision is reported at (1998), 22 E.T.R.
(2d) 106.
2    Symons did not provide credit life insurance since it was
not licensed to sell life insurance in Ontario.
3     The  Insurers also made a claim in negligence.   Sharpe  J.
found  that  the  evidence did not disclose a genuine  issue  for
trial in respect of the Insurers&#146; negligence claim.  The Insurers
do not take issue with that finding.
4     Symons  had an earlier business relationship with  Ravinsky
and  GAS&#146;s  predecessor company.  This relationship  began  about
1984.   In  1984, Symons began underwriting accident  and  health
credit insurance.  GAS was involved in processing the  insurance,
generally  as I have earlier described, until June 1,  1986  when
the  GAS-Symons  arrangement ended.   As  noted,  the  GAS-Symons
relationship revived, effective November 1, 1988.
5     Neither agreement deals with GAS&#146;s entitlement to  interest
earned on the premiums in the remittance period.
6     Transamerica  reinsured  25% of  its  liability  under  its
accident   and  health  credit  policies  with  Ontario   General
Insurance Company (&#147;OGIC&#148;).  OGIC was an insurance company  owned
by  Ravinsky  and  was part of the Guardall Group.   Transamerica
ceded  100%  of  its liabilities on its credit life  policies  to
another reinsurer Guardall Insurance Company (&#147;GIC&#148;).  GIC was  a
Bermuda  corporation  which  was also  owned  and  controlled  by
Ravinsky.
7     GAS kept the interest earned on the premiums it held during
the remittance period.  This was not addressed in the agreement.</pre></td>
