</pre>
    <pre>[1]  These two appeals arise out of an acrimonious matrimonial
dispute.  On January 3, 1994, after a marriage of approximately
17 years, the wife commenced divorce proceedings against her
husband.  On the same date, she commenced an action for damages
for personal injuries arising out of alleged physical and mental
abuse.  The husband made an assignment in bankruptcy in June
1996.  Loukidelis J. found that he did so in order to avoid
paying his wife&#146;s claim for damages which was in the amount of
$750,000.  In addition, the husband admitted that he purposely
withheld from the trustee knowledge of a debt owing to his
sister, as it was his intention to pay her in full, that is, to
grant her a preference.
[2]  At the bankruptcy discharge hearing, Loukidelis J. observed,
on the basis of these facts, that he was required to impose some
penalty but, in the circumstances, that it would serve no purpose
to refuse to grant a discharge.  As a condition of discharge,
Loukidelis J. ordered the bankrupt to consent to judgment in the
amount of $18,000 payable at the rate of $300 per month,
commencing September 1, 1997.  In so doing, Loukidelis J.
preferred the evidence of the husband over that of the wife as to
the husband&#146;s income.  He found that the husband had monthly
income of approximately $3,950, or about $48,000 a year.  The
husband&#146;s own evidence filed in another proceeding indicated that
his income for 1997 was slightly in excess of $58,000.  The
husband has not yet signed the consent to judgment and has made
no payments pursuant to the order of Loukidelis J.
[3]  Divorce judgment was granted on November 10, 1997.  At that
time, DiSalle J. ordered the husband to pay to the wife $1,200
per month commencing December 1, 1997.  He further ordered that,
after two and one half years, the wife show cause why her support
should be continued.
[4]  With respect to the bankruptcy proceedings, the wife submits
that the amount ordered by Loukidelis J. was too low.  In the
alternative, the wife submits that the application for discharge
should have been suspended and that Loukidelis J. should have
granted leave to her to continue with her action.
[5]  With respect to the divorce proceedings, the wife submits
that the amount of support ordered is insufficient.  She further
submits that the trial judge erred in placing an onus on her to
show cause why support should be continued after two and one half
years from the divorce judgment.
[6]  During the marriage of approximately 17 years, the wife was
a traditional homemaker and mother.  From time to time, she was
able to earn some casual income babysitting.  Following the break-
up of the marriage, the wife, who has a grade 10 education,
wished to attend community college and upgrade her skills.  She
was not able to do so, she submits, owing to a lack of financial
support from her husband.  The wife has, however, remarried and
is presently employed by her current husband.
[7]  The husband has also remarried.  He has not appealed the
order of Loukidelis J. and we make no comment as to its
propriety.
[8]  The husband submits that the amount he was ordered to
consent to pay as a condition of being discharged in the
bankruptcy proceedings was appropriate and that the support order
made in the divorce proceedings should be upheld.
[9]  We agree with the wife that, given the length of the
marriage and her needs at the time the order for support was made
in the divorce proceedings, DiSalle J. erred in placing the onus
upon her to show cause why support should be continued after two
and one half years from the divorce judgment.
[10] Accordingly, we would delete paragraph 3 of the divorce
judgment of DiSalle J.  We would not otherwise make any further
order for support as we believe it is preferable to allow the
husband to apply for a variation of support in the event that he
chooses to do so having regard to the changed circumstances of
the parties.
[11] With respect to the bankruptcy proceedings, we would not
interfere with the decision of Loukedelis J.
[12] As the parties were not represented by counsel, there is no
order as to costs.
