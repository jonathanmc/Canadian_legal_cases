    <pre><font size="3">[1]  The appellant, Bruce Agra Foods Inc. (&#147;Bruce Agra&#148;) appeals
from the judgment of Somers J. of the Ontario Court of Justice
(General Division), dated February 10, 1998. In his judgment, the
trial judge granted a declaration that the respondents, Trilwood
Investments Limited (&#147;Trilwood&#148;) and Wendco Inc. (&#147;Wendco&#148;) were
entitled to receive and retain the sum of $5.5 million, described
as the &#147;Initial Instalment&#148;, and interest thereon. The amount was
paid by Bruce Agra pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement
(&#147;Agreement&#148;) between Bruce Agra and the respondents made
September 6, 1996, relating to shares of Sweet Ripe Drinks Ltd.
(&#147;Sweet Ripe&#148;). The judgment also dismissed Bruce Agra&#146;s
counterclaim and awarded costs against Bruce Agra on a party and
party basis up to June 11, 1997 and on a solicitor and client
basis thereafter.

[2]  The appellant&#146;s first argument was that the Material Consent
required under the  Agreement was not provided in that the
respondents as vendors of the shares had made certain
unauthorised representations to the Nova Scotia Economic Renewal
Agency (&#147;NSERA&#148;) and agreed to conditions binding on Sweet Ripe
that had not been agreed upon between the appellant as Purchaser
of the shares of Sweet Ripe under the Agreement and the
respondents as Vendors of the shares.

[3]  &#147;Material Consent&#148; is defined in the Agreement as:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               </font><font size="2">the consent of the Government of Nova Scotia to the direct
          change of control of the Corporation, and the indirect change of
          control of the Subsidiary, resulting from the completion of the
          transaction contemplated by this Agreement, if required by the
          terms of the grant the Government of Nova Scotia to the
          Corporation and / or the Subsidiary referred to in Schedule
          3.2(h);</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[4]  The requirement for this consent is contained in a Grant
Agreement between the Government of Nova Scotia (&#147;Government&#148;)
and Sweet Ripe and others. It provided that in return for certain
loans to and for Sweet Ripe, Sweet Ripe and its principals agreed
to a number of conditions, one being that there would be no
change in the ownership or management of Sweet Ripe without the
consent of the Government. This Grant Agreement was to expire by
its terms on March 31, 1997, three months after the last closing
date called for in the Agreement in appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[5]  The two conditions that are singled out for criticism in
this court are:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               1)   Sweet Ripe Drinks Ltd. and Allen&#146;s
          Food Industries Inc. continue to abide by all
          the terms of the captioned agreement and are
          committed to maintaining its Port Williams, N.S.
          operations, as indicated in your September 19,
          1996 letter.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               2)   As stated in your September 19,
          1996 letter, this share transaction will not
          have any material adverse change in the
          operations or balance sheet of Sweet Ripe
          Drinks Ltd. or Allen&#146;s Food Industries Inc.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[6]  These complaints are answered in overview by very strong
findings of fact by the trial judge. In the first place, the
trial judge is critical of the conduct of Dr. Bernard Sherman,
the owner of Apotex and the majority owner of the appellant Bruce
Agra. He had attempted without success to persuade Craig
Stanfield of NSERA not to provide the material Consent requested
by the respondents. With respect to the appellant&#146;s complaints
about the Material Consent, the trial judge&#146;s findings as to the
conduct of Dr. Sherman are instructive. He states:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               </font><font size="2">As to his alleged concerns about any commitment Mr. England
          may have made on behalf of Sweetripe to the Nova Scotia
          government, he and Mr. Hendler were told directly by Mr.
          Stanfield that his concerns were unfounded. He was told that the
          Nova Scotia government sought only a commitment that the terms of
          the subsidy agreement would be honoured by the new owners. Dr.
          Sherman continued to maintain that he was worried about this even
          in the face of such strong assurances to the contrary. I find
          that the transaction failed to close because Dr. Sherman
          deliberately planned that it should not. His attempt to hold up
          the delivery of the consent from the Nova Scotia government to
          the plaintiffs&#146; representatives was done merely to provide
          additional legitimacy to his position. In my view his conduct in
          taking these steps was entirely duplicitous.</font><font
size="3">
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[7]  The trial judge also found the following as a fact:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               </font><font size="2">24.  The defendant relied on the expected failure to deliver
          the consent as a reason for terminating the agreement and on the
          allegation that it had been placed under further and ongoing
          obligations because of statements made by Sweetripe through Mr.
          England in an attempt to negotiate a lower price. It did so in
          expectation that the consent would not be received because Dr.
          Sherman had asked Mr. Stanfield not to send it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[8]  As to the first condition relating to the commitment to
maintain the Port William operation, we do not read the language
as extending the obligation made by Sweet Ripe under the Grant
Agreement. A review of all of the correspondence, fortified by
the testimony at trial of Mr. Stanfield, confirms that this was
the understanding of all of the parties and supports the finding
of the trial judge that Dr. Sherman&#146;s concerns were bogus.

[9]  As to the second objection relating to the effect of the
share transaction on the operations of Sweet Ripe, we do not
regard this as more than a statement of fact as to the effect of
the share purchase on the corporation whose shares are being
acquired. Any exception to it should have been taken at the time
the Material Consent was proffered.

[10] A further argument advanced by the appellant was that the
Material Consent called for in the Agreement was to be that of
the Government and not that of Mr. Craig on behalf of NSERA. No
objection was taken to the signatory to the Material Consent when
it was tendered on closing and there has been no suggestion on
the part of the Government or any of its agencies that Mr.
Stanfield was not fully authorised to participate in the
discussions leading up to the obtaining of the Material Consent
or that he was not the person to act as signatory for the purpose
of providing the Material Consent. The requirement of consent to
a change of ownership was inserted in the Grant Agreement for the
protection of the Government. If it had not been obtained the
Government could call for the repayment of the loans.
Accordingly, while the obtaining of consent was vital to the
purchaser on a change of ownership, the Government was the only
party that could have objected to the adequacy of the consent and
no such objection was forthcoming. The trial judge dealt
specifically with this issue in his reasons and found against the
appellant. We would not give effect to such a technical argument
in the light of the overarching findings of the trial judge as to
the lack of good faith on the part of the appellant with respect
to this transaction.

[11] The next objection of substance related to the
characterizatoin of the Initial Instalment. The clause dealing
with this payment is as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               2.3  Payment of the Purchase Price
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               (a)  The Vendors acknowledge receipt
          from the Purchaser by their counsel, in
          trust, of an initial instalment in the amount
          of $5,500,000 (the &#147;Initial Instalment&#148;). The
          Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that on the
          date hereof $3,000,000 of the Initial
          Instalment plus interest accrued on such
          portion of the Initial Instalment shall be
          paid to, and become the property of and be
          retained by Trilwood Investments Limited on
          behalf of the Vendors, subject to Section
          5.2. In the event that the Purchaser is
          unable to complete the transactions
          contemplated in this Agreement on or before
          September 30, 1996 the Purchaser may, at its
          option, deliver to the Vendors written notice
          that it wishes to extend the Closing to
          November 15, 1996. The Purchaser acknowledges
          and agrees that upon delivery of such notice,
          an additional $1,000,000 of the Initial
          Instalment shall be paid to, and become the
          property of and be retained by Trilwood
          Investments Limited on behalf of the Vendors,
          subject to Section 5.2  . . . . In the event
          that following September 30 1996, the
          Purchaser is unable to complete the
          transaction contemplated in this Agreement on
          or before November 15, 1996 the Purchaser
          may, at its option, deliver to the Vendors
          written notice that it wishes to extend the
          closing to December 31, 1996. The Purchaser
          acknowledges and agrees that upon delivery of
          such notice, the remaining $1,500,000 of the
          Initial Instalment shall be paid to and
          become the property of and be retained by
          Trillwood Investments Limited on behalf of
          the Vendors, subject to Section 5.2.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[12] Section 5.2 provides that the obligation of the Purchaser to
complete the sale of the shares is subject to the receipt of the
Material Consent on or before the closing date.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="2">            (c)       For greater certainty, the Purchaser&#146;s obligation to
          complete the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
          absolute and unconditional subject only to a material default of
          the Vendors of their obligations under section 5.3 of the
          Agreement or the failure to obtain the Material Consent. If this
          transaction is not completed for any other reason, the full
          amount of the Remaining Instalment plus the retained amounts, if
          any, shall be retained by the Vendors to compensate them for
          inter alia lost opportunity and expenses incurred in connection
          with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[13] The evidence discloses that the figure totalling $5,500,000
was the result of significant bargaining between the parties
commencing in February 1996, some six months before the Agreement
was executed. The appellant, as Purchaser, was anxious to
demonstrate that it was serious in making this Agreement and had
suggested the figure of $3,000,000, which was the first figure
set out in the above clause. Representatives of the appellant
then added that the appellant wanted the right to unilaterally
extend the time for closing for the two periods set out therein
in order to permit itself more flexibility in financing the
purchase. The right to each extension was the subject of separate
negotiation resulting in the two additional figures of $1,000,000
and $1,500,000 respectively. The final figure arrived at
$5,500,000 was by no means arbitrary as argued by the appellant.
[14] For its part, the respondents, as Vendors, wanted a serious
deposit as a reflection of the appellant&#146;s good faith and as a
guarantee of its willingness to go forward with this acquisition.
They were expressly concerned with respect to the following
matters:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               a)   The reference to lost opportunity in the
          clause above included the concern that the extended
          negotiations with the appellant was &#147;keeping the
          company out of play&#148; in the sense that it was no
          longer available as a potential acquisition for other
          beverage companies in the market.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               b)   Sweet Ripe had recently purchased a
          company called Everfresh that was in the
          private labelling business and Sweet Ripe was
          anxious to avoid any situation which would
          create uncertainty in the business community
          as to the future intentions of Sweet Ripe
          with respect to Everfresh;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               c)   Apotex was represented as a partner
          in this venture with Bruce Agra in this
          purchase. Recognising the power and
          significance of Apotex, the respondents were
          concerned that if, after making the
          examination of the books of Sweet Ripe and
          pursuing its due diligence entitlement, the
          appellant was to decline to enter into the
          Agreement, this might be taken by the
          industry as an indication that Sweet Ripe had
          been overpriced; and
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">               d)   During the course of the
          negotiations, representatives of Bruce Agra
          and Apotex had made clear their willingness
          to be aggressive in Sweet Ripe&#146;s business and
          if they could not make a deal with Sweet
          Ripe, they were prepared to be an aggressive
          competitor to them. They threatened to become
          Sweet Ripe&#146;s biggest and worst competitor.
          They were prepared to drop prices, make
          acquisitions and do what was needed to be
          disruptive to Sweet Ripe and the industry. In
          the circumstances, Sweet Ripe was not
          prepared to disclose sensitive financial
          information and other confidential records in
          the due diligence process to a party who
          could be a significant competitor if the deal
          did not close.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[15] The argument of the appellant is that on its clear wording
the Agreement called for forfeiture of the $5,500,000 in the
event that the transaction did not close. Having regard to its
size in proportion to the amount of the purchase price
($22,000,000) it could not be considered to be a deposit. It was
a penalty.

[16] We do not accept that the full amount of the consideration
for the sale of the shares was $22,000,000, although just what is
the true figure is very much in dispute. However, in addition to
paying the specific price, the appellant as Purchaser was obliged
to take over financial responsibilities of the Vendors and others
with which they were affiliated. These included the assumption of
some $26,000,000 of short and long term debt of Sweet Ripe or its
affiliates underwritten by the respondents, the indemnification
of the undertakings of the respondents to pay out some $2,000,000
to preference share holders and the assumption of almost
$10,000,000 of non-institutional debt. Accordingly, depending on
how one looked at the total transaction, the &#147;deposit&#148; could be
anywhere from less than 10% to as much as 25%.

[17] We were invited to review the authorities in this area,
particularly the decision of the House of Lords in Workers Trust
&amp; Merchant Bank Ltd. V. Dojpa Investments Ltd., [1993] A.C. 573.
However we do not think that is necessary in this case. The same
authorities were referred to the trial judge and he concluded
that the $5,500,000 was a deposit and was subject to forfeit in
the event that the transaction did not close through any breach
on the part of the appellant. With reference to the Workers Trust
case, he found that in the event that the amount of the deposit
exceeded 10%, &#147;special circumstances&#148; existed in this case. It
may have been a large down payment but it was intended to
demonstrate that Bruce Agra was serious about the transaction. In
our view, on all of the evidence it was open to the trial judge
to make such findings. Certainly, we are not prepared to say that
the sum in issue did not have the character of a deposit, an
earnest of performance, which was liable to forfeiture on
recission.

[18] The last issue we propose to deal with relates to the
appellant&#146;s motion for leave to appeal the disposition of costs.
The trial judge awarded solicitor and client costs against the
appellant after June 11, 1997, the date on which the respondents
served an offer under rule 49.10(1) of the Rules of Civil
Procedure to settle for the Initial Instalment of $5,500,000 and
interest thereon, less $1,000 together with costs. The complaint
is that the offer contained no genuine element of compromise.

[19] The offer does not contain a substantial element of
compromise but as Morden A.C.J.O. of this court stated in Data
General (Canada) Ltd. V. Molmar Systems Group Inc et al. (1991),
6 O.R. (3d) 409 at 414:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font size="2">               For the reasons that I shall give I say at the outset that I
          do not think that an element of compromise is an essential
          element of an offer to settle but its absence can be a relevant
          factor to be taken into account in &#147;ordering otherwise&#148; under
          rule 49.10(1).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3">[20] The disposition of costs in this case is a clear exercise of
the trial judge&#146;s discretion with full knowledge of the nature of
the offer. We do not propose to interfere with it. Leave to
appeal is refused.

[21] For the reasons set out above, the appeal is dismissed with
costs.</font></pre></td>
