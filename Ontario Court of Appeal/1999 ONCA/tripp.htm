    <pre>WEILER J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  When land is expropriated, Section 32(1) of the
Expropriations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26 provides for the
expropriating authority, here the Ministry of Transportation
(&#147;MTO&#148;), to pay the &#147;reasonable legal, appraisal and other costs
actually incurred by the owner for the purposes of determining
the compensation payable.&#148;1
[2]  In this appeal, the MTO raises three issues concerning the
award of costs that it was ordered to pay. They are: 1) whether a
performance bonus over and above a solicitor&#146;s hourly rate can be
awarded in expropriation cases; 2) whether compensation can be
ordered for the cost of an expert&#146;s report which was not
disclosed in the affidavit of documents and was not used or
relied upon by the land owners for whom it was prepared; 3)
whether interest is payable on the amount of costs awarded to the
owners following assessment.
[3]  For their part, the owners have cross-appealed the
assessment officer&#146;s award of costs for their solicitor&#146;s
attendance at the assessment hearing.
[4]  For the reasons that follow I would allow the appeal to the
extent of setting aside the award of the solicitor&#146;s bonus, and
would also set aside the award of costs for the expert&#146;s report.
I would dismiss the third ground of appeal as I am of the opinion
that interest is properly payable on the costs awarded.  I would
also dismiss the respondent owners&#146; cross-appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>     FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Robert Barrie Tripp, Jack Boyd, and his sister Lorna Russell
were the representatives of two groups, each of which owned a
parcel of land of about 50 acres located in the City of Nepean in
the Regional Municipality of Ottawa Carleton. Access to the land
was over a right of way. On July 20, 1992, MTO expropriated both
parcels in order to build Highway 416.  The proposed highway went
through the middle of the land, cutting off the owners&#146; access
over the right of way to their property.  After a nine day
arbitration under the Expropriations Act, the Ontario Municipal
Board (&#147;OMB&#148;) ordered payment to each of the claimant groups of
$1.5 million or $30,000 an acre.   In addition, the OMB ordered
that interest totalling $1,300,000 be paid. The owners were also
awarded their &#147;reasonable legal appraisal and other costs&#148;
pursuant to s. 32(1) of the Expropriations Act.2
[6]  Douglas Kelly of the law firm of Solway, Wright represented
both groups of owners and was assisted at various times by junior
solicitors.  Mr. Kelly was called to the Bar in 1971 and
specializes in municipal law. The owners submitted their claim
for his fees as part of their claim for costs and the claims went
to assessment.  After a seven day hearing, Assessment Officer
Richard Lamoureux assessed the legal fees of Tripp at $82,642.10
plus consultants&#146; fees of $60,447.68 for a total recovery of
$143,089.78 . The Boyd/Russell claim was assessed at $88,120.95
for legal fees plus consultants&#146; fees of  $60,447.67 for a total
of $148,568.62.
[7]  In addition to allowing Mr. Kelly&#146;s fees at $275.00 per
hour, the legal fees allowed included a performance bonus for Mr.
Kelly totalling $32,100 (inclusive of G.S.T.).  It is this bonus
which is the subject of the first ground of appeal.
[8]  Part of the consultants&#146; fees allowed was the payment of the
account of Pigeon-Roy for preparation of an appraisal report in
the amount of $5,952.  This report was not produced by the owners
during negotiations, was not relied upon at the arbitration
hearing concerning compensation for the land, and was not
included in the owners&#146; affidavit of documents.  This report is
the subject of the second ground of appeal concerning the
assessment of costs.
[9]   The assessment officer also initially ordered the MTO to
pay the owners&#146; costs of the assessment in the sum of $10,000. He
withheld his certificates to permit further submissions by the
parties.  As a result of further submissions, the assessment
officer increased the costs of the hearing from $10,000 to
$41,145. He also awarded interest on the costs of $41,145
pursuant to s. 129(1) of the Courts of Justice Act R.S.O. 1990 c.
C.43 as am.,  from the date of the OMB&#146;s decision.  This order is
the subject of the MTO&#146;s third ground of appeal.
[10] By way of cross-appeal, the owners contend that Mr. Kelly
should have been paid his hourly rate as a solicitor when he
testified at the assessment hearing respecting his fees.
[11] On the appeal before Métivier J., both counsel agreed that
the assessment officer erred in law in stating that there was an
onus on the MTO to disprove the reasonableness of the fees
charged and the hours docketed. The onus remains on the owners.
After noting the error respecting the onus of proof, Métivier J.
held that the assessment officer had committed no other error in
principle.  She held that while she might have exercised her
discretion differently, the assessment officer had considered the
appropriate factors, was guided by correct principles and made
findings of fact which were not contrary to the evidence.  She
dismissed the appeal and, based on the same reasoning, dismissed
the cross-appeal.
[12] Both parties appealed to this court.
</pre>
    <pre>     DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>1.   Is Soloway Wright entitled to a performance bonus of
  $32,100?
</pre>
    <pre>[13] The MTO does not dispute that the scale of costs awarded
under s. 32(1) is on a solicitor-and-client scale, that is, that
the costs awarded are intended to reimburse the owners fully for
the fees and disbursements reasonably incurred by them in the
course of pursuing their claim for compensation for the
expropriation of their land.
[14] The MTO submits, however, that it was not reasonable to
award a performance bonus to the owners&#146; solicitor in addition to
the solicitor&#146;s hourly rate. The MTO submits that in awarding a
bonus the assessment officer erred and that Métivier J. erred in
upholding this award.
[15] A helpful review of many of the factors considered by courts
in deciding whether to award a bonus to a solicitor over and
above the solicitor&#146;s hourly rate is found in  Equity Waste
Management of Canada Corp. v. Halton Hills (Town), (1995), 22
O.R. (3d) 796 at 798 (Gen. Div.) They include the legal
complexity of the case, the responsibility assumed, the monetary
value in issue, the importance of the matter to the client, the
degree of skill and competence in the legal services rendered,
the results achieved and the ability of the client to pay.  If
the client is unable to pay, the financial risk assumed by the
firm is that it will not be paid if  the claim does not succeed.
This is an important consideration in some cases, although not,
as will be discussed below, in the expropriation context.  See De
Jong (Litigation Guardian of)  v. Owen Sound General and Marine
Hospital (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 594 (Gen. Div.), and Arctic
Installations v. Campney &amp; Murphy, (1992), 13 C.P.C. (3d) 60,
(B.C.S.C.), additional reasons at (1993), 15 C.P.C. 88
(B.C.S.C.),  aff&#146;d (1994) 22 C.P.C. (3d) 221 (B.C.C.A.).
[16] A further consideration is the pattern of billing and
payment. In Arctic Installations, supra, the court of first
impression noted that a pattern had been established of billing
for services based on the full hourly rates and time spent by
various members of the law firm. In the absence of notice to the
contrary, the court held that the clients were entitled to rely
upon the pattern as establishing the basis on which they would be
billed. In these circumstances, the solicitors were not entitled
to charge a bonus based on the success of the litigation because
they had already been paid in full. By way of contrast, where a
firm proceeded on the basis that the client could not or would
not pay periodic bills as they were rendered or might not be able
to pay them afterwards, a bonus factor for the successful
conclusion of the litigation was appropriate; see Campney, supra,
at 66. The Court of Appeal held that if solicitors did not inform
the client that they were claiming the right to charge a bonus at
the time the initial retainer for payment of services on an
hourly basis was entered into they could not charge it
afterwards.  The rationale was based on the solicitors&#146;
obligation of utmost good faith towards the client and the fact
that the solicitors had no intention of refunding any part of the
fees paid in the event of failure in the litigation.
[17] In determining the appropriateness of a solicitor&#146;s bonus,
it must be remembered that an owner whose property has been
expropriated is not in the same position as an ordinary litigant:
Neill v. British Columbia (Minister of Transportation and
Highways)  (1992), 47 L.C .R. 112 (B.C. Exp. Comp. Bd.), conf'd.
(1994) ,50 L.C.R., 241 (B.C.S.C.), sub nom. Neill v. British
Columbia (Chairman, Expropriation Board). The expropriating
authority will always be liable to compensate the owner for the
loss of his property and therefore the risk that the litigation
will not succeed does not exist to the same degree;  Neill,
supra, at 125-127.  As pointed out by the B.C.S.C. in Neill at
247, the reasonableness of a  costs award requires an assessment
of the nature and risk undertaken by counsel.3   Such an
assessment must be made in light of the fact that in an
expropriation the award of costs is a question of quantum, and
not entitlement.   Indeed, under ss. 32(1) and (2) of the
Expropriations Act, the solicitors performing the work for the
owner are assured of payment of their reasonable fees where the
amount awarded is 85% of the amount offered by the statutory
authority, or an appropriate amount if it is less.
[18] Here, Soloway Wright adopted a pattern of regular billing
and the owners paid the bills as they were rendered.  When the
owners first retained Soloway Wright they did not agree to pay a
bonus. Section 32(1) speaks of awarding, &quot;legal &#133; costs actually
incurred  by the owner&#148;.   The agreement to pay a bonus was only
entered into in 1992.  By that time, the risk that the MTO would
not have to pay the owners&#146; costs was small.  In these
circumstances, the rationale for the agreement to pay a bonus,
particularly when periodic bills had already been rendered and
paid, is not apparent. The obligation to pay reasonable fees by
the expropriating authority  contains within it an element of
fairness on the part of the owners.  Consideration of the factors
justifying a solicitors&#146; bonus will rarely, if ever, reveal that
a bonus should be subject to reimbursement by the expropriating
authority. See: Neill, supra; Hinder v. Metropolitan Toronto
Region Conservation Authority, unreported decision of Taxing
Officer Fernandez, dated October 4, 1993. Here, the agreement to
pay a bonus was only entered into at a point in time when it
appeared likely that the owners will be reimbursed for their
legal expenses. Absent any other rationale for the agreement to
pay a bonus, the requisite element of fairness is lacking.
[19] With respect to skill of the solicitor and his degree of
success, there is no doubt that the work done by Mr. Kelly and
the other members of the firm of Soloway Wright was very
competent and that the result achieved for the owners was
substantially in excess of the MTO&#146;s initial offer. However,
these factors do not, on the facts, suffice to justify the award
of the solicitor&#146;s bonus.  A review of the reasons of the Ontario
Municipal Board  in Boyd v. Ministry of Transportation  (1995),
55 L.C.R. 246 at 248 and following indicates that the parties
agreed that the highest and best use of the land was light
industrial.  The main issue was whether a wetland that was a
buffer around the property should be taken into account.  The
provincial wetland guidelines had just come into effect four
weeks before the expropriation and the MTO took the position that
the guidelines applied.  The Board concluded that the wetland on
the property was created by an act of nuisance by the golf course
next door and that the owners would have had the right to require
the golf course to remove the blockage creating the wetland. It
followed that the land could have been developed and did not have
to be maintained as a wetland.
[20] The Board&#146;s opinion that the wetland was the result of a
nuisance by the neighbouring golf course did not result from
ingenious submissions made by Soloway Wright.  Skill and
competence are to be expected of every solicitor, and do not,
absent more, justify a bonus.   Imagination and ingenuity, the
launching pad for extraordinary skill, did not have a role to
play in achieving the result.    This factor, taken in
conjunction with the relatively low risk faced by a solicitor
engaged in an expropriation matter, lead me to  conclude that the
MTO appeal with respect to the first issue must succeed.</pre>
    <pre>2. Did the assessment officer err in principle in ordering
   payment of the cost of the report of Pigeon-Roy?
</pre>
    <pre>[21] The MTO concedes that the cost of a second appraisal report
which was not used at an arbitration with respect to compensation
for land has been recouped in other cases.  The MTO submits,
however, that inasmuch as the owners did not include the
appraisal report in their affidavit of documents they are not
entitled to compensation for it.
</pre>
    <pre>[22] Pursuant to rule 30.03(2)  of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 as am.,  an affidavit of documents lists,
in separate schedules, all documents relevant to any matter in
issue in the action. There is a continuing obligation of
disclosure. If the owners did not intend to rely on the report
and did not wish to disclose it they were nevertheless required
to disclose its existence and to list it as a privileged
document. It is not suggested that the failure to disclose the
document in issue here was the result of any oversight. The
absence of the appraisal report from the list of documents
therefore amounts to a representation that the report was not
relevant. The effect of failing to disclose a document which is
not favourable to a party&#146;s case or of failing to file an
affidavit in compliance with the rules may lead to the court
making such order as is just, pursuant to rule 30.08. In these
circumstances, it is just that no costs for the report should be
granted.</pre>
    <pre>3.   Should interest be paid on the costs awarded?</pre>
    <pre>[23] The MTO submits that no interest on costs is payable because
s. 32, which governs all substantive rights with respect to
reimbursement of the owners&#146; costs, does not state that interest
is payable. The section is silent in that regard.  In support of
its position the MTO  relies on WMI Waste Management of Canada
Inc. v. Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto (1981), 34 O.R. (2d)
708 (H.C.J.) at 710-11 and Re Kimpe et al. v. Union Gas Ltd.
(1985), 51 O.R. (2d) 112 (Div. Ct.) which follows WMI.
[24] This was, in effect, the conclusion of Blair J.A. in
Northern &amp; Central Gas Corp. Ltd. v. Kidd Creek Mines Ltd.
(1988), 66 O.R. (2d) 11.  There, the Court of Appeal was asked to
determine whether an award of the Ontario Energy Board, filed
with the registrar of the Supreme Court and accordingly
enforceable as an order of that court, could attract post-
judgment interest under what was then s.139(1) of the Courts of
Justice Act, 1984, S.O. 1984, c. 11.  Section 29(1) of the
Ontario Energy Board Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 332 provided that an
order of the Board was enforceable as a court order upon it being
filed with the registrar, but the Act was itself silent on the
question of whether an order so filed could attract post-judgment
interest.
[25] For the court, Blair J.A. held that such an order did indeed
attract post-judgment interest under the Courts of Justice Act.
In so holding, he distinguished the holding in WMI and Kimpe on
two grounds.  First, he held that the ratio in WMI turned on the
court&#146;s interpretation of the Expropriations Act as a complete
code.  On the facts before him, no such interpretation was
required of the Ontario Energy Board Act.  Secondly, he held that
the decision in WMI flowed from the court&#146;s finding that the
Statutory Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 484, (the &#147;SPPA&#148;,
under which the orders of the Land Compensation Board (the
predecessor of the OMB in expropriation matters) were then made
enforceable as orders of the court, was procedural rather than
substantive in nature.  In Blair J.A.&#146;s opinion, the provisions
of the Courts of Justice Act could not be said to be merely
procedural, but in fact conferred substantive rights; see p. 16.
[26] In my opinion, the reasoning of Blair J.A. is correct and
must be preferred over that developed in WMI.  Although the
Expropriations Act is undoubtedly, as stated by Callaghan J. in
WMI, a complete code, the fact remains that the Courts of Justice
Act is not simply a procedural enactment, but does confer
substantive rights.  As stated by Blair J.A. at p. 16, &#147;[t]he
fact that the right [to prejudgment interest] is set out in a
statute which deals mainly, but certainly not entirely, with
procedural matters does not detract from its substantive effect.&#148;
Amongst these substantive rights is included the right of a party
to seek post-judgment interest on an award made by a statutory
tribunal when such award has been made enforceable by the courts.
[27] Assuming, without deciding, that WMI was correct in its
categorizing the SPPA as procedural in nature, subsequent
amendments to the Expropriations Act have rendered this decision
of little precedential value when considering the Expropriations
Act.  Prior to 1983, orders of the Land Compensation Board were
enforceable as court orders under s.19 of the SPPA.  However,
pursuant to S.O. 1983, c. 47, the Expropriations Act was amended
so as to replace the Land Compensation Board by the Ontario
Municipal Board.  Pursuant to s.86(1) of the Ontario Municipal
Board Act, orders of the Ontario Municipal Board are enforceable
under the Courts of Justice Act, rather than the SPPA.
Accordingly, following Blair J.A. in Northern &amp; Central Gas Ltd.,
an Ontario Municipal Board order so enforced may attract post-
judgment interest under that statute.
[28] The owners&#146; position is that a copy of any decision made by
the Board may be filed with the superior court and enforced as a
judgment, pursuant to s. 86(1) of the Ontario Municipal Board
Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. O.28, as am.,, and that a judgment attracts
interest until it is paid, pursuant to  s. 129(1) of Courts of
Justice Act.4
[29] The MTO&#146;s response is that these provisions create a
conflict with s.32 of the Expropriations Act,  and that s. 2 of
the Expropriations Act states that in the event of a conflict the
Act prevails5. Hence, no interest is payable.  In my opinion,
however, no conflict arises simply because s. 32 is silent on the
matter of interest.  The award cannot be enforceable as a
judgment in some respects and not others.  Inasmuch as the award
of costs is enforceable as a judgment, everything, including the
payment of interest on costs, follows.  Accordingly, this ground
of appeal is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>4.   The Cross-Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[30] The owners submit that the assessment officer erred in not
allowing Mr. Kelly&#146;s normal hourly rate as governed by s. 32(1)
of the Expropriations Act for preparation and attendance at the
assessment hearing and further erred in assessing the amount
according to the limits imposed under item #28 of Tariff A of the
Rules of Civil Procedure for Mr. Kelly&#146;s preparation and
attendance at the assessment hearing.
[31] The assessment officer did not err.  At the assessment
hearing Mr. Kelly was a witness.  The assessment officer arrived
at a sensible compromise by treating Mr. Kelly as an expert
witness and increasing the tariff to $2000 a day to cover his
preparation time.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION
</pre>
    <pre>[32] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal by the MTO
from the order of Métivier J. dated December 16, 1997 by:
     </pre>
    <pre>     a)   Reducing the costs payable to the claimants by the sum of
        $32,100 being the amount of the performance bonus; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     b)   setting aside the certificates of the assessment officer and
        reducing the costs payable to the claimants by the sum of
        $5952.68 on account of the fees of Pigeon-Roy.</pre>
    <pre>[33] In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal and the
cross-appeal.
[34] The MTO has been substantially successful on this appeal. I
would award 2/3 of the costs of this appeal, as well as the costs
of the cross-appeal, to the MTO.</pre>

    <pre>_______________________________
1 For ease of reference s. 32(1) states:</pre>
    <pre>          Where the amount to which an owner is
          entitled upon an expropriation or claim for
          injurious affection is determined by the
          Board and the amount awarded by the Board is
          85 per cent , or more, of the amount offered
          by the statutory authority, the Board shall
          make an order directing the statutory
          authority to pay the reasonable legal,
          appraisal and other costs actually incurred
          by the owner for the purposes of determining
          the compensation payable, and may fix the
          costs in a lump sum or may order that the
          determination of the amount of such costs be
          referred to an assessment officer who shall
          assess and allow the costs in accordance with
          this subsection and the tariffs and rules
          prescribed under clause 44(d).</pre>
    <pre>There is no issue that the amount awarded by the Ontario
Municipal Board was more than 85% of the initial amount offered
by the statutory authority.
2 The claim by the owners for compensation for their property is
reported at (1995), 55 L.C.R. 246 (O.M.B.), and I will make
further reference to the background of the litigation only in so
far as it is necessary to deal with this appeal.
3 In Neill, the Board and the B.C.S.C. both held that, absent
such risks, an award of costs on a contingency fee basis could
not be made.   Solicitor&#146;s costs on a contingency basis could not
be said to be reasonable, given the relatively minimal nature and
extent of a solicitor&#146;s risk .  The same principle applies to the
question of solicitors&#146; bonuses.
4 Section 86(1) provides as follows:</pre>
    <pre>A certified copy of any order of decision made by the Board under
this Act or any general or special Act may be filed with the
Ontario Court (General Division), and thereupon becomes and is
enforceable as a judgment or order of the Ontario Court (General
Division) to the same effect, but the order or decision may
