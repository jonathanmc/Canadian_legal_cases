    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an  application for bail pending  appeal  from  a
conviction  for  2nd degree murder. On October  14,  1992,  Donna
Hunter  was  murdered and her body found some days later  in  her
apartment.  The  evidence  against  the  applicant  was  entirely
circumstantial. No forensic evidence connected him to the  crime,
no  witness  gave direct evidence concerning the crime,  and  the
applicant made no inculpatory statements. The applicant  and  Ms.
Hunter  had  just  ended a relationship and  the  thrust  of  the
Crown&#146;s   evidence  related  to  motive,  opportunity,  and   the
applicant  being  seen in Ms. Hunter&#146;s apartment  complex  at  or
about  the time of the murder. There was also evidence introduced
as  to  the  conduct  of  the applicant  going  to  similar  fact
circumstances and consciousness of guilt.
[2]  The applicant appealed his conviction and the Crown cross-
appealed against the parole ineligibility period of 10 years.
[3]  Counsel for the applicant stated that he did not bring an
earlier bail application because he did not feel be could justify
such an order on an appeal from a murder conviction armed only
with trial counsel&#146;s opinion in support of a Legal Aid
application. He said he needed the transcripts of evidence and
only recently acquired sufficient pieces of transcript to provide
a foundation for his argument on the merits of the appeal.
[4]  The history concerning the production of transcript now
becomes a factor in the bail application itself, reflecting, as
it does, on the administration of justice.
[5]  Most of the 75-day-trial was recorded in shorthand by the
reporter Brian Keeley. A transcript was ordered in January 1996
at an estimated cost of $37,800.00.
[6]  Over the course of the next year and a half Mr. Keeley
inveigled out of counsel for the applicant $35,800.00 without
apparently producing any transcript.
[7]   By  order of October 28, 1997, Finlayson J.A. directed  Mr.
Keeley  to hand over to Eya Greenland, Acting Manager of Judicial
Administration  and  Court Reporting, all his  notes,  tapes  and
transcripts  and  to  co-operate  with  Ms.  Greenland   in   the
preparation of the transcript.
[8]  That order failed to produce the expected result. In June of
1999 Ms. Greenland reported that Mr. Keeley had co-operated at
the beginning, but then moved to Ottawa, his telephone was
disconnected, and she was unable to contact him thereafter. She
and her staff had produced transcripts for about 38 days but the
shorthand notes for the remaining 37 days were indecipherable.
[9]  It was at this point that the bail application was launched,
returnable before Labrosse J.A. on July 9th, 1999. The applicant
wished to proceed on the merits but the application was adjourned
to July 15th with a direction that Mr. Keeley attend. He appeared
under subpoena before Weiler J.A. and was examined under oath,
admitting that he had extracted payment without performing and
giving assurances of future co-operation. Weiler J.A. ordered
that he dictate tapes at the rate of one trial day every two days
and adjourned the bail application to September 10th, again over
the objection of the applicant. It was agreed that Ms. Minardi,
who replaced Ms. Greenland, would see to transcribing from the
tapes and provide transcripts to the applicant&#146;s counsel when
each was completed.
[10] As of September 10th, and the return of this application
before me, no transcripts have been delivered to Mr. Lockyer and
Mr. Keeley has dictated tapes for only 11 days of the 17 or 18
that should have been done under the schedule in the order of
Weiler J.A. A telephone discussion between counsel and Ms.
Minardi suggests that her failure to deliver transcripts, as
completed, was an oversight which would be corrected.
[11] The Crown did not ask for a further adjournment and the
application was argued on the merits.
[12]  If this appeal had been from a less serious conviction than
a  homicide there would be little doubt as to the outcome of this
application. The report from the institution indicates  that  the
applicant  has been a model prisoner, he has the full support  of
his  family,  and his employment at Canada Post awaits  him  upon
release.  The Crown made no comment in argument on these factors.
Nor does the Crown argue that the appeal grounds are frivolous  &#150;
only that they are less impressive than as opined by Mr. Lockyer.
The  thrust  of  Mr. Campbell&#146;s argument was that  the  applicant
failed  to meet the high onus imposed upon a person convicted  of
such  a  serious crime as murder to overcome the public  interest
factor  in  favour  of  enforcement of the penalty,  rather  than
release  pending  review. Reference was made to R.  v.  Farinacci
(1993),  86 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.), where this court reviewed
and approved of previous authorities stating that in appeals from
conviction  for such serious crimes as murder the appellant  must
show  something  more than that the appeal is not  frivolous  and
that he will surrender prior to the hearing. Otherwise the public
confidence  in  the  enforcement of  the  criminal  law  will  be
undermined. On the other hand, it was recognized that there  will
be  cases  where  the appeal hearing is so long delayed  and  the
probability of success so strong that it would be contrary to the
public interest to refuse a release.
[13] Arbour J.A. stated at p. 48-49:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    There may have been a time when appellate delays were
          so short that bail pending appeal could safely be denied, save in
          exceptional circumstances, without rendering the appeal illusory.
          Such is no longer the case. In both civil and criminal cases,
          appellate court judges are often required to balance two
          competing principles of justice: reviewability and
          enforceability. Ideally, judgments should be reviewed before they
          have been enforced. When this is not possible, an interim regime
          may need to be put in place which must be sensitive to a
          multitude of factors including the anticipated time required for
          the appeal to be decided and the possibility of irreparable and
          unjustifiable harm being done in the interval. This is largely
          what the public interest requires be considered in the
          determination of entitlement to bail pending appeal. This is what
          appellate judges do, sitting alone or on a review panel; this is
          what appellate judges have always understood their mandate to be.
          Any difference of opinion as to whether an individual applicant
          should or should not be granted bail merely reflects a different
          judgment in the application of the legal standard to the facts.
          It does not suggest that there is no discernable standard to be
          applied.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Respecting  delay, the most optimistic projection  is  that
this  appeal  will not be heard before the summer  of  2000  and,
given  past performance and the current failure of Mr. Keeley  to
respond in full to two court orders, the realistic projection  is
probably  November  or  December 2000.  Even  this  assumes  that
accurate transcripts are forthcoming from what others have  found
to be unintelligible shorthand notes. Thus, at best the applicant
will  serve 5 years of his sentence before review by this  court,
and  at  worst even longer. The court reporter individually,  and
the  administration of justice generally, is responsible for  the
delay  and this cannot be ignored in weighing the public interest
factor.
[15] Turning to the merits, I heard a very full argument based
upon the available transcripts, but must avoid expressing
opinions which may transgress upon the full hearing before a
panel of this court. It is sufficient for present purposes to
observe that in a trial dependent solely upon circumstantial
evidence any error made as to the admission of evidence may be
significant or even critical. Here, the issues include the
admission of hypnotically aided evidence as to the applicant&#146;s
presence at the apartment building, (an issue that has not
previously been dealt with by this court). Further, there is an
issue as to  similar fact evidence that the applicant lost his
temper and banged on a door when he broke up with a previous lady
friend (a witness heard someone banging on the deceased&#146;s door in
this case, suggesting by the similar fact evidence that this was
the applicant). Evidence was admitted going to consciousness of
guilt, including such matters as not attending the deceased&#146;s
funeral, the subject of criticism (in different factual
circumstances) by the Honourable Fred Kaufman in his report on
the Commission concerning Guy Paul Morin.
[16] I refer to the above as the most provocative of points of
appeal and to illustrate that the debate will be a lively one on
legal issues, which, if decided singly or collectively in favour
of the applicant could lead to a new trial.
[17] It is my duty to balance the considerations and decide, as
best I can, what serves the public interest. The seriousness of
the crime has been overlayed with the unconscionable delay which
is still ongoing and is preventing the applicant from presenting
a legitimate argument for review of his conviction. A reasoned
and balanced public perception must be one of indignation with a
sense that compromise against the usual strictures is in order. I
have no hesitation in concluding that this applicant in these
circumstances should be released pending the hearing.
[18] It is easier to reach this conclusion knowing that the
applicant has support in the community and has been a responsible
inmate since his incarceration. Counsel have agreed to conditions
to be included in his release order, in anticipation that I might
so order, and these are appended to these reasons.
[19] An order of release will issue on those conditions.
[20]  This  case  presents  a shocking aberration  in  our  court
reporting  system,  not likely ever to be repeated.  Nonetheless,
this  extreme  example  points up  the  impact  which  the  court
reporting   system   has  upon  appellate   hearings   generally.
Preparation  of a transcript from manual recording methods  takes
time  and  delays  all  appeals, some  quite  significantly.  Any
delaying  factor  which  can be avoided is  a  detriment  to  the
administration  of justice. Modern electronic reproduction  gives
reality to instant availability of transcripts and it is my  hope
that  this  case and these comments will spur on  those  who  are
presently  experimenting with new systems and  dealing  with  the
policy issues related to a conversion.</pre>
