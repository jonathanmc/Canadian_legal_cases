    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of the second degree murder of
his eight month old son.  The trial judge imposed a parole
ineligibility period of 15 years.  The appellant now applies for
bail pending appeal.
[2]  I start with the proposition, well established in this
province, that it is not in the public interest to release a
person convicted of murdering a young child unless the appeal has
a very strong probability of succeeding.  See, for example, R. v.
Olsen (1996); R. v. Pan (1994).
[3]  This appeal is arguable, even &#147;more than arguable&#148;.  The
Crown concedes as much.  The main ground turns on whether the
trial judge properly instructed the jury on causation.  A second
ground turns on whether the trial judge, in parts of his charge,
properly instructed the jury on reasonable doubt.
[4]  I have reviewed the entire charge to the jury.  My opinion
is that although the appeal is arguable, it is not so compelling
that I should consider releasing the appellant.  The trial judge
properly charged the jury on circumstantial evidence (pp.15-16),
the theory of the defence (pp.25 and 39), accident (p.31) and
reasonable doubt (p.92).  Other parts of the charge may be
vulnerable but when read as a whole, the charge does not stand
out as so deficient that it would be in the public interest to
release the appellant.
[5]  Accordingly, the application for bail is dismissed.
