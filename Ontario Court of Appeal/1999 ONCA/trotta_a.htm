COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>

               For the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Laurie Lacelle
               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         July 29, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing
death and failing to provide the necessities of life for her 8
month old son.  She was sentenced to five years imprisonment.
She has served 13 months of her sentence.  She now applies for
bail pending appeal.
[2]  In my view, the appellant should be released pending her
appeal, provided appropriate terms and conditions are imposed.  I
grant bail for the following reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The appeal is arguable.  Mr. Borenstein&#146;s opinion
          letter demonstrates and the Crown acknowledges that the appeal
          has merit.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The public interest considerations
          applicable to Mr. Trotta differ from those
          applicable to Mrs. Trotta.  Mrs. Trotta was
          not the homicidal actor; indeed she was
          acquitted of manslaughter.  She was sentenced
          to five years imprisonment, not life.  Thus,
          I decline to apply the proposition
          (applicable to Mr. Trotta) that the appellant
          should not be released unless her appeal is
          compelling.
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The appellant&#146;s assessment team,
          who have had daily contact with her,
          recommended her release into the community on
          parole.  Her psychological risk assessment
          shows that she is a low risk for general or
          violent recidivism.  The report&#146;s
          qualification  that she remains a high risk
          for future negligent conduct if she co-habits
          with her husband and children is irrelevant
          for this application because I have denied
          her husband bail and appropriate terms can be
          imposed concerning any contact with her
          children.
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.   Although the appellant still
          apparently has little insight into her
          husband&#146;s abusive behaviour and perhaps no
          real understanding of what she did, her
          values are said to be pro-social not anti-
          social, she has no problem with drugs or
          alcohol, and she at least recognizes that she
          must continue a program of counselling.
          </pre>
    <pre>               5.   For the purpose of this application
          I discount the decision of the parole board.
          In denying parole, the board relied on the
          appellant&#146;s desire to pursue her appeal and
          consequent refusal (on the advice of her
          counsel) not to discuss the facts surrounding
          her offences.  These considerations may be
          material to the parole board, but they have
          no part to play in my decision.  Moreover,
          the board seems to have mischaracterized the
          psychological risk assessment when it stated
          that the appellant&#146;s &#147;risk of future episodes
          of criminal negligence remains high&#148;.  That
          risk remains high, according to the
          assessment team&#146;s report, only when she is in
          a relationship with her husband or another
          abuser, a qualification not noted by the
          board.
          </pre>
    <pre>               6.   Although the appellant did flee to
          Quebec with her husband, to have another
          child and avoid apprehension by the
          Children&#146;s Aid Society, I am satisfied that
          the appellant will surrender into custody
          when ordered by the court.  The appellant&#146;s
          difficulties with the law have occurred when
          she was co-habiting with her husband.  No
          cohabitation will occur pending appeal
          because Mr. Trotta remains in custody.
          </pre>
    <pre>               7.   Indeed as I view the situation, the
          real risk to the community and the real
          public interest concern would occur if both
          Mr. and Mrs. Trotta were released.  That, as
          the Crown fairly submits, would be a &#147;recipe
          for disaster&#148;.  This &#147;disaster&#148; will not
          occur because Mr. Trotta is not entitled to
          bail.
          </pre>
    <pre>               8.   I have some concern about the
          ability of the proposed sureties  to
          supervise the appellant, but on balance I do
          not think that this concern should stand in
          the way of bail.
          </pre>
    <pre>               9.   Finally, the transcripts of the
          trial are not ready and realistically this
          appeal is not likely to be argued this year.
          Because the appellant has met the statutory
          criteria for release it would be unjust that
          she remain in custody.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Accordingly, I have concluded that the appeal is not
frivolous, that the appellant will surrender into custody in
accordance with the terms of her release and that the appellant&#146;s
detention is not necessary in the public interest.  The
application is granted.  Counsel may speak to me about
appropriate terms of release.
