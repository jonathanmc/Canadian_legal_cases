    <pre>BY THE COURT:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, William Robert Tuplin, was seriously injured
in a single car accident on May 16, 1992.  The car in which he
was a passenger was not insured.  However, the appellant had his
own automobile insurance policy with Allstate Insurance Company
(&quot;Allstate&quot;).  Allstate has paid accident benefits to him in the
amount of $113,691.98.  Allstate's policy also provides for
uninsured motorist coverage to a limit of $200,000.
[2]  A motion was brought pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules of
Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, as amended, for the
determination of the following question of law:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Is Allstate entitled to deduct the amount of accident
          benefits paid to the appellant from its uninsured motorist
          coverage limit of $200,000?</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Festeryga J., by order dated April 2, 1998, determined that
Allstate could deduct the accident benefits from its uninsured
motorist coverage thereby limiting its liability to $86,308.02.
[4]  The appellant appeals against this finding.  His position is
that the accident benefits should be deducted from the total
award of damages, and that Allstate should be liable for any
remaining damages to the extent of its $200,000 limit.  It is
common ground between the parties that the appellant's damages
exceed $200,000 even after deducting the accident benefits from
the total award.
[5]  The determination of this question turns on the
interpretation of s. 265(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. I.8, and the regulations thereunder.  The same issue arose in
Gignac v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, a decision
released concurrently with these reasons.
[6]  For the reasons in Gignac, the appeal must be allowed.  The
order of Festeryga J. dated April 2, 1998 is set aside and, in
its place, an order is made answering the question in the
negative.  Allstate is not entitled to deduct the accident
benefits from its $200,000 limit.  Rather, the accident benefits
are to be deducted from the total award of damages.  The
appellant is allowed his costs of the appeal.
