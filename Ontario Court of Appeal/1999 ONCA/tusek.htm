    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by His Honour Judge Reinhardt
on November 20, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a Crown appeal from a sentence imposed upon the
respondent following his plea of guilty to aggravated assault.
Reinhardt Prov. Ct. J. imposed a sentence of two years less one
day's imprisonment and three years' probation.  The respondent
was one of four young men who were involved in a serious
altercation in a restaurant.  The trial judge dealt with all four
men and imposed sentences of different lengths depending upon
their degree of culpability.  We will return to the other
dispositions after a brief recitation of the facts.
[2]  The following summary of the facts is taken from the
appellant&#146;s factum and is conceded to be accurate by the
respondent.

               On November 21, 1997, around 7:30 p.m., Craig McGuire was
          finishing his shift at a &quot;Just Desserts&quot; restaurant in
          Scarborough, where he worked as a manager.  He was planning to
          spend the evening with his friend, Edwin Marasigan, who was
          waiting for him at a table in the restaurant.  Also present in
          the establishment, and seated at two tables near the main
          entrance, were the respondent and his three friends, Aristotle
          Paras, Cyril Wang, and Kei Choi.  There were many other patrons
          in the restaurant, mostly young people in their late teens and
          early twenties.
               At one point, Marasigan and Paras became
          involved in a very brief confrontation when
          they almost brushed against each other in the
          confined area near the washroom.  After this,
          Marasigan returned to his table where his
          friend, Craig McGuire, eventually joined him.
          The two men were waiting for other friends to
          arrive and periodically looked over towards
          the front door.  Directly in their line of
          vision were the tables occupied by the
          respondent and his three friends.
               It seems that some staring &#151; either real
          or imagined &#151; took place between Marasigan
          and McGuire, on the one hand, and the
          respondent and his friends on the other.  The
          respondent and Paras eventually approached
          Marasigan and McGuire, and the respondent may
          have said, &quot;What the fuck are you looking
          at?&quot;  As the confrontation began to heat up,
          there was some movement of tables and chairs
          and some touching or shoving, during which
          the respondent was heard to say, &quot;What the
          fuck did you touch me for?&quot;  After a bit more
          pushing and shoving, there was a break in the
          activity.  Figuring things were settling
          down, McGuire turned away from the respondent
          and his friends.
               Choi then punched Marasigan in the body
          and Marasigan punched back at him.  Choi
          grabbed a beer bottle and hit Marasigan in
          the forehead, causing a gash that later
          required four stitches.  Marasigan's eyes
          became covered by the blood from his wound
          and he could no longer see.  With the help of
          others, he went to the washroom to tend to
          his injury.
               McGuire, who was unarmed, demanded that
          the respondent and his friends leave the
          restaurant.  With his arms spread wide, he
          tried to push all four men out.  He then took
          Choi in a headlock and tried to back him
          toward the front door.
               From roughly this point forward, the
          assault on McGuire was captured on video-tape
          by means of a security camera mounted in the
          ceiling.  The respondent can be seen holding
          a knife with the blade exposed.  He waved the
          knife around and made a stabbing motion
          towards a patron and then towards a second
          person who is off camera (the trial judge
          thought this person was McGuire).  The
          respondent then went over to a stack of
          chairs near the front entrance and stood
          there for a moment.
               The trial judge found that the
          respondent could have walked out at this
          point.  But instead, he became enraged and
          started screaming and waving the knife
          around.  Knocking over the chairs, he rushed
          towards McGuire, pushed Paras out of the way
          and started stabbing McGuire in the head,
          neck, shoulders, back, and abdominal area.
          In total, the respondent stabbed McGuire 13
          times, 11 of which can be seen on the video-
          tape.  The trial judge described the sixth
          stab in these words:
               The sixth stab enters directly into the
          centre back of the head, just above where the
          spine connects to the skull.  This stab goes
          so deeply that the knife appears to be stuck,
          imbedded in the flesh and skull bone,
          slightly, above the hairline.  The pressure
          on the knife is such that Tusek has to pause
          and take ahold of the handle of the knife
          with both hands in order to remove it from
          McGuire's head.  This movement produces a
          sucking sensation, as later described by
          McGuire, and was his first indication that he
          is being stabbed.
               While the respondent was stabbing
          McGuire, Paras joined in and hit the victim
          ten times in the body with an expandable
          steel baton.  Wang, using the same kind of
          weapon, struck McGuire once in the knee.
          Choi, for his part, grabbed the victim and
          threw a single punch at him.
               The four assailants fled the scene and
          disposed of their weapons and some of their
          clothing.  The respondent dyed his hair and
          changed his hairstyle.  He did not return
          home and his whereabouts were unknown for 36
          hours.  It was only after the respondent and
          his accomplices learned that the attack had
          been caught on video-tape, and that they were
          clearly identifiable, that they consulted
          counsel and surrendered to the police.
               Craig McGuire was taken to hospital
          where he was treated for his injuries, which
          included the following: ten stab wounds to
          his head, neck, back, shoulders, and hand;
          and a punctured left lung with resulting
          internal bleeding requiring the insertion of
          a chest tube to drain blood and fluids from
          the chest cavity.
               As well, extensive testing was required
          to rule out injuries to his throat, heart,
          and major veins and arteries.  He was
          discharged after seven days but had to return
          to hospital periodically for monitoring of
          his gradual recovery.  The Crown submitted
          that Mr. McGuire's injuries were life-
          threatening and that without medical
          intervention he would have died.  The trial
          judge found that the respondent &#147;...used a
          knife in a manner that could easily have
          resulted in the death of another human being.
          Any one of the several blows that he struck
          with that knife could have had a lethal
          result.&#148;
               The other victim, Edwin Marasigan,
          received four stitches in his forehead and
          was released from hospital after a few hours.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  While most of the facts were agreed to at the guilty plea
proceedings, a hearing was held to determine certain disputed
issues.  The trial judge found that the co-accused Choi struck
the first blow by punching Marasigan in the body and that more
generally the respondent and his companions were the aggressors.
On the other hand, the Crown conceded that it could not prove
that the respondent was armed with a knife when he entered the
restaurant or that the other accused knew that the respondent was
stabbing McGuire.
[4]  As we have indicated, the trial judge imposed a sentence of
two years less one day's imprisonment and three years' probation
on the respondent.  He imposed a sentence of one year and three
years' probation on Paras, ten months' imprisonment and three
years' probation on Wang and three years' probation on Choi.  The
Crown only appeals from the sentence imposed on the respondent
and seeks the substitution of a substantial penitentiary
sentence.
[5]  In most respects, there was little to distinguish the four
accused.  All were nineteen years of age and had no prior record,
although Wang was on bail at the time for a charge of assault
causing bodily harm.  Most significantly, all four had been
refused bail pending trial and had spent a year in prison.  All
four accused had originally been charged with attempted murder
and it was only on the eve of the preliminary inquiry that Crown
counsel agreed to accept a plea to the lesser offence.
[6]  The most important distinguishing feature among the accused
was their level of culpability.  In lengthy and careful reasons,
the trial judge explained the basis upon which the various
sentences were imposed.  It is clear to us that the trial judge
took great care to assess the individual culpability and
circumstances of the four accused and then attempted to reach a
result that was not only fair to each accused but also consistent
with the other objectives of sentencing.
[7]  Crown counsel conceded that the trial judge was entitled, as
he did, to give a 2 for 1 credit for the pre-trial custody and
that accordingly, the sentence imposed upon the respondent was
the equivalent of a sentence of four years.
[8]  We see no error in principle in the trial judge&#146;s reasons.
He considered all of the appropriate circumstances and factors.
He recognized that this was a most serious offence and that the
respondent&#146;s moral culpability was very high.  On the other hand,
he was dealing with a young man with no prior criminal record.
The respondent came from a supportive family who were naturally
appalled by the respondent&#146;s involvement in this offence.  The
trial judge was satisfied that the respondent was genuinely
remorseful for his actions.  The trial judge considered that
rehabilitation was an important factor and we agree.
[9]  Where, as here, there is no error in principle and the only
issue on the Crown appeal is the quantum of sentence, this court
may interfere only where it is satisfied that the sentence
imposed is clearly unreasonable or demonstrably unfit.  In R. v.
M. (C.A.) (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.) at 374-75 Lamer
C.J.C. provided the functional underpinnings of this deferential
standard of review:

               This deferential standard of review has profound functional
          justifications. As Iacobucci J. explained in Shropshire, at para.
          46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit of presiding
          over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the
          comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to
          the crime. But in the absence of a full trial, where the offender
          has pleaded guilty to an offence and the sentencing judge has
          only enjoyed the benefit of oral and written sentencing
          submissions (as was the case in both Shropshire and this
          instance), the argument in favour of deference remains
          compelling. A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of
          advantage over an appellate judge in being able to directly
          assess the sentencing submissions of both the Crown and the
          offender. A sentencing judge also possesses the unique
          qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on
          the front lines of our criminal justice system. Perhaps most
          importantly, the sentencing judge will normally preside near or
          within the community which has suffered the consequences of the
          offender's crime. As such, the sentencing judge will have a
          strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals that
          will be &quot;just and appropriate&quot; for the protection of that
          community. The determination of a just and appropriate sentence
          is a delicate art which attempts to balance carefully the
          societal goals of sentencing against the moral blameworthiness of
          the offender and the circumstances of the offence, while at all
          times taking into account the needs and current conditions of and
          in the community. The discretion of a sentencing judge should
          thus not be interfered with lightly.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial judge in this case had all of the advantages
referred to in this passage.  He had viewed the videotape of the
offence many times during the proceedings.  He heard extensive
and lengthy submissions from counsel for all of the accused and
for the Crown.  He heard expert opinion evidence concerning the
respondent&#146;s psychological make-up and character witnesses for
the respondent and the other accused.  He also heard evidence
from one of the victims during the hearing of disputed facts.
While we also viewed the videotape during the hearing of the
appeal, that does not entitle us to substitute our opinion for
that of the trial judge.
[11] In R. v. Shropshire (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at
210, Iacobucci J. held that a sentence can be described as
unreasonable only where it falls outside an acceptable range.  On
a Crown appeal, this requires a demonstration that the sentence
was clearly or manifestly inadequate.  In an attempt to show that
this sentence was manifestly inadequate, Mr. Kelly referred us to
several cases.  However, he placed special emphasis on the
decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Allard (1990), 36
Q.A.C. 137.  This decision was also placed before the trial
judge. Allard was originally convicted of attempted murder.  On
his appeal from conviction and sentence, the Court of Appeal
substituted convictions for aggravated assault because of an
error by the trial judge with respect to the mens rea of
attempted murder.  The court reduced the sentence of nine years,
imposed at trial, to five years.  There, as here, the accused had
spent a year in pre-trial custody.  While there are many
similarities between Allard and this case, there are important
differences.  Allard stabbed two &#147;good samaritans&#148;, inflicting
permanent and debilitating injuries on one of them.  He did not
plead guilty and there was apparently no expression of remorse.
We are not satisfied that Allard or other cases to which we were
referred established a range for this offence of five years in
addition to pre-trial custody.
[12] This court has a duty to minimize disparity of sentences in
cases involving similar offences and similar offenders.  However,
in attempting to achieve uniformity, appellate courts &#147;must not
interfere with sentencing judges&#146; duty to consider all relevant
circumstances in sentencing&#148;:  R. v. Stone (1999), 134 C.C.C.
(3d) 353 (S.C.C.) at 450.  It would be wrong to assume that there
is any &#147;precise range that will apply to every case&#148;:  R. v.
Stone at p. 450, referring with approval to R. v. Archibald
(1992), 27 W.A.C. 301 (B.C.C.A.) at 304. There is a very wide
range of conduct that comes within the offence of aggravated
assault.  As Lamer C.J.C. said in R. v. M. (C.A.) at p. 567, an
appellate court may only interfere on the basis of disparity
where the sentence imposed by the trial judge is in &#147;substantial
and marked departure from the sentences customarily imposed for
similar offenders committing similar crimes&#148;.
[13] This sentence is at the very bottom of the acceptable range
and it would have been open to the trial judge to impose a
penitentiary sentence on this respondent. However, we have not
been persuaded that the sentence requires our intervention,
particularly in view of the respondent&#146;s age, his lack of prior
record, and the lengthy pre-trial custody.  In our view, the
sentence imposed in this case is not a substantial and marked
departure from sentences customarily imposed.
[14] Accordingly, while we would grant leave to appeal the
sentence, we would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
