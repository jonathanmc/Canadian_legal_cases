    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Lack J. dated June 10, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by The Regional Municipality of Durham
from the judgment of the Honourable Madam Justice Lack dated June
10, 1999 in which Tracy Tutton recovered judgment in the total
amount of $86,625 against the appellant.  The appellant was the
employer of a work crew whose admitted negligence caused the
respondent&#146;s injuries and damages in a motor vehicle accident.
The actions against the other defendants The Corporation of the
Town of Pickering, The Durham Regional Police Department and
Kiyoshi Tsui were dismissed on consent.  The only parties to this
appeal are the appellant The Regional Municipality of Durham and
the respondent Tracy Tutton.
[2]  The parties had agreed prior to trial on all matters other
than the meaning and effect of s.266(5) of the Insurance Act,
R.S.O. 1990 c. I.8.  In regard to that issue, Lack J. adopted the
decision that had earlier been made in this action by Logan J. on
a Special Case, the appeal from which was adjourned by this court
pending the conclusion of the trial of the action. The judgment
of Logan J. is reported as Tutton v. Pickering (Town) (1996), 29
O.R. (3d) 539.</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The respondent was injured in a car accident on June 19,
1991.  The accident was caused by miscommunication between a work
crew working on a street light and a police officer directing
traffic at the intersection in question.  The work crew was
employed by the appellant.  The work crew was immunized from
liability for damages by the operation of s.266(1) of the
Insurance Act in that they were &#147;persons present at the
incident&#148;. The respondent therefore sought recovery for her
damages from the appellant under the theory that the appellant,
as employer, was vicariously liable for the work crew&#146;s
negligence and was not immunized by the Insurance Act.
[4]  The only issue in this appeal relates to the significance of
s.266(5) of the Insurance Act within the framework of s.266.
Section 266 was introduced for the  purpose of significantly
limiting the right of the victim of a motor vehicle accident to
maintain a tort action against tort feasors in exchange for more
generous first party no-fault benefits.  The underlying purpose
of the legislation was to control the cost of automobile
insurance premiums: see Meyer v. Bright (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129
(C.A.). As was stated by the authors of Dreidger on the
Construction of Statutes (3rd ed. 1994) at p.248:

     When analyzing the scheme of an Act, the court tries to
     discover how the provisions or parts of the Act work together to
     give effect to a plausible and coherent plan.  It then considers
     how the provision to be interpreted can be understood in terms of
     that plan.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Section 266(1) provides that none of the owner or occupants
of an automobile or any person present at the incident are liable
for loss or damage caused by a car accident (subject to
exceptions not relevant in this case).  Section 266(2) provides
that subsection (1) does not relieve from liability anyone other
than the three groups of persons mentioned in subsection (1).
Section 266(5) provides, however, that in a proceeding where a
plaintiff cannot recover against the owner, occupants or persons
present at the incident because of the operation of subsection
(1), &#147;a defendant is not liable for damages caused by any person
who is excluded from liability because of the operation of
subsection (1) and is not liable to contribute or indemnify in
respect of such damages&#148;.
[6]  The respondent argues that the employer is vicariously
liable for the damages caused by the work crew and that the
immunity in s.266(1) does not extend to the employer.  The
appellant argues that, notwithstanding this fact, s.266(5)
provides a separate immunity which is sufficient to counter any
claim of vicarious liability.  Lack J. agreed with the respondent
and ordered judgment in the amount of $86,625 against the
appellant, finding that s.266(5) did not operate so as to provide
immunity from liability for the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[7]  A number of cases were relied upon by the respondent but I
propose to refer to only three of them.  The first is Harrison v.
Toronto Motor Car Limited and Krug, [1945] O.R. 1 (C.A.) dealing
with s.47(2) of The Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1937, c.288.
This is the former &#147;gratuitous passenger&#148; section which provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Notwithstanding the provisions of
          subsection 1, the owner or driver of a motor
          vehicle, other than a vehicle operated in the
          business of carrying passengers for
          compensation, shall not be liable for any
          loss or damage resulting from bodily injury
          to, or  the  death of any person being
          carried in, or upon, or entering or getting
          on to, or alighting from such motor vehicle.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The facts in Harrison were that Krug was the owner of the
motor vehicle and his passenger was a nurse named Harrison who
was in his employ.  The driver of the car was a chauffeur named
McKenzie supplied by Toronto Motor Car through arrangements made
with Krug.  The accident giving rise to the law suit was caused
by the negligence of McKenzie.  Krug was killed and the nurse was
badly injured.  The case stands for the proposition that where an
automobile dealer supplies a driver in return for  payment by the
owner, the owner becomes the temporary master of the driver and
liable for his negligence.  In these circumstances, Harrison was
not a gratuitous passenger and her claim was not defeated by the
application of s.47(2) because that section immunized only the
owner and driver. The court stated at p.13:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The provisions now being considered,
          being directed to the liability of the owner
          and driver, should be restricted to their
          liability qua owner and qua driver, and I
          think may not bar  a right of action due to
          some other relationship.  If the appellant
          has a cause of action against her master by
          reason of the negligence of his servant,
          subs. 2 does not take it away, even though at
          the time it arose she was being carried in
          her employer&#146;s motor vehicle.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Harrison was expressly applied by the Supreme Court of
Canada in Co-operators Insurance Association v. Kearney (1964),48
D.L.R (2d) 1 (S.C.C.) at p.24 to the same gratuitous passenger
section, which was then s.50(2) of the Highway Traffic Act,
R.S.O. 1950, c.167.  Additionally, this court in Derksen
(Litigation guardian of ) v. 539938 Ontario Ltd. [1999] O.J. No.
2743 referred to Kearney and Harrison and said of Harrison at
para.8 that it had survived some 35 years without the
intervention of the legislature and must be accepted.
[10] While Derkson is relied upon heavily by the respondent it
has no application to the issue in this appeal. It arose out of a
motion to determine a question of law under Rule 22.01(1) of the
Rules of Civil Procedure.  The question related to which insurer
was obliged to respond to the claim.  The factual issue was with
respect to a claim that exceeded the severity threshold provided
in the no-fault scheme and the negligence alleged was with
respect to employees of one of the parties who were not &#147;present
at the scene of the incident&#148;.  The relevant provisions of the
Insurance Act had been amended by the Insurance Statute Law
Amendment Act, S.O. 1993, c.10, s.267.1 (Bill 164) and the
equivalent of s.266(5) of the Insurance Act was not available on
the facts to the judge in appeal nor was it relied upon.
[11] Having discussed these cases, I must now comment on the
principle of &#147;vicarious liability&#148;, which is at the heart of the
respondent&#146;s claim. The principle holds one individual
responsible for the misconduct of another so that the tort of one
individual is imputed to the other.  As stated in Fleming, The
Law of Torts (9th ed. 1998), p.409:
          </pre>
    <pre>               We speak of vicarious liability when the
          law holds one person responsible for the
          misconduct of another, although he is himself
          free from personal blameworthiness or fault.
          It is therefore an instance of strict (no-
          fault) liability.</pre>
    <pre>[12] In this case, the particular relationship which forms the
basis for the vicarious liability claim is that of employer and
employee.  The respondent is quite right in suggesting that the
vicarious liability of the employer is not derivative in that an
immunization of the employee from liability, by statute for
example, does not automatically immunize the employer from
vicarious liability.  This is the principle for which both
Harrison and Kearney stand.  Namely, that statutes which immunize
specific categories of potential tort feasors from liability do
not remove the possibility of suit against those who may be
vicariously liable for the wrongful action in their capacity as
employers.
[13] The problem facing the respondent in this case, however, is
that those cases did not deal with any equivalent of s.266(5).
In this case, the employer is not relying on the immunity of its
employees from liability, but is rather asserting that s.266(5)
provides a separate immunity for other defendants and therefore
&#147;catches&#148; the vicarious liability situation.
[14] In this case, the damages caused to the plaintiff were
clearly caused by the negligence of the work crew.  The plain
meaning of s.266(5) appears to be that therefore the employer is
not liable for those damages.  In his reasons, Logan J. held that
Durham was liable despite s.266(5) because the damages that flow
from the vicarious liability are separate and distinct from the
damages that flow from the employees&#146; negligence.  With respect,
this cannot be the case.  The theory behind vicarious liability
is that the tort of the employee is imputed to the employer and
that the employer is therefore liable for the employee&#146;s unlawful
action; it is not that the employer itself has committed any
wrong.  The damage is caused by the employee and is imputed to
the employer for sound policy reasons, such as provision for an
adequate and just remedy, and deterrence of future harm: Bazley
v. Curry (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 45 (S.C.C.).  Therefore, where
there is no suggestion that the damages are anything other than
those caused by the employee, the only question is who is to be
liable for them.  By enacting s.266(5), the Legislature has
decided that no defendant is to held liable for these particular
damages.
[15] Any doubt as to this interpretation is, in my opinion,
removed when one considers the purpose of the statutory
provision, as explained by this court in Meyer v. Bright, supra
(at p.134):
          </pre>
    <pre>               In our view, the Ontario legislature
          enacted s.266 and other related amendments to
          the Act for the purpose of significantly
          limiting the right of the victim of a motor
          vehicle accident to maintain a tort action
          against the tortfeasor.  The scheme of
          compensation provides for an exchange of
          rights wherein the accident victim loses the
          right to sue unless coming within the
          statutory exemptions, but receives more
          generous first-party benefits, regardless of
          fault, from his or her own insurer. The
          legislation appears designed to control the
          cost of automobile insurance premiums to the
          consumer by eliminating some tort claims.</pre>
    <pre>[16] With this purpose in mind, it makes even more sense to
interpret s.266(5) in the way that it was written rather than to
import to it a meaning which flies in the face of its express
wording.
[17] Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would allow the
appeal, set aside the judgment of Lack J. and enter judgment
dismissing the respondent&#146;s claim with costs.  The appellant
should have its costs here and below.
