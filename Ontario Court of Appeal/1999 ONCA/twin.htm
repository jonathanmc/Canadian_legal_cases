    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  For the purposes of this appeal, it is unnecessary to decide</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">whether Ontario, having chosen, in its capacity as owner of the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">project, to use the bid depository process, owed a duty of care</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to subcontractors such as Twin City to take reasonable steps to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">ensure the integrity of the bid depository process.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  Assuming that such a duty existed, either generally as a</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">result of using the bid depository process or on the specific</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">facts of this case, we are satisfied that in taking the steps it</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">did, Ontario complied with this duty.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  Contrary to the views expressed by the trial judge, in order</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to fulfil its obligation Ontario was not required to investigate</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">or adjudicate the complex legal and factual issues arising out of</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the dispute between Bradsil and Twin City. Nor, in our opinion,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">was Ontario obliged to mediate the dispute between Bradsil and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Twin City with a view to working out a solution acceptable to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">both parties.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  What Ontario did do was to require Bradsil to try to work</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">out an agreement with Twin City, failing which Bradsil could</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">replace Twin City with one of the subcontractors that had bid on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the project at a price not less than that submitted by Twin City.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  In our opinion, this was a reasonable response designed to</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">preserve the integrity of the bid depository process. It sought</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to overcome the mischief of bid-shopping by precluding Bradsil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">from entering a new subcontract at a price lower than that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submitted by Twin City. This measure effectively removed any</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">incentive on the part of a general contractor, such as Bradsil,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">to  circumvent the rules governing the bidding process.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  The trial judge was also of the view that Ontario was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">negligent in failing to ensure Bradsil’s compliance with the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">condition that the new subcontract price not be less than that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submitted by Twin City. With respect, we disagree.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Much as it would have been preferable for Ontario to follow</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">up with Bradsil, in our opinion, it was not obliged to do so.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Ontario was entitled to rely upon Bradsil’s unqualified assurance</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">that the new subcontract price would not be less than the price</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">submitted by Twin City. To the extent, if any, that Bradsil</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">breached this condition, Ontario may have been justified in</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">reducing the amount it was obliged to pay Bradsil under the</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">contract. This, however, was a matter between Ontario and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bradsil. It had nothing to do with Twin City.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Finally, we take issue with the trial judge’s finding that</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Bradsil’s initial tender was informal and as such, it should have</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">been disqualified.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  On its face, Bradsil’s tender was unqualified. The problem</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">of Bradsil’s alleged duplicity was only brought to light after</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">the closing date for tenders had passed. To say that Ontario</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">should, at that point, have disqualified the bid as informal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">would have required Ontario to become embroiled in the legal and</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">factual dispute between Bradsil and Twin City, something it was</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">not required to do.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] In sum, we have not been persuaded that there was any basis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">upon which Ontario could be found liable to Twin City.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment is set aside,</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">and in its place judgment is granted dismissing Twin City’s claim</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">against Ontario.

</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Ontario is entitled to its costs, both at trial and on</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">appeal.</font></pre></td>
