    <pre>               Brian H. Greenspan, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         November 17, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Ormston J. on April 7, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   The Crown at trial did not take issue with a sentence of
eighteen months.  The issue before the trial judge was whether
the sentence should be served in the community or in custody.  In
imposing a conditional sentence, the trial judge gave careful and
detailed reasons in which he canvassed the relevant authorities
and the relevant sentencing principles.  He imposed onerous
restrictions, which included house arrest for the first six
months.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On appeal, the Crown makes two arguments in support of his
submission that we should impose a custodial sentence: first,
that the trial judge erred in principle in one part of his
reasons; and, second, that a conditional sentence is demonstrably
unfit.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We do not agree with either submission.  Read in context, we
do not think that the trial judge erred in principle in saying:
&#147;This is not a well planned scheme designed with larceny in mind.
He always intended to pay the credit union back when he made his
big score.&#148;  The trial judge, instead, was simply concluding that
the respondent had not chosen his victim and that he always
intended to pay the credit union.  From his reasons, the trial
judge was well aware that the respondent, motivated by greed, had
planned his fraudulent scheme over a long period of time.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  We are also not persuaded that we should interfere with the
conditional sentence imposed by the trial judge on the ground it
is demonstrably unfit.  Although this case may well have merited
a custodial term, bearing in mind the deference to be accorded to
the trial judge, his reasons, reflecting the many mitigating
circumstances of the offender, and the appropriately restrictive
conditions he imposed, we are not persuaded that the sentence was
demonstrably unfit.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  An additional reason for deference to the trial judge is
that the respondent has served eight months of his conditional
sentence, including the period with the most restrictive
conditions on his liberty, and has completed most of the 240
hours of his community service.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Accordingly, although leave to appeal sentence is granted,
the sentence appeal is dismissed.</pre>
