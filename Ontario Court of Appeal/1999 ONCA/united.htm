    <pre>          Robert H.C. MacFarlane and Scott Pundsack, for the respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:    October 5, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Wilkins J. dated March 5, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]  In the last analysis, the respondents appear to have
conceded that the order in appeal dismissing the claims in
respect of breach of fiduciary duty and breach of contract set
out in the appellants&#146; statement of claim is too broadly drawn.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  While the evidence of a breach of one of the contracts
(NASA) is tenuous at best, there is some evidence of breaches of
other contracts.  More important, the history of the relationship
between the parties is clearly relevant to the causes of action
which survived the motion before the motions judge and it appears
to us to be inappropriate for this court to fine tune the
proceedings when the large issues are going to go to trial in any
event.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed to the extent of
restoring the two causes of action which were struck down by the
motions judge.  In all of the circumstances, we feel that the
costs of this appeal and the motion below should be reserved and
disposed of in the cause.
