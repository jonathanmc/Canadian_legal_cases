    <pre>HEARD:         August 5, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Haines J. dated February 26, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was diagnosed with breast cancer in May 1992.
Her action against the respondent is based in negligence and is
founded on the allegation that Dr. Stewart failed to correctly
interpret a mammogram on March 1, 1991. The issue in this appeal
is whether the appellant knew, or ought to have known, the facts
upon which she bases her action, more than a year before Dr.
Stewart was added as a party defendant on September 12, 1995.1
If so, her action against Dr. Stewart is prescribed and the
motions judge was correct in dismissing it. If not, or
alternatively, if this question raises a triable issue, the
motions judge erred in dismissing the action summarily, the order
must be set aside and the action allowed to proceed to trial.
[2]  The appellant takes the position that she did not have
knowledge of all the material facts necessary to found her action
until June 19, 1995 when she received a medical opinion letter
informing her that the March 1, 1991 mammogram had not been
interpreted properly by Dr. Stewart.
[3]  On the motion, counsel for the respondent submitted, as he
did before this court, that the appellant knew or ought to have
known the facts upon which she was alleging negligence in January
1993 when her counsel received the medical records.  In other
words, knowing that there were mammograms alone and that the
outcome was cancer was enough to found a cause of action in
negligence against Dr. Stewart.  He submitted, in the
alternative, that even if that knowledge was not sufficient, when
the expert report was received in July 1993 raising the issue of
the expertise of the radiologists who read the mammograms, the
appellant had all the information she required to allege
negligence against Dr. Stewart.  The motions judge agreed with
that submission.
[4]  In our view, he erred in that conclusion.  In Soper v.
Southcott (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.), this court held, at p.
744:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In some cases, a medical opinion will be necessary to know
          whether to institute an action. In other cases, it will be
          possible to know material facts without a medical opinion, and
          the medical opinion itself will simply be required as evidence in
          the litigation.  In the latter instances, the time of receipt of
          the medical opinion is immaterial to the commencement of the
          running of the limitation period.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In our view, this case falls within the first category.
Clearly, a medical opinion was necessary in order to know that
there may have been negligence by a radiologist in respect of the
mammograms.
[6]  The medical records, including the 1991 mammogram report,
did not contain all the facts necessary to found a claim in
negligence. In addition to the facts already in the knowledge of
the appellant, it was also necessary for the appellant to find
out that Dr. Stewart had made an error in her interpretation of
the March 1, 1991 mammogram. The appellant was in no position to
recognize that she had a cause of action against Dr. Stewart on
the basis of the mammogram report and other medical records
alone.
[7]  We do not agree with counsel for the respondent that this
case is indistinguishable from this court&#146;s decision in Soper v.
Southcott, supra. In that case, even before receiving the medical
reports, the plaintiff knew that she had had an infection in her
knee joint which had persisted for some time, that the infection
had flowed from the surgery performed by Dr. Southcott and that,
as expressed by her daughter, a nurse, there was a concern about
the quality of treatment received from Dr. Southcott and his
failure to treat her with antibiotics.
[8]  In this case, there was no reason to believe that the 1991
mammogram was other than non-diagnostic of cancer as had been
reported by Dr. Stewart, until the appellant was informed to the
contrary. Furthermore, it is uncontested that the appellant did
not acquire knowledge of Dr. Stewart&#146;s alleged error until the
receipt of Dr. McCurdy&#146;s report on June 19, 1995, a time well
within the year preceding the commencement of her action against
Dr. Stewart.
[9]  In this case the appellant ultimately obtained the opinion
which led her to institute the action against Dr. Stewart.  The
issue to be determined was whether, with the exercise of due
diligence and acting reasonably, the appellant ought to have
obtained that opinion by September 1994, one year prior to the
institution of the action against Dr. Stewart. As this court also
held in Soper, supra, at p. 744:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Limitation periods are not enacted to be ignored.  The
          plaintiff is required to act with due diligence in acquiring
          facts in order to be fully apprised of the material facts upon
          which a negligence or malpractice claim can be based.  This
          includes acting with diligence in requesting and receiving a
          medical opinion, if required, so as not to delay the commencement
          of the limitation period.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The case was not presented and argued in this court on the
issue of due diligence in obtaining the ultimate expert medical
report which suggested negligence by Dr. Stewart.  Therefore, the
matter must be decided by a trial judge, whether on the record
that was before Haines J. or based on any other evidence, as
determined by the parties.
[11] We note that the procedure adopted in this case, although an
attempt to be efficient, turned out to be the opposite.  A
summary judgment motion normally is out of time at the opening of
trial.  Counsel are free to proceed before the trial judge on a
limited record, if so advised, and to have a decision made by the
trial judge which may obviate the need for a further trial.
However, if they choose to proceed in that manner, they should do
so in the trial proper and not on a summary judgment motion.
That way, the appeal route is clear, the record is complete and
the question of whether there is a genuine issue that requires a
trial is removed from consideration.
[12] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the order below is set
aside and the summary judgment motion is dismissed with costs.
The action is ordered to proceed to trial, including the issue of
whether the action against Dr. Stewart is statute-barred.  The
appellant is also entitled to her costs of the appeal.</pre>
