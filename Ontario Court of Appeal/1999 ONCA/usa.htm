    <pre>On appeal, pursuant to s.19.2 of the Extradition Act, from the
order of Hawkins J. dated October 28, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>BROOKE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellant, the requesting state, appeals from the order
of  Hawkins J. staying the proceedings for the extradition of the
respondents, who are Canadian citizens.
[2]  Extradition was sought as the respondents, along with a
number of others, were indicted in the U.S. District Court for
the Middle District of Pennsylvania, with conspiracy to commit
mail fraud and the substantive offences of mail fraud and wire
fraud. A number of alleged co-conspirators made affidavits
implicating the respondents.  Hawkins J. found that the appellant
had made out a prima facie case.
[3]  But, on the evidence as to utterances of the judge who was
to try them and the prosecutor who was to prosecute them, Hawkins
J. would not commit these fugitives. He said:

     In  my  view, to commit these fugitives for surrender to  be
     tried  before a judge who has publicly threatened them  with
     the imposition of a maximum sentence before having commenced
     their trial and to be tried by a prosecutor who has publicly
     threatened them with homosexual rape (boasting at  the  same
     time  how  effective  the technique has  been)  &#147;shocks  the
     Canadian conscience&#148; and &#147;simply is not acceptable&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Hawkins J. held that, by reason of s.9(3) of the Extradition
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. E-23, as amended by (Can), c-13, s.2, he had
jurisdiction to give relief under s.24(1) of the Canadian Charter
of  Rights and Freedoms and that to surrender the respondents  to
be  so  tried  would  infringe their rights  guaranteed  by  s.7.
Hawkins J. stayed the proceedings. As to jurisdiction, he  relied
on  the judgment of Chamberland J.A. in United  States of America
v.  Cazzetta  (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 536 (Que. C.A.),  leave  to
appeal  to the Supreme Court of Canada refused December 5,  1996.
In that regard, Chamberland J.A. said at p.553: &#147;I am also of the
opinion  that,  in this context, it would be a mistake  to  limit
this  jurisdiction  solely  to  issues  concerning  his  role  in
determining the sufficiency of the evidence produced.&#148; Hawkins J.
also  relied on the judgment of Cory J. and Iacobucci  J.  as  to
Charter relief in extradition proceedings at pp. 522-3 in  United
States of America v. Dynar (1997), 115  C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.).
There, they said at pp.522-3:

               Mr. Dynar has not argued that the situation he will face in
          the United States is in any way oppressive or unacceptable.
          Indeed, before such argument could succeed, the fugitive would
          have to demonstrate that he will be subjected to egregious
          conduct that &#147;shocks the conscience and&#148; and that &#147;simply would
          be unacceptable&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   In  United States of America v. Shulman (1998), 128  C.C.C.
(3d)  475  (Ont. C.A.), the appellant was indicted  on  the  same
count   of   conspiracy  and  substantive   offences   as   these
respondents. While his appeal from committal for extradition  did
not  rely on that ground, the appellant sought to introduce fresh
evidence relating to the same conduct and utterances of the judge
and  prosecutor that these respondents rely on. He sought a  stay
of  proceedings. This court rejected the submission, holding that
the  matter  raised by the fresh evidence was a  matter  for  the
Minister of Justice to consider.
[6]  There is no basis upon which we should distinguish Shulman,
supra. There are two important principles running through the
judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada and this court regarding
the exercise of power to grant relief under s.24 of the Charter,
both before and since the amendment to s.9(3) of the Extradition
Act, which merged the function of the extradition judge and the
judge sitting on an application for habeas corpus. The first
principle is that the role of the extradition judge is a narrow
one, confined to that specified in the statute. The second is
that the court should not pre-empt the discretion residing in the
Minister of Justice to surrender the fugitive in the discharge of
our obligations under the treaty.
[7]  The role of the judge is to determine whether there is a
prima facie case that an extradition crime has been committed by
the fugitive. By the amendment to s.9(3), the judge has s.24
jurisdiction with respect to the functions that that judge is
required to perform in applying the Extradition Act. That is the
plain meaning of the words of s.9 (see United States of America
v. Kwok (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.)). In this way,
the fairness of the committal hearing is ensured. The judgment of
Cory and Iacobucci JJ. in Dynar, supra makes this clear. In my
opinion, the judge was in error in relying on the passage quoted
above as authority to stay the proceedings because he is of the
view the situation the fugitives will face in the foreign court
will be oppressive and unacceptable. I do not think the sections
confer jurisdiction to stay on the grounds stated by Cory and
Iacobucci JJ. until after the executive has made the decision to
surrender the fugitive to the requesting state, or that the
passage from their judgment, when read in its context, should be
so construed. In any event, the judge should have observed the
principle stated above and not pre-empted a decision by the
Minister. Even if he had broad s.24 jurisdiction, he should hold
his hand until the Minister has made a decision.  I would set
aside the stay.
[8]  The respondents sought to raise a number of &#147;Additional
Issues&#148; as grounds of a cross-appeal. These included: whether the
requesting state had made out a prima facie case, delay,
disclosure, and double jeopardy. We heard and rejected
submissions with respect to each of these except for the
committal for extradition of the respondents Tsioubris and
Grossman on counts 2 through 52 of the indictment. We agree with
the appellant that no committal was ordered with respect to these
counts.
[9]  In the result, leave to appeal is granted, the appeal is
allowed, the stay is set aside and the matter is remitted to the
judge for the formal issuance of warrants of committal.
