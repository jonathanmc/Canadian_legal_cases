    <pre>On appeal, pursuant to s.19.2 of the Extradition Act, from the
order of Hawkins J. dated October 28, 1997.                                                      </pre>
    <pre>                      SUPPLEMENTARY REASONS</pre>
    <pre>BROOKE J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On September 13, 1999, we released reasons for judgment in
this case.  These further reasons are to correct an error in
paragraph 8 and modify the remedy provided in paragraph 9 of
those reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  While the &#147;additional grounds&#148; referred to were raised as
cross-appeals by the respondents, and extensively dealt with in
the facta, none of the respondents pursued his cross-appeal.  It
was, therefore, error to say that those &#147;additional grounds&#148;, or
any of them, were heard and rejected.  We express no opinion on
any of them.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In the circumstances, paragraph 9 of the reasons of
September 13, 1999 is modified.  Leave to appeal is granted, the
appeal is allowed, the stay is set aside and, pursuant to the
statute, the matter is remitted to Hawkins J.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  I am indebted to counsel for promptly bringing this matter
to our attention and the manner in which they have dealt with it.</pre>
    <pre>Released: SEP 27 1999                   Signed: &#147;John W. Brooke J.A.&#148;
JWB                                       &#147;I agree: H. Krever J.A.&#148;
                                          &#147;I agree  S.T. Goudge J.A.&#148;</pre></td>
