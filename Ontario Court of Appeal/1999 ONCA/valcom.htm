</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of A. de L. Panet J. dated December 18, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants concede, and we agree, that the motions judge
was correct in striking out paragraphs 1(i) and (ii) of the
appellants&#146; amended statement of claim.
[2]  With respect to the balance of the claim, wherein the
appellants seek damages from the respondent for alleged breaches
of fiduciary and contractual obligations, the motions judge found
that the appellants were precluded from asserting those claims on
the basis of issue estoppel. In particular, he found that the
appellants were estopped from litigating the issue of the
respondent&#146;s alleged misconduct in the sale of Lanvista&#146;s assets
to ADGA because that sale was approved by Chadwick J. in
proceedings in which the appellants participated.
[3]  Having regard to the particular and somewhat unusual
circumstances of this case, we believe that the motions judge
erred in striking out the balance of the appellants&#146; claim.
[4]  Accepting, as we must for the purposes of a Rule 21
application, that the material facts pleaded by the appellants in
the amended claim are true, as against the appellants, the order
of Chadwick J., under which the respondent seeks refuge, must be
likened to a ex parte order obtained on the basis of information
from the respondent and others which the respondent knew to be
false and misleading.
[5]  The respondent takes the position that if the appellants
wished to challenge Chadwick J.&#146;s order, their remedy lay in an
appeal to this court or an application under s. 37 of the
Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the &#147;Act&#148;)
for an order reversing his decision. As it happens, the
appellants did file a notice of appeal in this court immediately
after the issuance of Chadwick J.&#146;s order, before Lanvista&#146;s
assets had been transferred to ADGA. Under s. 195 of the Act, the
filing of the notice of appeal should have resulted in an
automatic stay of Chadwick J.&#146;s order that could only be lifted
by order of this court.
[6]  In oral argument, counsel for the respondent fairly conceded
that at the time, the parties were unaware of s. 195 of the Act.
Accordingly, the appellants, acting under the mistaken belief
that they bore the onus of obtaining a stay of Chadwick J.&#146;s
order, moved before a judge of the General Division for a stay.
The application was refused and the Lanvista asset sale was
completed. While this did not foreclose the appellants from
pursuing their appeal, in the circumstances, a successful appeal
would not have provided the appellants with an effective remedy
against the respondent. The asset sale had been completed and it
could not be set aside as against an innocent third party without
notice.
[7]  In these circumstances, a basis has been made out for the
appellants to assert, at this stage, a claim for damages against
the respondent. Whether the appellants will be successful in
their claim remains to be seen. Obviously, if they are unable to
substantiate their allegations, the respondent will be at liberty
to move for summary judgment. In our view, however, in the
peculiar circumstances of this case, it would be unjust and a
triumph of form over substance to deny the appellants the
opportunity to pursue their claim against the respondent.
[8]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the order of Panet J.
is varied to give effect to these reasons.
[9]  The appellants are entitled to their costs of the motion and
the appeal.
