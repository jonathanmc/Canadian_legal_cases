</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]       The four appellants, Valentini, Paquin, Bonin and
Tepsa, were jointly tried on an indictment charging them with
conspiracies to import and traffic in narcotics. Bonin and Tepsa
were also charged with importing and trafficking in narcotics and
possession of narcotics for the purpose of trafficking. The
charges relate to activity in April through to July 1994 that
culminated in the importation of 34 pounds of cocaine having a
street value of $1.8 million. The police had been informed of the
conspiracy and they arrested Bonin and Tepsa at Pearson Airport
after they arrived from Aruba. Paquin was waiting for Bonin and
Tepsa at the airport and she was also arrested. Valentini was
arrested a short time later at a nearby hotel. The appellants
appeal from their convictions on all counts and from the
sentences imposed by Caswell J. Valentini was sentenced to
fifteen years' imprisonment, Paquin to eleven years', Bonin to
nine years' and Tepsa to seven years' imprisonment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]       The principal Crown witnesses at the trial were Alana
Marsh and William Switzer. They testified that Valentini
attempted to involve them in the conspiracy by threats. Marsh and
Switzer pretended to join the conspiracy but at the same time
they contacted the R.C.M.P. Bonin and Tepsa testified that they
too took part in the importation scheme because of threats by
Valentini. At trial they relied upon the defence of duress.
Paquin, Valentini’s common law spouse, denied any knowledge of
the conspiracy. Valentini denied any involvement in the scheme
described by Switzer and Marsh. He claimed that the conspiracy
was actually between Marsh, Switzer and one Max Stanco.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]       The grounds of appeal against conviction principally
concern the trial judge’s charge to the jury with respect to the
duress defence, the review of the evidence in support of the
various theories of the defence and the admission of certain
evidence. In the result, I would dismiss the conviction appeals,
but allow the sentence appeals. In my view, the trial judge erred
in principle and the sentences were grossly excessive.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE FACTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]       In April 1994, Marsh and Switzer traveled from Windsor
to Montreal to discuss legitimate business opportunities with
Valentini. At some point, Valentini turned the conversation to
the importing of cocaine from Aruba. Paquin was present for some,
but not all of this conversation. Later, Valentini introduced
Marsh and Switzer to Max Stanco at a bar. They saw Stanco engage
in several cocaine transactions in the bar. It does not appear
that Marsh and Switzer agreed to take part in the importing
scheme.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]       During this first visit to Montreal, Marsh also agreed
to purchase Valentini’s Cadillac. Valentini later used the debt
for this purchase and another debt for a subsequent drug
transaction to try to involve Marsh and Switzer in his drug-
importing scheme.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]       Marsh and Switzer met with Valentini again in Montreal
several weeks later. Valentini again discussed his scheme to
import cocaine from Aruba and told Marsh and Switzer to find two
couriers to bring back the drugs. Valentini also agreed to supply
cocaine to Switzer who would use his biker gang connections in
Windsor to distribute the drugs. Paquin was not present during
these discussions.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]       The next meeting of Marsh, Switzer and Valentini took
place in Toronto. On this occasion, Valentini sold Switzer a
quantity of cocaine. As a result of this transaction, Switzer
owed Valentini $5,000. While Paquin was present in Toronto with
Valentini, she denied seeing the drug transaction. Switzer and
Marsh returned to Windsor where Switzer attempted to sell the
cocaine. The cocaine was of very poor quality and Switzer
eventually refunded the money to his purchasers. Valentini,
however, insisted on payment for the cocaine and the Cadillac. He
became angry with Switzer and Marsh and insisted that they
immediately find couriers for the impending importation from
Aruba. In May 1994, Switzer and Marsh found two couriers and
Valentini bought them airline tickets.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]       On June 25th, the day before the scheduled departure,
Switzer and Marsh informed Valentini that the two couriers they
had obtained had backed out. Valentini was very angry and said
that he would send “someone from Detroit” to collect the money
and, in effect, that he could have them killed for $1,000. He
told Marsh and Switzer that they would have to take the place of
the two couriers since the cocaine was ready to be imported. They
agreed to meet with Valentini later that night at the Hard Rock
Café in Toronto.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]       Marsh and Switzer arrived at the Hard Rock Café around
10:30 p.m. Paquin was waiting for them. Valentini was not
present. Paquin said that Valentini had gone to pick up somebody
at the airport and would be returning soon. According to Marsh,
Paquin engaged in conversation that showed that she was aware of
the importing scheme and of Marsh's and Switzer's role. Switzer
did not recall any conversation concerning anything criminal at
that time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] Valentini eventually arrived at the restaurant with Max
Stanco. He told Marsh and Switzer that they would be travelling
to Aruba the next morning in place of the couriers who had backed
out. At this point, Marsh excused herself to go the washroom. She
telephoned the R.C.M.P. and advised that she would be calling
back concerning something very serious. When she returned to the
table, Marsh persuaded Valentini that Switzer should not make the
trip. She told him that she thought his long hair, several
tattoos and his criminal record would attract attention. It was
agreed that Marsh and Stanco would go instead. The five people
then went to a hotel where two rooms were rented: one for Marsh
and Switzer and another for Stanco. Valentini told Marsh that she
would be paid $20,000 for bringing two bags into Canada.
Valentini also told her that there would be another couple whom
she knew on the plane. She was not to associate with, or talk to,
them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] Once Valentini and Paquin left, Marsh and Switzer sneaked
out of the room and called the R.C.M.P. They explained the
situation and arrangements were made for Switzer to meet with the
police in the morning.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] At the same time that Valentini was attempting to enlist
couriers through Marsh and Switzer, he was also making his own
arrangements for two other couriers. On June 21, 1994, Valentini
approached the appellant, Daniel Bonin. Bonin had previously
worked for Valentini and Valentini offered him employment in a
new venture he was planning. Valentini and Bonin met again on
June 22nd to discuss this venture. Valentini offered to purchase
two tickets for a vacation to Aruba for Bonin and his then
girlfriend, the appellant Carole Tepsa, as an incentive to come
back and work for him. Bonin said that he thought Tepsa would be
able to go and they agreed to meet the following day. At this
meeting Valentini said that he had purchased the tickets but that
they would have to bring something back with them. Bonin
testified that he told Valentini that he did not want to be
involved in anything illegal but Valentini told him that he had
no choice and that if he refused he and Tepsa would be killed.
According to Bonin, Valentini told them that he had sent their
pictures to the people he was dealing with and if they backed out
now, they would all be killed. Bonin testified that he quickly
surmised that he was being asked to import drugs. He testified
that he was terrified of Valentini. The flight to Aruba was not
until June 26, 1994. Thus, on Bonin’s own evidence, he was aware,
while he was still in Toronto, that he was to bring contraband
back to Canada. He took no steps to contact the authorities.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] Bonin testified to several previous acts of violence by
Valentini. These were acts that Bonin had either witnessed or
that Valentini had told him about. This evidence was led in
support of the duress defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] On the morning of June 26th, Marsh, Switzer and Stanco met
Valentini at the airport. Paquin was standing near the ticket
counter and it was the Crown's theory that she was changing the
names on the tickets to enable Stanco and Marsh to use them.
Paquin denied any involvement in the ticket transfer. Marsh and
Switzer also saw Bonin and Tepsa at the airport.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Once in Aruba, Marsh made contact with two R.C.M.P. officers
who stated that they would assist Marsh upon her return to
Canada. Marsh signed a letter of acknowledgment that provided her
with immunity from prosecution for her assistance with the
prosecution of the conspirators. Switzer had signed a similar
letter in Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] On the third day in Aruba, Stanco provided Marsh with two
large duffel bags containing cocaine. Stanco instructed Marsh on
how to pack the bags. He drove Marsh over to the hotel where
Bonin and Tepsa were staying and gave Marsh two other duffel bags
to deliver to them. Marsh brought the bags to their room. She
testified that Bonin and Tepsa seemed to be having a good time
and they “chuckled” when she suggested they lift the bags to feel
the weight of them.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] Tepsa first found out about the importation scheme when she
overheard Bonin talking to his father on the telephone. Bonin
then told Tepsa that he was being forced to bring back drugs,
that their lives had been threatened and that they were being
watched. At Tepsa’s request, Bonin called Valentini to tell him
that they were not going through with the plan. However,
Valentini threatened them and told Bonin that they could not back
out. Two days later, Marsh arrived at their hotel room with the
drugs. Tepsa testified that she did not tell anyone because she
was too scared and believed that she was being watched.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] On July 3, 1994, Tepsa, Bonin and Marsh arrived at Toronto
airport. Marsh turned over her bags to the police. They contained
7 kilograms of cocaine. Tepsa and Bonin were directed to a
secondary examination where their bags were examined and found to
contain false bottoms. Tepsa’s bag contained 4.5 kilograms of
cocaine;  Bonin’s contained 3.5 kilograms. Bonin was questioned
by the police at the airport. An inculpatory statement that Bonin
gave to the police was excluded by the trial judge because
Bonin’s rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights and
Freedoms were violated.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] In cross-examination Bonin admitted that he could have
escaped from Valentini in Toronto prior to the departure for
Aruba. He also admitted that he could have gone to the police, or
to the Canadian consulate in Aruba, or he could have told the
airline crew on the way back to Canada or he could have told
Canada Customs or the RCMP once he was back in Canada. Bonin
testified that he was too scared to tell anyone.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Switzer attended at the airport in order to assist the
police in identifying the couriers. Paquin was also at the
airport. Switzer approached her and asked her what was going on.
Paquin was reluctant to talk and just said that she didn’t know
anything. About 20 minutes after the flight arrived, Paquin
approached Switzer and asked him if he thought everything was all
right. Switzer reassured her and asked her what he was supposed
to do when Marsh arrived. Paquin told Switzer: “we’re taking care
of it, we’ll all be going in a taxicab”, the suitcases would be
going in the taxi and they would be meeting Valentini at a hotel.
Paquin was subsequently arrested at the airport. Valentini was
arrested in the area of one of the airport hotels. The police
searched Valentini’s car and found a number of items linking him
to Stanco, including receipts for money-grams sent to Stanco at
an address in Columbia.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          THE CONVICTION APPEALS
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Valentini</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] To support his defence of duress, Bonin testified to a
number of acts of violence by Valentini which he had either
witnessed or Valentini had told him about. Trial counsel for
Valentini (who was not Mr. Koziebrocki) did not object to the
admissibility of this evidence and did not apply for a separate
trial. On appeal, Mr. Koziebrocki essentially confined his
arguments to the adequacy of the charge to the jury, although he
also suggested that the trial judge could have, on her own
motion, ordered a severance of the trials.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   Evidence of bad character</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] There is no dispute that the evidence of the prior acts of
violence was admissible on behalf of Bonin. The applicable rule
of evidence is summarized by Goodman J.A. in R. v. Kendall and
McKay (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 105 (Ont. C.A.) at 120:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The prosecution is not allowed to adduce
          evidence against an accused as to disposition
          as a matter of policy. With the exception of
          possible prejudice to a co-accused, of which
          more will be said later, there does not
          appear to be any policy reason for preventing
          an accused from adducing evidence to show the
          disposition of another person to commit the
          crime where such evidence is relevant. On the
          contrary, absent any compelling reason to the
          contrary, it is essential that as a matter of
          policy an accused be permitted to adduce by
          way of defence any relevant evidence unless
          it is excluded by some evidentiary rule.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] Goodman J.A. then considered whether the trial judge could
exclude evidence that was highly prejudicial to a co-accused. At
p. 127 he stated:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I conclude, therefore, that the trial judge
          should have admitted the evidence. Can it be
          said, however, that he was nevertheless
          entitled to exclude the evidence on the
          ground that it was highly prejudicial to [the
          co-accused]? In my opinion, he was not
          entitled to do so. As indicated previously,
          Kendall and McKay had applied for separate
          trials. The trial judge in the proper
          exercise of his discretion, refused those
          requests. Such decision was justified even
          though the accused had antagonistic defences
          and even though McKay had made voluntary
          statements to the police implicating Kendall:
          see R. v. Grondkowski and Malinowski, [1946]
          1 All E.R. 559; R. v. McNamara et al. (No. 1)
          (1981), 56 C.C.C. (2d) 193; R. v. McLeod,
          Pinnock and Farquharson (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d)
          29, 66 N.R. 309. Having been obliged to
          participate in a joint trial, Kendall was
          nevertheless entitled to make full answer and
          defence in accordance with the principles of
          fundamental justice: see Canadian Charter of
          Rights and Freedoms, s. 7 and Criminal Code
          of Canada s. 577(3) [now s. 650(3)].
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] Once evidence of Valentini's bad character was admitted, the
trial judge was required to instruct the jury concerning its
proper use. Framing a proper instruction is not without
difficulty. The policy rule that prevents the Crown from leading
evidence of an accused’s propensity for violence for the sole
purpose of proving that he is the type of person likely to have
committed the offence has no application when the evidence is
adduced by a co-accused. Goodman J.A. made this clear in Kendall
at p. 126:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It may be that the similarities were not
          sufficient to require the admission of the
          evidence as similar fact evidence. I am
          satisfied, however, that the nature of the
          Dakin evidence was such that it was relevant
          as being probative of a disposition on the
          part of McKay to commit the acts which formed
          the subject-matter of the charge against him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Accordingly, the classic direction that must be given in a
case where the prosecution is allowed to lead evidence of bad
character (e.g., R. v. D. (L.E.) (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 142
(S.C.C.) at 161-62 regarding similar fact evidence) has limited
application. In my view, where evidence of bad character is led
by a co-accused, the trial judge should, where possible, minimize
the prejudice to the accused while ensuring that the jury
understands the full force of the evidence in favour of the co-
accused. In order to best accomplish these dual purposes, the
jury must be told in clear terms the reason why the evidence has
been admitted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] The jury charge was sufficient in the circumstances of this
case to alert the jury to the proper use of the evidence without
unduly prejudicing Valentini. The trial judge only referred to
that evidence in relation to the duress defence and Bonin's and
Tepsa’s belief in the seriousness of Valentini's threats. Thus
the trial judge charged the jury as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The second ingredient, once again, is that
          the threats were of such gravity that the
          accused believed that these threats would be
          carried out. This is fairly straightforward.
          It simply requires that the circumstances
          surrounding the making of the threats be
          taken into consideration. The circumstances
          have to be such that they created in the mind
          of the accused the real belief that they
          would be carried out, removing any real
          choice from the accused and requiring him
          and/or her to carry out the acts compelled by
          the maker of the threat.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Mr. Bonin testified that he believed
          Mr. Valentini because he knew from firsthand
          knowledge the kind of people around
          Mr. Valentini. He gave some examples, you
          will recall, of Mr. Valentini's violent
          behaviour, something about a driver who was
          shorting the cash, Jacques I believe was his
          name, and Mr. Valentini beat him up. Another
          example was Mr. Bonin went to Pauly's
          sandwich café and Pauly picked him up with
          one hand and another person came at him with
          a knife and Mr. Valentini allegedly quelled
          the potential threat. Miss Tepsa said she
          believed Mr. Bonin's assertions that they
          both would be killed if she did not carry the
          duffle bag into Canada even though it was
          filled with illegal drugs. Her testimony was
          that she was never personally threatened.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] It would not have been appropriate to direct the jury that
the prior acts of violence were not admissible to show that
Valentini was the type of person likely to have committed the
offence. The prior acts of violence might well have been admitted
for that purpose, as shown in Kendall. The fact that the trial
judge did not extend the use of the evidence for that purpose
enured to Valentini’s benefit. There was little risk that the
jury would have been overwhelmed by the prior acts of violence or
diverted from the real issues in the case. The threats made by
Valentini, as testified to by Marsh, Switzer, Tepsa and Bonin in
attempt to persuade them to enter the conspiracy, were far more
significant. That evidence was an essential part of the Crown's
case and the case for the other accused. No complaint could be
made about the admission of that evidence or its use to show that
Valentini was a member and chief architect of the conspiracy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    2.   Severence of the trials</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Finally, I am not persuaded that any miscarriage of justice
was occasioned by the trial judge's failure to raise the question
of severance on her own motion. The evidence of Valentini’s
involvement in the conspiracy was overwhelming and it has not
been demonstrated that severance was necessary in the interests
of justice:  Criminal Code, s. 591(3).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Accordingly, I would dismiss Valentini’s appeal from
conviction.

of Marsh and Switzer. The trial judge warned the jury about the
danger of acting upon their evidence in accordance with R. v.
Vetrovec (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.). The appellant does
not complain about the sufficiency of that direction. Mr.
Tanovich argues, however, that the trial judge's subsequent
comments about the evidence undermined the effect of that
direction. He singled out three comments in particular:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (i)  Members of the jury, my father who was a
          noted counsel in Ontario in his day, albeit
          in civil as opposed to criminal litigation,
          would have said of a witness like Alana
          Marsh, “There is none so virtuous as the
          reformed sinner.”
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (ii) We had witness number one for the Crown,
          Alana Marsh. She was the informant… She was
          31 years old. She had short blond hair. I am
          sure you will remember, she was rather an
          attractive lady.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (iii)     With respect to Miss Marsh’s
          relationship with Miss Paquin, the two women
          did not like each other, whether Marsh was
          jealous of Paquin’s relationship with
          Valentini or for other reasons. She said in
          her evidence Paquin was working for an escort
          service and was smoking hash while pregnant.
          In my view, her recounting of the involvement
          of Paquin in the conspiracy had an air of
          reality to it. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] There is no substance to the complaint about the first and
second comments. The first comment, although somewhat dated, was
a further warning to the jury to carefully scrutinize Ms. Marsh’s
evidence. The second comment was simply reminding the jury who
the witness was. It was a technique the trial judge used with
several of the witnesses to refresh the jury’s memory. The jury
would have understood the comment in that context. For example,
she referred to one of the customs officers as the “slight blond
man with a bad sunburn”.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] The third comment is more troubling. It was virtually the
only time that the trial judge expressed an opinion about the
credibility of a witness and, in my view, it would have been
better had the trial judge not made the comment. In R. v.
Cavanagh and Donaldson, (1976), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 134 (Ont. C.A.),
at 142-3, Evans J.A. wrote:

          function by confining his attention to those
          areas which he has already instructed the
          jury belong exclusively to him. It is not
          sufficient that he pay only lip service to
          the stated divisions of responsibility. In

C.A.) at 263-266, Proulx J.A. expressed his reservations, which I
share, about the rule that “tolerates” a trial judge expressing
an opinion on the facts in the jury charge. Nevertheless, until
the matter is reconsidered by the Supreme Court of Canada, the
state of the law is accurately summarized by Proulx J.A. at p.
261:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1. It is unacceptable for a judge, in his
          charge to the jury, to express his personal
          conviction as to the guilt of the accused,
          even if he cautions the jury that they are
          not bound by his opinion.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2. A fundamental defect will result from this

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (i) were formulated forcefully and thereby
          present a risk that the jury was influenced
          by these opinions, or

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (ii) were imposed on the jury or had a

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (iii) tilted the balance in favour of the
          prosecution and thereby discredited the
          theory of the defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] In my view, the charge to the jury did not cross the line
into the realm of unacceptable comment. The trial judge warned
the jury in forceful and clear terms that they were not bound by
her comments on the facts. Moreover, it is apparent from the
course of the jury’s deliberations that they were not unduly
influenced by this comment. Well into the deliberations, the jury
asked to have repeated the trial judge’s summary of the evidence
concerning Paquin and the theory of Paquin’s defence. The trial
judge answered this question fully and fairly, without repeating
the impugned comment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] In reviewing the evidence concerning Paquin’s involvement in
the conspiracy, the trial judge referred to the meeting at the
Hard Rock Café while they were waiting for Valentini to arrive.
The trial judge, however, only referred to Marsh’s version of
that meeting. Marsh had testified that while they were waiting
for Valentini, Paquin had asked about the couriers, said that
Marsh and Switzer would be going to Aruba, and recounted a story
about an earlier importation. Trial counsel for the appellant
objected to this part of the charge and asked that the trial
judge also remind the jury that Switzer's evidence was that while
they were waiting for Valentini there was just idle conversation
and nothing was said about criminal activity. The trial judge
refused to recharge the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] There is no obligation on a trial judge to summarize all of
the evidence in her charge to the jury. Failure to refer to a
specific piece of evidence will amount to misdirection requiring
a new trial only where that item of evidence is the foundation of
the defence: R. v. Demeter (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 417 (Ont. C.A.)
at 436, affirmed on other grounds, 34 C.C.C. (2d) 137 (S.C.C.).
Switzer’s evidence about the meeting at the Hard Rock Café does
not fall into that category. Had the trial judge acceded to the
defence objection she would have had to refer to all of Switzer’s
evidence on this point. While he did testify that there was no
discussion of criminal matters in Valentini’s absence, he also
testified that once Valentini and Stanco arrived there was a very
specific discussion about the trip to Aruba, the problem with the
couriers who had backed out and the decision that only Marsh
would go because of Switzer’s appearance and criminal record.
Switzer testified that Paquin was present throughout this
conversation. In the circumstances, the failure to refer to one
aspect only of Switzer’s evidence does not constitute a
reversible error.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   The appellant’s demeanour upon arrest</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] For reasons that are not apparent to me, Crown counsel led
evidence as to Paquin’s “demeanour” when she was arrested. One of
the arresting officers, Constable Trendell, testified that Paquin
was “somewhat hostile”. No objection was taken to this evidence.
Defence counsel proceeded to conduct a lengthy and extensive
cross-examination of Trendell devoted almost entirely to the
appellant’s demeanour. Trendell really had little evidence to
give concerning Paquin. Trendell’s answer to the question in
direct examination occupies five lines of the transcript; the
cross-examination on that answer occupies twenty pages. Be that
as it may, the cross-examination was very effective and counsel
demonstrated that the “hostility” probably stemmed from the fact
that the appellant, whose first language is French, was having
difficulty understanding what the officer was telling her, that
she was attempting to exercise her right to counsel and her right
to remain silent, and from the fact that the officer called her a
“liar”. When the second arresting officer, Constable Boyd, was
called, Crown counsel led no evidence about the appellant’s
demeanour. Defence counsel, however, cross-examined Constable
Boyd extensively on the appellant’s demeanour. She drew out from
Boyd that the appellant was uncooperative and then spent ten
transcript pages eliciting details as to how and why the
appellant was uncooperative. When Paquin testified, she explained
that her hostile demeanour resulted from the fact that the
arresting officers were arrogant and not very polite.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] In reviewing the evidence, the trial judge referred to the
evidence of Trendell, Boyd, and the appellant on this point.
Counsel for the appellant now argues that Paquin was severely
prejudiced by the trial judge’s reference to this part of the
evidence and that the jury should have been told that the
appellant, by being “uncooperative”, was doing nothing more than
exercising her constitutional rights. Counsel relies upon the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Chambers (1990),
59 C.C.C. (3d) 321. In Chambers, the accused was extensively
cross-examined by Crown counsel to demonstrate that his defence
[involving someone named “Kuko”] was a recent concoction. He was
specifically asked why he did not give a statement to the police
when he was arrested or thereafter and why he had made no mention
of “Kuko”. Counsel for the accused objected to the line of
questioning and also demonstrated that in fact Chambers had
disclosed his defence several years before the trial. The trial
judge agreed that the questioning was improper and indicated that
he would charge the jury accordingly. Unfortunately, he failed to
do so. In that context, Cory J., speaking for the majority of the
court, held at pp. 342-3:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In my view, unless the Crown can establish a
          real relevance and a proper basis for their
          admission, neither the questions by the
          investigating officers nor evidence as to the
          ensuing silence of the accused should be
          admitted.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In the case at bar, the Crown agreed that the
          trial judge should have instructed the jury
          that they were to ignore both the questions
          and the answers. It can therefore be taken
          that there was no relevant basis for asking
          these questions. The questions were improper
          and the evidence inadmissible. The failure of
          the trial judge to so instruct the jury,
          pursuant to his undertaking, compounded the
          error and caused, I fear, irreparable damage
          to the defence.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Further, I am in agreement with the
          conclusion of Lambert J.A. that s.
          613(1)(b)(iii) cannot be applied to rectify
          the situation. Without a direction from the
          trial judge, I would expect that the most
          reasonable and fair-minded juror might still
          draw an inference that the appellant should
          have said something regarding Kuko to persons
          in authority at the time of his arrest or at
          least well before trial. A juror could not be
          expected to understand that in the ordinary
          course of events neither the questions nor
          the answers pertaining to situations where
          the right to silence applied should be
          admitted. In those circumstances it would be
          impossible for the Crown to establish, as it
          must, that despite the error the result must
          necessarily be the same: see Colpitts v. The
          Queen, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 146, 52 D.L.R. (2d)
          416, [1965] S.C.R. 739.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] The appellant’s case is different and, in my view, she was
not prejudiced by these parts of the charge to the jury. While it
was the Crown who opened up the issue of the appellant’s
demeanour, there was no suggestion that the appellant was under
some obligation to speak to the police. The extensive cross-
examination by trial counsel and the trial judge’s review of the
evidence made that clear. Her summary of the evidence was very
fair and, indeed, favourable to the appellant. For example, with
respect to Constable Trendell the trial judge said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          He [Trendell] said she did not volunteer any
          answers to questions concerning the events
          and he also said, I believe, that she was
          hostile in a verbal sense. It was a fairly
          long period of time until Nancy Paquin was
          afforded her rights, through no fault of
          anyone, by a French speaking legal aid
          lawyer. Constable Trendell said it was his
          practice to stop questioning a suspect when
          he knew that the suspect wanted a lawyer. He
          agreed in cross-examination finally that he
          did ask some questions concerning the
          investigation notwithstanding that it was not
          his practice. He said it was Nancy Paquin
          started a conversation and the witness
          answered back [sic]. In cross-examination, he
          finally told the Court that in fact Miss
          Paquin did volunteer some information. She
          did not have any identification and was not
          able to give him any identification. That
          seemed somewhat annoying to Constable
          Trendell.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Similarly, the treatment of Constable Boyd’s evidence was
also fair. The trial judge reminded the jury that the officer was
under a legal duty to cease asking questions once the appellant
asked to speak to counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] It may not have been necessary for the trial judge to review
this evidence. However, defence counsel at trial spent a
considerable amount of time and effort on the issue. The summary
of the evidence, as I have indicated, was fair and balanced and
referenced the fact that the appellant was exercising her rights.
In the circumstances, the trial judge was not required to do
anything further.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] In conclusion, I would dismiss Paquin's appeal from
conviction.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Bonin and Tepsa</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] The appellants Bonin and Tepsa mounted a joint defence based
on the common law defence of duress:  R. v. Ruzic (1998), 128
C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.). I will consider first the grounds of
appeal common to both appellants and then the grounds raised only
by Tepsa.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   Conspiracy and the duress defence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] The trial judge directed the jury that the duress defence
was available to the appellants for the substantive counts of
importing and trafficking in cocaine and possession of cocaine
for the purpose of trafficking. The trial judge, however,
directed the jury that the defence was not available for the
charges of conspiracy to import cocaine and conspiracy to traffic
in cocaine. The Crown concedes that this is an error, but argues
that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice was
occasioned in view of the verdicts on the two counts for which
the defence was left. In R. v. Haughton, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516 at
516-7, Sopinka J. held that in considering the application of s.
686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          the findings of the jury in the case under
          appeal may be a factor in determining what
          the hypothetical reasonable jury would have
          done, provided those findings are not tainted
          by the error. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] I agree with Crown counsel that this is a proper case for
application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code. In my view, the
jury’s rejection of the duress defence, on the counts for which
that defence was left, is untainted by the error in relation to
the conspiracy counts. The jury, having rejected that defence on
the substantive counts, would inevitably have rejected the
defence if it had been left on the conspiracy counts.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   Misdirection with respect to a safe
          avenue of escape</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] The appellants make two submissions with respect to the safe
avenue of escape element of the duress defence. They argue that
the trial judge erred in directing the jury that if there was an
“obvious” avenue of escape, the defence fails. They also argue
that the trial judge erred in suggesting that the defence failed
because the appellants could have sought assistance from the
customs officers and police in Canada upon their return from
Aruba.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] In listing the four elements of the duress defence, the
trial judge described the fourth element as:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (4)  the person must not have had an obvious
          avenue of escape from the person making the
          threats.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] The appellants submit that the issue is not whether there
was an “obvious” avenue of escape, but whether there was a “safe”
avenue of escape. This element of the common law duress defence
was explained by Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. Hibbert (1995), 99 C.C.C.
(3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at 224-28. He held that duress has the same
theoretical foundation as the necessity defence and thus, like
necessity, duress would only be available to an accused who had
no legal way out of the situation. One way to describe the “no
legal way out” element is to say that the defence is unavailable
if a safe avenue of escape was open to the accused. Thus,
Lamer C.J.C. notes at p. 225 that if the accused “could have
escaped without undue danger” the decision to commit the offence
is deemed to be voluntary, attributable to factors other than the
threats to which the accused was subjected. Lamer C.J.C.
concluded that the safe avenue of escape element was to be
determined according to an objective standard although the
personal circumstances of the accused are “relevant and important
and should be taken into account”.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] The impugned direction in this case cannot be taken in
isolation. The trial judge expanded on the avenue of escape
element in the following terms:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Finally, the fourth ingredient is that the
          accused must not have had a means of escape.
          Typically, the means of escape may mean
          flight from the maker of the treats or
          seeking assistance from the police or from
          other authorities. You should consider
          whether in the circumstances that have been
          brought forward in the evidence that you have
          heard Miss Tepsa and/or Mr. Bonin may have
          reasonably have availed herself/himself of
          the assistance of the police or other
          authorities. You must consider the knowledge
          possessed by Miss Tepsa and/or Mr. Bonin and
          whether it was such that he or she was well
          aware of the possibility of escape or seeking
          assistance from the police or other
          authorities. Again, the age, the background
          and other relevant characteristics may be
          taken into account in your finding on this
          ingredient. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] It would have been preferable had the trial judge used the
phrases “safe avenue of escape” or “escape without undue danger”.
However, I am satisfied that the failure to use that particular
formula did not constitute misdirection. It is important that the
jury understand that the defence is not available if the accused
reasonably had a legal way out of the situation. When the
directions are considered as a whole, the jury would have
understood that the duress defence failed if they could have
safely extricated themselves from the situation. As was pointed
out by Crown counsel on appeal, an avenue of escape that involved
undue danger would not have been a “reasonable” or “obvious”
avenue of escape.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] The appellants also submit that the trial judge erred in
directing the jury that the appellants could have sought
assistance from the Canadian authorities. The impugned direction
is as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Miss Tepsa and Mr. Bonin basically said that
          they were too scared to take advantage of the
          opportunities that they both acknowledged
          that they had to contact the police in
          Toronto and Aruba, Mr. Bonin, prior to the
          trip the customs people and police, on the
          aircraft to Toronto and in Toronto both the
          customs officers and police; for Miss Tepsa,
          the customs people in Aruba, on the plane, in
          Toronto, the customs people and the police.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] The appellants submit that contacting the authorities in
Toronto did not constitute a safe avenue of escape as the offence
of importation was complete prior to the appellants having the
opportunity to seek assistance from the customs agents and the
police. This submission is based on the decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in Bell v. The Queen (1983), 8 C.C.C. (3d) 97,
where McIntyre J., speaking for a majority of the court at
p. 110, held that the offence of importing narcotics under former
s. 5 of the Narcotic Control Act is complete “when the goods
enter the country”.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] Nothing turned on the technical meaning of importing in this
case and, in my view, the appellants were not prejudiced by this
part of the charge to the jury for at least two reasons. First,
this alleged error has no impact on the convictions for
trafficking and possession for the purpose of trafficking, which
are continuing offences. Second, as a matter of fact, the
appellants could have sought the assistance of the authorities
immediately upon entering the airport before they physically took
possession of the contraband. The importing offence was at least
not complete until that point:  R. v. Miller et al. (1984), 12
C.C.C. (3d) 54 (B.C.C.A.) at 82-4; Re Martin and The Queen
(1973), 11 C.C.C. (2d) 224 (Ont. H.C.J.) at 228. The fact that
neither appellant sought the assistance of the police or customs
officials even after they had taken possession of the bags
containing the drugs was compelling evidence that the reason for
completing the importation was not the lack of a safe avenue of
escape. Accordingly, I have not been persuaded that the jury was
misdirected on the duress defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">                    3.   Credibility of Alana Marsh</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] Bonin and Tepsa also submit that the trial judge improperly
undermined the warning with respect to the witness Marsh. For the
reasons given in respect of Paquin's appeal, I would not give
effect to this ground of appeal.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4.   Cross-examination of Bonin on his
          statement</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] Bonin was arrested at the airport by a customs inspector. He
asserted his right to counsel and the customs inspector left to
try and locate counsel for him. In the meantime, two police
officers entered the room where the appellant was being held and
“basically asked him why he did it?”  The appellant replied that
he did it for the money, $10,000, and that he had not been
forced. The trial judge excluded this statement because of the
infringement of the accused’s rights under s. 10(b) of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Both Bonin and Tepsa submit that
having ruled the statement inadmissible, the trial judge erred in
permitting counsel for Valentini and Crown counsel to cross-
examine Bonin on it.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] There are two aspects to the impugned cross-examination.
Counsel for Valentini cross-examined the appellant to elicit the
fact that he did not tell either customs or the police that he
had been forced to bring in the drugs, even though he was in a
place of safety by then. Bonin agreed that he had not done so and
testified that he was still afraid. Similarly, Crown counsel
cross-examined the appellant to the effect that he could have
told the customs inspector or the RCMP and that he chose not to
do so. Again, Bonin testified that he was too scared.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] The second aspect of the cross-examination of Bonin by
counsel for Valentini elicited from Bonin what he had told the
authorities. The appellant agreed with the suggestion that he
told the “customs people” that he was to be paid $10,000 to
import the drugs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] In R. v. Cook (1998), 128 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), Cory and
Iacobucci JJ., writing for a majority of the court, reviewed the
earlier decision of R. v. Calder (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.) concerning admission of evidence for a limited purpose
where that evidence has previously been excluded under s. 24(2)
of the Charter. They summarized the effect of the holding in
Calder at pp. 33-4:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          However, the decision in Calder also
          considered the broader issue. Specifically it
          considered whether a distinction should be
          drawn for the purposes of s. 24(2) where the
          Crown seeks to admit the evidence for the
          limited purpose of impeaching the accused's
          credibility on cross-examination. Sopinka J.,
          writing for the majority, conceded that it
          might be possible for the Crown to succeed in
          having evidence admitted only for the purpose
          of cross-examination that would otherwise be
          excluded, and that the Crown could seek a
          ruling to that effect, which would be made
          following a voir dire. However, he stated at
          para. 35 that this might be the case only in
          &quot;very limited&quot; and &quot;very special&quot;
          circumstances.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It is not necessary to speculate what
          &quot;special circumstances&quot; would be required to
          allow the admission of evidence for a limited
          purpose that was not otherwise admissible. In
          our view those circumstances would be very
          rare indeed. In this case, there are no
          special circumstances which would justify
          such a finding. Rather, we find that there
          should be no difference, for the purposes of
          deciding whether to exclude the evidence
          under s. 24(2), between the admission of
          evidence generally and admission for the
          limited purpose of challenging the
          credibility of the accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] Thus, it is only in “special circumstances”, which would be
“very rare indeed”, that the Crown would be entitled to have
evidence previously excluded under s. 24(2) admitted for any
purpose. Assuming that this rule applies where a co-accused seeks
to make use of evidence previously ruled inadmissible, it is my
view that the rule was not violated in this case. Neither counsel
for Valentini nor Crown counsel attempted to have the excluded
statement admitted to contradict the appellant’s testimony.
Merely asking Bonin whether he had told the police or the customs
authorities about the threats did not constitute a use of the
statement contrary to the trial judge’s ruling under s. 24(2). It
was not argued that there was any other ground for excluding this
evidence: see R. v. Crawford, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 858.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] The second aspect of the cross-examination, where counsel
for Valentini suggested to Bonin that he had told the customs
people he was to be paid $10,000 is more problematic. However, I
need not decide whether this constituted an admission of evidence
of the statement contrary to the trial judge’s ruling, since I am
satisfied that the appellant was not prejudiced by this line of
cross-examination. This cross-examination did not disclose any
information that was not already properly before the jury. Bonin
had already testified that Valentini had promised to pay him
$10,000 for bringing in the cocaine without any reference to the
statement he gave to the authorities.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] Accordingly, Bonin's appeal from conviction is dismissed.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Tepsa</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63] As I previously indicated, Tepsa also raises a number of
other grounds of appeal.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   Unreasonable verdict</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] Counsel for the appellant Tepsa argues that the convictions
for conspiracy are unreasonable. There seems to be little doubt
that Tepsa became involved in the plan to import the cocaine at a
very late stage when she and Bonin were already in Aruba.
However, it is equally clear that, although she may have been a
reluctant conspirator, there was evidence upon which the jury
could reasonably find that Tepsa agreed to import the narcotics.
In my view, the convictions for conspiracy are not unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   Cross-examination on excluded statement and pre-
trial silence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] Tepsa also gave a statement to the authorities at the
airport, which the trial judge ruled inadmissible pursuant to s.
24(2) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The appellant
submits that cross-examination by counsel for Valentini and Crown
counsel about her conduct at the airport was improper. For the
reasons given in relation to Bonin, this cross-examination did
not infringe the trial judge’s ruling under s. 24(2). The
appellant submits, however, that the cross-examination infringed
her pre-trial right to silence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] Counsel for the appellant argued that, unlike Bonin, Tepsa
did not attack her co-accused and therefore the trial judge
should not have permitted any reference to her pre-trial silence
or, at the very least, should have directed the jury that no
adverse inference could be drawn from the pre-trial silence.
Counsel relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
in R. v. Crawford.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] In my view, the cross-examination by counsel for Valentini
was not improper. Tepsa’s attack on Valentini was not as direct
or as vigorous as Bonin’s. However, she did testify that Bonin
told her about the threats from Valentini and she claimed to have
overheard some of the threats in a telephone call between
Valentini and Bonin while she and Bonin were in Aruba. In light
of that, it was open to counsel for Valentini to cross-examine
Tepsa on her failure to tell the authorities about the threats.
In R. v. Crawford, Sopinka J. held at p. 883 that an accused who
has incriminated a co-accused by his or her testimony cannot rely
on the right to silence to deprive the co-accused who is
implicated by that testimony of the right to challenge the
testimony by a full attack on the credibility of the former,
including reference to her pre-trial silence. This enables the co-
accused to dispel the evidence that implicates him. The co-
accused cannot, however, go further and ask the trier of fact to
consider the evidence of his co-accused's silence as positive
evidence of guilt on which the Crown can rely to convict. In this
case, counsel for Valentini cross-examined Tepsa on her failure
to tell the authorities about being forced to bring the narcotics
into Canada. Tepsa explained that she was scared and believed
that there were people watching her even when she was speaking to
the customs officers. In view of R. v. Crawford, the cross-
examination by counsel for Valentini was not improper.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] Moreover, in my view, the cross-examination by Crown counsel
did not infringe the rules relating to an accused’s pre-trial
silence. The impugned cross-examination was as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   When you came back to customs in Canada

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   You've heard the evidence of customs
          Inspector Coleman where he asked you

          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Yes.

          the same to you. Why didn't you tell Coleman?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   I wasn't scared of him, I was afraid of

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Ms. Tepsa, would you agree with me that

          police?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Yes, I do. I didn't realize how safe it
          could be.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[69] The cross-examination relating to the appellant’s dealings
with Inspector Coleman did not concern a time when her right to
remain silent applied. The question concerning her interaction
with the police officers was carefully worded and, in my view,
did not violate her right to silence. In any event, it did not
elicit any information that had not already been obtained through
the proper cross-examination by counsel for Valentini.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[70] As to the charge to the jury, in R. v. Crawford, at pp. 884-
85, Sopinka J. set out guidelines for the ideal charge to the
jury to deal with the problem of balancing the rights of co-
accused in this situation:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The jury should be told:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (1) that the co-accused, who has testified
          against the accused, had the right to pre-
          trial silence and not to have the exercise of
          that right used as evidence as to innocence
          or guilt;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (2) that the accused implicated by the
          evidence of the co-accused has the right to
          make full answer and defence, including the
          right to attack the credibility of the co-
          accused;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (3) that the accused, implicated by the
          evidence of the co-accused, had the right,
          therefore, to attack the credibility of the
          co-accused by reference to the latter's
          failure to disclose the evidence to the
          investigating authorities;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (4) that this evidence is not to be used as
          positive evidence on the issue of innocence
          or guilt to draw an inference of
          consciousness of guilt or otherwise;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (5) that the evidence could be used as one
          factor in determining whether the evidence of
          the co-accused is to be believed. The failure
          to make a statement prior to trial may
          reflect on the credibility of the accused or
          it may be due to other factors such as the
          effect of a caution or the advice of counsel.
          If the jury concluded that such failure was
          due to a factor that did not reflect on the
          credibility of the accused, then it must not
          be given any weight.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[71] In the particular circumstances of this case, the failure of
the trial judge to follow these guidelines did not constitute
misdirection. In Crawford, the two accused, Crawford and
Creighton, were charged with murder. Crawford did not give a
statement to the police. He testified at the joint trial that
Creighton alone had killed the deceased. Counsel for Creighton
cross-examined Crawford on his failure to make a statement to the
police and stressed that he had over a year to think about the
story that he was telling the jury for the first time. The
Supreme Court held that the cross-examination was not improper.
Crawford’s appeal was allowed, however, because of serious
misdirection as to the use to be made of this evidence in that
the jury was “clearly invited to consider the evidence of the pre-
trial silence on the issue of innocence or guilt and as
consciousness of guilt”: Crawford at p. 886.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[72] The circumstances of this case are different. In view of the
duress defence raised by Tepsa, the initial dealings with the
customs officers and the police were a necessary part of the
transaction itself. It was open to the jury to consider her
failure to seek protection from the Canadian authorities on the
viability of that defence. There was no suggestion that the jury
could use the appellant’s pre-trial silence as consciousness of
guilt and the trial judge reviewed with the jury the appellant’s
explanation for not seeking protection from the Canadian
authorities, namely, her fear of Valentini.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3.   The appellant was “compelled” to testify</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[73] Counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant was
compelled to testify as a result of Crown counsel's improper
cross-examination of Valentini. The impugned cross-examination
was as follows:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Q.   Now sir, if Mr. Bonin chooses to call
          evidence and says that you and Paquin were
          part of this conspiracy, would that be true?
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A.   Sir, Mr. Bonin with his girlfriend …
          </font></pre>

          in Aruba, got arrested taking cocaine. On the

          the right way. He was asking right question
          for Billy Switzer, Allana Marsh, when asking…</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[74] Valentini’s answer is confusing at best. There seems to be a
suggestion that counsel for Bonin was taking a different approach
at the trial than at the preliminary inquiry. However, I cannot
see any basis for interpreting the question or answer as some
suggestion that Tepsa would testify or that the question violated
her rights under s. 11(c) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4.   Duty to consider cases separately</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[75] It is apparent that while Bonin and Tepsa mounted a common
defence, the case against these two appellants was different.
Tepsa complains that the trial judge did not adequately direct
the jury to consider the two cases separately and that they could
acquit Tepsa even though they convicted Bonin. In my view, the
trial judge’s charge to the jury was adequate in this respect.
Although she did not single out Bonin and Tepsa, the trial judge
expressly directed the jury to consider the case separately
against each accused. She stated:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The fact that you, as the jury, may be
          satisfied that all of the elements of a
          particular offence may have been proven
          beyond a reasonable doubt against one accused
          does not lead to the conclusion that such
          elements have been proven against a co-
          accused. Accordingly, before you can convict
          any of the four accused of any of the five
          offences charged, you must be satisfied that
          the Crown has proven all of the elements of
          that offence against that particular accused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76] Accordingly, I would dismiss Tepsa’s appeal from conviction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE SENTENCE APPEALS</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] All four appellants appeal from the sentences imposed by
Caswell J. Valentini was sentenced to fifteen years'
imprisonment, Paquin to eleven years', Bonin to nine years' and
Tepsa to seven years' imprisonment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     Valentini</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] Valentini is now 45 years of age. He was born in Poland and
graduated from the University of Vienna. He immigrated to Canada
in 1975 and, aside from a two-year period when he lived in the
United States, he has lived here illegally under a false name. He
has a child (now 20 years of age) from a previous marriage and a
child (now four years of age) from his relationship with Paquin.
Valentini had set up a number of businesses including photography
and telemarketing enterprises in Montreal. He was arrested on
July 3, 1994 and remained in jail until sentencing on September
8, 1995 – a period of fourteen months of pre-trial custody.
During that time, he underwent surgery for cancer of the bladder.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] The trial judge found that Valentini was the “kingpin” and
chief organizer of the scheme and at least a partner of Max
Stanco. This finding was clearly open to the trial judge. In
fact, the evidence tends to show that Valentini may have been
superior to Stanco, since Stanco was sent to Columbia to arrange
for the importation of the cocaine from Columbia to Aruba and he
was in Aruba with Marsh and the other accused. Valentini
attempted to shield himself from discovery by using Paquin to
meet the airplane on the return to Canada on July 3, 1994. He
also used threats and intimidation to coerce Marsh, Switzer,
Bonin and Tepsa to remain in the conspiracy.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] With respect to each accused, the trial judge listed a
number of aggravating and mitigating factors. In respect of
Valentini, the trial judge found the appellant’s lack of a
criminal record as the only mitigating factor. Among the
aggravating factors, the trial judge listed the following:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1)   The motive for the crime was greed;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2)   The quantity and value of the cocaine
          (16 kilograms
               with a  street value of $1.8 million);
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3)   The number of people involved in the
          scheme;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4)   “Mr. Valentini has expressed no
          remorse”.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] In my view, the trial judge erred in principle in
considering lack of a demonstration of remorse as an aggravating
circumstance. In R. v. Anderson (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 523
(B.C.C.A.) at 535-36, Taylor J.A. explained the role of remorse
in sentencing:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The factor of &quot;remorse&quot; is often important.
          In so far as it might be suggested that the
          court should regard those who come before it
          in a submissive or contrite manner as
          deserving of more lenient treatment than
          those who accept their predicament with
          whatever fortitude they are able to summon,
          there would be little in this factor which
          could assist the sentencing judge. But to the
          extent that an accused person is able to
          demonstrate that he or she has, since the
          commission of a crime, come to realize the
          gravity of the conduct, and as a result has
          achieved a change in attitude or imposed some
          self-discipline which significantly reduces
          the likelihood of further offending, the
          existence of remorse in this sense obviously
          has much importance.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The capacity of human beings who have erred
          to recognize the magnitude of their
          wrongdoing, and to redeem themselves, offers
          the only possibility that those who have
          committed crimes may again become
          contributing members of the community, rather
          than its burden for the rest of their lives.
          [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82] In my view, a court must be very careful in treating lack of
remorse as an aggravating circumstance. A sincere expression of
remorse can be an important mitigating factor and can reduce the
sentence that might otherwise be imposed. Lack of remorse is not,
ordinarily, an aggravating circumstance. It should only be
considered aggravating in very unusual circumstances such as
where the accused’s attitude toward the crime demonstrates a
substantial likelihood of future dangerousness. Even then the
trial judge must be careful not to increase the sentence beyond
what is proportionate having regard to the circumstances of the
particular offence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[83] The problem with treating lack of remorse as an aggravating
factor is similar to treating the conduct of the defence as an
aggravating circumstance. In this case, the lack of remorse
appeared to rest on nothing more than the continued assertion of
innocence in the face of a guilty verdict following a trial. To
treat lack of remorse as an aggravating factor in those
circumstances comes perilously close to increasing the sentence
because the accused exercised his right to make full answer and
defence. The comments of Laycraft J.A. in R. v. Sawchyn (1981),
60 C.C.C. (2d) 200 (Alta. C.A.) at 208-210 are applicable:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Evidence of remorse, as for instance by a
          plea of guilty, will often justify reduction
          of a sentence below the level which would
          otherwise be appropriate for the offence
          committed. In my view, however, evidence of
          misconduct by an accused in the course of his
          defence cannot justify an increase in
          sentence beyond that which is appropriate for
          the offence for which he has been convicted.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Misconduct by an accused in the course of his
          defence may indirectly affect his sentence by
          negating the existence of remorse. A plea of
          leniency leading to a sentence lower than
          otherwise appropriate may fail because the
          misconduct will prove that the accused has no
          contrition for the offence committed and that
          the process of rehabilitation has not
          commenced.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          …
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It remains a valid principle that remorse, or
          indeed any other mitigating factor, justifies
          leniency; an accused who shows no remorse
          will, all other factors being equal, receive
          a higher sentence than accused who does not
          [sic]. It is also a valid principle that an
          accused is not to receive a sentence higher
          than appropriate for the offence of which he
          has been convicted because of misconduct in
          his defence. In my view, the two principles
          are not inconsistent. It is simply a fact
          that it will be much more difficult to
          perceive the existence of remorse where there
          has been misconduct in the defence. Where
          that occurs, and there is no other indication
          of remorse, an accused may lose the benefit
          of leniency arising from factors in
          mitigation. At the same time the Court must
          ensure that the resultant sentence is not
          higher than that which is appropriate for the
          offence involved. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[84] Carthy J.A. reached the same conclusion in R. v. Kozy
(1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 500 (Ont. C.A.) at 505-6:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A broad range of sources of information feed
          that assessment and the personal contact
          between judge and accused, eye to eye in the
          court-room, is bound to leave its mark. Yet,
          in terms of the administration of justice
          both the right to full answer and defence and
          the right not to be punished for a crime of
          which an accused has not been convicted point
          in the direction of ignoring the conduct of
          the defence.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          A similar conflict between these two aims of
          sentencing has been resolved in dealing with
          guilty pleas. For example, if two accused
          persons have identical backgrounds and
          identical responsibility for the crime, a
          guilty plea by one may be evidence of remorse
          and lighten an otherwise fit sentence. The
          accused who pleads not guilty and is
          convicted will not have the benefit of a plea
          of guilty as evidence of remorse and if it is
          not established on other facts (there being
          no necessary inconsistency between a plea of
          not guilty and remorse), the court should
          assess the fit sentence without mitigation on
          that account. Some disgruntled convicted
          persons may feel they have been penalized,
          rather than denied a reduction, but no one
          could sensibly argue that an increased
          sentence is justified for putting into motion
          a full trial. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[85] The trial judge’s reasons disclose that she considered the
appellant’s lack of remorse to be an aggravating factor and, like
the other aggravating factors such as the motive for the crime
and the quantity and value of the cocaine, lack of remorse was
used to increase the sentence. In view of this error in
principle, this court is required to determine the appropriate
sentence. In making this determination, I have considered, with
the consent of the Crown, the fresh evidence introduced as to the
appellant’s conduct in the penitentiary. That evidence shows that
he has taken a number of courses to upgrade his education and has
been active in assisting other inmates with their education. This
material also indicates that he will be deported from Canada upon
his release on parole.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[86] This was a very serious offence involving the importation of
a very substantial amount of cocaine. The offence required
extensive planning and included acts of coercion and intimidation
by the appellant. The appellant is a mature and well-educated
individual. His involvement and use of Nancy Paquin, a much
younger and easily manipulated person, is particularly
reprehensible. Giving the appellant credit for the equivalent of
twenty-eight months for the pre-trial custody, I would reduce
Valentini's  sentence of fifteen years' to twelve years'
imprisonment.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Paquin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[87] Sentencing Paquin poses the difficulty of determining her
role in the conspiracy. The trial judge described her role as
subsidiary to Valentini, being his “assistant”. She further found
that Paquin was “materially involved in the conspiracy” and in
particular her role at the airport was to insulate Valentini
should the authorities become involved. On the other hand, it was
unclear whether Paquin stood to gain financially from her
involvement in the conspiracy. She also seems to have been
dominated by Valentini.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[88] At the time of the trial, Paquin was 25 years of age and had
an eight month old child from her relationship with Valentini.
Until she was adopted at the age of five, Paquin was in some 19
foster homes. Paquin’s childhood was difficult notwithstanding
the best efforts of her adoptive parents. She did poorly at
school and left home at the age of 18. She has had a number of
temporary and short-term jobs. She had been a regular user of
marijuana and hashish until she became pregnant. It was only
after the arrest that she learned Valentini's real name and age.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[89] The appellant’s relationship with Valentini was a concern at
the time of sentencing. The appellant’s parents had made it clear
that she was welcome to come home with the child, provided that
she ended her relationship with Valentini. In the pre-sentence
report, the appellant is reported as saying that she would not
give up that relationship and, in fact, intended to follow
Valentini to Poland once he was deported. At the sentencing
proceedings, the appellant called a psychologist, Stanley Newman,
as a witness. Mr. Newman testified that the appellant has low
self-esteem and is very easily manipulated by others. He also
testified that Paquin was now totally focussed on the well-being
of her infant child and realized that her relationship with
Valentini was over.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[90] The trial judge found as mitigating circumstances the
appellant’s lack of a prior criminal record, her relative youth
and that she has an infant child. She found the following
aggravating circumstances:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1)   The large amount of cocaine involved;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2)   That she was not a user of cocaine and
          therefore her motive was greed;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3)   “I query her latest decision to end her
          relationship with Mr. Valentini and I suspect
          it may have a great deal to do with this
          sentencing”;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4)   That she was involved in the illicit use
          of hashish and marijuana;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          5)   There was no evidence of remorse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[91] These reasons for sentence disclose several errors in
principle. I have already dealt with the error in principle in
considering lack of remorse as an aggravating circumstance.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[92] It is unclear to me how the appellant’s professed decision
to end her relationship with Valentini is an aggravating
circumstance. If she had truly decided to end the relationship,
this could be considered a mitigating circumstance indicating an
enhanced likelihood for rehabilitation as it would remove her
from his bad influence. But even if she was uncertain whether to
end the relationship, I do not see how that can be an aggravating
circumstance. There was no convincing evidence that the
appellant’s uncertainty was a sham designed to mislead the trial
judge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[93] Finally, it was an error in principle to consider the
appellant’s former use of marijuana and hashish as an aggravating
circumstance. The appellant was not on trial for offences that
she may have committed in the past. In R. v. Roud and Roud
(1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 226 (Ont. C.A.) at 242 Brooke J.A.
discussed the permissible use of background material that tends
to show that the accused has committed other untried criminal
offences:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          [The trial judge] did not, as he must not do,
          punish the appellant for past acts, but on
          the other hand I think he properly sought to
          understand the appellant in determining the
          quantum of sentence appropriate for the
          offence of which he had been convicted by the
          jury. He had a duty to the public, and he had
          a duty to the appellant. I do not see how he
          could have discharged either without fairly
          complete information as to the appellant, his
          background and his character. [Emphasis
          added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[94] Unfortunately, by identifying the appellant’s prior drug use
as an aggravating circumstance, the trial judge is susceptible to
the criticism that she punished the appellant for past acts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[95] Having regard to these errors in principle, this court must
determine the fit sentence. The fresh evidence as to the
appellant’s progress while on bail pending appeal is of
considerable assistance. The appellant has taken important and
significant steps towards her rehabilitation. She has upgraded
her education and is looking for a permanent job. In the
meantime, she has held a number of part-time jobs and volunteered
with Clowns Without Frontiers, a non-profit organization
dedicated to improving the lives of disadvantaged children. She
has also reconciled with her parents who presently share
responsibility for the care of her child. She lived with her
parents for a period of time, but has now moved in with her
fiancée who assists in the parenting of her child. She and her
parents have also undergone counselling. It is clear from the
fresh evidence that the appellant has no intention of continuing
her relationship with Valentini.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[96] Although the appellant was found to be an active participant
in the conspiracy, what her counsel referred to as the
“situational nature” of that involvement cannot be ignored. Her
involvement stemmed from her unfortunate relationship with
Valentini who was much older and more sophisticated than her and
who took advantage of this easily manipulated individual in an
attempt to shield his own culpability. I consider this to be an
important factor even though there is no evidence of any physical
abuse by Valentini towards the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[97] The role played by the appellant in this case is similar to
the role played by the appellant Chalmers in R. v. Saulnier,
[1988] 2 W.W.R. 546 (B.C.C.A.) as described by Seaton J.A. at pp.
555-56:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Mrs. Chalmers was sentenced to seven years
          for importing 1.9 kilos (4.4 pounds) of 75
          per cent pure cocaine into Canada. We are
          told that this amount of cocaine would sell
          in bulk for $245,000 and that diluted and
          sold in grams on the street it would fetch
          approximately $1 million.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          It appears that this 35 year-old woman was
          very much under the influence of a man by the
          name of Senior with whom she lived. Senior
          and another man flew into Tacoma from Miami
          and drove in a station wagon to a place near
          Bellingham. Mrs. Chalmers drove her car down
          to meet them and they apparently exchanged
          cars. When Mrs. Chalmers was stopped in the
          station wagon in Canada, the police found the
          cocaine in 13 cylinders under the back seat.
          Senior was admited to bail pending his trial
          and absconded, leaving Mrs. Chalmers to face
          these problems alone. She has three children
          and has custody of two. They are with her
          mother.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The appellant had unrelated convictions in an
          earlier stage of her life.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          I think a proper sentence in this case would
          be five years.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[98] In view of the appellant’s lack of prior criminal record and
the significant evidence of her rehabilitation I would reduce
Paquin’s sentence from eleven years' to four years' imprisonment.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Bonin</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[99] Bonin’s role in the conspiracy is simple. He was a courier
and, on his own evidence, was to be paid $10,000. He also
involved his common-law wife, Tepsa, in the conspiracy. However,
he testified that he entered into and remained in the conspiracy
because of threats from Valentini. Those threats were the basis
of the failed duress defence. The effect of those threats on the
sentence to be imposed is an issue in this appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[100]     Bonin was 25 years of age at the time of sentencing.
His father was an alcoholic who had been physically and verbally
abusive towards the appellant and his mother. The appellant had
used marijuana in the past and used cocaine for about one year
when he was 19 years of age. He had a serious alcohol problem,
but had reduced his drinking prior to the trial. He had a Grade 8
education and was steadily employed in telemarketing since
leaving high school until his arrest. Through this employment
Bonin met Valentini. At the time of sentencing, Bonin was living
with Tepsa who was expecting their child.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[101]     The trial judge found the appellant’s lack of criminal
record and relative youth to be the only mitigating factors. She
identified the following aggravating circumstances:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1)   The amount and value of the cocaine;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2)   His continued insistence that his
          actions were caused by fear of Valentini and
          his lack of remorse;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          3)   He was being paid $10,000 and involved
          Tepsa, an innocent party;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          4)   He had many more opportunities to escape
          from the conspiracy than did Tepsa;
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          5)   “He was a user of illicit drugs, cocaine
          in the past, but not an addict. However, as a
          buyer, he was faimiliar with and part of the
          illicit world of drug trafficking. Mr. Bonin
          was more than just a simple courier. He was
          instantly suspicious that the parcels he was
          being asked to carry into Canada would
          contain drugs, which presupposes a knowledge
          of Mr. Valentini’s illicit activities. He was
          to be paid $10,000 in addition to a week’s
          vacation in Aruba, airfare to and from Aruba,
          and $1,000 spending money.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[102]     The trial judge, in considering the sentencing of
Tepsa, had earlier stated that duress, having been rejected by
the jury, should not be considered for sentencing purposes.
Accordingly, the trial judge did not make any express finding
concerning the allegations made by Bonin and Tepsa that they were
threatened by Valentini.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[103]     In my view, the trial judge’s reasons for sentence
disclose several errors in principle. As with the other
appellants, the trial judge erred in considering the appellant’s
lack of remorse as an aggravating circumstance. The misuse of
this factor is plain in Bonin’s case as the trial judge
specifically referred to the appellant’s continued insistence
that he had been subjected to duress as an aggravating factor. It
would appear that the appellant was being punished for the nature
of his defence and his continued protestation of innocence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[104]     I agree with the trial judge that the appellant could
not be sentenced as if the duress defence, having been rejected
by the jury, had been made out. However, the circumstances in
which the offences were committed were important factors in
determining the culpability and moral blameworthiness of the
appellant. The trial judge seems to have accepted that Valentini
did threaten Bonin. The evidence of threats, in any event, is
substantial. The two principal Crown witnesses testified to being
threatened by Valentini. In my view, the fact that Bonin was
threatened was a factor that had to be taken into account.
However, the fact that Bonin had many more chances to leave the
conspiracy than did Tepsa reduces the mitigating effect of the
threats by Valentini. The trial judge also accepted Marsh’s
evidence that when she delivered the suitcases with the drugs to
Bonin and Tepsa, they seemed to be amused.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[105]     I also find the trial judge’s reference to the
appellant being part of the “illicit world of drug trafficking”
very troubling. There is simply no evidence to support this
contention. The fact that the appellant was a drug user many
years earlier is not evidence that he was part of the “drug
trafficking” world. This reference by the trial judge also
suggests the same error in principle made by the trial judge in
relation to Paquin and her drug use. Finally, I fail to see any
evidence that Bonin was anything more than a drug courier. The
planning of the enterprise was between Valentini and Stanco and
to some extent Marsh and Switzer. There is no evidence that Bonin
was to share in the proceeds of the sale of the drugs or that he
would be involved in any way other than as a courier.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[106]     It therefore becomes necessary to consider the fitness
of the sentence imposed on Bonin in light of the fresh evidence.
That evidence shows that the appellant has now married Carole
Tepsa and they have three infant children all born since the
trial. Bonin has been employed while on bail pending appeal.
Taking into account Bonin’s limited role in the conspiracy, his
prior good character, and the fact that he was subject to threats
by Valentini to enter and remain in the conspiracy, I would
reduce his sentence from nine years' imprisonment to four years'
imprisonment concurrent on all the charges. Bearing in mind the
factor of the threats by Valentini, I consider this sentence to
be in line with the six- to eight-year range suggested by this
court in R. v. Cunningham (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (Ont.
C.A.). In that case this court said at pp. 546-47 that:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          we are all of the view that as a general
          rule, absent exceptional or extenuating
          circumstances, the range of sentence for
          first offender couriers who smuggle large
          amounts of cocaine into Canada for personal
          gain should be six to eight years in the
          penitentiary. In establishing such a range,
          we readily acknowledge that sentencing is not
          an exact science and that trial judges must
          retain the necessary degree of flexibility to
          do justice in individual cases. We recognize
          as well that the suggested range will often
          require the imposition of a severe penalty
          for first offenders. [Emphasis added.]</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[107]     In Cunningham, this court increased a sentence of three
years' imprisonment to five years' taking into account a period
of pre-trial custody, the accused’s guilty plea and lack of prior
record. The amount of cocaine imported by the accused was
substantial and similar to the amount imported by Bonin. The
court specifically pointed out at p. 544 that the accused in that
case was not subject to “either importuning or duress”. It is
implicit that such factors would constitute extenuating
circumstances justifying a sentence outside the six- to eight-
year range.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               Tepsa</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[108]     Tepsa was 29 years of age at the time of the trial. She
was raised by her mother who died of cancer in the year preceding
the trial. She left home at the age of 19 to live with a
boyfriend. She became a heavy user of drugs including cocaine and
LSD. However, she had been drug free for over five years prior to
the trial after taking in-patient and out-patient treatment. At
the time of trial she had been living with Bonin for one and a
half years and she was expecting their child at the time of
sentencing. The couple was living with Bonin’s mother who would
care for the child should Tepsa be incarcerated. The appellant
had a grade eleven education and had taken courses towards a
hairdresser's certificate. She had worked at various hairdressing
salons and, in the three years prior to the trial, worked as a
hairdresser in a nursing home. Mr. Newman had also interviewed
Tepsa. He described her as naïve, unsophisticated and easily
influenced by others.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[109]     At the sentence hearing, Crown counsel accepted that
Tepsa only became involved in the conspiracy when she was already
in Aruba. He described her as not being a sophisticated
individual. He also seems to have accepted that, unlike Bonin,
she was not being paid for her role in the offences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[110]     The trial judge considered as mitigating factors the
appellant’s lack of prior record, her pregnancy, her
vulnerability, her good pre-sentence report and that she did not
know that Bonin was being paid for importing the cocaine. The
trial judge listed the following aggravating circumstances:
          </font></pre>

          this Court, but she continues to insist that
          she had no other choice but to bring the
          cocaine into Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[111]     The trial judge also stated that duress should not ever
be considered, having been rejected by the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[112]     The same errors in principle that I have discussed in
relation to the other appellants were also made in relation to
Tepsa and require this court to impose a fit sentence.
Notwithstanding the large amount of cocaine imported by Tepsa, it
is my view that her circumstances are exceptional and justify a
sentence significantly outside the range set in Cunningham. She
only entered the conspiracy at a very late stage. The trial judge
seems to have accepted that her duress defence failed only
because she had a safe avenue of escape. The trial judge also
accepted that she did not expect any financial gain from her
involvement. The only explanation for her involvement is the
threats from Valentini and the influence of Bonin. In my view,
the sentence of seven years' imprisonment imposed by the trial
judge is grossly disproportionate to Tepsa’s role in the
offences. A fit sentence on the charges of importing, possession
for the purpose of trafficking and trafficking is eighteen
months' imprisonment concurrent. In view of her minimal role in
the conspiracy, I would impose a sentence of three months'
concurrent on the charges of conspiracy to import and conspiracy
to traffic.

    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Multiple convictions</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[113]     In addition to the conspiracy counts, Tepsa and Bonin
were convicted of importing, trafficking and possession for the
purpose of trafficking. All the convictions relate to the same
act of importing the narcotics into Canada from Aruba on July 3,
1994. I have some doubt that conviction for all of the three
substantive offences was proper in view of the rule against
multiple convictions. However, this question was not put in issue
on the appeal. In any event, the additional convictions would
have no bearing on the sentence. These reasons should not be
taken as an indication that all three convictions were proper in
the circumstances.
