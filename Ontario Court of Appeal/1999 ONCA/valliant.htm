      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Karam J. dated December 20, 1996
and from the jury verdict made at Timmins, Ontario.
                                </pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant asks the court to accept the reality that this
was  an  action  defended by two insurers  when  considering  the
allocation of costs awarded to the plaintiffs and others. On this
approach  we  would  look  to the respective  insurer’s  coverage
limits  and their involvement at trial to determine how  to  deal
with  an  offer  to settle and the ultimate allocation  of  costs
between the defendants.
[2]  This is not a case such as Broadhurst &amp; Ball v. American
Home Assurance  (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.) where one
defendant was represented by two insurers and the issue was
allocation of costs of defence.
[3]  This case concerns costs awarded to the plaintiffs (and
others) and the insurers involved in this appeal represent
separate defendants.
[4]  These defendants are the only parties to whom issues of
costs should be directed and whatever the suggested “realities”
of insurance coverage may suggest as background, the litigation
process would be distorted if we did not confine our application
of principles to the parties. These parties, the two defendants,
were found liable for damages on an 80/20 basis and we see no
reason that they should not bear their costs on the same ratio.
[5]  It would have been open to the trial judge to take into
account that one defendant made an offer and the other didn’t,
but it was not an error in principle to follow the split in
liability in dividing the obligation. These two insurers are, and
have been, acting independently and have presented no reason that
one can claim upon the other.
[6]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</pre>
