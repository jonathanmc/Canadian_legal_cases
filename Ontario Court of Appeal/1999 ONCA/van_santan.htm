    <pre>On appeal from the summary conviction by Leitch J., dated October
21, 1998 and, if granted, from the judgment of Pockele, J., dated
January 7, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Crown submits that the summary conviction appeal judge
exceeded her jurisdiction by substituting her opinion for that of
the trial judge.
[2]  The summary conviction appeal judge held that the trial
judge erred by not considering the question of whether Ms. Van
Santen, an angry parent, intended to confine the principal when
speaking to her in the principal&#146;s office.
[3]  The evidence is Ms. Van Santen followed the principal into
her office uninvited and shut the one door to the office behind
her. The principal asked Ms. Van Santen to open the door of her
office three times.  Ms. Van Santen refused saying she wanted to
have a private conversation. She placed herself in front of the
door and placed her arm across it. The principal said she would
call the police. Ms. Van Santen told her to go ahead.  Ms. Van
Santen said, &#147;I wasn&#146;t going to open the door until I got an
answer&#148; to a witness and similar words to the police.  These
circumstances amply justified the finding of guilt made by the
trial judge.
[4]  Although an appellate judge is entitled to re-examine and to
re-weigh the evidence to some extent, this re-examination can
only be done in the context of determining whether the verdict
was one which the trial judge could reasonably have reached.
Here, the summary conviction appeal judge substituted her own
view of the interences to be drawn from the facts and, in so
doing, exceeded her jurisdiction. The appeal is allowed and the
acquittal is set aside.
[5]  In view of the Crown&#146;s concession that the sentence imposed
by the trial judge was excessive and that a conditional discharge
would be appropriate, we would enter a finding of guilt and
impose a conditional discharge. The terms are a 6 month period of
probation during which Ms. Van Santen is directed to report to a
probation officer as soon as practicable and thereafter as and
when required and to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.
