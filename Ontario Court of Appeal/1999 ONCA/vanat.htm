               WILLIAM VANAT (Respondent)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        BROOKE, FINLAYSON and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>

    <pre>               Douglas M. Waterston, for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         August 19, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the summary conviction appeal judgment imposed by
Kruzick J. dated October 26, 1998 and, if leave be granted, from
the judgment of Atwood J. dated April 17, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge in this case proceeded on the assumption
that he could rely upon a letter from the Chief Scientist of the
Alcohol Central Forensic Laboratory as expressing the opinion
that Standard Alcohol Solution (&#147;S.A.S.&#148;) tests conducted when
the solution temperature was below 19.5° Centigrade could not be
guaranteed.
[2]  The trial judge did so because the letter was introduced
into evidence by a qualified expert on the operation of the
Breathalyzer machine used in the case.  However, the expert did
not endorse the statement in the letter by the Chief Scientist.
Indeed, she stated that: &#147;I have no scientific explanation to
support this statement&#148;.  She went further and testified that,
earlier in her practice, she had conducted S.A.S. tests on the
basis of a chart which permitted temperatures as low as 15°
Centigrade.  Her sole opinion with respect to the temperature in
question in this case was that it was &#147;low&#148;.
[3]  While it is true that the expert was also referred to a
chart issued by the manufacturers as an instruction to the
operators of the Breathalyzer machine, she did not express any
opinion with respect to the chart and was not prepared to say,
and indeed was not asked, if the &#147;low&#148; reading in the case at bar
reflected adversely on the accuracy of the Breathalyzer readings.
Accordingly, there is no opinion to the contrary as to the
accuracy of the reading in issue.  The summary conviction appeal
judge fell into the same error in dismissing the appeal.
[4]  In the result, the appeal must be allowed and the acquittal
set aside.  Since there is no evidence to the contrary in this
case, the trial judge was obliged to convict and would have done
so but for the error referred to above.
[5]  Accordingly, a conviction is entered for driving over &#147;80&#148;
and the mandatory minimum penalty of $300.00 is imposed under
s.255(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Code.
[6]  There will be a further order under s.259(1)(a) prohibiting
the appellant from operating a motor vehicle for three months.
