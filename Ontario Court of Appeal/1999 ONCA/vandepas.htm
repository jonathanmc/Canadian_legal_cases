    <pre>COUNSEL:       Patrick G. Morris
               For the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Mark Rodenburg
               For the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         September 2, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Dunn J. dated January 20, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a claim for the payment of child support and for
arrears of child support owing over a period of 11 years.  It was
heard on the basis of affidavits of the husband and wife without
any cross-examination of either.  Not surprisingly there are
unresolved conflicts respecting the conclusions to be drawn from
the evidence, including the reasons why payments were not made
and were not enforced through legal proceedings.
[2]  The reasons of the hearing judge suggest to us that he
attempted, as best he could in the circumstances, to do justice
amongst the persons involved.  Counsel have attacked virtually
every aspect of the decision but we are not persuaded that any
significant error was made, nor that we can improve upon the
result.
[3]  The appeal and cross-appeal are therefore dismissed.  No
order as to costs.</pre>
