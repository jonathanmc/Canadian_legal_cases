    <pre>Appeal from the judgment of Cosgrove J. dated August 13 and
December 9, 1997</pre>
    <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:


</pre>
    <pre>Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Every  person knows that his or her child will on  occasion
become  ill  or be injured.  An illness can arise or an  accident
happen anywhere &#150; at home, in school, at a friend&#146;s house,  on  a
playground,  at ballet or band or hockey practice.  Usually,  the
illness  or injury occurs naturally or accidentally; no one  else
is at fault.
</pre>
    <pre>[2]   Occasionally, however, a child becomes ill  or  is  injured
through  someone  else&#146;s  fault,  even  negligence.   When   that
happens, inevitably parents are called to the scene (if they  are
not  already present) and they must deal with the situation  they
face.   Fortunately,  most  of the situations  parents  face  are
fairly  ordinary  &#150;  the child has fallen  off  a  swing  in  the
schoolyard and has a bump on her head and a scrape or cut on  her
knee.  Sadly, on a few occasions the situation parents must  face
is horrific &#150; their child is dead or seriously injured.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]   All  parents  react when faced with these  situations.   No
matter  how  minor  the apparent injury, every  parent  would  be
concerned  about  the child&#146;s condition.  Beyond  concern,  other
reactions  &#150;  confusion, fear, anger, grief and  terror  &#150;  might
arise  depending on two factors: what has happened to  the  child
and a parent&#146;s own psychological make-up.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]   Tort  law  permits a person who has  been  injured  by  the
negligent conduct of another to seek compensation in damages  for
those  injuries  from the tortfeasor.  The  injury  need  not  be
physical;  modern  case  law establishes  clearly  that  in  some
situations  a  person can recover for psychological or  emotional
injury.


[5]  This appeal fits within the category of psychiatric damage.1
It  essentially  poses  this problem: if a  company&#146;s  negligence
causes  minor  and  short-term injury to a child,  can  a  parent
recover  damages  for  the  substantial psychiatric  damage  that
appears  to have flowed from his or her concern about the child&#146;s
condition?</pre>
    <pre>A.   Factual Background
</pre>
    <pre>[6]   In June 1993, Eva Vanek (&#147;Eva&#148;) was an 11-year old Grade  6
student.   On  June 16 she was eating her lunch at  school.   She
opened  a  bottle  of Beatrice grape nectar  and  drank  a  small
amount.  She  noticed that it had a foul taste  and  regurgitated
some  of it.  She did not vomit or lose consciousness.  She  said
that  the top of the drink looked different from the rest  of  it
(&#147;like  it was the oil floats to the top&#148;) and that &#147;it  made  me
feel a bit nauseous, and extremely scared&#148;.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   She reported the bad taste of the drink to a couple of  her
classmates.   The classmates took the drink to the teacher.   The
teacher took Eva to the principal&#146;s office.  The principal called
Eva&#146;s  parents,  Ivan and Georgina Vanek, and they  came  to  the
school  immediately. Both Mr. and Mrs. Vanek testified that  when
they  saw  Eva  in the principal&#146;s office she seemed  &#147;sad&#148;.  Mr.
Vanek  testified  that she looked &#147;pale&#148;.  Mrs.  Vanek  testified
that Eva was &#147;burping&#148;. They decided to take her to the Emergency
Department of Hotel Dieu Hospital in Kingston.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]   At the hospital Eva was checked by a doctor.  In his report
Dr. Silva wrote:</pre>
    <pre>          She  has  been  experiencing  epigastric
          abdominal     pain     and     recurrent
          regurgitation   up  her  esophagus;   no
          vomiting,   no  dizziness,  no   blurred
          vision, no drowsiness.
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The drink appears oily and has a paint
          thinner smell to it.
          </pre>
    <pre>          A [Assessment]:  She is not probably
          poisoned.
          </pre>
    <pre>          P [Prescription]:  reassurance
          </pre>
    <pre>          See Dr. if new symptoms develop.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[9]   Eva  received  no  other treatment at  the  hospital.   Her
stomach was not pumped and she was given no medication. She  left
the  hospital the same afternoon and returned to school the  next
day.   She  resumed her normal academic and athletic  activities.
For her, the grape juice incident was over.
</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  juice  bottle was sent to Health and Welfare  Canada&#146;s
laboratory for testing.  On July 30, 1993, Theresa Burke, a  Food
and Drug Inspector, wrote to Mrs. Vanek, stating, inter alia:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          The  laboratory  has now  completed  its
          testing and has identified the liquid as
          a   hydrocarbon   mixture   similar   to
          gasoline.
          </pre>
    <pre>          With   respect  to  your  concern  about
          possible  long-term  effects   on   your
          daughter&#146;s health, we have contacted the
          Poison  Control  Unit at the  Children&#146;s
          Hospital,  Eastern  Ontario.   The  Head
          nurse, Jill Courtemanche, indicated that
          she had already spoken with your husband
          regarding  this matter.   She  suggested
          that  if the amount of chemical ingested
          by your daughter was not enough to cause
          acute  toxic  symptoms  then  there  was
          probably not enough ingested to have any
          long-term effects.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[11]  In a separate letter, dated August 5, 1993, to one  of  the
defendants, Beatrice Foods Inc., Shirley Chalouh, an  Auditor  of
Food  Processing  at  Health  and  Welfare  Canada  reported   an
identical conclusion, albeit in more scientific language:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          [T]he  sample  was found to  contain  a
          relatively    complex    mixture     of
          aliphatic, olefinic, napthenic (cyclic)
          and    aromatic   hydrocarbons.    Most
          compounds identified were in the C6  to
          C13  range. Not all compounds could  be
          characterized.  The lab indicated  that
          this mixture could have originated with
          contamination  by gasoline  or  similar
          product.
          </pre>
    <pre>[12] In spite of the results of Eva&#146;s check-up at the hospital on
June 16, 1993, her return to school the next day, and the absence
of any further symptoms of illness or injury, and in spite of the
report Mrs. Vanek received from Health and Welfare Canada on July
30, in the months following the juice incident Eva&#146;s parents, and
especially   Mr.  Vanek,  were  deeply  concerned   about   their
daughter&#146;s health.  They began to conduct their own research into
the  long-term  effects  of hydrocarbons,  consulting  the  Merck
Manual  and  the  Encyclopedia Britannica.  They  also  requested
Health  and  Welfare&#146;s complete file, pursuant to the  Access  to
Information  Act,  R.S.C. 1985, c. A-1, which  they  received  in
February  1994.   They were also in almost constant  contact,  by
telephone  or  letter,  with  Health  and  Welfare  Canada,   the
Kingston,  Frontenac,  Lennox &amp; Addington  Health  Unit  and  the
Poison  Information Centre at the Children&#146;s Hospital of  Eastern
Ontario.
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  At  the  trial, Mrs. Vanek testified that after  the  juice
incident  she was nervous about the long-term effects on  Eva  of
swallowing  the  contaminated drink.  Her family  physician,  Dr.
Langley, prescribed Ativan to relieve her stress.
</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Shortly  after the juice incident, Mr. Vanek also  reported
experiencing  stress.  On June 21, five days after the  incident,
Dr.  Langley prescribed Ativan for him.  A chest x-ray  taken  at
this time showed no signs of heart or lung trouble.
</pre>
    <pre>[15]  At  the  trial, Mr. Vanek testified that his  stress  level
increased  steadily after the juice incident, reaching  its  peak
when  the  Vaneks  received the complete  file  from  Health  and
Welfare  Canada in February 1994.  At that time, Mr. Vanek  began
to  feel  pressure in his chest, shortness of breath and numbness
in  his  hands.  He also became less physically active  and  felt
depressed.   On  March  27, 1994 Mr. Vanek was  hospitalized  for
coronary heart disease and unstable angina.
</pre>
    <pre>[16]  On  June  9, 1994 the Vaneks initiated this action  seeking
damages of $925,000.  They named as defendants the Great Atlantic
&amp;  Pacific  Company of Canada Limited, which owned the  store  in
which  the  juice  was  sold,  and  Beatrice  Foods  Inc.,  which
distributed  the  juice.   These  defendants  later  joined   the
manufacturer of the juice, Fairlee Fruit Juice Ltd., as  a  third
party.
</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  matter proceeded to trial before Cosgrove J.  Evidence
was  heard for four days.  At the conclusion of the evidence, the
defendants  and the third party admitted responsibility  for  the
presence  of the toxic fluid on the surface of the juice  in  the
bottle.
</pre>
    <pre>[18]  On  August 13, 1997 Cosgrove J. rendered his decision.   He
granted judgment to Eva for $2,000 in general damages and $2,500,
pursuant  to section 61(1) of the Family Law Act (&#147;FLA&#148;),  R.S.O.
1990,  c.  F.  3, for the loss of care and companionship  of  her
father.   He  granted  judgment to  Mrs.  Vanek  for  $2,500  for
&#147;anxiety  or distress&#148; and $5,000, pursuant to the FLA,  for  the
loss  of care and companionship of her husband.  The trial  judge
also granted judgment to Mr. Vanek for $15,000 for &#147;physical harm
and  loss  of  amenities&#148; and $12,500 for &#147;mental, emotional  and
psychological distress.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The trial judge refused to award aggravated damages to  the
plaintiffs.   In  subsequent reasons, on  December  9,  1997,  he
awarded  the plaintiffs their costs of the action on &#147;an enhanced
Party-and-Party  scale&#148;, which he fixed at $35,000  inclusive  of
disbursements and G.S.T. He also awarded pre-judgment interest at
4 percent from January 25, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The defendants and third party jointly appeal most  of  the
components  of the trial judgment.  They do not take  issue  with
the  trial  judge&#146;s conclusion that they are liable in negligence
to Eva; nor do they contest the award to her of $2,000 as general
damages.   The  appellants do challenge the $2,500 FLA  award  to
Eva.   They also challenge the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that they
are  liable  in negligence to Mr. and Mrs. Vanek and his  various
awards of damages to them.  Finally, the appellants contend  that
the trial judge erred in his disposition of costs.
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  respondents  cross-appeal on two  issues:  first,  the
refusal  of the trial judge to award aggravated damages;  second,
his setting of pre-judgment interest at 4 percent.</pre>
    <pre>B.   Legal Issues
</pre>
    <pre>[22] This appeal and cross-appeal raise the following issues:</pre>
    <pre>     Appeal Issues
</pre>
    <pre>(1)  Are the appellants liable in negligence to Mr. and Mrs.
     Vanek?  Specifically, was the trial judge correct in awarding
     damages to the Vaneks for the psychiatric damage they suffered in
     the aftermath of learning that their daughter had consumed
     contaminated juice?</pre>
    <pre>(2)  Was the trial judge correct to award FLA damages to the</pre>
    <pre>     child and her mother?</pre>
    <pre>(3)  If the answer to (1) is &#145;Yes&#146;, was the trial judge correct
     to award $2,500 as general damages to Mrs. Vanek?</pre>
    <pre>(4)  If the answer to (1) is &#145;Yes&#146;, was the trial judge correct
     to award $27,500 as general damages to Mr. Vanek?</pre>
    <pre>(5)  Did the trial judge make any error in principle in fixing</pre>
    <pre>     costs at $35,000?</pre>
    <pre>     Cross-Appeal</pre>
    <pre>(6)  Did the trial judge make any error in principle in refusing
     to award aggravated damages to the plaintiffs?
     </pre>
    <pre>(7)  Was the trial judge correct in setting the pre-judgment</pre>
    <pre>     interest rate at 4 percent?


C.   Analysis</pre>
    <pre>     Appeal Issues</pre>
    <pre>(1)  Liability for psychiatric damage
</pre>
    <pre>[23]  The  common  law  of  negligence  no  longer  recognizes  a
distinction between physical and psychiatric2 injuries  in  terms
of  compensability.   Moreover, since the turn  of  the  century,
compensation  for  psychiatric injury has not required  proof  of
physical injury: see Dulieu v. White &amp; Sons, [1901] 2 K.B. 669.
</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The  reason for the disappearance of the early  distinction
between  physical  and psychiatric injury was  well-explained  by
Lord  MacMillan  in  the leading case Hay or Bourhill  v.  Young,
[1943] A.C. 92 at 103 (H.L.):</pre>
    <pre>          It  is  no  longer necessary to consider
          whether the infliction of what is called
          mental    shock   may   constitute    an
          actionable wrong.  The crude  view  that
          the  law should take cognizance only  of
          physical  injury resulting  from  actual
          impact has been discarded, and it is now
          well recognized that an action will  lie
          for  injury  by shock sustained  through
          the medium of the eye or the ear without
          direct contact.  The distinction between
          mental shock and bodily injury was never
          a  scientific one, for mental  shock  is
          presumably  in all cases the result  of,
          or   at   least  accompanied  by,   some
          physical  disturbance in the  sufferer&#146;s
          system.   And  a mental shock  may  have
          consequences  more  serious  than  those
          resulting from physical impact.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[25]  In  Canadian law, a plaintiff can recover for the negligent
infliction  of  psychiatric damage if he or she  establishes  two
propositions &#150; first, that the psychiatric damage suffered was  a
foreseeable  consequence of the negligent conduct;  second,  that
the  psychiatric  damage was so serious that  it  resulted  in  a
recognizable psychiatric illness.  See Linden, Canadian Tort Law,
supra, at pp. 389-92.
</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The  leading case in Ontario in the domain  of  psychiatric
damage clearly and succinctly enunciates the requirement that the
plaintiff  establish both propositions.  In Duwyn  v.  Kaprielian
(1978),  22 O.R. (2d) 736 (C.A.), a mother experienced an extreme
psychological  and  emotional reaction when she  arrived  at  the
scene  of  a  minor automobile accident and saw  her  young  son,
uninjured  but screaming, inside the car. Morden J.A. stated,  at
pp. 747 and 754-55:</pre>
    <pre>          
          [T]he  test  of  liability  for  nervous
          shock  is the foreseeability of  nervous
          shock.   This puts the law of negligence
          concerned  with this kind of  claim,  at
          least    according   to    its    verbal
          formulation,   in  line   with   general
          negligence law.
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>          The  law  is relatively clear  that  the
          kind   of  &#147;nervous  shock&#148;  for   which
          recovery  may be had involves  something
          more  than general emotional  upset.   I
          refer  to Lord Denning in Hinz v. Berry,
          [1970] 2 Q.B. 40 at 42, where a wife saw
          her husband fatally injured:
          </pre>
    <pre>            In   English  law  no  damages   are
            awarded  for grief or sorrow  caused
            by  a  person&#146;s death.   No  damages
            are  to be given for the worry about
            the  children, or for the  financial
            strain    or    stress,    or    the
            difficulties of adjusting to  a  new
            life.     Damages   are,    however,
            recoverable for nervous  shock,  or,
            to  put it in medical terms, for any
            recognizable   psychiatric   illness
            caused by the breach of duty by  the
            defendant.
            [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>(a)    Foreseeability
          
</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Morden  J.A.&#146;s proposition that the test of  liability  for
nervous   shock  is  the  foreseeability  of  nervous  shock   is
consistent  with the leading duty of care cases from the  Supreme
Court  of  Canada: see, for example, Kamloops (City) v.  Nielson,
[1984]  2  S.C.R.  2,  the unanimous decision  of  the  court  in
Winnipeg Condominium Corporation No. 36 v. Bird Construction Co.,
[1995] 1 S.C.R. 85, and the recent decision in Dobson (Litigation
guardian of) v. Dobson (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.), where
the  Anns  test3 of liability is affirmed as the  proper  way  to
establish a duty of care in Canadian tort law.4
</pre>
    <pre>[28]  Duwyn  v. Kaprielian has also been followed in all  of  the
leading  cases in Ontario.  For example, in Bechard v. Haliburton
Estate  (1991),  5  O.R. (3d) 512 at 518 (C.A.),  Griffiths  J.A.
stated  that &#147;under Canadian and English law reasonable foresight
of   nervous  shock  to  the  plaintiff  is  the  touchstone   of
liability&#148;.  See also Nespolon v. Alford (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 355
(C.A.)5,  especially  at  pp.  364-66  per  Abella  J.A.,   where
reasonable  foreseeability of nervous shock, potentially  limited
by  policy  considerations, is utilized as the  proper  test  for
imposing a duty of care in these types of situations.
</pre>
    <pre>[29]  In  his  reasons in the case under appeal, the trial  judge
correctly stated that foreseeability was a central issue  in  the
case.  Under the heading Findings, he posed a series of questions
and  then  proceeded  to  an analysis  and  conclusion  for  each
question.  He posed the foreseeability question in this fashion.</pre>
    <pre>          
          2.  Is  it  reasonably foreseeable  that
            parents  in the position of  Ivan  and
            Georgina   Vanek  would  suffer   some
            degree  of  nervous shock  or  mental,
            emotional  and psychological  distress
            over  the  well-being of their  child,
            given  the facts and circumstances  of
            this case?
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[30]  Unfortunately, in the analysis which follows this  question
the  trial  judge said nothing about foreseeability.  Rather,  he
moved  immediately to the recent decision of  Molloy J. in  Mason
v.  Westside Cemeteries Ltd. (1996), 29 C.C.L.T. (2d)  125  (Ont.
Ct.  Gen.  Div.).  In that case, Molloy J. held that a  plaintiff
could recover damages for moderate emotional distress caused by a
defendant&#146;s  action.  In other words, Molloy J.  was  challenging
the  second  component  of  the settled  law  in  the  domain  of
psychiatric damages; she held that a plaintiff need not establish
that  he  or  she was suffering from a &#145;recognizable  psychiatric
illness&#146; in order to obtain recovery.
</pre>
    <pre>[31] The trial judge agreed with Molloy J.&#146;s reasoning.  He said:
&#147;I  adopt what I view as the unassailable logic and good sense of
Madame Justice Molloy in Mason v. Westside Cemeteries Ltd.&#148;  Then
he  analyzed  the  medical evidence at the trial  concerning  the
extent of Mr. Vanek&#146;s distress and reached the conclusion that &#147;I
would  rank  the  anxiety  distress as moderate  and  a  moderate
contributor to the triggering of his angina attack.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[32]  None of this analysis speaks to the foreseeability question
which  the trial judge posed at the beginning of this section  of
his  reasons.   The  trial  judge  posed  the  correct  question.
Unfortunately,  he did not answer it. He assumed the  answer  and
proceeded immediately to the injury analysis.
</pre>
    <pre>[33]  So,  what is the answer to the question: &#147;Is it  reasonably
foreseeable  that  parents in the position of Ivan  and  Georgina
Vanek  would  suffer  some  degree of nervous  shock  or  mental,
emotional and psychological distress over the well-being of their
child, given the facts and circumstances of this case?&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[34]  Let me say at the outset that, in my view, the trial  judge
framed   this  question  in  particularly  careful  and  accurate
language.  He tied foreseeability to &#147;some degree&#148; of psychiatric
damage.   That  is  all that is required at  this  stage  of  the
analysis;  the  extent of the damage must be  considered  in  the
second  step  of  the analysis.  Moreover, the trial  judge  also
linked  foreseeability  to &#147;the facts and circumstances  of  this
case&#148;.   That,  too, is an appropriate linkage.  In  all  of  the
psychiatric damages cases &#150; indeed in all of the negligence cases
&#150;  foreseeability  cannot be considered in the abstract;  rather,
the  careless conduct of the tortfeasor must be assessed  in  the
context  of  all of the circumstances surrounding  that  conduct.
The  surrounding circumstances will include the identity  of  the
parties,  their relationship to each other, the careless conduct,
its aftermath or consequences, and the injuries suffered.
</pre>
    <pre>[35] Let me begin with the careless conduct of the defendants and
third  party.   It was serious conduct.  Through  their  acts  or
omissions,  they allowed a product to become contaminated.   They
distributed  and  sold this product in the  expectation  that  it
would  be consumed.  Consumption by an 11-year old girl would  be
entirely foreseeable.
</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Who  was  injured by this conduct?  The  girl  herself  was
injured, although briefly and not seriously.  Could the companies
foresee  that  any other person, a non-consumer of  the  product,
would  suffer  psychiatric damage as a result  of  a  young  girl
consuming  a  contaminated product?  I think  that  the  starting
point  for  the answer to this question would be:  if  any  other
person  could be harmed by the companies&#146; negligence, the parents
of the child would be the most likely candidates.
</pre>
    <pre>[37]  To  this  point, then, there are two factors suggesting  an
affirmative answer to the foreseeability inquiry &#150; the  substance
of  the careless conduct (production, distribution and sale of  a
contaminated  consumable  product), and  the  close  relationship
between  the person who consumed the product (the child) and  the
parties alleging they were injured (the parents).</pre>
    <pre>[38]  However, the parent-child relationship needs to be explored
further.  In the leading cases, the foreseeability of psychiatric
damage  has usually been linked to the bystander (often a parent)
witnessing a terrible accident befall the person (often a  child)
who was the principal victim of the defendant&#146;s negligence.
</pre>
    <pre>[39]  The  leading  English case in which parental  recovery  for
psychiatric damage was permitted is McLoughlin v. O&#146;Brian, [1982]
2  All  E.R. 198 (H.L.).  In that case Mrs. McLoughlin&#146;s  husband
and three children were involved in a road accident caused by the
negligence  of the defendant.  One of Mrs. McLoughlin&#146;s  children
was  killed  and  her  husband and the other  two  children  were
severely  injured.  At the time of the accident  Mrs.  McLoughlin
was  at home two miles away.  She went to the hospital where  she
saw the injured members of her family and heard that her daughter
had been killed.  As a result, she suffered severe and persisting
psychiatric damage.
</pre>
    <pre>[40]  The  House  of  Lords allowed Mrs.  McLoughlin  to  recover
damages.   The law lords found that it was reasonably foreseeable
that  a parent could suffer serious psychiatric damage from  what
she  had  seen and heard at the hospital.  As expressed  by  Lord
Wilberforce, at p. 30l:
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          There   can  be  no  doubt  that   these
          circumstances,    witnessed    by    the
          appellant,  were  distressing   in   the
          extreme and were capable of producing an
          effect  going well beyond that of  grief
          and sorrow.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[41]  The  leading Ontario case in which recovery for psychiatric
damage was permitted is Bechard v. Haliburton Estate, supra.   In
that  case,  Mrs. Bechard was a passenger who was  injured  in  a
collision  between a motor vehicle and a motorcycle.   While  her
spouse   and   a   bystander  were  attempting  to   assist   the
motorcyclist, who had been thrown into the middle of the road,  a
second vehicle struck and killed the motorcyclist.  The cyclist&#146;s
estate admitted liability for the first collision, and the  trial
judge found the driver who struck the motorcyclist liable for the
second  accident.   In  addition to her physical  injuries,  Mrs.
Bechard suffered a severe psychiatric illness caused by what  she
had experienced.
</pre>
    <pre>[42] This court held that Mrs. Bechard&#146;s psychiatric damage was a
reasonably  foreseeable consequence of the  accident.   Griffiths
J.A. said, at p. 525:</pre>
    <pre>          In   my   opinion,  it   is   reasonably
          foreseeable that witnessing a horrifying
          or  gruesome  accident such as  occurred
          here   might  well  upset  the   average
          sensitive  bystander.   The  shock   she
          suffered   at  witnessing  the  gruesome
          sight  of  Haliburton&#146;s body  being  run
          over   was  foreseeable  to  an  average
          person.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[43]  The  leading Ontario case in which recovery for psychiatric
damage  was  considered in the context of a  parent  seeing  harm
befall a child is Duwyn v. Kaprielian, supra.  In that case, Mrs.
Duwyn  took  her two young sons and her mother  in  a  car.   She
parked  the  car  and  went into an office building  to  pay  her
telephone and gas bills.  Her mother and two sons stayed  in  the
car.   While  Mrs.  Duwyn was inside the office building,  a  car
driven  by  the defendant backed out of a laneway  and  into  the
Duwyn  vehicle.  The driver&#146;s side door was dented and  a  window
was  broken, scattering glass throughout the inside of  the  car.
No  one  inside the car was injured.  Mrs. Duwyn returned to  her
car  and  saw the accident.  She thought her younger son,  Brent,
was  injured because he was screaming.  She became upset.  At the
trial,  there  was  evidence  that  the  accident  rekindled   an
experience from her childhood when she had left a younger brother
unattended  and  he had been seriously burned.   Mrs.  Duwyn  was
unable  to  comfort Brent at the accident scene.   Moreover,  she
became  incapacitated at home, unable to cope  with  &#147;the  misery
which  she suffered in attempting to cope with Brent on  a  daily
basis following the accident&#148; (at p. 755).
</pre>
    <pre>[44]  A  lawsuit  was brought on behalf of both  Mrs.  Duwyn  and
Brent.   The  trial  judge dismissed both  of  their  claims  for
recovery  for  psychiatric  damage.   This  court  reversed   the
decision  respecting Brent; however, it upheld the trial  judge&#146;s
decision relating to Mrs. Duwyn. Writing for a unanimous  court,6
Morden J.A. concluded that it was not reasonably foreseeable that
Mrs.  Duwyn  would suffer psychiatric damage from witnessing  the
aftermath of this accident.  He stated, at p. 754:</pre>
    <pre>          
          In  judging  the possibility of  nervous
          shock to someone in the position of Mrs.
          Duwyn, on the facts, I do not think that
          it  can  be  said that it was reasonably
          foreseeable.  I  appreciate   that   the
          defendant&#146;s  driving,  with  respect  to
          Brent,  created risks of  both  physical
          and  mental  injury, that  part  of  the
          basis of Mrs. Duwyn&#146;s reaction was  that
          she  apparently thought that  Brent  had
          suffered  some  physical injury  in  her
          absence,  and that a defendant does  not
          have to foresee the precise way in which
          the  damage is caused as a condition  of
          liability.   However, these  factors  do
          not,  in  my view, allow for a situation
          where it seems likely that, but for Mrs.
          Duwyn&#146;s  particular hypersensitivity  (I
          would  call it &#147;abnormal&#148;, see  Bourhill
          v.  Young, supra, at p. 110), she  would
          not have reacted in the extreme way that
          she did, whether she was at the scene at
          the  time  of the accident or  had  come
          upon  it  just  after.   In  the  latter
          event, but for her condition, she  would
          have  reasonably soon satisfied  herself
          that  her  son had suffered no  physical
          injury.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[45]  In  these three cases, and in the many other cases  dealing
with  psychiatric damage caused to a bystander, it is clear  that
the  courts  focus  their analysis on two factors  &#150;  the  actual
event,  or  its  aftermath, witnessed by the  bystander  and  the
reaction  this  event  and its aftermath might  engender  in  the
reasonable person.
</pre>
    <pre>[46]  Turning  back  to the present case, I have  identified  two
factors  that  might suggest that the companies could  reasonably
have  foreseen  that  their negligence  would  cause  psychiatric
damage to Mr. and Mrs. Vanek.  Those factors are that the harm to
the  injured  person was a potentially serious  one,  namely  the
consumption  of  a  contaminated product, and  that  the  injured
person was a young daughter of the Vaneks.
</pre>
    <pre>[47]  There  are, however, important factors pointing  away  from
foreseeability in this case.
</pre>
    <pre>[48]  First, the parents did not see Eva consume the juice.  They
did  not witness a &#145;horrific sight&#146; like the mother in McLoughlin
v. O&#146;Brian.
</pre>
    <pre>[49] Second, swallowing the juice did not appear to cause Eva any
significant harm.  She did not vomit, convulse, panic  or  faint.
She said &#147;it made me feel a bit nauseous, and extremely scared.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[50] Third, all of the people involved at the school handled  the
situation  perfectly.  Eva&#146;s classmates took the juice bottle  to
their  teacher.   The  teacher took Eva to  the  principal.   The
principal called Eva&#146;s parents and they came to the school.
</pre>
    <pre>[51] Fourth, what confronted the Vaneks when they arrived at  the
school  was  a  fairly  ordinary  scene  &#150;  their  daughter   was
experiencing some discomfort, but it was clear that she  was  not
experiencing any serious distress.
</pre>
    <pre>[52]  Fifth, the Vaneks immediate response was that of  a  normal
parent; they drove Eva to the hospital for a check-up.  This  was
the right decision and they had no difficulty making or executing
it   (unlike  the  mother  in  Duwyn  v.  Kaprielian  who  became
incapacitated at the accident scene).
</pre>
    <pre>[53]  Sixth,  at the hospital Eva was given a thorough  check-up.
The doctor reported that she was experiencing some abdominal pain
and   regurgitation  in  her  throat.   There  was  no  vomiting,
dizziness, blurred vision or drowsiness.  The doctor&#146;s assessment
was  that  Eva  was probably not poisoned.  His prescription  was
that she should see a doctor if new symptoms developed.
</pre>
    <pre>[54]  Seventh, Eva left the hospital and returned to  school  the
next  day.   She  experienced no ill effects from swallowing  the
juice.
</pre>
    <pre>[55]  In  short,  if one focuses on the event and  its  immediate
aftermath,  what  the  Vanek parents saw and  experienced  was  a
fairly  ordinary  situation.  They  were  called  to  the  school
because  of  a  mishap  involving  their  daughter,  the   school
personnel  dealt  properly with the situation,  as  parents  they
handled   the  situation  appropriately  and  apparently  without
distress,  the medical personnel provided proper care  for  their
daughter and, the next day, she was back in school.
</pre>
    <pre>[56]  Even  if  one takes a longer view of the aftermath  of  the
juice  incident,  the picture of ordinariness  does  not  change.
Within  days  of the incident, the parents visited  their  family
doctor,  Dr.  Langley,  complaining  of  stress  caused  by   the
incident.   Dr. Langley informed them that, in his opinion,  &#147;Eva
would  be fine.&#148; He went on to testify: &#147;but my concern was their
over&#133;  that  their pre-occupation with this was  not  the  actual
seriousness  of the event, it was the reaction that they  had  to
the event&#148;.
</pre>
    <pre>[57]  Finally, moving out farther into the aftermath of the juice
incident,  on July 30, 1993 the Vaneks received the  report  from
Health  and  Welfare  Canada.   Based  on  its  analysis  of  the
contaminant (&#147;a hydro carbon mixture similar to gasoline&#148;) and on
a  consultation with the Poison Control Centre at the  Children&#146;s
Hospital of Eastern Ontario, the advice to the Vaneks was  &#147;there
was  probably not enough ingested to have any long-term effects.&#148;
In  fact,  this  advice has proved to be correct.   Eva  has  not
experienced  any  problems flowing from her  consumption  of  the
juice.  She is today an excellent student and a fine athlete.
</pre>
    <pre>[58]  The House of Lords returned to the subject of recovery  for
psychiatric  damage  in a recent, and tragic,  case  involving  a
disaster at a football stadium which claimed the lives of ninety-
six  people.   In  White v. Chief Constable of  South  Yorkshire,
[1998]  3  W.L.R. 1509 (H.L.), a large number of police  officers
brought  claims for psychiatric injury suffered as  a  result  of
tending  victims  of  the tragedy.  The law lords  dismissed  the
police  officers&#146; claims.  In the speech by Lord Griffiths  there
is,  in my view, a particularly succinct and useful statement  on
the  foreseeability issue in this type of case.   Lord  Griffiths
said, at p. 1512:
         </pre>
    <pre>          
          There  is a further requirement  in  the
          bystander   case  and   that   is   that
          psychiatric   injury   was    reasonably
          foreseeable  as a likely consequence  of
          exposure  to the trauma of the  accident
          or  its  immediate aftermath.   The  law
          expects    reasonable   fortitude    and
          robustness of its citizens and will  not
          impose  liability  for  the  exceptional
          frailty of certain individuals.  This is
          not  to  be  confused with the &#147;eggshell
          skull&#148; situation, where as a result of a
          breach  of  duty  the  damage  inflicted
          proves to be more serious than expected.
          It  is  a  threshold test of  breach  of
          duty; before a defendant will be held in
          breach of a duty to a bystander he  must
          have  exposed  them to  a  situation  in
          which it is reasonably foreseeable  that
          a  person  of reasonable robustness  and
          fortitude  would  be  likely  to  suffer
          psychiatric injury.
         </pre>
    <pre>         
[59]  I  do  not think that the psychiatric damage Mr.  and  Mrs.
Vanek suffered following the consumption of contaminated juice by
their  daughter  could  have  been  reasonably  foreseen  by  the
defendants  and the third party in this case.  The  actual  event
was  not  witnessed  by  them; nor was  it  &#147;distressing  in  the
extreme&#148;  (McLoughlin  v. O&#146;Brian), or &#147;horrifying  or  gruesome&#148;
(Bechard  v.  Haliburton).   Moreover,  if  the  time  frame   is
lengthened to &#147;just after&#148; (Duwyn v. Kaprielian) the event or  to
its  &#147;immediate  aftermath  (White v. Chief  Constable  of  South
Yorkshire),  the  picture that emerges is one of almost  complete
normalcy  &#150; a child at school suffers a mishap but does not  seem
to  be  in  serious  distress, the school  personnel  handle  the
situation well, the parents arrive and make appropriate decisions
without  difficulty,  medical personnel conduct  the  appropriate
investigation and release the child, and, importantly, the  child
returns  to  school the next day and never again experiences  any
problem  arising from her consumption of the juice.  Finally,  if
&#145;aftermath&#146; is lengthened even more, the picture still  does  not
change.   Both the Vaneks&#146; family doctor and Health  and  Welfare
Canada  informed  the  parents that their daughter  was  probably
fine.
</pre>
    <pre>[60]  In conclusion, the juice incident on June 16, 1993 was  the
type  of  incident that happens, in schools and in  family  life,
every day.  A minor mishap occurs.  The appropriate people  &#150;  in
this case, school personnel, parents and medical personnel &#150; deal
with  it  effectively.  The minor mishap gives rise to legitimate
parental  concern  about  potential long-term  effects  on  their
child.  The appropriate people &#150; in this case, the parents, their
family  doctor,  medical  personnel at  a  hospital,  and  health
personnel in the federal government &#150; deal effectively with  this
concern.   Life  goes on.  Unfortunately, for the  Vaneks  normal
life did not go on.  They became obsessed with the incident.   In
doing so, they were not acting like the average concerned parent.
They  were  displaying a &#147;particular hypersensitivity&#148; (Duwyn  v.
Kaprielian);   they   lacked   the  &#147;reasonable   fortitude   and
robustness&#148;  (White v. Chief Constable of South  Yorkshire)  that
the law expects of all its citizens, including concerned parents.
The defendants and third party could not have reasonably foreseen
this  highly  unusual  reaction and the psychiatric  damage  that
flowed from it.
</pre>
    <pre>[61]  For  these  reasons, in my view the trial  judge  erred  in
holding  the  defendants and the third party  at  fault  for  the
psychiatric damage he found Mr. &amp; Mrs. Vanek suffered.  The trial
judge  did not address the pivotal issue of foreseeability.   Had
he  done  so, he should have concluded that the harm  was  not  a
reasonably foreseeability consequence of the juice incident.</pre>
    <pre>(b)  &#145;Recognizable Psychiatric Illness&#146;
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[62]  In light of my conclusion on the foreseeability factor,  it
is  unnecessary to consider the second factor in the  psychiatric
damage cases, namely whether the parents&#146; injuries amounted to  a
recognizable  psychiatric illness.  There is no  doubt  that  for
many   years  it  was  settled  law  in  Ontario  and   in   most
jurisdictions that recovery could not take place without  such  a
finding:  see  Duwyn v. Kaprielian, supra; Page v. Smith,  supra;
Linden, Canadian Tort Law, supra; Klar, Tort Law (1991),  at  pp.
280-81;  and Mullany and Handford, Tort Liability for Psychiatric
Damage: The Law of &#147;Nervous Shock&#148;, supra, at pp. 15 and 58.
</pre>
    <pre>[63]  The  trial judge in the present case chose not to  consider
the   leading   authorities,  especially  Duwyn  v.   Kaprielian.
Instead,  he  adopted  the reasoning of Molloy  J.  in  Mason  v.
Westside  Cemeteries Ltd., supra.  In that case,  a  son  sued  a
funeral  home for losing the urn containing his parents&#146; cremated
ashes.   Molloy J. found that the emotional harm done to the  son
was  minor.  Nevertheless, she awarded general damages for mental
distress  of  $1,000.   In  reaching her  conclusion,  Molloy  J.
acknowledged,  but  did  not apply, the recognizable  psychiatric
illness factor.
</pre>
    <pre>[64] Additional support for the proposition that there should  be
recovery   for   psychiatric  damage  short  of  a   recognizable
psychiatric illness can be found in judgments authored by Southin
J.  in  McDermott v. Ramadanovic Estate (1988), 44  C.C.L.T.  249
(B.C.S.C.)  and  Southin  J.A.  in Rhodes  v.  Canadian  National
Railway  (1990), 75 D.L.R. (4th) 248 (B.C.C.A.).  There  is  also
criticism   in   the  academic  literature  of  the  recognizable
psychiatric illness factor, most notably by Linden, the  dean  of
Canadian tort scholars, in Canadian Tort Law, supra, at p. 402.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[65]  Should  the  &#145;recognizable psychiatric illness&#146;  factor  be
reassessed  in this case?  In my view, it should not  &#150;  for  two
reasons.
</pre>
    <pre>[66]  First, in terms of judicial role and technique,  I  do  not
think that a clear and longstanding principle of law should be re-
evaluated   where  every  word  of  the  re-evaluation,   whether
favourable  or  critical, would be obiter.   That  would  be  the
situation in this case in light of my conclusion that it was  not
reasonably   foreseeable  that  the  Vaneks  would   suffer   any
psychiatric   damage   from  the  events   they   witnessed   and
experienced.
</pre>
    <pre>[67]  Second,  any reassessment of the law in a  difficult  area,
like  this  one  with  its  mix  of sometimes  complicated  legal
principles and sophisticated and fast-changing medical knowledge,
should  take place against the backdrop of a real fact  situation
which presents the issue squarely.  Put another way, the facts in
a  case  where  it is reasonably foreseeable that  some  form  of
psychiatric  damage would occur may serve as an important  anchor
for  the affirmation of the traditional, or the development of  a
new,  legal  principle. That factual anchor is  missing  in  this
case.
</pre>
    <pre>[68]  For  these reasons, it is wise to leave reconsideration  of
the recognizable psychiatric illness factor to another case.
</pre>
    <pre>(2)  FLA damages to Eva and Mrs. Vanek
</pre>
    <pre>[69] On this issue, the trial judge said, at p. 11:</pre>
    <pre>          It  would  appear that all parties  have
          overlooked a claim by Eva for  the  loss
          of  guidance, care and companionship  of
          her father.  I intend to award Georgina,
          her  mother, damages under this  heading
          and  I conclude on all the evidence that
          Eva has suffered a similar loss.


</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge fixed Eva&#146;s damages under s. 61(1) of the FLA  at
$2,500 and Mrs. Vanek&#146;s damages at $5,000.
</pre>
    <pre>[70] In my view, these awards are untenable.  There is nothing in
the  plaintiffs&#146; pleadings concerning an FLA claim.  In  Kalkinis
(Litigation  Guardian  of) v. Allstate Insurance  Co.  of  Canada
(1998), 41 D.L.R. (3d) 528 at 533-34 (C.A.), Finlayson J.A. said:</pre>
    <pre>          
          It  has  long been established that  the
          parties to a legal suit are entitled  to
          have  a  resolution of their differences
          on the basis of the issues joined in the
          pleadings:  see rule 25.06.   The  trial
          judge cannot make a finding of liability
          and award damages against a defendant on
          a  basis  that  was not pleaded  in  the
          statement  of claim because it  deprives
          the  defendant  of  the  opportunity  to
          address   that  issue  in  the  evidence
          presented at trial.
</pre>
    <pre>[71] The respondents seek to remedy the defect in their pleadings
by  obtaining an order of this court to amend their pleadings  to
conform  to  the judgment at trial.  This point, too,  was  dealt
with by Finlayson J.A. in Kalkanis, at p. 533:</pre>
    <pre>          
          In this court, the respondents sought to
          remedy this problem by moving to amend
          their pleadings &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          This amendment is exactly what is
          required to enable the court to deal
          with the disposition of this case at
          trial.  However, it is much too late.
</pre>
    <pre>(3)  General damages to Mrs. Vanek
</pre>
    <pre>[72]  In light of the answer in (1) above, the trial judge  erred
in awarding general damages of $2,500 to Mrs. Vanek.


(4)  General damages to Mr. Vanek
</pre>
    <pre>[73]  In light of the answer in (1) above, the trial judge  erred
in awarding general damages of $27,500 to Mr. Vanek.
</pre>
    <pre>(5)  Costs</pre>
    <pre>          
[74]  The trial judge awarded the plaintiffs their costs  of  the
action on &#147;an enhanced Party-and-Party scale&#148;, which he fixed  at
$35,000  inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.  In  light  of  my
disposition of the various substantive issues on the appeal, this
costs  order  cannot stand.  The plaintiff Eva Vanek was  awarded
damages of $2,000.  This component of the trial judge&#146;s order was
not appealed.  Accordingly, Eva Vanek is entitled to her costs of
the  action.  Those costs should be assessed, with the  following
observations  in  mind.   First,  the  trial  lasted  five  days.
Second,  the  defendants  and the third  party  did  not  concede
liability for the fact that the juice was contaminated until  the
end  of  the  trial.   Third, the first two observations  clearly
remove  this  case from the parameters of rule  57.05(1)  of  the
Rules  of  Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  Although  Eva
Vanek  recovered only $2,000 in this action, she is, in my  view,
certainly  entitled to recover her costs of the action.   Fourth,
in  Ontario  there are only two types of costs &#150;  party-and-party
and  solicitor-and-client. The factors set out in Rule 57 provide
sufficient  flexibility under either of these two  categories  of
costs.  There is not a need, therefore, to create a hybrid  scale
of &#145;enhanced&#146; party-and-party costs.
</pre>
    <pre>Cross-Appeal Issues
</pre>
    <pre>(6)  Aggravated damages
</pre>
    <pre>[75]  On  the facts of this case, there is no credible  basis  on
which aggravated damages should be considered.</pre>
    <pre>(7)  Pre-judgment interest rate</pre>
    <pre>[76]  The  defendants and the third party concede that the  trial
judge  set  an  incorrect  rate for  pre-judgment  interest.  The
correct rate is 5 percent, not 4 percent, per annum.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition
</pre>
    <pre>[77]  The  appeal is allowed. The judgment of the trial judge  is
varied as follows:
</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)  The plaintiff, Eva Vanek, by her litigation guardian
     Georgina Vanek, is entitled to recover $2,000 in general damages
     plus pre-judgment interest from the defendants and the third
     party;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>    (b)  The claims of the plaintiffs Ivan Vanek and Georgina Vanek,
         and the Family Law Act claim of the plainitff Eva Vanek, are
         dismissed; and</pre>
    <pre>    (c)  The plaintiff Eva Vanek is entitled to her costs of the
         action.
</pre>
    <pre>[78]  The  cross-appeal is allowed on the issue  of  pre-judgment
interest.   The judgment of the trial judge is varied to  provide
for pre-judgment interest calculated at the rate of 5 percent per
annum.</pre>
    <pre>[79] The appellants are entitled to their costs of the appeal, if
requested.  Success on the cross-appeal is divided.  Accordingly,
the parties will bear their own costs of the cross-appeal.

2 PUT IN CASE NUMBER &#150; NOT LOWER COURT NUMBERS
1   This  terminology is suggested in Linden, Canadian Tort  Law,
6th ed., (1997), at pp. 385-86:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Tort law was slow to grant protection to the interest in mental
tranquility.   The phrase &#147;nervous shock&#148;,  which  was  used to
describe this type of damage, is no longer in favour; it is now
preferable  to  refer  to  this  kind  of   loss   as
&#147;psychiatric damage&#148;, which  includes  &#147;all relevant forms  of
mental illness, neurosis and personality change&#148;.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>In  their  comprehensive treatise Tort Liability for  Psychiatric
Damage: The Law of &#147;Nervous Shock&#148; (1993),  Mullany and  Handford
employ  the terms &#145;psychiatric damage&#146;, &#145;psychiatric injury&#146;  and
&#145;psychiatric illness&#146;, a usage that has been adopted by the House
of  Lords: see, for example, Page v. Smith, [1995] 2 All  E.R.736
(H.L.).  Professor Fleming, in The Law of Torts, 9th ed., (1998),
uses the term &#145;psychiatric injury&#146;.
2  I do not use this word in a clinical sense.  Rather, I use it,
as Linden suggests, as encompassing &#147;all relevant forms of mental
illness,  neurosis  and  personality change&#148;.   See  footnote  1,
supra.
3 Named after the seminal decision of Lord Wilberforce in Anns v.
Merton London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.).
4  This  general test for duty, as incorporated by Wilson  J.  in
Kamloops  v.  Nielson  and applied by La Forest  J.  in  Winnipeg
Condominium at p. 113 is as follows:</pre>
    <pre>     1. is  there a sufficiently close relationship between the
        parties  &#133;so that, in the reasonable  contemplation  of
	[one person],   carelessness on  its   part might cause
        damage to [the other] person? If so,</pre>
    <pre>     2. are there any considerations which ought to negative or
        limit (a) the scope  of  the  duty and (b) the class of
	persons to whom it is owed or (c) the damages  to which
        a breach of it may give rise?

21, 1999.
6  Wilson J.A. wrote a separate concurring judgment on the  issue
of  the  son&#146;s recovery for psychiatric damage.  She agreed  with
Morden  J.A.&#146;s  analysis  and conclusion  on  the  issue  of  the
mother&#146;s recovery.</pre></td>
