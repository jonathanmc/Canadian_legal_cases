them.   The  relevant part of the information setting  forth  the

          RAMPERSAUD  by  stabbing  him  in  the   back
          numerous   times   thereby   committing    an
          aggravated assault contrary to section 268 of
          the Criminal Code of Canada.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[2]   At  the  conclusion of the Crown's case,  the  trial  judge
directed  a  verdict  of  acquittal  with  respect  to  Sakdavanh
Thongsavath.  Van Do Nguyen, whom the trial judge found to be the
actual  perpetrator of the offence, i.e. the one who stabbed  the
complainant  Rampersaud, was sentenced to a  term  of  15  months
imprisonment.   He has not appealed.  The trial  judge  convicted
the  appellants as parties to the offence under s. 21(2)  of  the
Criminal Code and, alternatively, under s. 21(1) of the Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[3]   The  appeals from conviction are based on two grounds:  (1)
that  the  convictions are unreasonable; and (2) that  the  trial
judge erred in her interpretation and application of s. 21(2)  of

course  of  submissions before us counsel for the respondent  did
not  seek  to justify the conviction on the basis of s. 21(1)  of
the Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE FACTS</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[4]  The following outline is based substantially on the overview
contained  in the respondent's factum, which is an accurate  one.
It  bears  only on the conduct of the two appellants and  not  of
that of their co-accused Nguyen.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          On  the  evening of March 10,  1996,  Camelia
          Harris celebrated her birthday by throwing  a
          party  for  her friends at the Star  Café  in
          Kitchener.  She reserved a room in the 3 room
          café,  and  paid for beer and  food  for  her
          guests.  In all, about 16 people came to  the
          party, most of whom did not arrive until some
          time  after  9:30  p.m.   Among  the  invited
          guests were the victim of the stabbing, Bobby
          Rampersaud,  his girlfriend,  Kim  Reidt  and
          their  friends Michael and &quot;Hammy&quot;, the  four
          accused, and several other young women.  Also
          present in the bar were its owner, Toan Tran,
          an  employee,  Hoa  Ha,  and  the  bartender,
          Chien.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The  party progressed uneventfully for a  few
          hours.   People  were drinking (mostly  beer,
          tequila and &quot;B-52s&quot;), dancing, and eating the
          finger  food  which  had  been  provided   by
          Camelia Harris.  Bobby Rampersaud watched the
          hockey  game for a while, and the party-goers
          generally enjoyed a good time.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Towards  closing time, Rampersaud  and  Reidt
          were  preparing to leave.  Reidt went to  the
          washroom, during which time Rampersaud  began
          verbally abusing the Appellants using  racist
          slurs.   Shortly  thereafter, Rampersaud  and
          one   of  the  Vietnamese  party-goers   came
          together,  and, according to some  witnesses,
          shook hands.  At that moment, Rampersaud  was
          attacked  from behind, causing  him  to  fall
          forward,  at  which point he was punched  and
          kicked from the front.  Rampersaud managed to
          grab  the neck of one of his assailants (whom
          the  trial judge determined was the Appellant
          Chanthaboury).    In  the   course   of   the
          struggle, Rampersaud was struck over the head
          with  a beer bottle, and stabbed in the  back
          seven times.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Some  of  the  women  at the  party,  notably
          Camelia Harris and Kim Reidt, tried to  break
          up  the  fight, in the course  of  which  the
          Appellant  Vang moved to hit Reidt  over  the
          head  with a beer bottle, but was stopped  by
          Camelia  Harris.  Harris managed to  separate
          the  combatants on at least one occasion, but
          the fight continued.  The police were called,
          and  when  the  fight ended,  Rampersaud  and
          Reidt  left the bar and went to their car  to
          wait  for  their friends Hammy  and  Michael.
          When  Rampersaud got into the car,  his  back
          felt   wet,  at  which  point  he  and  Reidt
          realized that Rampersaud had been stabbed  in
          the  back.  Kim Reidt got out of the  car  to
          find  their  friends,  at  which  point   the
          Appellant  Vang approached her and apologized
          for what had happened.  Rampersaud was driven
          to  the hospital, where he remained for  five
          days,  two and a half of which were spent  in
          intensive care.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Rampersaud's  lung  was  punctured,  and  his
          kidney   was  lacerated  causing  potentially
          fatal  internal bleeding.  The police arrived
          at the Star Café and spoke briefly to Camelia
          Harris, but left, not realizing that what had
          occurred was anything more than a run of  the
          mill bar fight.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          After  the  police left, the  Appellants  and
          several  other people from the party went  to
          Camelia  Harris' house.  There,  Chanthaboury
          told Harris that if she had not intervened in
          the fight, &quot;he'd a killed him&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[5]   Because  it bears upon the question of what the prosecution
must  prove to obtain a conviction under s. 21(2) of the Code  it
will  be  more convenient to deal with the second ground  of  the
appeal first.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">THE APPLICATION OF S. 21(2) OF THE CRIMINAL CODE</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[6]  This provision reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          21(2)      Where two or more persons form  an
          intention in common to carry out an  unlawful
          purpose and to assist each other therein  and
          any  one of them, in carrying out the  common
          purpose, commits an offence, each of them who
          knew   or  ought  to  have  known  that   the
          commission of the offence would be a probable
          consequence  of  carrying  out   the   common
          purpose is a party to that offence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">Section 268(1) reads:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          268(1)            Every   one   commits    an
          aggravated   assault   who   wounds,   maims,
          disfigures  or  endangers  the  life  of  the
          complainant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[7]   The  appellants  submit  that  the  trial  judge  erred  in
concluding  that  objective foreseeability  of  bodily  harm  was
sufficient  to  found  a  conviction as  a  party  to  aggravated
assault.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[8]  In her reasons the trial judge said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Based on the evidence before this Court, I am
          convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that each
          of    Nguyen,    Chanthaboury,    and    Vang
          participated in an assault on Rampersaud.   I
          make this finding on the basis of my findings
          of   fact  that  they  all  participated   in
          applying  force to him after he had made  the
          racial slurs.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[9]   She  then  found, based principally on admissions  made  by
Nguyen, that the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt  that
he  was  the  stabber and that he was guilty of  &quot;the  charge  as
laid&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[10] She continued her reasons as follows:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          With respect to Chanthaboury and Vang, I must
          consider whether they are parties to  the  s.
          268  offence as it is laid in that it alleges
          that  they  endangered Rampersaud's  life  by
          stabbing  him  several times.   There  is  no
          evidence to directly show that either one  of
          them   wielded   the  weapon   that   stabbed
          Rampersaud.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The  mental element that is required  for  s.
          268  is  objective foresight of bodily  harm.
          It  does not require an intention to endanger
          life.  The section deals with an assault that
          has the consequence of endangering life.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          On  the  evidence before me, there is nothing
          to  show  that Chanthaboury and Vang knew  of
          the   presence  of  any  weapon  capable   of
          inflicting  the  wounds that were  inflicted.
          There  is evidence that they participated  in
          the  assault, and that Vang at least  used  a
          beer bottle as part of the assault.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          There is here a common intention to carry out
          an  unlawful  purpose which  was  to  assault
          Rampersaud.   In carrying out  this  purpose,
          Nguyen stabs Rampersaud, thus endangering his
          life.   According to s. 21(2)  of  the  Code,
          Chanthaboury and Vang would be guilty of  the
          s.  268 offence, as parties, if they knew  or
          ought to have known that s. 268 offence would
          be a probable consequence of carrying out the
          common  purpose.   The issue,  then,  becomes
          whether they knew or ought to have known that
          as  a  probable consequence of  the  assault,
          Rampersaud's life would be endangered.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Actual  knowledge  of the  weapon  cannot  be
          imputed  to them on the basis of the evidence
          before me.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          Objectively, however, considering  that  they
          were  assaulting Rampersaud on the  basis  of
          three  against one, and that it was  apparent
          that  at least one type of weapon in the form
          of  a  beer bottle was being used during  the
          course  of  the fracas, there is a basis  for
          finding  that Chanthaboury and Vang knew,  or
          ought  to have known, that bodily harm  would
          be a probable consequence of the assault.  It
          is equally true to say that bodily harm would
          be objectively foreseeable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          This would, of course, mean that each of them
          could be found guilty of the included offence
          under s. 267(b) of the Code - assault causing
          bodily harm.  However, on the basis of R.  v.
          Godin  [(1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 574 (S.C.C.)],
          it  also  means  that  they  are  guilty,  as
          parties, to the offence under s. 268  of  the
          Code  -  i.e.,  endangering life,  since  the
          mental   element  there  is  also  &quot;objective
          foresight of bodily harm&quot;.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">(Although  in the middle of this quotation the trial  judge  says
that  the issue is whether they knew or ought to have known  that
as  a probable consequence of the assault Rampersaud's life would
be  endangered,  it  is  clear that her  decision  was  based  on
objective foreseeability of bodily harm.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[11]  The  appellants  submit  that  the  trial  judge  erred  in
confusing  the  mens rea for an offence under s.  268(1)  of  the
Criminal   Code  applicable  to  the  actual  perpetrator,   i.e.
objective foreseeability of bodily harm - decided in R. v.  Godin
-  referred  to in the trial judge's reasons, with the  mens  rea
requirement  applicable to a party.  Under the express  terms  of
s.  21(2), the appellants submit, to be a party one must have  at
least  objective foresight that &quot;the commission  of  the  offence
would  be  a  probable  consequence of carrying  out  the  common
purpose&quot;.   The  offence in question in this case was  aggravated
assault  by endangering life and the appellants submit  that  the
proper  test to apply in considering the application of s.  21(2)
would   be   to  determine  whether  the  completed  offence   of
endangering  life was objectively foreseeable from  the  vantage-
point of either appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[12] In R. v. Godin, Cory J. said for the Supreme Court of Canada
at p. 575:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The  mens rea required for s. 268(1)  of  the
          Criminal  Code,  R.S.C.  1985,  c.  C-46,  is
          objective  foresight of bodily harm.   It  is
          not  necessary  that there be  an  intent  to
          wound  or  maim  or disfigure.   The  section
          pertains   to   an  assault  that   has   the
          consequences   of   wounding,   maiming    or
          disfiguring.   This  result  flows  from  the
          decisions  of  the  court in  R.  v.  DeSousa
          (1992),  76 C.C.C. (3d) 124, 95 D.L.R.  (4th)
          595, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, and R. v. Creighton
          (1993),  83 C.C.C (3d) 346, 105 D.L.R.  (4th)
          632, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 3.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">This  sets  forth  a  part of the mens  rea  of  the  offence  of
aggravated  assault as far as the perpetrator is concerned.   (It
is  clear  that  in addition to the consequences of  the  assault
referred  to in this passage there is that of the endangering  of
life.)   The  full mens rea is the mens rea for  the  offence  of
assault and objective foreseeability of bodily harm.  Godin  must
be  read as implicitly overruling this court's decision in R.  v.
L.  (S.R.) (1992) 76 C.C.C. (3d) 502 which held that the state of
mind required for aggravated assault was the mens rea for assault
and  objective  foreseeability that  the  assault  subjected  the
complainant  to  the  risk,  as the case  may  be,  of  wounding,
maiming, disfiguring, or endangering life.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[13]  As  far as the mens rea of a party to the offence under  s.
21(2) is concerned, having regard to the terms of this provision,
the   plausibility  of  the  appellants'  submission   that   the
application  of  this provision would involve  the  determination
whether  the  completed  offence  of  endangering  of  life   was
objectively  foreseeable  from  the  vantage  point   of   either
appellant,  must  be  acknowledged. However,  I  think  that  the
submission  is answered by the judgment of the Supreme  Court  of
Canada in R. v. Jackson (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 385.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[14] In Jackson the accused was charged with murder.  The Crown's
theory  was that he and the co-accused intended to rob  and  kill
the  deceased.  McLachlin J., who wrote on behalf of  the  court,
said at pp. 393-94:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          This  leaves  the question of  the  mens  rea
          required   to   sustain  a   conviction   for
          manslaughter  under s. 21(2) of the  Criminal
          Code.   The Court of Appeal held that  to  be
          convicted of manslaughter under s.  21(2)  of
          the  Code, the Crown must establish that  the
          accused  knew  or  ought to have  known  that
          killing   short  of  murder  was  a  probable
          consequence  of  the pursuit  of  the  common
          unlawful purpose.  However, as was previously
          noted,  since  the  date  of  the  Court   of
          Appeal's  decision, this court has held  that
          manslaughter does not require that a risk  of
          death  be foreseeable; foreseeability of  the
          risk of harm is sufficient: Creighton, supra.
          This  court's  decision in  R.  v.  Trinneer,
          [1970]  3  C.C.C.  289, 10 D.L.R.  (3d)  568,
          [1970]  S.C.R.  638 (S.C.C.),  suggests  that
          there  is nothing inherent in s. 21(2)  which
          requires   a  higher  mens  rea  than   would
          otherwise  be  required for a conviction  for
          manslaughter.    There   the    court    held
          unanimously   that   an  accused   could   be
          convicted of constructive murder as  a  party
          to  that offence under the combination of ss.
          21(2)  and 230 (then s. 202) of the  Criminal
          Code,  without  the Crown  proving  that  the
          accused  knew or ought to have known that  it
          was  probable  death  would  ensue  from  the
          execution  of  the  common unlawful  purpose.
          While  it  would  no longer  be  possible  to
          convict  for  murder under s.  21(2)  without
          proof of subjective awareness of the risk  of
          death  (R.  v. Logan (1990), 58  C.C.C.  (3d)
          391, 73 D.L.R. (4th) 40, [1990] 2 S.C.R.  731
          (S.C.C.)), the reasoning in Trinneer, coupled
          with  Creighton,  supra,  suggests  that  the
          appropriate  mens rea for manslaughter  under
          s.  21(2) is objective awareness of the  risk
          of  harm.   It must follow that a  conviction
          for  manslaughter  under s.  21(2)  does  not
          require  foreseeability of  death,  but  only
          foreseeability of harm, which in fact results
          in death.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[15] Applying this reasoning to the issue before us, the question
is  whether  the  appellants, in engaging in the common  unlawful
purpose  of  assaulting Rampersaud, foresaw,  or  ought  to  have
foreseen, that bodily harm was a probable consequence of carrying
out  the  common  purpose.  If the answer is yes, then,  provided
Rampersaud's  injuries  did,  in fact,  endanger  his  life,  the
appellants are guilty of aggravated assault.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[16]  I  accept  the respondent's submission that the  appellants
assisted the stabber, Nguyen, and each other, three on one, in  a
fight  that  went beyond a mere &quot;fist fight&quot;.  The specific  harm
that  resulted  may not have been foreseeable, but  it  is  clear
that,  as  the  trial  judge found, bodily harm  was  objectively
foreseeable as a probable consequence of engaging in  the  fight.
Parties to the offence are bound by the consequences in the  same
manner as the actual perpetrator.  It has been held at common law
that  there are reasons of policy that justify why a party to  an
unlawful  joint enterprise may reasonably have a lower  level  of
mens  rea  than  the actual perpetrator.  (See R. v.  Powell  and
another;  R. v. English, [1997] 4 All E.R. 545 (H.L.) at 561-62.)
Accordingly, it is not unprincipled that the mens rea required of
a  party  to an aggravated assault under s. 21(2) should  be  the
same  as  that  required of the perpetrator.   I  note  that  the
foregoing  reasoning  is  in accord  with  that  of  the  British
Columbia Court of Appeal in R. v. Cuadra (1998), 125 C.C.C.  (3d)
289,  which  was concerned with liability for aggravated  assault
through s. 21(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[17]  The  appellants  relied upon  the  recent  House  of  Lords
decision  in  R.  v. English, an unlawful joint enterprise  case,
referred  to  above,  for  the  proposition  (I  quote  from  the
headnote)  that  the  &quot;secondary party would  not  be  guilty  of
murder,  however, where he intended or foresaw that  the  primary
party  would  or  might act with intent to cause grievous  bodily
harm  but  the  lethal act carried out by the primary  party  was
fundamentally different from the acts foreseen or intended by the
secondary party&quot;.  In English the appellant and another  man  had
taken  part  in a joint attack on a police officer in which  they
both  caused injury with wooden posts but the police officer died
from  fatal stab wounds inflicted by the other man.  English  was
convicted  of  murder.   The trial judge  directed  the  jury  to
convict of murder if they found that the accused had joined in an
unlawful  attack,  realising  at  the  time  that  there  was   a
substantial risk that the other man might kill the police officer
during  the attack, or at least cause some really serious  injury
to  him.  The House of Lords held that since the jury could  have
found  that English did not know that the other man had  a  knife
the  conviction of English was unsafe.  At page 566  Lord  Hutton
said:  &quot;[T]he unforeseen use of the knife would take the  killing
outside the scope of the joint venture.&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[18]  I  do  not  think that this reasoning is applicable  to  s.
21(2).   This provision's application does not turn on the  scope
of  the joint venture but , rather (except for offences which are
constitutionally  mandated to require  subjective  mens  rea)  on
objective foreseeability of the probability that one party to the
common  purpose would commit the consequent offence in the course
of  pursuing  the parties' common intention.  In this  regard,  I
would  think  that the method of infliction of the  bodily  harm,
i.e., what weapon, if any, was used to inflict bodily harm, would
not  be  of  fundamental  concern.  It could  be  significant  in
evidential   terms.   See  Clarkson,  &quot;Complicity,   Powell   and
Manslaughter&quot;, [1998] Crim. L.R. 556 at 558-59.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">UNREASONABLE VERDICT</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[19]  The appellants submit that three elements which have to  be
proven  for  party  liability under s. 21(2)  were  not  properly
proven in this case.  In my view, there was evidence relating  to
each  element that was reasonably capable of supporting the trial
judge's  finding with respect to it.  I shall now  set  forth  my
reasons for this general conclusion.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">     (a)  Insufficient evidence of intention in common</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[20]  The  appellants submit that there was no specific  evidence
that the appellants formed an intention with Nguyen to carry  out
the  unlawful purpose of assaulting Rampersaud and to assist each
other  in doing so.  They submit that at its highest the evidence
was  that a chaotic melee broke out and that the appellants  were
involved,  as  were several others.  Further, in so  far  as  the
appellants  were  concerned, the fight was  consensual  or  even,
possibly, the appellants were acting in self defence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[21] The evidence showed that each of the appellants participated
in an assault on Rampersaud after he had made racial slurs toward
them, and that Vang, at least, used a beer bottle as part of  the
assault.  It was a three on one fight that included the use of  a
beer bottle.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[22] The chief witness who identified the appellants as attackers
of  Rampersaud, with Nguyen was Camellia Harris.  Her evidence is
attacked  by  the  appellants  mainly  on  the  ground   of   her
intoxication at the time in question.  The trial judge was  alive
to this potential vulnerability in her evidence.  She said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          [Harris]  tended to present  herself  as  the
          hero of the event, and her description of the
          alcohol  she  had consumed on  the  night  in
          question   seemed   to  reach   near   mythic
          proportions.   However,  having  said   that,
          other  witnesses also described her  role  in
          semi-heroic  terms indicating that  she  held
          off   the   combatants.    Moreover,   no-one
          indicated  that  she was intoxicated  to  the
          degree that she would be unreliable, and this
          included  the  police  officer  who  attended
          immediately  after  the  stabbing  had  taken
          place.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">The  trial judge found Camellia Harris's evidence to be generally
credible.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[23]  With  respect to the appellants' submission that the  fight
was  consensual  or  that  the appellants  were  acting  in  self
defence,  in  the absence of evidence from either of them,  there
was   no   evidence   reasonably  supporting  either   of   these
possibilities.   Even  if  the  fight  could  be   described   as
consensual,  it  is  clear that there can  be  no  legally  valid
consent to a fight where serious hurt or non-trivial bodily  harm
results.  R. v. Jobidon (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 454 (S.C.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[24]  Further,  as far as the intention in common  is  concerned,
this  phrase  means no more than that two (or more) persons  must
have in mind the same unlawful purpose.  The common intention may
not  be  formed or articulated in advance of the action, but  may
arise  at the instant of the offence being committed, the  mutual
intention  to  pursue unlawful purpose and to assist  each  other
therein being formed at the very moment of carrying it out.   See
Rose, Parties to an Offence (1982) at pp. 67-68.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[25]  It  is clear that there was sufficient evidence  of  common
intention  to  satisfy the requirements of s. 21(2).   The  three
accused were bent on attacking only Rampersaud as a result of the
racial  slurs  he  directed at them.  Even  if  the  assault  was
commenced  by  only  one  party, once the appellants  joined  the
attack  they  can properly be found to have engaged in  a  common
purpose  to assault Rampersaud and to assist each other  therein.
The  trial  judge accepted Camellia Harris's evidence as  to  the
roles  played by each accused.  She testified that the appellants
were punching and kicking Rampersaud simultaneously.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">     (b)  There was insufficient evidence that the stabbing  took
          place &quot;in carrying out the common unlawful purpose&quot;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[26]  The  appellants submit that there was very little  evidence
that  the  stabbing was inflicted at the time when the appellants
were engaged in the assault on Rampersaud.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[27]  Two  witnesses, Constable Camilo and Hoa Ha, both  observed
blood  drops inside the Star Café in the approximate area of  the
fight.   Rampersaud and Reidt testified that they  went  directly
from  the cafe to their car, at which point Rampersaud said  that
he  was  not  feeling well and they realized  that  he  had  been
stabbed.   There  was no evidence to suggest  that  the  stabbing
occurred  anywhere other than in the Star Café during the  course
of the assault.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">     (c)  There  was  insufficient evidence to support a  finding
          that  the  appellants  ought to  have  known  that  the
          endangerment  of  Rampersaud's  life  was  a   probable
          consequence of carrying out of the unlawful purpose.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[28]  This  submission has been dealt with  above  largely  as  a
question   of  law.   There  was  no  requirement  of   objective
foreseeability of the endangerment of Rampersaud's life - only of
bodily  harm  to him.  Based on the three on one  nature  of  the
assault,  with  the  use  of  the beer  bottle,  the  finding  of
objective foreseeability of bodily harm was reasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">SENTENCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[29] Each of the appellants received a ten-month sentence for his
conviction  of  aggravated assault, and a one  month  consecutive
sentence for convictions of breach of recognizance.  They seek to
appeal the ten-month sentences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[30]  The  appellants submit that the sentences  were  harsh  and
excessive considering that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">     (a)   neither appellant stabbed the complainant or knew that
a knife was present;</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">     (b)  both  appellants  had  only  one  prior  offence,  both
          unrelated and relatively minor;
     (c)  the   fight  giving  rise  to  the  stabbing   of   the
          complainant    was   apparently   provoked    by    the
          complainant's racist slurs and the racist  attitude  of
          the  complainant  was reflected in  his  victim  impact
          statement;
     (d)  the  lack  of  disparity from the sentence  of  fifteen
          months imposed on the stabber, Nguyen.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[31]  The  trial judge's reasons for sentence are  extensive  and
detailed.   She  considered her findings of fact  underlying  the
conviction, the pre-sentence reports prepared on behalf  of  each
of  the  appellants, the victim impact statements,  the  relevant
case law, and the submissions of counsel.  In the central part of
her reasons she said:</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          In my view, the most important aspects of the
          purposes of sentencing to be served here  are
          to denounce this kind of conduct and to deter
          both  these offenders and other persons  from
          committing  similar  offences.   Weight  must
          also  be given to the need to separate  these
          offenders   from  society.   The   issue   of
          rehabilitation  is,  in these  circumstances,
          diminished by the failure of the offenders to
          accept responsibility for their conduct.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The  aggravating circumstances of the offence
          before  the  court include the fact  that  it
          involved  three  people  ganging  up  on  and
          assaulting  the victim, and that it  resulted
          in  seven  stab  wounds to the victim,  which
          could  well  have been fatal.   There  is  no
          sense   of   remorse  from  either   of   the
          defendants with respect to the injury  caused
          to  Mr. Rampersaud.  The &quot;apology&quot; offered by
          Mr.  Vang to Ms. Reidt very shortly after the
          assault   is,  without  explanation,  equally
          consistent with an apology to her that he had
          hit  her, and hardly an expression of remorse
          or   regret  regarding  the  injury  to   Mr.
          Rampersaud.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">          The mitigating circumstances include the fact
          that the attack was not planned and cannot be
          said to be entirely unprovoked, in that there
          were  apparently  racial slurs  made  at  the
          time.   Whatever  was said  cannot,  however,
          afford  any justification for the  attack  on
          the  victim.   The response was  out  of  all
          proportion    to   the   victim's    actions,
          notwithstanding  that the casting  of  racial
          slurs is unacceptable in our society.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[32]  Counsel  for  the  appellants asked that  the  trial  judge
consider terms in the range of six to nine months and counsel for
the  Crown  submitted  that terms of  one  year  each  should  be
imposed.   The trial judge accepted that, based on the background
of  the  two appellants and their respective roles, there was  no
reason  to  differentiate between them on the length of sentence.
She  then considered and rejected a submission on behalf  of  the
appellants  that a conditional sentence would be appropriate  and
imposed the ten-month sentences.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[33]  Having  regard  to  the governing principles  of  appellate
review  of  sentences,  I  do not think that  the  trial  judge's
reasons  indicate any error in principle or in the  consideration
or  weighing of relevant factors.  Further, particularly in light
of  the range of sentence suggested to her on each side, it would
be   difficult  to  conclude  that  the  sentences  were  clearly
unreasonable.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[34]  I  must say, having regard to the fact that the  appellants
did  not use the knife or even know that it was present, that  it
appears  to  me  that  there is a reasonable  argument  that  the
difference between their sentences and the fifteen-month sentence
imposed on Nguyen does  not reflect the relative gravity of their
respective roles.  I do not think, however, that in the light  of
the  other considerations to which I have referred (as well, with
respect,  to the possibility that the sentence imposed on  Nguyen
may  have  been  unduly lenient) the insufficient  difference  in
itself  is  a  proper  basis for interfering with  the  sentences
imposed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">DISPOSITION</font></pre>
    <pre><font size="3" face="Courier New">[35]  For  the reasons I have given, I would dismiss the  appeals
from conviction, grant leave to appeal the sentences, but dismiss
the appeals from sentence.
