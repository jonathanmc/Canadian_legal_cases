    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Killeen J. dated April 3, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BORINS J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is an appeal by the plaintiff from a summary judgment
granted  by Killeen J. on a Rule 20 motion brought by  the  third
parties dismissing the plaintiff&#146;s claim for damages against  the
defendants.   The  third  parties also moved,  pursuant  to  rule
21.01(1)(b)  to strike out the third party claim  on  the  ground
that it discloses no reasonable cause of action.  The reasons for
judgment of Killeen J. are reported in (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 716.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[2]   On  May  17,  1986, the plaintiff was injured  in  a  motor
vehicle  accident  while a passenger in a car  driven  by  Rhonda
Rawlins.  The  car was owned by Williams Rawlins.  Following  the
accident, the plaintiff received medical treatment from a  number
of  physicians, including the defendants in this proceeding, Drs.
Wright and Cheng, who treated her on May 22, 1986.
[3]  In April, 1988, the plaintiff&#146;s lawyer negotiated a
settlement of her claim against the Rawlins for about $24,000,
including costs.  In accepting the settlement, the plaintiff was
required to sign what the motions judge described as a standard
form release of liability.  In consideration of her receipt of
the amount of the settlement, the plaintiff released and
discharged the Rawlins from any claims which she and her heirs,
executors, administrators and assigns might bring against them in
consequence of the motor vehicle accident.
[4]  The release contained the following provision which is
central to the resolution of the issue presented by this appeal:
          </pre>
    <pre>               AND FOR THE SAID CONSIDERATION it is further agreed not to
          make claim or take proceedings against any other person or
          corporation who might claim contribution or indemnity under the
          provisions of any statute or otherwise.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Subsequent  to  the date of the settlement,  the  plaintiff
experienced  continuous  neck pain.  In  May,  1992,  she  sought
medical advice which disclosed a significant dislocation  of  the
odontoid  process  at  the  C.2  level.   As  a  result  of  this
diagnosis,  a  C1-2 fusion procedure was performed  on  June  20,
1992.
[6]  In colloquial language, the plaintiff had sustained a broken
neck as a result of the accident.  This had not been recognized
by Drs. Wright and Cheng when they treated her in May, 1986.  In
the opinions of Drs. Marshall and Bailey, which formed part of
the evidence before Killeen J., Drs. Wright and Cheng were
negligent in their treatment of the plaintiff.  There was no
evidence before the motions judge that refuted the opinions of
Drs. Marshall and Bailey.
[7]  On June 16, 1993 the plaintiff issued her statement of claim
against Drs. Wright and Cheng seeking damages for negligence, or
breach of contract, in failing to diagnose the true nature of the
injuries she had sustained as a result of the accident.  Although
the doctors have not admitted liability, it appears from the
motion record that it is not in issue.  Indeed, pursuant to a
request to admit, the doctors have admitted that:
          </pre>
    <pre>               There was a contract between the Plaintiff and Dr. D. L.
          Wright and Dr. S. W. Cheng, which contract contained a provision
          whereby the medical doctors agreed to provide care, treatment and
          services in a careful, competent and diligent manner which met
          the standard required of a prudent physician practising in their
          respective specialties.</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The  pleadings  in these proceedings have  now  reached  50
pages.   It  is helpful to review them insofar as they relate  to
this appeal.
[9]  In their statement of defence the defendants, in my view
properly, place no reliance on the release.  They have defended
the plaintiff&#146;s claim on the ground that they were not negligent.
[10] On April 21, 1996, Drs. Wright and Cheng issued a third
party claim against the Rawlins, seeking contribution and
indemnity from them in the event the doctors were found at fault,
in reliance on ss. 2 and 5 of the Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c.N.1.  They plead that if the plaintiff sustained damages as a
result of their negligence, the damages were caused or
contributed to by the negligence of Rhonda Rawlins, for which
William Rawlins is liable.
[11] In addition to defending the third party claim, the Rawlins
entered a defence to the main action.  As well as defending the
main action in respect to the quantum of damages sought by the
plaintiff, they entered a defence based on the settlement of the
plaintiff&#146;s claim arising from the May 17, 1986 accident and the
final release which she signed in exchange for the settlement
funds.  After setting out the provision of the release which is
central to this appeal, they plead that as a result of the
settlement and the release the plaintiff is estopped or barred
from proceeding with her claim against Drs. Wright and Cheng.  In
addition to her defence of the main action, Rhonda Rawlins
counterclaimed against the plaintiff for damages of $750,000 for
breach of contract on the ground that in bringing a claim against
the doctors, the plaintiff had breached the provision in the
release.
[12] As I will return to it later, it is important to recognize
that while rule 29.05(1) permits a third party to enter a defence
to the main action, the third party is limited to pleading a
defence that is open to the defendant in the main action.
[13] In her statement of defence to Rhonda Rawlins&#146; counterclaim,
the plaintiff pleads that the release was &#147;void ab initio as it
was based on a mutual mistake going to the root of the contract
and/or contravenes public policy and/or is unconscionable&#148;.  She
also counterclaimed against Ms. Rawlins seeking a declaration
that the release was void ab initio, or, in the alternative, does
not preclude her from suing Drs. Wright and Cheng, and, on the
assumption that the release is set aside, claims damages of
$600,000.
[14] The third parties then moved for alternative relief.  First,
they sought an order, under rule 20.04(2), for summary judgment
dismissing the plaintiff&#146;s claim against the doctors on the
ground that there was no genuine issue for trial because the
effect of the provision of the release was to preclude the
plaintiff from suing the doctors.  Presumably, this branch of the
motion was brought under rule 29.05(2)(a) which gives a third
party that has defended the main action &#147;the same rights&#133;in the
main action&#148; as the defendant in the main action.
[15] In the alternative, they sought an order striking out the
third party claim under rule 21.01(1)(b), on the ground that it
discloses no reasonable cause of action.  It is to be noted that
pursuant to rule 21.01(1)(b) no evidence is admissible on such a
motion.  The court is required to consider the substantive
adequacy of the third party claim on the assumption that the
facts as stated in it can be proved and to determine whether it
is &#147;plain and obvious&#148; that the pleading discloses no reasonable
cause of action:  Hunt v. Carey Canada Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959.
[16] Killeen J. granted the motion for summary judgment and
dismissed the plaintiff&#146;s claim against Drs. Wright and Cheng on
the ground that it disclosed no genuine issue for trial.  It was
his view the plaintiff&#146;s release of the Rawlins precluded her
from issuing a claim against her treating physicians.  As a
result of the effect of the dismissal of the plaintiff&#146;s claim,
he found it unnecessary to deal with the Rawlins&#146; rule
21.01(1)(b) motion.
[17] The plaintiff has appealed from the summary judgment
dismissing her claim against her doctors.  The doctors, although
acknowledging that the result of the Rawlins&#146; Rule 20 motion is a
windfall, support the Rawlins in seeking to uphold the summary
judgment.  The Rawlins do not appeal from the motions judge&#146;s
disposition of their rule 21.01(1)(b) motion.

</pre>
    <pre>REASONS OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</pre>
    <pre>[18] The position taken by counsel for the Rawlins before Killeen
J.  was that the release signed by the plaintiff was binding  and
enforceable  against  her and precluded her  from  bringing  this
proceeding  against  her  treating  physicians.   Counsel  placed
particular  reliance  on  the provision by  which  the  plaintiff
agreed  not  to  make  any claim &#147;against  any  other  person  or
corporation who might claim contribution or indemnity  under  the
provisions  of any statute or otherwise&#148;.  [Emphasis  added]   As
well,  counsel  relied on the final paragraph of the  release  in
which the plaintiff accepted the proceeds of the settlement as  a
&#147;full  and  final  compromise, adjustment and settlement  of  all
claims  for injuries, losses and damages resulting or  to  result
from the said accident&#148;.
[19] The motions judge gave effect to this position, relying on
the reasons for judgment of Sutherland J. in Ysselstein v. Tallon
(1992), 18 C.P.C. (3d) 110 (Ont. Gen. Div.), which was very
similar on its facts to those of this appeal.
[20] Ms. Ysselstein was injured in a motor vehicle accident
caused by the negligence of her driver.  She suffered a neck
injury.  She settled her claim against her driver and signed a
release which included a contribution-indemnity provision in
virtually identical language to the provision in this appeal.
Later it was discovered that her treating physicians had failed
to diagnose a neck fracture.  She sued them for damages in
negligence.  In their statement of defence, unlike the doctors&#146;
defence in this appeal, the doctors asserted that Ms.
Ysselstein&#146;s claim was precluded by the final release of her
claim against her driver.  The doctors issued a third party claim
against the driver for contribution and indemnity. The driver
entered a defence to the main action asserting, in reliance on
the provision of the release, that the plaintiff had breached her
contract with the driver in suing her doctors.  As in these
proceedings, the third party then moved under rule 20.04(2) for
summary judgment dismissing the plaintiff&#146;s claim against the
doctors, and, in the alternative for an order striking out the
third party claim pursuant to rule 21.01(1)(b).  Relying on the
provision in the release, Sutherland J. granted the motion for
summary judgment and dismissed the main action.
[21] In his reasons, Sutherland J. first disposed of the third
party&#146;s rule 21.01(1)(b) motion to strike out the third party
claim for failing to disclose a reasonable cause of action.  He
dismissed the motion on the ground that were the plaintiff to
succeed against her doctors, they would be entitled to recover
contribution or indemnity from the third party driver on the
basis that she &#147;[was] or may be wholly or partly responsible for
the damages claimed&#148;, within the meaning of s.5 of the Negligence
Act.  Sutherland J. then used this finding in reaching his
conclusion on the third party&#146;s Rule 20 motion.
[22] Sutherland J. appears to have approached the motion for
summary judgment on the basis of rule 20.04(4), which permits the
court to determine a question of law where there is no genuine
issue for trial in respect to the facts, and the only genuine
issue is a question of law.  In doing so, he observed that the
plaintiff had not challenged that the release precluded her from
asserting further claims against the third party in respect to
the accident.  He also noted that the plaintiff had advanced
three grounds which disentitled the defendant doctors to the
benefit of any protection from the release.  In my view, it
appears that the principle ground advanced by the plaintiff was
that the doctors were not entitled to enforce the release as they
were not parties to it.  However, Sutherland J. found no merit in
law in this, or any of the other, contentions advanced by the
plaintiff.
[23] Sutherland J.&#146;s reasons for granting summary judgment are
summarized in the following passages at p.135:
          </pre>
    <pre>               There is no reason why the third party should not be allowed
          to enforce the terms of the settlement and of the Final Release.
          </pre>
    <pre>                                                   &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Once  it is determined, as it has been,
          that  the defendants when sued in this action
          have  the  right  to  claim  contribution  or
          indemnity  from  the third  party  the  Final
          Release is engaged, with the result that  the
          third   party  is  entitled  to  a   judgment
          dismissing  the action against the defendants
          on   the  ground  that  whatever  rights  the
          plaintiff may have had against the defendants
          were  bargained  away in the  settlement,  as
          clearly  expressed in the broad and inclusive
          terms of the Final Release.
          </pre>
    <pre>                                                   &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Among  the things bargained for by  the
          third party, as part of the consideration for
          the  settlement moneys paid to the plaintiff,
          was  the  right  not to have  to  defend  any
          claims   arising  in  connection   with   the
          accident.  She bought and paid for  peace  in
          that  regard, and she is entitled in  law  to
          have it.</pre>
    <pre>[24] In reaching the conclusion that the third party was entitled
to  enforce the release to preclude the plaintiff&#146;s claim against
her  treating  physicians,  Sutherland  J.  applied  a  line   of
authorities including Athabasca Realty Co. v. Foster  (1982),  18
Alta.  L.R. (2d) 385 (C.A.) &#150; a decision which was relied on,  as
well, by Killeen J.  In my view, these authorities do not support
the  reasoning  of  Sutherland J. and the  result  based  on  his
reasoning.   Athabasca, and the other authorities  relied  on  by
Sutherland J., support the well-established policy in  favour  of
upholding and enforcing settlements agreed upon by litigants,  or
potential litigants, absent evidence of fraud, mistake of fact or
unconscionability.  The singular feature of these cases concerned
whether  an injured party had sufficient grounds to set  aside  a
settlement entered into with the party who caused the injury when
it  was  discovered  subsequently that  the  injuries  were  more
serious than believed when the settlement was reached.  They  did
not  deal with the issue in this appeal &#150; whether the person  who
caused  the injury is entitled to enforce a negative promise  not
to  sue  another person in circumstances where the  promisor  has
sued another person.
[25] Killeen J. applied the result in Ysselstein to the
resolution of the third party&#146;s motion for a summary judgment
dismissing the plaintiff&#146;s claim against her treating physicians.
His reasons for granting summary judgment are found at pp.723-24:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Mr. Schenke, in his able argument for the plaintiff, has
          attempted to distinguish Ysselstein by arguing (1) its release
          was far broader than the release here; (2) it is simply wrongly
          decided; or (3) this is a case of mutual mistake under the
          subject release.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  recognize that there are differences
          in the language of the Ysselstein release but
          cannot   conclude   that  these   differences
          justify   the  conclusion  that  the  subject
          release is not a complete bar to this action.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The language of the release is broad and
          unambiguous  in  its reach.  It  purports  to
          cover  &#147;all  claims for injuries, losses  and
          damages resulting or to result from the  said
          accident&#148;   and,   in  its  contribution-and-
          indemnity      proviso,     the     plaintiff
          unequivocally agrees not to start  an  action
          against  anyone &#147;who might claim contribution
          or  indemnity&#148;.  Yet the plaintiff  has  done
          just  that  in suing these doctors for  their
          failure  to  diagnose the neck  fracture  she
          indisputably suffered in the accident.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  can  see  no reason in principle  or
          policy why the third parties here should  not
          be able to bring this motion under Rule 20 to
          enforce  this broad and fair release  against
          its  maker.   Ms. Van Patter had  independent
          legal  advice throughout and there is  simply
          no   evidence   of   coercion,   absence   of
          comprehension or mistake.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  third parties, and their  insurer,
          entered  into  the settlement agreement  with
          Ms. Van Patter to buy complete peace, whether
          from  direct or side-winds, and, as it  seems
          to  me,  they  are entitled  to  enforce  the
          release even if the defendant doctors  become
          indirect  beneficiaries of their  motion  for
          dismissal of the action.
          </pre>
    <pre>                                                   &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  many  cases  in  the  law  reports
          dealing with settlement releases may seem  to
          have  sharp  edges but their thrust  is  that
          absent  fraud, overreaching or  some  similar
          equitable consideration, the release must  be
          given  its  due.  Typical of these  cases  is
          Athabasca  Realty  Co. v. Foster  (1982),  18
          Alta.  L.R.  (2d) 385 at p. 394,  132  D.L.R.
          (3d)  556  (C.A.) where, Laycraft  J.A.  says
          this:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     While a settlement extends only to
               subjects  which  the  parties  have   in
               contemplation, a settlement may  not  be
               avoided because the damages arising under one
               of the headings contemplated is greater than
               expected.  Where, for example,  a  party
               settles a claim for personal injuries and
               later finds he was injured more seriously
               than he thought, a settlement is binding:
               Thornburn v. Danforth Bus Lines Ltd., [1955]
               O.R. 494, [1955] I.L.R. 1-188, and Tucker v.
               Moerman, [1970] 2 O.R. 775, 12 D.L.R. (3d)
               119.</pre>
    <pre>As  I  have noted, in my view, Athabasca and the cases  which  it
followed have no application to the circumstances of this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>THE ISSUE</pre>
    <pre>[26]  In  my  view, it is important to define the  issue  in  the
context  of  the proceedings before Killeen J. in  which  he  was
required  to determine whether the third parties had established,
as a question of law, that there was no genuine issue to be tried
as  to  whether  the  doctors  caused,  or  contributed  to,  the
plaintiff&#146;s  injuries by their negligence or breach of  contract.
This  was  the narrow issue presented by the motion  for  summary
judgment.   In  this  context, the issue  before  this  court  is
whether  the  motions  judge was correct in concluding  that  the
third party could enforce the plaintiff&#146;s negative promise not to
sue  another person who might seek contribution or indemnity from
the third party by precluding the plaintiff from claiming damages
from  Drs. Wright and Cheng.  For the reasons that follow, it  is
my view that the motions judge erred in reaching this conclusion.
[27] It is equally important, considering the context of the
proceedings before Killeen J., to indicate what is not in issue
on this appeal.  I do so because counsel for the parties raised a
number of issues which it appears they would like this court to
resolve, which arise for the most part from the extensive
pleadings in these proceedings.  These issues include the
relative degrees of fault of the doctors and Rhonda Rawlins,
whether damages can be apportioned at common law where an injured
person&#146;s damages are caused by the negligence of one person and
the breach of contract of another, setting aside the settlement
on the ground of mutual mistake or unconscionability, whether the
conduct of the doctors constituted a novus actus interveniens,
whether the third party claim should be struck out for failing to
state a reasonable claim and some form of direction in respect to
what credit should be given to the third parties for the amount
of the settlement in the event they are required to contribute to
any damages the plaintiff may recover from the doctors.  The
narrow focus of this appeal precludes any consideration of these
issues.  They have no bearing on whether Killeen J. was correct
in granting a summary judgment dismissing the main action.  In
any event, as there is to be a trial, most of the issues are
properly the concern of the trial judge.  As Killeen J. found it
unnecessary to decide whether the third party claim should be
struck out pursuant to rule 21.01(1)(b), it is not appropriate
for this court to deal with this question.



</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[28]  In  my view, there are two related reasons why this  appeal
must  succeed and the plaintiff be permitted to pursue her  claim
against  her treating physicians.  The first reason is  found  in
the  law of contract.  The second, arises from the Rules of Civil
Procedure.
[29] The position of counsel for the plaintiff is based on the
doctrine of privity of contract.  As the release is a contract
between the plaintiff and Rhonda Rawlins and William Rawlins,
Drs. Wright and Cheng acquire no rights under that contract.
Indeed, counsel for the doctors made a number of significant
concessions.  She conceded that the doctors did not plead the
release in their defence to the plaintiff&#146;s claim because they
were not parties to it and derived no rights under it.  For the
same reason, she agreed that the doctors would have been
unsuccessful if they had sought to obtain a summary judgment in
reliance on the release.  Nevertheless, she sought to uphold the
result reached by Killeen J.
[30] Counsel for the third parties was equally candid in her
submissions.  In essence, while stating that she could not take
issue with the dismissal of the plaintiff&#146;s claim, counsel took
no position on the plaintiff&#146;s appeal.  Her position was that the
third parties wished to be let out of the dispute between the
plaintiff and the doctors, and she did not really care how this
result was achieved, even if it meant the dismissal of the
plaintiff&#146;s claim.  This position is not surprising given that
the apparent purpose of the provision in the release is to
protect the Rawlins from being made a party to any further claim
brought by the plaintiff arising from the accident, and to
protect them from having to pay more than they have already paid
the plaintiff in consideration for the release.
[31] In my view, the position of the plaintiff is correct and it
is unnecessary to deal with it extensively.  Although the
doctrine of privity of contract has come under academic criticism
and a number of exceptions to it have been developed by the
courts1, it dates back to Tweddle v. Atkinson (1861), 1 B. &amp; S.
393 when it became firmly established.  The doctrine received the
approval of the House of Lords in Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. Ltd.
v. Selfridge &amp; Co. Ltd., [1915] A.C. 847, in which Lord Haldane
L.C. said at 853:
          </pre>
    <pre>               [I]n the law of England certain principles are fundamental.
          One is that only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on
          it.</pre>
    <pre>The doctrine of privity of contract, therefore, may be stated  as
follows:  a contract cannot (as a general rule) confer rights  or
impose  obligations  arising under it on any  person  except  the
parties  to  it.   In  the leading modern authority,  Beswick  v.
Beswick,   [1968]  A.C.  58  (H.L.),  all  speeches  assume   the
correctness of the commonly accepted view that a contract can  be
enforced only by the parties to it.</pre>
    <pre>[32]  Neither  Sutherland  J., nor  Killeen  J.,  considered  the
doctrine of privity of contract.  Simply put, as the doctors were
not parties to the release, they derived no rights under it.  The
release  does  not give the doctors a defence to the  plaintiff&#146;s
claim.
[33] The motions judge did not give effect to the position of the
plaintiff based on the doctrine of privity of contract.  As I
have indicated, the authorities relied on by the court in
Ysselstein, which by implication were relied on by Killeen J.,
support neither the result reached in Ysselstein nor in this
proceeding.  Rule 29.05(2)(a), which I will assume is the
authority under which the third parties moved for summary
judgment, does not change the onus of the moving party to
establish that no genuine issue for trial exists.  In the context
of these proceedings, by bringing a Rule 20 motion to dismiss the
main action, the third party necessarily steps into the shoes of
the defendant in the main action.  As I have observed, rule
29.05(1) limits the third party to defences available to the
defendant.  Counsel for the defendants has conceded &#150; correctly,
in my view &#150; that the doctrine of privity of contract would
preclude the success of a motion by them for summary judgment in
reliance on the release.  It follows that in respect to both
their defence to the main action and their motion for summary
judgment, the third parties cannot be in a better position than
the defendants.
[34] This brings me to the second, and procedural, reason why the
appeal must succeed.  The result obtained by the third parties on
their Rule 20 motion flowed from a significant procedural error
on their part.  By reading together rule 29.05(2)(a) and rule
20.01(3), the remedy available to a third party to move for
summary judgment to dismiss the main action derives from its
delivery of a statement of defence, which is permitted by rule
29.05(1).  It does not derive, as Sutherland J. thought in
Ysselstein, from rule 20.09, which applies to a motion for
summary judgment to dismiss a third party claim.  However, rule
29.05(1) limits a third party&#146;s  defence to the main action to
&#147;any defence open to the defendant&#148;.  The third parties&#146; defence
to the main action &#150; based on the release which the plaintiff
signed &#150; was not a defence to the main action open to the
defendants.  Although the plaintiff has not moved to strike this
defence, as it was not a defence open to the third parties, it
could provide neither a defence which they were entitled to
plead, nor the foundation for the motion judge&#146;s dismissal of the
main action.  This is because rule 21.01(3) requires the delivery
of a statement of defence as a condition precedent to bringing a
motion for summary judgment.
[35] In the final analysis, what emerged clearly from the
positions of the plaintiff and the third parties is the
following.  The plaintiff does not want to be deprived of her
access to the courts to assert, what she believes to be, a
meritorious claim against the doctors.  On the other hand, the
third parties wish to avail themselves of the provision in the
release which they believe immunizes them from further
litigation, and financial exposure, arising from the accident.
In this regard, I believe that it may be helpful to bear in mind
in respect to what may follow, that the plaintiff has
acknowledged, through her counsel, that by virtue of the release
she has no further claim against the third parties and that
should she enjoy recovery from the doctors, any award of damages
should exclude any damages for which the doctors could claim
indemnity.  We need not decide what cost consequences might flow
from the pursuit of the third party claim in these circumstances.
Nor would it be appropriate for us to pronounce on the third
parties&#146; rule 21.01(1)(b) motion, given that Killeen J. did not
address it.  Presumably, it is now open to the third parties to
return this motion for determination on the merits.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[36]  In the result, the appeal is allowed.  The summary judgment
is set aside and there will be an order dismissing the motion for
summary judgment.  The plaintiff is entitled to her costs of  the
motion and the appeal.
