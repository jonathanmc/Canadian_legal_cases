    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The motions judge was entitled to consider the documents
referred to in the statement of claim.  Since they were pleaded
and relied upon by the appellant, any Criminal Code protection
was lost.  In view of the entire record and the nature of the
allegations, significant aspects of which are explicitly
speculative on the face of the pleadings, there was an adequate
basis for the motions judge to conclude that the action is
frivolous and vexatious.
[2]  For the same reasons, we would not interfere with the motion
judge&#146;s decision not to permit the adding of 9 new defendants.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed with costs fixed in the amount of
$500.00 per respondent ($1,500.00 in total).</pre></td>
