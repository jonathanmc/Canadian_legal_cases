    <pre>On appeal from the Order of Wein J. dated March 5, 1999</pre>
    <pre>FELDMAN J.A.:  (Dissenting)</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This appeal arises out of a ruling made by Hawke J. in the
course of a preliminary inquiry. The Crown sought prohibition in
the Superior Court on the basis that the provincial court judge
had lost jurisdiction by failing to follow the mandatory
requirements of s. 276 of the Criminal Code R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.
Wein J. upheld the decision below and refused the order of
prohibition. The Crown appeals from the order of Wein J.
[2]  The issue arose in the following circumstances. The
information charges the accused with two counts of assault, two
counts of uttering death threats and four counts of sexual
assault against his spouse. Three of the sexual assault counts
are alleged to have taken place within the time span of the
marriage between July, 1986 and August, 1997 but without
particularizing dates.
[3]  The preliminary inquiry began in August, 1998 but was
adjourned following the complainant&#146;s examination-in-chief to
January, 1999 while the complainant gave birth to her third
child. Before returning to continue her testimony, the
complainant read the transcript of her examination and reported
to the Crown that she had made some errors including an error as
to the date of the first occurrence of non-consensual anal
intercourse. Disclosure was made to the defense. The preliminary
hearing judge ruled that the corrections would not be made before
the commencement of the cross-examination but the matters could
be addressed in re-examination if the evidence was not adduced in
cross-examination.
[4]  In examination-in-chief the complainant had been asked about
instances of non-consensual sexual relations which she had had
with her husband, in categories. She had testified that there had
been 30 instances of non-consensual anal intercourse, the first
of which had been in January 1989, before her first miscarriage.
She related her memory of the date to a discussion she had had
with her doctor. In January 1999, she corrected her testimony and
stated that the date was not January 1989, but in March 1990, at
the time of her second miscarriage.</pre>
    <pre>     Defense counsel then led up to the following question:</pre>
    <pre>     Q. And you&#146;re telling us today that the first non-consensual
     anal intercourse then occurred in March of 1990?
     </pre>
    <pre>     A. Correct.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Q. And not in January 1989?
     </pre>
    <pre>     A. Correct.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Q. Everything prior to by way of anal intercourse was
     consensual?
     
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Crown counsel objected to the question on the basis that, in
accordance with s. 276(2) of the Criminal Code, the defense is
not entitled to ask the complainant about prior acts of
consensual sex either with the accused or with anyone else
without first complying with the procedure set out in s. 276.1 of
the Criminal Code.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Section 276 provides as follows:
       </pre>
    <pre>       276.(1)  In proceedings in respect of an offence
       under section 151, 152,153,155 or 159, subsection
       160(2) or (3) or section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271,
       272 or 273, evidence that the complainant has
       engaged in sexual activity, whether with the
       accused or with any other person, is not
       admissible to support an inference that, by
       reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the
       complainant
       </pre>
    <pre>       (a)   is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity
             that forms  the subject-matter of the charge; or</pre>
    <pre>       (b)   is less worthy of belief.</pre>
    <pre>        (2)  In proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in
        subsection (1), no evidence shall be adduced by or on behalf of
        the accused that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity
        other than the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of
        the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person,
        unless the judge, provincial court judge or justice determines,
        in accordance with the procedures set out in sections 276.1 and
        276.2, that the evidence
        </pre>
    <pre>        (a)  is of specific instances of sexual activity;
          </pre>
    <pre>        (b)  is relevant to an issue at trial; and</pre>
    <pre>        (c)  has significant probative value that is not substantially
             outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper
             administration of justice.
             </pre>
    <pre>        (3)  In determining whether evidence is admissible under
        subsection (2), the judge, provincial court judge or justice
        shall take into account
          </pre>
    <pre>         (a)  the interests of justice, including the right of
	      the accused to make a full answer and defence;
             </pre>
    <pre>         (b)  society&#146;s interest in encouraging the reporting
	      of sexual assault offences;
             </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  whether there is a reasonable prospect that the
	       evidence will assist in arriving at a just
	       determination in the case;</pre>
    <pre>          (d)  the need to remove from the fact-finding process
	       any discriminatory belief or bias;</pre>
    <pre>          (e)  the risk that the evidence may unduly arouse
               sentiments of prejudice, sympathy or hostility
               in the jury;</pre>
    <pre>          (f)  the potential prejudice to the complainant&#146;s personal
               dignity and right of privacy;</pre>
    <pre>          (g)  the right of the complainant and of every individual
               to personal security and to the full protection and
               benefit of the law; and</pre>
    <pre>          (h)  any other factor that the judge, provincial court
               judge or justice considers relevant.
       </pre>
    <pre>       276.1(1)  Application may be made to the judge,
       provincial court judge or justice by or on behalf
       of the accused for a hearing under section 276.2
       to determine whether evidence is admissible under
       subsection 276(2).
       </pre>
    <pre>       (2)   An application referred to in subsection (1) must be made
       in writing and set out
       </pre>
    <pre>       (a)  detailed particulars of the evidence that the accused seeks
            to adduce, and
          </pre>
    <pre>       (b)  the relevance of that evidence to an issue at trial,</pre>
    <pre>       and a copy of the application must be given to
       the prosecutor and to the clerk of the court.
       </pre>
    <pre>       (3)   The judge, provincial court judge or justice shall consider
       the application with the jury and the public excluded.
            </pre>
    <pre>       (4)    Where the judge, provincial court judge or justice is
          satisfied</pre>
    <pre>        (a) that the application was made in accordance with subsection
            (2),
          </pre>
    <pre>        (b) that a copy of the application was given to the prosecutor
            and to the clerk of the court at least seven days previously,
	    or such shorter interval as the judge, provincial court
	    judge or justice may allow where the interests of justice
	    so require, and</pre>
    <pre>        (c) that the evidence sought to be adduced is capable of being
            admissible under subsection 276(2),</pre>
    <pre>       the judge, provincial court judge or justice
       shall grant the application and hold a hearing
       under section 276.2 to determine whether the
       evidence is admissible under subsection 276(2).
          </pre>
    <pre>[6]  After hearing submissions, the judge ruled that defense
counsel could only ask whether prior to March 1990 there was no
non-consensual anal intercourse. This form of inquiry does not
contain the presumption or admission that there were events of
consensual anal intercourse prior to March 1990. After the
complainant answered no to that question and denied any act of
non-consensual anal intercourse in January 1989, defense counsel
continued and ultimately asked:</pre>
    <pre>     Q. So are you saying that there was no act of anal
        intercourse in January 1989?</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Crown counsel objected again that defense counsel is not
entitled to elicit evidence of other consensual sexual acts
without complying with the Criminal Code procedure. Defense
counsel sought to justify the propriety of the question on the
basis that it would go to the defense of consent as well as to
the credibility of the complainant.
     </pre>
    <pre>     Hawke J. made the following ruling:</pre>
    <pre>        THE COURT:  As I said before, there was an act
        complained of on the last occasion in January
        of &#146;89.  The witness now says that the act
        that she&#146;s complaining of prior to March of
        &#146;90.  She says that she mixed up the two
        miscarriages, the second of which we didn&#146;t
        hear of at all on the last occasion.  And a
        mix-up in the miscarriages leads to a mix-up
        in the circumstances and facts that she says
        came before the miscarriage.
        </pre>
    <pre>        I do not have a problem with counsel exploring
        what happened in January of &#146;89.  I do not
        think that the witness can change the lay of
        the land quite that easily.  She complained of
        an act in January of '89 on the last occasion
        and counsel can explore that time period
        because there was a complaint for that time
        period.
        </pre>
    <pre>        It may, in the end, be for the trier of fact
        if the explanation is accepted but I do not
        think her moving from one point to another
        alters the fact that there was a complained of
        act and by moving to another point that she
        can foreclose counsel from asking about the
        time when she originally suggested she had a
        complaint.  So I will allow the questions.
        Yes.
        </pre>
    <pre>        MS. CULLEN: Your Honour, just for
        clarification so I understand your ruling, is
        it that counsel can question the complainant
        on consensual sexual activity in January of
        1989 without following any of the
        prerequisites, either of common law or by
        statute?
        </pre>
    <pre>        THE COURT: Well, if she had not moved the
        date, he could ask her around that complaint,
        about everything that was involved.  It is
        someone else who finds if it is consensual or
        non-consensual, it is not her.
        </pre>
    <pre>        MS. CULLEN: I appreciate that, Your Honour,
        but what my friend has asked to do is ask
        about sexual activity other than the non-
        consensual act complained of.
        </pre>
    <pre>        THE COURT:  He can ask her what happened,
        period.
        </pre>
    <pre>        MS. CULLEN: In relation to any sexual activity
        in January of 1989?
        </pre>
    <pre>        THE COURT:  Yes.
        (emphasis added)
        </pre>
    <pre>[8]  Crown counsel then sought an adjournment in order to seek
prohibition in the Superior Court. The application was heard by
Wein J. on March 5, 1999 when she made the following endorsement:</pre>
    <pre>         The Crown is correct that failure of a
         provincial court judge to follow a mandatory
         provision of the Code amounts to
         jurisdictional error.  The procedures in s.
         276 are clearly mandatory.  However, the
         learned Provincial Court judge ruled that, in
         the particular factual context of this case,
         s. 276 did not apply.  The procedural aspects
         are not applicable in the circumstances in
         which the questions arose, particularly given
         the change in the complainant&#146;s evidence
         indicating dates. The provincial court did
         not err jurisdictionally in determining that
         the case fell outside the provisions.
         </pre>
    <pre>         Application by Crown is accordingly
         dismissed.
                              II</pre>
    <pre>[9]  It is common ground, as stated by Wein J., 1) that a failure
by a provincial court judge to comply with mandatory provisions
of the Criminal Code will result in a loss of jurisdiction: R. v.
Forsythe, [1980] 2 S.C.R 268; and 2) that the procedures in s.
276 of the Code are mandatory.
[10] It is also common ground that in her ruling the preliminary
inquiry judge declined to follow the procedures set out in s.
276.
[11] Therefore the issue before Wein J. was whether the
provincial court judge lost jurisdiction by failing to follow a
mandatory procedure set out in the Criminal Code.
[12] The position of the respondent is that Hawke J. did not fail
to comply with the mandatory provisions of s. 276 of the Code.
Rather, she made a determination that the section did not apply
in the circumstances before her. The respondent submits that the
decision was an evidentiary ruling the effect of which was that
questions about what occurred in January, 1989 were questions
about &#147;the sexual activity that forms the subject matter of the
charge&#148; and were therefore excluded from the prohibition in
section 276.  As a result, the judge did not lose jurisdiction by
making the ruling.
[13] In my view it is clear from an examination of the state of
the evidence, the ruling and the Court&#146;s answers to the questions
of Crown counsel in respect of the ruling, that Hawke J.
determined that whether the questions were about the sexual
activity that formed the subject matter of the charge, or about
other sexual activity by the complainant with the respondent in
January 1989, counsel could ask them and elicit the evidence
without complying with s. 276.
[14]  The judge held that whatever occurred in January 1989,
whether it was an event of non-consensual anal intercourse which
was one the events charged in the information, or whether there
was a separate event of consensual or non-consensual anal
intercourse at that time but which was not part of the charge
before the court, the respondent was entitled in either case to
ask questions about it without following the procedure in ss.
276, 276.1 and 276.2. This was a ruling that in the circumstances
s. 276 did not apply, and therefore there was no need to comply
with the mandatory procedure.
[15] Wein J. did not say that this was an evidentiary ruling as
submitted by the respondent. She stated that it was a ruling that
on the facts in this case where the complainant changed her
testimony about dates, the section did not apply and its
procedural aspects were not applicable.
[16] In my view, Wein J. erred in law in holding that in the
circumstances of this case the section does not apply. Section
276 is mandatory and applies in every circumstance where the
defense seeks to adduce evidence regarding sexual activity
between the complainant and the accused which is not the subject
of the charge. There is no exception carved out for circumstances
where the complainant, for whatever reason, revises her testimony
about the date of an alleged sexual assault. Hawke J. made it
clear that whether it was the sexual assault charged, or other
sexual activity between the complainant and the accused in
January 1989, counsel for the accused could ask questions to
adduce the evidence about it without complying with the s. 276
procedure.
[17] In my view, the ruling by Hawke J. resulted in a loss of
jurisdiction. It was not open to the judge to determine that in
these particular circumstances, the mandatory procedure of the
section did not apply. This amounted to either a misconstruction
of the meaning and effect of the mandatory section, or simply a
decision not to follow a mandatory provision of the Criminal
Code. In either case, the result was a failure to comply with the
mandatory provision of the Code and therefore a loss of
jurisdiction.
[18] Watt J. accurately set out the law in R. v. Jenkins (1996),
108 C.C.C. (3d) 565 at 574, (Ont. Gen. Div.):
          </pre>
    <pre>          There is no exhaustive catalogue of
          jurisdictional error.  Lack of initial
          jurisdiction to enter upon a preliminary
          inquiry is an unlikely event.  What
          requires to be decided is whether, by
          the conduct of the inquiry, the initial
          jurisdiction has been in some manner
          lost.  It has been said that the
          situations in which there can be a loss
          of jurisdiction in the course of a
          preliminary inquiry are few.  See, R. v.
          Forsythe, supra, at p. 228, per Laskin
          C.J.C.  Jurisdiction may be lost due to
          a failure to observe a mandatory
          provision of the Criminal Code.  See,
          for example, R. v. Forsythe, supra, at
          p. 229, per Laskin C.J.C.; and, Doyle v.
          The Queen (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 177
          (S.C.C.). It may also be lost by a
          denial of natural justice, as for
          example, a complete denial to the
          accused of a right to call defence
          witnesses or to cross-examine
          prosecution witnesses.  See, R. v.
          Forsythe, supra, at p. 229, per Laskin
          C.J.C.
</pre>
    <pre>[19] In R. v. Gray (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 73 at 85, (Gen. Div.),
Watt J. also noted that where a court of limited jurisdiction
misconstrues an enabling statute, it loses jurisdiction, citing
In re Long Point Co. v. Anderson (1891), 18 O.A.R. 401 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>                               III
                                </pre>
    <pre>[20] The only evidence that any sexual activity which may have
occurred in January 1989 was the subject matter of the charge is
the original evidence of the complainant, which she corrected by
saying that the event of non-consensual anal intercourse that she
was thinking of occurred in March 1990 and not in January, 1989.
Her clear evidence in cross-examination was that 1) she is not
complaining about anything that may have occurred in January
1989, and 2) nothing non-consensual occurred at that time.
Because of the objection, the complainant has not yet answered
whether there was any sexual activity at all in January 1989. But
if there was, she has indicated by her evidence in cross-
examination that it was consensual and was a separate event from
the subject matter of the charge which occurred in March 1990.
[21] Defense counsel submitted that in these peculiar
circumstances, he should be entitled to explore all the issues
surrounding what if anything did take place in January 1989, in
respect of the defense of consent and in order to challenge the
credibility of the complainant. His position was that the aspects
of consent and credibility which he wished to explore are not the
prohibited inferences arising from the twin myths that someone
who once consented must have consented on the occasion in
question and that such a person lacks credibility. Rather,
because the complainant changed her testimony, her credibility
about this incident, and her perception of consent on this
occasion are in question.
[22] These arguments are available and open to be made in the
context of the structure of the procedure set out in section
276.1. Within that structure the judge must make a determination
of admissibility using the criteria set out and must give reasons
which clearly state the basis for allowing the evidence and the
limitations on it, or for disallowing it. That ruling is then
available for use by the superior court judge if the matter is
sent on for trial and if the defense seeks to rely on that
evidence. It is also available so that the parties involved, both
the accused and the complainant will have a full understanding of
the reason why the particular issue was or was not permitted to
be examined on in court.
[23] It is very important that the procedure set out in s. 276.1
be applied equally both at the preliminary inquiry stage and at
the trial. (See Re Alibhai and The Queen (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d)
556 (Ont. Gen. Div.), where McCombs J. held that a preliminary
hearing judge lost jurisdiction by ruling that he did not have
jurisdiction to entertain an application under s. 276.1 and
276.2). It is incorrect to say that any error can be corrected at
the trial.
[24] Section 276 was enacted following the Supreme Court of
Canada decision in R. v. Seaboyer; R. v. Gayme (1991), 66 C.C.C.
(3d) 321. That case made it clear that one of the proper purposes
of the section is to encourage the reporting of crimes of sexual
assault by attempting as much as possible to minimize
embarrassment and discomfort for the complainant. Another proper
purpose is the protection of the privacy of the complainant
within the parameters of ensuring a fair trial for the accused.
It is therefore essential that the prescribed procedure be used
as required at every stage of the trial procedure in order to
ensure that the complainant receives the benefit of the
protections, as contemplated by the section, throughout the
process.
[25] The intent of the procedure prescribed in s. 276.1 is to
require the court to consider and rule in advance on questions to
the complainant which may elicit evidence of other acts of
consensual intercourse with the accused. That is the thrust of
the impugned question asked by defense counsel in this case. If
the answer is that there was consensual anal intercourse at that
date which is not the subject matter of the charge, then the
ruling of the preliminary inquiry judge that counsel may explore
what happened in January 1989 allows defense counsel to adduce
the evidence prohibited by the section without going through the
procedure required by s. 276.1, and therefore without according
to the complainant the protections mandated by the section in
accordance with constitutional imperative.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[26] In my view the provincial court judge made an error which
caused her to lose jurisdiction. Wein J. also erred in holding
that the provincial court judge was correct in ruling that s. 276
did not apply in the circumstances of the case and therefore
there was no loss of jurisdiction by failing to require
compliance with the procedure mandated by the section.
[27] I would set aside the order of Wein J., and grant the order
of prohibition prohibiting the provincial court from proceeding
with the preliminary inquiry without complying with the mandatory
provisions of s. 276 of the Criminal Code.</pre>

ROSENBERG J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[28] Feldman J.A. has fully set out the facts of this case and I
need not repeat them.  I cannot, however, agree with her
conclusion.  The resolution of this appeal turns on the meaning
of the phrase &#147;other than the sexual activity that forms the
subject-matter of the charge&#148; in s. 276(2) of the Criminal Code
and the scope of review by a superior court judge of evidentiary
rulings at a preliminary inquiry.
[29] The circumstances of this case are somewhat unusual.  The
information alleges, without particulars, sexual assaults during
an eleven year period when the complainant and the respondent
were married and living together.  The Criminal Code, as
interpreted by the courts, appears to sanction this type of
pleading.  Section 581(1) of the Criminal Code provides that an
indictment, which includes an information, &#147;shall in general
apply to a single transaction&#148;.  However, the term &#147;transaction&#148;
had been held not to be synonymous with &#147;incident&#148; or
&#147;occurrence&#148; and thus &#147;several acts of sexual assault involving
the same parties at successive times are capable of being treated
as one transaction&#148; for the purposes of s. 581(1):  Re Regina and
R.I.C. (1986), 32 C.C.C. (3d) 399 (Ont. C.A.) at 404.
[30] Thus, in this case, the Crown led evidence from the
complainant of numerous acts of non-consensual sexual acts
allegedly committed by the appellant in the course of the
marriage, presumably on the theory that they all embraced a
single transaction.  This presented a difficulty when Hawke J.
was called upon to consider the application of s. 276 of the
Criminal Code, which authorizes questioning of a complainant
about sexual activity without compliance with the procedure set
out in that section and ss. 276.1 and 276.2, provided that sexual
activity &#147;forms the subject-matter of the charge&#148;.  I do not
suggest that the imprecise pleading in the information meant that
any sexual activity between the parties during that eleven year
period &#147;forms the subject-matter of the charge&#148;.  The point is
that any non-consensual sexual activity during that eleven year
period could potentially come within the four corners of the
information.  The authorities that caused the information to be
laid did nothing to assist Hawke J. when she was called upon to
decide what was and was not the subject matter of the charge.
[31] The complainant&#146;s change in testimony added to the
difficulty.  As set out by Feldman J.A., the complainant
initially placed the first act of non-consensual anal intercourse
in January 1989.  She related her memory of the date to a
discussion she had had with her physician.  This was the state of
the evidence at the end of her examination in chief.  It was, in
my view, open to Hawke J. to find that an act of non-consensual
anal intercourse in January 1989 was the subject matter of the
charge within the meaning of s. 276(2).  The act fell within the
terms of the information and it was presumably an act upon which
the Crown would seek an order that the respondent stand trial for
sexual assault.  Cross-examination about that act was therefore
authorized by s. 276, without compliance with the procedure in
that section and ss. 276.1 and 276.2.  That questioning could
not, in my view, be limited to an acceptance of the complainant&#146;s
testimony that the act was non-consensual or even that any act of
anal intercourse took place.  Counsel for the respondent was
entitled to challenge her assertion that the act was non-
consensual and to challenge her assertion that there even was an
act of anal intercourse.
[32] As I read the submissions by Crown counsel before Hawke J.,
she conceded that the impugned question would have been
permissible, had the complainant not changed her testimony.
While those submissions are set out in Feldman J.A.&#146;s reasons,
they bear repeating:</pre>
    <pre>
            Ms. Cullen:  Your Honour, just for clarification
	  so I understand your ruling, is it that counsel can
	  question the complainant on consensual sexual
	  activity in January of 1989 without following any
	  of the prerequisites, either of common law or by
	  statute?

               THE COURT:  Well, if she had not moved
          the date, he could ask her around that
          complaint, about everything that was
          involved.  It is someone else who finds if it
          is consensual or non-consensual, it is not
          her.

               MS. CULLEN:  I appreciate that, Your
          Honour, but what my friend has asked to do is
          ask about sexual activity other than the non-
          consensual act complained of.
          </pre>
    <pre>[33] The Crown says, however, that because the complainant
changed her testimony following the adjournment and was now
alleging that the first act of non-consensual anal intercourse
occurred in March 1990, questions that would formerly have been
permitted were now off limits.  Hawke J. and Wein J. thought
otherwise.  Feldman J.A. holds that this amounted to an error of
law.  It may or may not be, but it was not a jurisdictional
error.  It was not a failure to observe a mandatory provision of
the Criminal Code.  This, in my view, was an example of a
decision on an evidentiary issue that is not reviewable as
jurisdictional error.  Hawke J. was at the preliminary inquiry.
She was in the preferred position to determine whether the
question was relevant and whether the answers that might be
elicited would constitute evidence of sexual activity that forms
the subject matter of the charge.</pre>
    <pre>[34] Feldman J.A. points out that the only evidence that sexual
activity that may have occurred in January 1989 was the subject
matter of the charge is the direct evidence of the complainant,
which she had now corrected.  She holds further that the
complainant is no longer complaining about anything that may have
occurred in January 1989.  That may not be the complainant&#146;s
position today, but the complainant had opened up the area of
sexual activity in January 1989 and she had testified that this
activity was the subject matter of the charge.  Feldman J.A.&#146;s
position is based on the assumption that Hawke J. would be bound
to accept the correction, presumably including the reasons, as
true because this was the complainant&#146;s most recent version.
That is not the case.  The genie cannot be put back in the bottle
so easily.  It was open to the preliminary inquiry judge to hold
that the exception in s. 276(2) applied.
[35] The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in A.-G. Que. v.
Cohen (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 473 is helpful in distinguishing
jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error.  In that case,
Pigeon J. speaking for the court at p. 476 referred with approval
to the decision of McIntyre, J.A. in R. v. Norgren (1975), 27
C.C.C. (2d) 488 (B.C.C.A.) at 489-90:
    
      The learned Provincial Court Judge had
      jurisdiction to embark upon the preliminary
      hearing. Central to the exercise of that
      jurisdiction was the responsibility to determine
      the admissibility of evidence tendered by the
      parties. The confession referred to was the
      sole evidence against the respondent. It is
      now said, as it was said below, that the Judge
      applied the wrong test in considering the
      admissibility of this evidence and that
      certiorari should lie.

      As I have said, the Judge below acceded
      to that argument and ordered the writ.

      If error was made in the admission of
      this evidence, and for the purpose of this
      argument and for the purpose of this judgment
      I am prepared to assume that error was made
      in the admission of the evidence, such an
      error was at most an error in the exercise of
      the jurisdiction properly possessed by the
      Provincial Court Judge, and it does not go to
      or affect his jurisdiction. By making such an
      error he did not lose his jurisdiction or
      exceed it -- and certiorari will not lie to
      review his decision.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[36] To a similar effect is the decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in Dubois v. The Queen, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 366.  In Dubois,
the court held that the same limits on the power to review apply
whether it is the Crown or the accused that seeks to challenge a
ruling at a preliminary inquiry.  The superior court may review
only for jurisdictional error and not simply errors of law on the
face of the record.  Estey J., speaking for the court, held as
follows at pp. 373-374:

      It has been said numerous times that the objective of holding a
      preliminary inquiry is merely to determine whether there is
      enough evidence against the accused to justify ordering him to
      stand trial. It is not intended to determine, finally or
      otherwise, the accused's guilt or innocence. Therefore, it is
      inappropriate to allow the expansion of supervisory remedies
      designed to correct errors of law made in the course of
      preliminary inquiries which relate, for example, to the admission
      of evidence, the questioning of witnesses, or the production of
      documents.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>and at p. 376:

      In summary, it is clear enough that no jurisdictional error
      is committed where the justice incorrectly rules on the
      admissibility of evidence or incorrectly decides that a
      particular question or line of questioning cannot be pursued at
      the preliminary inquiry. This is, of course, subject to the
      important condition that rulings in the course of a preliminary
      hearing on evidentiary questions as to the extent of limitation
      on the basic right to cross-examine or to call witnesses, may
      develop into a violation of natural justice and fall within the
      condemnation of Forsythe, supra, and hence be subject to judicial
      review.  See also Re Martin, Simard and Desjardins and The Queen,
      supra, at p. 488 O.R. Jurisdictional error is committed where
      &quot;mandatory provisions&quot; of the Criminal Code are not followed, and
      in the context of s. 475, this means at least that there must be
      some basis in the evidence proffered for the justice's decision
      to commit. There is no jurisdiction to act &quot;arbitrarily&quot;.
      However, where there is some evidence, it is clearly within the
      justice's jurisdiction to come to a decision as to whether that
      evidence is of sufficient weight to commit.  [Emphasis added.]
         </pre>
    <pre>[37] The same applies in this case.  Hawke J. had the
responsibility to determine the admissibility of evidence.  She
did not refuse to apply a mandatory provision of the Criminal
Code.  She held that in the circumstances of that case, the
provision did not apply.  That was her decision to make.  There
was some basis for her making the decision, given the manner in
which the information was framed and the unusual testimony given
by the complainant.  If Hawke J. was wrong, it was at worst an
error of law on the face of the record, not an error going to
jurisdiction.</pre>
    <pre>[38] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.
