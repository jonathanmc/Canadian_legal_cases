    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Joan Lax dated
September 26, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>GOUDGE J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Dover Corporation (Canada) Limited appeals from the judgment
of Lax J. issued September 26, 1997.  She determined that the
plaintiff Victor Veer had been dismissed by Dover without cause
and awarded him damages equivalent to twenty-four months' notice
together with damages for the loss of his stock options.
[2]  The appellant raises three issues on this appeal.  First, it
says that the trial judge erred in not finding cause for
dismissal.  Second, it says that given the wording of his stock
option agreements with Dover, Mr. Veer had no entitlement
following his dismissal.  Third, it argues that if Mr. Veer had
such a contractual entitlement, the trial judge erred in her
assessment of the damages suffered for its breach.  By way of
cross-appeal the respondent seeks an increase in the twenty-four
month notice period.
[3]  For the reasons that follow I would dismiss both the appeal
and the cross-appeal.
[4]  Mr. Veer was suspended by Dover on March 21, 1993 and
dismissed on April 27, 1993.  At that point he was sixty-one
years of age and a very senior executive with Dover, having
worked there for more than forty years.
[5]  In early 1993 Dover was seeking to bring about a joint
venture that would bring it significant business opportunities in
China.  Both Mr. Veer and Dover's president, Mr. Wilkinson, were
involved in this endeavour.  It was Mr. Veer's activities in
connection with this joint venture that Dover primarily relied on
in asserting that it had cause to terminate him.  Secondarily,
Dover relied on what it described as persistent disobedience by
Mr. Veer during the last three years of his employment.
[6]  The trial judge, after carefully reviewing the evidence,
concluded that Dover had not demonstrated a pattern of
disobedience in Mr. Veer's general conduct or in his
participation in the development of the joint venture prior to
March 18, 1993.  Thereafter, until his suspension from work on
March 21, he sought to continue his own participation in the
joint venture contrary to Mr. Wilkinson's wishes.  The trial
judge concluded that this single episode of defiance and
insubordination by Mr. Veer did not justify his termination in
light of his subsequent apology, his long record of faithful
service, his position of seniority and responsibility and the
absence of any injury to Dover or to the joint venture.
[7]  The appellant's primary challenge to this conclusion is that
the trial judge erred in failing to find a pattern of misconduct
and in determining that only in the single episode after
March 18, 1993 was there insubordination.  In my view this
conclusion is one of fact that the trial judge was entitled to
make.  The record provides an ample evidentiary basis for it.
Unless such a finding demonstrates palpable and overriding error,
this court will not interfere.  In my view this finding clearly
does not do so.
[8]  The appellant also argues that the episode of
insubordination that did occur revealed a fundamental defect in
Mr. Veer's character and justified Mr. Wilkinson's loss of
confidence in him, either of which warranted termination.
[9]  Again the trial judge's findings of fact are a conclusive
answer.  She expressly rejected the assertion that Mr. Veer's
conduct demonstrated a defect in his character.  Moreover, she
concluded that it was an error in judgment for Mr. Wilkinson to
conclude that if Mr. Veer continued in his employment, it would
threaten Mr. Wilkinson's leadership at Dover.  These findings
follow a full review of the evidence and were, in my view,
entirely open to the trial judge to make.
[10] The appellant also challenges the determination of the trial
judge that Mr. Veer's unexercised stock options remained
available to be exercised during his notice period, after his
actual dismissal on April 27, 1993.  She concluded that this was
permitted because of the wording of the stock option agreements
between Mr. Veer and Dover and further, that this wording was
distinguishable from that in Brock v. Matheson Group Limited et
al. (1991), 34 C.C.E.L. 50 (Ont. C.A.).
[11] The relevant provision in each of Mr. Veer's stock option
agreements reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               If the option holder's employment with the corporation
          and/or a subsidiary, as the case may be, is terminated for any
          reason other than set forth in paragraphs 6, 7 or 8 above,
          whether such termination be voluntary or involuntary, without his
          having fully exercised his option, the option shall be cancelled
          and he shall have no further rights to exercise his option or any
          part thereof and all of his rights hereunder shall terminate as
          of the effective date of such termination.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[12] Paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 respectively deal with the death,
retirement or incapacity of the option holder and have no
application here.
[13] The appellant argues that the language of this clause ended
Mr. Veer's option rights as of his dismissal on April 27, 1993,
even if that dismissal was unlawful.  In this regard, it points
to the inclusion of both voluntary and involuntary termination as
triggering events under the agreements for the cancellation of
his stock options.
[14] I disagree.  In my view &quot;voluntary&quot; termination refers to a
termination that is consensual or initiated by the employee,
whereas &quot;involuntary&quot; termination is that initiated by the
employer.  In either case, the termination contemplated must, I
think, mean termination according to law.  Absent express
language providing for it, I cannot conclude that the parties
intended that an unlawful termination would trigger the end of
the employee's option rights.  The agreement should not be
presumed to have provided for unlawful triggering events.
Rather, the parties must be taken to have intended that the
triggering actions would comply with the law in the absence of
clear language to the contrary.  There is no such language in
these stock option agreements.  Hence, following his unlawful
dismissal on April 27, 1993, Mr. Veer had the twenty-four months
of reasonable notice required for his termination to exercise the
rights under the stock option agreements.
[15] In McDonald v. Lac Minerals Ltd., [1987] O.J. No. 1216
(H.C.) (Q.L.) Griffiths J. followed a similar line of reasoning
and reached a similar conclusion.
[16] In Ryan v. Laidlaw Transportation et al. (1995), 26 O.R.
(3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) this court came to the same result.  The
termination language in the stock option plan in that case read
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Each of the 10 options are conditional upon the executive
          completing continuous service with the Company (which includes
          any of the subsidiaries), &#133; to the last day of the year
          immediately following the granting date of the particular option,
          failing which the option becomes null and void.</pre>
    <pre>[17] This court concluded that this language preserved the stock
options for the employee to the end of his notice period.  It did
not extinguish them as of the date of his wrongful dismissal.
[18] The language of the option agreements in this case is
clearly different from that in Brock, supra.  The relevant
paragraph from one option agreement in that case is
representative:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4.  Upon the occurrence of any event specified in clause 10
          hereof [which commenced 'In the event of the Employee ceasing to
          be an employee or servant of the Corporation'] (except the death
          of the Employee) prior to October 31, 1985, the option hereby
          granted shall forthwith cease and terminate and shall be of no
          further force or effect whatsoever as to such of the Optioned
          Shares in respect of which such option has not previously been
          exercised; provided that where the Employee is dismissed by the
          Corporation, the Employee shall have 15 days from the date notice
          of dismissal is given in which to exercise the option hereby
          granted in respect of the Optioned Shares available as of
          October 31 of the Year preceding such dismissal.  [Emphasis
          added]</pre>
    <pre>[19] That case also involved an employee terminated without cause
and without reasonable notice.  This court read the language
quoted above to provide that the date of the actual dismissal of
the employee was the reference point for the ending of the
employee's option rights.  In doing so, it focused on the special
language in that provision of &quot;ceasing to be an employee &#133; from
the date of the notice of dismissal&quot; and &quot;such dismissal&quot; to
conclude that it was the day on which the employee was in fact
dismissed that mattered, irrespective of whether that dismissal
was lawful or unlawful.  Absent language such as this, it seems
to me that parties must be presumed to contemplate triggering
action that complies with the law.  There being nothing in the
provision in this case that resembles the language in Brock, I
would conclude that the respondent's rights under these option
agreements were alive until the end of the reasonable notice
period required for his lawful termination.
[20] Finally, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
calculating the damages for the lost stock options as of the date
of judgment.  It says that damages should have been assessed as
of April 27, 1995, the end of the notice period, when Mr. Veer
could have mitigated his loss by using his own funds to purchase
in the market the shares to which he would have been entitled
under the option agreements.  This would have cost him between
$261,000 and $303,000 U.S. dollars.
[21] This argument must fail.  It appears not to have been raised
at trial.  Moreover, there is no evidence to permit the appellant
to show, as it must, that such action by Mr. Veer would be
reasonable in his circumstances as a way of minimizing his
losses.  Indeed, given the amounts involved, I would think quite
the opposite is the case.
[22] As to the cross-appeal, I would not interfere with the
length of notice determined by the trial judge to be reasonable.
In the circumstances of this case it is clearly within an
acceptable range of notice.  Nor do the reasons for judgment
reflect any error in principle in reaching this conclusion.
[23] In summary, I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal,
each with costs.
