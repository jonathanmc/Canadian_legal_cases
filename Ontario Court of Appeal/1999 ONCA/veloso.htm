    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]   Although  the  impugned evidence was not strictly  speaking
similar  fact evidence, the trial judge did not err in  admitting
it.  This  was  the  kind of extrinsic evidence  referred  to  by
Charron  J.A. in R. v. L.B. at p. 497 in which the similarity  of
the  evidence  has no bearing on its relevance.  Nonetheless,  as
Charron  J.A.  pointed  out,  its  admissibility  turns  on   its
probative   value.  Even  accepting  that  the  evidence   showed
discreditable  conduct by the appellant, it had a high  probative
value,  which  far weighed its prejudicial effect. Therefore  the
evidence was admissible.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The trial judge did not give an express limiting instruction
but he cautioned the jury on the way they could use the evidence,
that  is,  to  prove identity. If necessary, we would  apply  the
proviso   to  the  trial  judge’s  failure  to  give  a  limiting
instruction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  The Crown concedes that the conviction under s. 87 should be
stayed  on  the  Kienapple  principle. Otherwise  the  appeal  is
dismissed.  The appellant did not pursue his sentence appeal  and
that appeal is also dismissed.</font></pre></td>
