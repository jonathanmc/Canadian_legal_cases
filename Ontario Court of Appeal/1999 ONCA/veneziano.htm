    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent)
               v. NICK VENEZIANO (Appellant)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        CATZMAN, CHARRON and ROSENBERG JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Diane Oleskiw,
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Catherine Cooper,
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         October 5, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by His Honour Judge R. A. Mindard
on June 10, 1997</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   To succeed on this appeal, the appellant must show that the
trial judge completely disregarded relevant evidence.  We are not
persuaded that has been demonstrated in this case.  It  was  open
to  the  trial judge to find that there was a discrepancy between
the appellant and his witness as to the number of bottles of wine
being  consumed and that this affected his credibility.   On  the
appellant&#146;s  own evidence he had consumed a substantial  quantity
of  alcohol and we agree with the summary conviction appeal court
that there was evidence to support the conviction.
[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
