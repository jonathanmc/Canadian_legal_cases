      <pre>HEARD:         November 3 and 4, 1999
</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Southey,
MacDonald, Quinn JJ.) in this matter pronounced March 10, 1999.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  It is our view that the Divisional Court was wrong in saying
MacPherson  J.  erred in principle in visiting the misconduct  of
the  lawyer  upon his client. He was entitled to do  so  and  the
circumstances  justified visiting the legal  consequences  of  an
agent’s  actions upon the principal, even if the client  was  not
complicitous.  Someone  was going to be prejudiced  by  the  time
taken  to  unravel the scheme and it should not be  the  innocent
bonding company. Instead of being on the verge of trial as it was
in  June  of 1996 when the order of O’Connor J. was obtained,  by
the  time MacPherson J. heard the motion it was March of 1998 and
any  trial  would  be  some time in the  future.  We  accept  the
argument  that  the bonding company would be prejudiced  by  this
delay  in  the  presentation of any defence  and  in  facing  two
parties who had hatched this conspiracy.
[2]  The appeal is allowed and the Divisional Court’s order is
set aside. Costs here and in the Divisional Court are to be paid
by the respondent to the appellant Boreal Insurance Inc. (now
known as Axa Pacific Insurance Company) forthwith, fixed in the
amount of $10,000.
