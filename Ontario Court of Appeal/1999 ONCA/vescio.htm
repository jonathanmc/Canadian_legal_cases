</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Feldman J. dated January 26, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In determining whether or not the plaintiffs had met their
onus of establishing, on a balance of probabilities, that the
identity of the driver could not be ascertained, the trial judge
refused to impute to them the knowledge of their solicitor.
[2]  With respect, we are of the view that the learned trial
judge erred in this regard. In the circumstances of this case,
there was no basis for departing from the general rule set forth
by this court in Re Durbin and Monserat Investments Limited
(1978), 87 D.L.R. (3d) 593 at 595 that in the ordinary case, the
knowledge of the agent is imputed to the principal, there being a
&#147;presumption that an agent will communicate his knowledge to the
principal because it is his duty to do so.&#148;  The plaintiffs chose
not to lead evidence from their solicitor and, accordingly, the
record is silent as to the reason for his failure to disclose the
information he had obtained as a result of the motor vehicle
search and any follow-up information in his possession. It was,
therefore, not open to the trial judge to conclude that his
failure to disclose fell within any of the recognized exceptions
to the presumptive rule.
[3]  Contrary to the position of the respondents, the issue in
this case is not properly cast in terms of the plaintiffs&#146;
contractual duties under the policy to ascertain the identity of
the driver. The plaintiffs cannot escape the fact that regardless
of any contractual duties, their solicitor had information from
which the identity of the driver may well have been ascertained.
This is fatal to the plaintiffs&#146; claim since the plaintiffs bore
the onus of establishing that the identity of the driver could
not be ascertained by reasonable means.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment is set
aside, and the action against the appellant is dismissed. The
appellant is entitled to its costs at trial and on appeal.</pre></td>
