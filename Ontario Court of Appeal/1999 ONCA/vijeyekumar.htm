</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from a judgment of Molloy J. dated February 9, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   On  November  29,  1994, Sittampalam  Vijeyekumar  died  of
asphyxiation  caused by carbon monoxide poisoning. His  wife  had
found  him  unconscious, sitting in his car inside the garage  of
their  home.  The garage door and the car doors and windows  were
closed.  The car engine was running. A hose had been attached  to
the  exhaust pipe and run through the trunk and rear seats of the
car,  coming to rest on the front console beside Mr. Vijeyekumar.
He was noted to be &#147;dead on arrival&#148; at the Scarborough Centerary
Hospital. He was only 40 years old.
[2]  His wife, Parimala Vijeyekumar and his two-year-old
daughter, Gayathir Vijeyekumar sued State Farm, Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s
car insurer, for death benefits under his automobile insurance
policy. Death benefits are payable if an insured person &#147;dies as
a result of an accident&#148;, which is defined to mean: &#147;an incident,
in which, directly or indirectly, the use or operation of an
automobile causes an impairment &#133;&#148;  Mrs. Vijeyekumar and her
daughter claimed Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s death was accidental. State
Farm denied coverage on the ground that Mr. Vijeyekumar committed
suicide. It argued that suicide was not included in the meaning
of the word &#147;incident&#148; and that Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s death did not
result from the &#147;use or operation&#148; of his car.
[3]  Molloy J. found that Mr. Vijeyekumar had committed suicide.
Nonetheless, she held that State Farm was required to pay death
benefits because Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s suicide was covered by the
definition of accident. Damages of $131,517.30 were agreed on by
the parties.
[4]  State Farm appeals to this court. I would dismiss its appeal
for largely the reasons of Molloy J. Her decision1 is thoughtful
and well-reasoned. In these reasons, therefore, I will simply
summarize what I consider to be the main points supporting her
conclusion, highlighting those that were addressed by counsel in
this court.</pre>
    <pre>1.   The Statutory Scheme</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Every  automobile insurance policy in Ontario provides  for
the  payment  of   no-fault or accident benefits  by  an  insured
person&#146;s own car insurer. These accident benefits are set out  in
a  schedule to the Insurance Act, called the Statutory  Accidents
Benefits  Schedule. The Schedule applicable to Mr.  Vijeyekumar&#146;s
death  is  contained  in  Ontario Regulation  776/93  and  covers
accidents  after  December 3, 1993 and before November  1,  1996.
This  regulation was passed under the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c.I.8 as amended, which limits the right of an insured person  to
sue for compensatory damages.
[6]  Section 51 in Part XI and s.52 in Part XII of the Schedule
require the insurer to pay death benefits and funeral benefits if
an insured person &#147;dies as a result of an accident&#148;. These
benefits include a loss of income supplement to a surviving
spouse, $10,000 to a dependant of the insured and a maximum of
$6,000 for the insured&#146;s funeral expenses.
[7]  Accident is defined in Part I, s.1 of the Schedule:
          </pre>
    <pre>1. In this Regulation,
          </pre>
    <pre>                &#147;accident&#148;.- &#147;accident&#148; means  incident
          in  which, directly or indirectly, the use or
          operation   of   an  automobile   causes   an
          impairment   or   causes   damage   to    any
          prescription  eyewear, denture, hearing  aid,
          prosthesis or other medical or dental device.</pre>
    <pre>The  Schedule  does not contain any express exclusion  for  death
resulting from suicide.</pre>
    <pre>[8]    This   Schedule  differs  from  the  previous  legislation
providing  for  accident  benefits. The  previous  legislation  &#150;
Schedule C of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1980, chap. 218 &#150; did not
define  &#147;accident&#148; and contained an express exclusion2  relieving
the insurer of liability if an insured committed suicide.</pre>
    <pre>2.   The Finding of Suicide</pre>
    <pre>[9]   Neither the appellant nor the respondents challenged Molloy
J.&#146;s  finding of suicide. That finding is fully supported by  the
evidence.  Molloy  J. carefully reviewed the factual  background,
which was largely undisputed, and she applied the proper standard
and  burden  of  proof. Almost all the evidence was  inconsistent
with  a  finding  of  suicide: in the words  of  Molloy  J.,  Mr.
Vijeyekumar  &#147;had no reason to kill himself and every  reason  to
want  to  live.&#148;  But one piece of evidence stood in the  way  of
concluding  that his death was accidental: the hose  attached  to
the  exhaust pipe and then placed inside the car. Because of  the
hose,  Molloy J. concluded that Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s death  was  not
accidental:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The hose could not possibly have been attached accidentally.
          Further, the act of attaching the hose demonstrates an awareness
          of the toxic nature of the fumes and this negatives any
          possibility that the person who attached it could have sat in the
          sealed car with the engine running and the hose connected without
          realizing that this would kill him. Accordingly, I have come to
          the conclusion that Mr Sittampalam&#146;s death was not accidental.3</pre>
    <pre>She  then  ruled  out  homicide. She  therefore  found  that  Mr.
Vijeyekumar committed suicide. The issue in this court is whether
the  trial judge&#146;s finding that Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s death  was  not
accidental precludes finding that his death was an &#147;accident&#148; for
the purpose of coverage under the Schedule.</pre>
    <pre>3.   Was  Mr.  Vijeyekumar&#146;s Suicide An &#147;Accident&#148; As Defined  in
     the Schedule?</pre>
    <pre>[10]  This  is  an  issue  of statutory  interpretation  and  the
ordinary  rules of statutory interpretation apply. In my  opinion
Molloy   J.&#146;s  interpretation of  the definition of accident  was
reasonable  and  appropriate. She interpreted &#147;accident&#148;  in  its
context  and she gave effect to the words used in the definition.
Her  interpretation promotes the purpose of the statutory scheme,
reflects the intention of the drafters of the Schedule so far  as
that  intention  can  be  known, is consistent  with  legislative
policy,  and produces a reasonable and just outcome.  I  find  no
reason to interfere with her interpretation.
[11] &#147;Accident&#148; is defined under the Schedule to mean &#147;an
incident in which directly or indirectly the use or operation of
an automobile causes an impairment&#133;&#148;  Therefore, whether Mr.
Vijeyekumar&#146;s suicide was an &#147;accident&#148; breaks down into two
questions: first, does &#147;incident&#148; include intentional occurrences
such as suicide; and second, was Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s death caused
by the &#147;use or operation&#148; of his car?
</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  Does &#147;incident&#148; include suicide?</pre>
    <pre>[12]  Molloy J. held that the use of the word &#147;incident&#148; extended
the   meaning  of  &#147;accident&#148;  to  some  occurrences,   including
intentional  occurrences such as suicide, that  ordinarily  might
not  be  considered  accidental. She made  the  following  points
which, taken together, I find compelling:   </pre>
    <pre>(i)  A statutory definition may expand the usual meaning of a
word. Here the drafters of the Schedule chose to define
&#147;accident&#148; by using the broader and more neutral term &#147;incident.&#148;
The word incident means an event or occurrence and can include
both intentional and unintentional events or occurrences. In
interpreting the word incident, the court should assume that the
Legislature intended what it said. This is especially so in a
definition section;
(ii) Moreover,  the  word incident is unqualified.  Had  the
Legislature - or more properly the drafters of the Schedule &#150;
wanted to restrict accident benefit coverage to unintentional
occurrences, qualifying language could have been used. The
definition therefore extends the meaning of &#147;accident&#148; to include
some events that in popular parlance might not be so considered;
(iii) The previous legislative scheme for accident benefits
did not contain a definition of accident and had a specific
exclusion for suicide. Existing case law under the former
legislation had defined accident in its ordinary and popular
sense as &#147;an unlooked for mishap or an untoward event, which is
not expected or designed4;
(iv) The current scheme for accident benefits added a definition
of accident and removed the exclusion for suicide. Although these
amendments do not automatically mean that the Legislature
intended to change the existing law, they take on significance in
their broader context. They form part of a major legislative
reform that ushered in a modified no-fault regime for
compensating victims of car accidents;
(v)  Under this new regime many victims lost the right to sue in
exchange for more generous no-fault benefits from their own
insurer. And under this regime death benefits are available even
if the insured, had he or she survived, would have been precluded
from claiming some benefits for having committed a specified
wrong. Under Part XIV of the Schedule an insured who makes a
material misrepresentation inducing the insurer to enter into a
contract of insurance or who intentionally fails to notify an
insurer of a material change in risk is disentitled to various
accident benefits, including income replacement benefits.
Nonetheless, if the insured dies in a car accident the insured&#146;s
spouse and children are entitled to death benefits;
(vi) Interpreting the word &#147;incident&#148; to have the same meaning as
&#147;accident&#148; &#150; which is State Farm&#146;s contention &#150; would offend the
presumption against tautology. This presumption means that the
Legislature is presumed to avoid unnecessary or meaningless
language. Every word in a statute or regulation is to have a
meaning and a function. State Farm&#146;s interpretation would render
the word &#147;incident&#148; meaningless or redundant. The decision of
Borins J. in Young v. Donway Ford Sales Ltd.,5 in which he held
that the words &#147;incident&#148; and &#147;accident&#148; in s.266 of the
Insurance Act have the same meaning, should be distinguished. As
Borins J. pointed out that was a &#147;rare example&#148; where different
words should be interpreted as having the same meaning because of
the rest of the wording of the section;
(vii)     Interpreting the definition of accident to extend death
benefit coverage to spouses and children of insured persons who
commit suicide is consistent with the case law that considers the
victim&#146;s perspective in determining whether an event is an
accident.6  Thus, murder is &#147;accidental&#148; from the victim&#146;s
standpoint. Here, too, Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s death is accidental from
the victims&#146; perspective. The victims are the respondents who
claim benefits, but who did not commit the intentional act
causing death;
(viii)    State Farm concedes that if Mr. Vijeyekumar had been
murdered by the use or operation of a car &#150; for example, if he
had been deliberately run down &#150; then his wife and child would be
entitled to death benefits. It is illogical to say that an
accident under the Schedule includes murder, but not suicide. In
both cases the death of the insured is caused by an intentional
act. In this court, counsel for State Farm argued that the two
cases differ: in suicide the intentional act is that of the
insured; in murder the intentional act is that of a third party.
I fail to see how this distinction alters the definition of
accident in the Schedule;
(ix) No policy considerations preclude payment of no-fault
benefits in cases of suicide. Suicide is no longer a crime in
Canada. The Insurance Act now permits beneficiaries to recover
under a life insurance policy even if the person whose life is
insured commits suicide.7  Under the Schedule, death benefits are
payable even when, on policy grounds, the insured is denied
accident benefits because of some wrongdoing. Part XIV of the
Schedule lists a series  of  exclusions  denying  accident
benefits  to  an  insured  in specified cases of wrongdoing. This
list of exclusions, however, does not apply to the payment of
death and funeral benefits to a surviving spouse and dependants.
Indeed, even if a person steals a car and is killed while driving
it, his or her spouse and children are entitled to death
benefits.  These considerations demonstrate that paying death
benefits to the respondents because of Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s suicide
is consistent with legislative policy. I add that the respondents
had no culpability for Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s death and nothing in the
evidence suggests that he committed suicide to provide accident
benefits to his wife and daughter.</pre>
    <pre>[13]  For  these  reasons  I  agree  with  Molloy  J.  that   Mr.
Vijeyekumar&#146;s suicide was an &#147;incident&#148; within the definition  of
accident in the Schedule.</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Did the Use or Operation of Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s Car Cause
His Death?</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Both  counsel agreed that to determine whether the  use  or
operation of Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s car caused his death, the test set
out  by  Major J. in Amos v. ICBC8 should be applied.  That  test
asks  two questions, one dealing with purpose, the other  dealing
with causation, and both parts of the test must be met to make  a
finding of use or operation:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   Did the accident result from the ordinary and well-
          known activities to which automobiles are put?
          </pre>
    <pre>                2.    Is  there  some nexus  or  causal
          relationship  (not necessarily  a  direct  or
          proximate  causal relationship)  between  the
          appellant&#146;s  injuries and the ownership,  use
          or  operation  of  his  vehicle,  or  is  the
          connection  between  the  injuries  and   the
          ownership,  use or operation of  the  vehicle
          merely incidental or fortuitous?</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The wording of the British Columbia legislation under which
Amos  was  decided  differs slightly from  the  wording  used  in
Ontario&#146;s Schedule. The British Columbia statute provides for the
payment of benefits &#147;in respect of death or injury caused  by  an
accident that arises out of the ownership, use or operation of  a
vehicle&#148;;  the definition of accident in the Schedule  speaks  of
&#147;an  incident,  in  which  directly  or  indirectly  the  use  or
operation  of  an automobile causes an impairment.&#148;  Nonetheless,
the  two  provisions are enough alike that the Amos test  may  be
applied to the definition of accident under the Schedule.
[16] Molloy J. applied the test in Amos. She concluded that the
causation part of the test was easily met because the running of
the car produced the carbon monoxide fumes, which caused Mr.
Vijeyekumar&#146;s death. The purpose part of the test gave her more
concern. She correctly viewed the words &#147;use&#148; and &#147;operation&#148; as
disjunctive &#150; meeting one of them would suffice. She focussed on
the word &#147;operation&#148;. She found that although &#147;the manner of Mr.
Vijeyekumar&#146;s death was not an ordinary &#145;use&#146;&#148; of an automobile,
nonetheless, it fell &#147;within the ordinary &#145;operation&#146; of a car&#148;.
[17] In this court, State Farm submitted that neither part of the
Amos test had been met. Its submissions centered on the
significance of the hose attached to the car&#146;s exhaust pipe. On
the purpose branch of test, State Farm argued graphically in its
factum that &#147;the mere operation of the engine in a motor vehicle
in order to convert it into a &#145;gas chamber&#146; &#133; to cause one&#146;s own
death is not  &#133; the normal way an automobile is &#145;operated&#146;&#148;. On
the causation branch of the test, State Farm argued that Mr.
Vijeyekumar&#146;s death was caused not by the operation of his car
but by the hose. I do not agree with these submissions.
[18] On the purpose branch of the test I agree with the following
reasoning of Molloy J.:
          </pre>
    <pre>               A car is being operated if it is being driven or if it is
          merely sitting idle with its engine running. The operation of the
          engine is part of the ordinary operation of a car. If the use of
          a vehicle as a weapon to injure somebody else meets the test for
          &#147;operation&#148;, then surely the use of a vehicle to injure oneself
          must also meet the test.9</pre>
    <pre>Moreover,  as counsel for the respondents noted in their  factum,
the  courts  have adopted an expansive approach  to  the  purpose
test.10 The trial judge&#146;s finding reflects this approach.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  On  the causation branch of the test, State Farm submission
fails to take into account that the causation requirement will be
satisfied  if, in the words of Major J. in Amos11:  &#147;the  use  or
operation  of  a motor vehicle in some manner contributes  to  or
adds  to  the  injury.&#148;  The operation of Mr.  Vijeyekumar&#146;s  car
contributed to his death by suicide. He could not have  committed
suicide  unless  the car engine was running. The running  of  the
engine  is an ordinary activity of a car. Therefore, an  ordinary
activity  of a car was a contributing factor in Mr. Vijeyekumar&#146;s
death.  Accordingly,  the  respondents  were  entitled  to  death
benefits.
[20] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
