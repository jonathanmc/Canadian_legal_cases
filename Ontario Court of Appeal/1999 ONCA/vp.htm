</pre>
    <pre>On  appeal  from the conviction by Mr. Justice Trafford,  sitting
with a jury, dated October 18, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, who is East Asian, was tried before Mr.
Justice Trafford sitting with a jury in Toronto on October 18,
1996.  The appellant was convicted of three counts of sexually
related offences and one count of uttering a death threat.  On
January 15, 1997, the appellant was sentenced to a total of five
years' imprisonment.
[2]  The appellant appeals against conviction only and raises the
following grounds:</pre>
    <pre>     (i)  the trial judge erred in not permitting a challenge for
     cause based on racial prejudice;</pre>
    <pre>     (ii) the trial judge erred in not permitting a challenge for
     cause based on the nature of the offence;</pre>
    <pre>     (iii)     the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that
     they could only consider the defence evidence of the
     complainants'  motive and collaboration if they were
     satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the evidence
     was true;</pre>
    <pre>     (iv) the verdicts with respect to the complainant V.S. are
     unreasonable and unsupported by the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In my view, there must be a new trial on the first ground.
In light of this conclusion, it is not necessary to deal with the
third ground of appeal other than to point out that the Crown did
not seek to support the impugned instruction concerning the
defence evidence of motive. The language used by the trial judge
was unfortunate and it should be avoided on the new trial.</pre>
    <pre>Challenge for cause based on racial prejudice</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Prior to the selection of the jury, defence counsel applied
to challenge for cause based on racial prejudice and proposed the
following race-based challenge:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Would your ability to judge the evidence in this case
          without bias, prejudice or partiality be affected by the fact
          that the person charged is an Oriental male from Laos?
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[5]  The trial judge refused to permit this challenge on the
ground that the appellant had laid no evidentiary foundation
showing widespread racism against persons of Asian origin. He
based his ruling on this court&#146;s decision in R. v. Alli (1996),
110 C.C.C. (3d) 283 where it was held that &#147;[a]ny extension of
Parks should await a case in which an adequate evidentiary
foundation has been laid at trial.&#148;
[6]  In a subsequent decision, this court in R. v. Koh (1998),
131 C.C.C. (3d) 257 reviewed the question of challenge for cause
in the case of persons of Chinese origin. In Koh, evidence had
been called at trial in an attempt to show the existence of
racism against persons of Asian or Chinese origin. The trial
judge had refused to allow the challenge for cause, finding that
the evidence did not establish &#147;&#133; a social level of prejudice
against &#145;Asians&#146; or &#145;Chinese&#146; so great as to raise an
apprehension of bias in the judicial setting.&#148;  This court held
that the trial judge had applied the wrong test and that he had
erred in refusing to allow the challenge for cause. Extensive
references were made to the decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Williams (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.).
[7]  Consonant with the decision in Williams where the Supreme
Court reaffirmed the well-established parameters of the doctrine
of judicial notice, this court in Koh further held that the issue
of prejudice against visible minorities had been the subject of
sufficient judicial concern and proof in other cases that the
doctrine of judicial notice could be invoked without the need for
formal proof in the case of all visible minorities. Finlayson
J.A., in writing for the court stated as follows (at pp. 268-69):
          </pre>
    <pre>               This court, supported by the judgment of the Supreme Court
          in Williams, has decided that racism is a fact of judicial life
          and that it must be addressed directly through court approved
          challenges to members of the jury pool.  In doing so we have been
          prepared to make an exception to the traditional approach that
          jury panels can be trusted to be true to their individual oaths
          and try the case on the evidence in accordance with the law as
          given to them by the trial judge.  This conclusion was arrived at
          incrementally and on the accepted wisdom that racism is
          omnipresent and where once established through an evidentiary
          showing with respect to a specific race, need not be the subject
          of formal proof in subsequent proceedings involving the same
          race.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Indeed, in this jurisdiction, I think we
          have arrived at the stage in the development
          of the law relating to challenges for cause
          for racial prejudice that, absent sustainable
          objection from the Crown, the trial judge
          should allow a challenge for cause by a
          member of a visible racial minority without
          strict compliance with Sherratt, supra.  I
          stress visible when referring to minorities,
          because I accept the submission of the
          intervener that distinctions between the
          various ethnic groups that make up the Asian
          community are unhelpful.  The prejudice,
          where it occurs, is triggered by skin colour.
          The same would apply to all visible non-
          Caucasian minorities.
          </pre>
    <pre>               It might be said that this opinion does
          away with the requirement laid down by the
          Sherratt threshold test. I disagree. The &#147;air
          of reality&#148; test must still be met wherever
          an application for a challenge for cause is
          made under s.638(1)(b) of the Criminal Code.
          The effect of this holding is not to do away
          with this requirement generally, but rather,
          is to find that in the light of the numerous
          trial and appellate decisions in this
          jurisdiction concerning various categories of
          visible minorites, this test has been met
          wherever the accused is a member of a visible
          racial minority.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[8]  In light of this incremental change in the law, I am of the
view that the appellant has successfully shown that a realistic
potential for partiality exists and that he is entitled to
challenge prospective jurors on the basis of his race. Given the
fundamental importance of the right of an accused to be tried by
an impartial jury, I am of the view that the appellant is
entitled to a new trial.  In this regard, it should be noted that
following R. v. Parks (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 353, leave to appeal
to the Supreme Court of Canada refused April 28, 1994, this court
has ordered a new trial in any case heard before the decision in
Parks was released where the race challenge was requested and
denied at trial.  (See, for example, R. v. Willis (1994), 90
C.C.C. (3d) 350; R. v. Wilson (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 86; R. v.
Glasgow (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 57).</pre>
    <pre>Challenge for cause on the basis of the nature of the offence</pre>
    <pre>[9]  At trial, the appellant also applied to challenge jurors on
the basis of the nature of the offence and more specifically the
prejudice arising from the fact that the appellant was charged
with historical sexual offences against children. The following
question was proposed:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Would your ability to judge the evidence in this case
          without bias, prejudice or partiality be affected by the fact
          that the accused is charged with sexually assaulting his nieces?
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[10] No evidence was presented at trial in support of the
application. The appellant nonetheless submits that he is
entitled to the proposed challenge for cause on the authority of
R. v. Williams, supra. For the reasons set out in R. v. A.K. and
N.K., released concurrently with this decision, the majority of
the court rejects this argument. Consequently, this ground of
appeal must fail.</pre>
    <pre>Unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellant submits that the verdict with respect to the
complainant, V.S., was unreasonable. He submits that the
complainant&#146;s testimony, that she was assaulted while she was
babysat by the appellant&#146;s wife, is evidence that is inconsistent
with the uncontradicted evidence that the appellant&#146;s wife was
working at the relevant time. He also points out that the
complainant mistakenly called the appellant&#146;s wife by the name of
another aunt.
[12] In my view, there was evidence to support the verdict. When
V.S.&#146;s testimony is considered as a whole, it is not at all clear
that the alleged time of the offence was confined to the period
when the appellant&#146;s wife was working as contended by the
appellant. It is also clear from her testimony that the
complainant knew which aunt she was talking about. Although she
did refer to another aunt&#146;s name at one point, she later
corrected her testimony. The complainant was also quite firm
throughout her testimony on the fact that the appellant was the
alleged aggressor.
[13] I therefore see no merit to this ground of appeal.
[14] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are
quashed and a new trial is ordered on all counts.
                                   (signed) &quot;R. McMurtry C.J.O.&quot;
                                   (signed) &quot;I agree Louise Charron J.A.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>MOLDAVER J.A. (concurring in the result):</pre>
    <pre>[15] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of the Chief
Justice and I agree with his analysis and conclusions on all but
the issue of challenges for cause based on the nature of the
crime.
[16] On that issue, for reasons given in R. v. A.K. and N.K.
(C21487 and C21488), released concurrently with these reasons, I
am of the view that the appellant should have been permitted to
challenge prospective jurors for cause.  He was deprived of that
right and it cannot be said that he received a fair trial by an
impartial jury.
[17] Accordingly, for this reason and the reason given by the
Chief Justice, I would allow the appeal and direct a new trial.
