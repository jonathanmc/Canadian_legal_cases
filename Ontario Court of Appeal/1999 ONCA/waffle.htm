    <pre>HEARD:         June 4, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of MacKenzie J. dated September 22,
1998 and amended October16, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants, Mr. Waffle and Ms. Duggan appeal from the
order made by Justice MacKenzie on September 22, 1998 wherein the
respondents, Messrs. Francis, were appointed as statutory
guardian of the property of Mrs. Melita Waffle pursuant to
s.18(2) of the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992.
[2]  Briefly stated, both Mr. and Mrs. Waffle were previously
married and each has grown children from their respective first
marriages, including Mr. Waffle&#146;s daughter, Ms. Duggan and Mrs.
Waffle&#146;s sons, Messrs. Francis.
[3]  Mr. and Mrs. Waffle were married in 1988 and lived together
happily until 1996 when Mrs. Waffle suffered an aneurism and
subsequently a broken hip, the cumulative result of which was
that she became incapacitated and must reside in a nursing home.
As a result of her declared incapacity, by s.15 of the Act, the
Public Guardian and Trustee became the statutory guardian of Mrs.
Waffle&#146;s property as of May 23, 1996.
[4]  Since that time, there have been a number of applications to
the Public Guardian and Trustee to replace her as guardian by
various combinations of the appellants and respondents but none
was able to be finalized.  Ultimately two applications were
received; one from the two sons, the respondents, and one from
the husband and his daughter, the appellants.  The Public
Guardian and Trustee refused to choose between the two
applications and therefore applied to the court under s.18(2) of
the Act to decide the matter.
[5]  The court had before it the affidavits of the representative
of the Public Guardian and Trustee and of the parties and some
other of Mrs. Waffle&#146;s children but there was no cross-
examination conducted on any of the material.
[6]  The criteria for the court to consider are set out in
s.18(4) of the Act which says:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The court shall take into consideration an incapable
          person&#146;s current wishes, if they can be ascertained, and the
          closeness of the applicant&#146;s relationship to the person.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Sections 31, 32 and 33 of the Act set out the powers and
duties of the statutory guardian:
          </pre>
    <pre>               31(1)     A guardian of property has power to do on the
          incapable person&#146;s behalf anything in respect of property that a
          person could do if capable, except make a will.
          </pre>
    <pre>            (2)     [Repealed, S.O. 1996, c.2, s.19].
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (3)      The  guardian&#146;s  powers  are
          subject  to  this Act and to  any  conditions
          imposed by the court.
          </pre>
    <pre>                32(1)     A guardian of property  is  a
          fiduciary  whose powers and duties  shall  be
          exercised  and  performed  diligently,   with
          honesty and integrity and in good faith,  for
          the incapable person&#146;s benefit.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (1.1)    If  the guardian&#146;s decisions
          will have an effect on the incapable person&#146;s
          personal  comfort or well-being, the guardian
          shall  consider  that effect  in  determining
          whether  the  decision is for  the  incapable
          person&#146;s benefit.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (1.2)    A  guardian shall  manage  a
          person&#146;s property in a manner consistent with
          decisions  concerning the  person&#146;s  personal
          care  that  are made for the person  who  has
          authority to make those decisions.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (1.3)    Subsection  (1.2)  does  not
          apply in respect of the decision concerning a
          person&#146;s  personal  care  if  the  decision&#146;s
          adverse  consequences  in  respect   of   the
          person&#146;s property significantly outweigh  the
          decision&#146;s   benefits  in  respect   of   the
          person&#146;s personal care.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (2)     The guardian shall explain to
          the  incapable  person  what  the  guardian&#146;s
          powers and duties are.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (3)     A guardian shall encourage the
          incapable person to participate, to the  best
          of  his  or  her abilities, in the guardian&#146;s
          decisions about the property.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (4)      The guardian shall  seek  to
          foster  regular personal contact between  the
          incapable   person   and  supportive   family
          members and friends of the incapable person.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (5)      The  guardian shall  consult
          from time to time with
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (a)     supportive family members and
          friends  of the incapable person who  are  in
          regular  personal contact with the  incapable
          person; and
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (b)      the  persons from  whom  the
          incapable person receives personal care.
          </pre>
    <pre>                   (6)       The  guardian  shall,   in
          accordance   with   the   regulations,   keep
          accounts  of  all transactions involving  the
          property.
          </pre>
    <pre>                   (7)      A  guardian  who  does  not
          receive   compensation   for   managing   the
          property  shall exercise the degree of  care,
          diligence and skill that a person of ordinary
          prudence would exercise in the conduct of his
          or her own affairs.
          </pre>
    <pre>                   (8)       A  guardian  who  receives
          compensation for managing the property  shall
          exercise  the  degree of care, diligence  and
          skill  that  a  person  in  the  business  of
          managing  the property of others is  required
          to exercise.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (9)     Subsection (8) applies to the
          Public Guardian and Trustee.
          </pre>
    <pre>            (10)     A guardian shall act in accordance
          with the management plan established for  the
          property,  if the guardian is not the  Public
          Guardian and Trustee, or with the policies of
          the Public Guardian and Trustee, if he or she
          is the guardian.
          </pre>
    <pre>            (11)     If there is a management plan,  it
          may  be  amended from time to time  with  the
          Public Guardian and Trustee&#146;s approval.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 (12)    The Trustee Act does not apply
          to the exercise of a guardian&#146;s powers or the
          performance of a guardian&#146;s duties.
          </pre>
    <pre>                33(1)      A  guardian of  property  is
          liable for damages resulting from a breach of
          the guardian&#146;s duty.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  (2)    If the court is satisfied that
          a  guardian  of property who has committed  a
          breach   of   duty  has  nevertheless   acted
          honestly, reasonably and diligently,  it  may
          relieve the guardian from all or part of  the
          liability.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In making his decision, the motions judge first rejected the
submission of the appellants that s.17(1) of the Act mandates a
priority order in which competing applicants must be considered.
He then proceeded to assess the merits of the two applications
before him and of the applicants themselves.  He considered the
issue of closeness then turned to the relative abilities of the
parties to carry out the duties and functions of the statutory
guardian of property, including their business experience and
ability to manage property and the obligation under s.32(1.2) for
the guardian to manage the property in a manner consistent with
decisions made by the person who has authority to make the
personal care decisions for the incapacitated person.  In this
case, that is the spouse Mr. Waffle.
[9]  The motions judge ultimately concluded that the respondents
had met the onus of establishing that they should replace the
Public Guardian and Trustee as guardian of their mother&#146;s
property.
[10] On this appeal, the appellants ask the court to find that
the trial judge erred in his interpretation and application of
the relevant sections of the Substitute Decisions Act, 1992.
However, on the appeal before this court, one of the main issues
which has been highlighted by both sides is the apparent lack of
trust and some animosity which has, most unfortunately, developed
between the parties.  Mr. Waffle is devoted to his wife and this
is acknowledged by her sons but they have concerns about how Mr.
Waffle will deal with her property and he has fears as to how the
sons will deal with the property and whether he will be
appropriately consulted as required by the Act.
[11] One option which did not appear to have been considered by
the motions judge, was to decline to order that either applicant
replace the Public Guardian and Trustee.  This option is provided
for by s.18(3).
[12] We do not suggest that the motions judge erred in that
regard at the time of the motion.  However, counsel for the
Public Guardian and Trustee has informed the court 1) that the
Public Guardian and Trustee now has concerns about the entire
situation although counsel did not elaborate on matters not fully
dealt with in the record, and 2) that the Public Guardian and
Trustee has indicated that she is prepared to retain the
guardianship in this case if the court so decides pursuant to its
authority under s.134(1) of the Courts of Justice Act.
[13] It is most unfortunate that in a situation where an
incapacitated wife and mother has the support and love of both
her husband and children that those parties are not able to agree
on issues regarding her financial welfare so that her assets can
be managed by those closest to her in the manner that is in her
best interests.  However, that appears to be the case here.
[14] In the circumstances, in our view, neither applicant should
replace the Public Guardian and Trustee as statutory guardian of
Mrs. Waffle&#146;s property at this time.
[15] The appeal is therefore allowed and the order of Justice
MacKenzie that the respondents replace the Public Guardian and
Trustee as statutory guardian of Mrs. Waffle&#146;s property is set
aside.  The Public Guardian and Trustee shall therefore remain as
statutory guardian.  In the circumstances, there will be no costs
of the appeal.</pre>
