</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Lyon J. dated October 28, 1997</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The trial judge found that the police had articulable cause
to believe that the appellant was engaged in a drug transaction.
The record amply supports that finding and we see no basis for
interfering with it.  It follows that the police were entitled to
briefly detain the appellant to investigate their suspicions.
The police were denied that opportunity when the appellant chose
to flee.  Given that the police had the right to detain the
appellant, they also had the right to pursue him.  In these
circumstances, the pursuit did not offend the appellant&#146;s s.8
Charter rights.
[2]  Having refused to submit to lawful detention, in our view,
Constable Wray was entitled to physically restrain the appellant
when he finally caught up with him in the apartment building.  It
was at that moment that Constable Wray observed what he believed
to be a bag of cocaine in the appellant&#146;s right hand.  No issue
is taken with the fact that Constable Wray was then entitled to
place the appellant under arrest for possession of cocaine.  Nor
is any issue taken with the ensuing conduct of the police which
resulted in the appellant&#146;s apprehension.
[3]  In the circumstances, we agree with the trial judge that the
conduct of the police was lawful throughout and involved no
breach of the appellant&#146;s s. 8 Charter rights.  Accordingly, the
appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
