</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant picked up the respondents’ goods, which showed
considerable wear and tear, and stored them for seven years at
its warehouse on five pallets. While the goods were in storage,
the appellant, through no fault of its own, suffered a break-in
at its warehouse and some damage was done to one pallet of the
respondents’ goods. The appellant did not advise the respondents
that there had been a break-in. In addition, during the period of
storage the appellant moved the goods to another warehouse. When
the goods were returned to the respondents they claimed that
substantial damage had been done to the goods, several boxes of
goods were missing and some of the goods did not belong to them.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The respondents sued the appellant for damages and punitive
damages. The trial judge found that the appellant was responsible
for much of the damage. His conclusion was based on several
findings. Part of the damage was to goods stored on pallets that
had not been broken into and for which no explanation was given
by the appellant. Even though the appellant was not responsible
for any damage occasioned by the break-in, the appellant, by his
actions nonetheless contributed to the loss. The appellant did
not advise the respondents of the break-in and deprived them of
the opportunity to view and assess the damage. The trial judge
also found that the appellant unceremoniously dumped the
respondents’ goods at their residence without comment or apology.
When the respondents complained about the situation, they were
threatened by the appellant’s employees. The trial judge ordered
the appellant to pay to the respondent the sum of $26,342 for
compensatory damages and $25,000 for punitive damages. From this
decision the appellant now appeals and raises three issues:</pre>
    <pre>
                    1.   Was the trial judge correct in
          finding that the Plaintiffs’ property was
          damaged as a result of D’Arcy’s negligence?
          </pre>
    <pre>                    2.   Did the trial judge err in
          finding that the Warehouse Receipts Act, as
          amended, did not provide a defence to the
          appellants?
          </pre>
    <pre>                    3.   Did the trial judge err in
          awarding punitive damages?
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[3]  There was evidence from which the trial judge could infer
that the damage done to the respondents’ goods was caused by the
appellant and that the appellant’s employees had deliberately
caused damage. Some of that damage consisted of a urine stained
mattress, a note on a can of dog food, and a dirty and twisted
trail bike. Accordingly, we cannot disturb the trial judge’s
finding that the appellant was responsible for the damage to the
respondents’ property. The appellant’s first ground of appeal is
dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Pursuant to the Warehouse Receipts Act, the weigh bill would
constitute a contract and by its terms limits the appellant’s
liability to $0.60 per pound. The trial judge held that the
appellant was not entitled to rely on the limitation clause in
the weigh bill  because the damage was deliberately caused. As
indicated, the trial judge was entitled to draw the inference
that damage to the appellant’s goods was unrelated to the break-
in and was deliberately caused. The appellant’s second ground of
appeal is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  With respect to punitive damages, the trial judge found that
the conduct of the appellant was malicious. He stated: “To
continue to bill the clients for storage of items which had
either been destroyed or stolen without advising them of that
fact and allowing them an opportunity to inspect their property
is, in my view reprehensible and malicious conduct”. The
appellant’s conduct was compounded by its actions on delivery of
the goods. This conduct was separate from the contract of storage
and the trial judge’s award of punitive damages is therefore
supportable in principle. We are, however, of the opinion that
the amount awarded was excessive and would reduce the amount of
punitive damages to $5,000.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The appeal is allowed to the extent that the amount of
punitive damages is reduced to $5,000 and is otherwise dismissed.
Having regard to the result, the respondents are entitled to two-
thirds of their costs of the appeal on a party and party scale,
payable forthwith after their assessment.</pre></td>
