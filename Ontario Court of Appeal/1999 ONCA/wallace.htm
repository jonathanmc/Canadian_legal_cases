    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We are of the view that this appeal must succeed and that
there should be a new trial.  We have reached this conclusion
because, in our view, the trial judge should have acceded to the
appellant&#146;s request for an adjournment of the proceedings when,
during the trial, the appellant discharged his counsel.
[2]  The appellant&#146;s request for an adjournment appears to have
been flatly denied.  There was no finding by the trial judge that
the appellant had discharged his counsel as a ploy on his part
simply to delay the proceedings.
[3]  Significantly, the appellant renewed his request for an
adjournment as the trial proceeded and really did not participate
in the trial from the moment of the first request.  He had been,
and was then, in custody throughout the proceedings and obviously
would have had difficulty in preparing to defend on the many
counts upon which he was being tried.
[4]  In the circumstances, we are all satisfied that the
appellant did not have the opportunity to make full answer and
defence.  Accordingly, the verdict cannot stand.
[5]  The appellant sought leave to file fresh evidence in support
of his appeal as it related to the decision of the trial judge
refusing to stay the trial proceedings.  In the circumstances, we
think it is unnecessary to deal with that application or that
aspect of the appeal.  The appellant, of course, is at liberty to
proceed as he is advised at the new trial.
[6]  In the result then, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is
set aside and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
