    <pre>HEARD:         November 24, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice D. Rutherford,
sitting with a jury, on December 3, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant raises two grounds of appeal on  his  appeal
from conviction:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The jury exhortation;
          </pre>
    <pre>                2.    The  admission  of  similar  fact
          evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[2]   With respect to the jury exhortation, in our view there  is
no  reasonable  possibility  that the  trial  judge&#146;s  statement,
during  the  exhortation, that the jurors in the minority  should
reconsider their views, coerced the jury or interfered  with  its
right   to   deliberate  in  complete  freedom  from   extraneous
considerations.  This language should now be avoided in  view  of
R. v. G. (R.M.) (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 26 (S.C.C.).  However, we
note  that  following  the exhortation,  the  jury  continued  to
deliberate for several hours and in the end, informed  the  trial
judge that it could not reach a verdict on one of the two counts.
This is compelling evidence that the members of the minority  did
not  feel  coerced.  We would therefore not give effect  to  this
ground of appeal.
[3]  We would also not interfere with the trial judge&#146;s ruling
admitting the similar fact evidence.  In his very helpful
submissions on behalf of the appellant, Mr. Litkowski points out
that the conduct itself did not involve criminality on the part
of the appellant and was in this respect dissimilar from the
charged conduct.  He therefore submits that the similar facts did
not reach the level of striking similarity or the high degree of
similarity required where the evidence is adduced to prove
identity in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Arp (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321.
[4]  In R. v. Arp at p. 342, Cory J. explained that a principled
approach to the admission of similar fact evidence will &#147;in all
cases rest on the finding that the accused&#146;s involvement in the
alleged similar acts or counts is unlikely to be the product of
coincidence&#148;.  Where the evidence is adduced on the issue of
identity this generally will require a &#147;high degree of
similarity&#148;.  However, as he pointed out at p. 345, the
similarity may consist of a unique trade mark or signature or a
&#147;series of significant similarities&#148;.  This requires the court to
look not only at the actual acts of misconduct but the
surrounding circumstances.
[5]  In our view, when all the circumstances are considered, the
admission of the similar fact evidence meets the test of
objective improbability set out in R. v. Arp.  It was so
improbable that there was another unaccompanied man frequenting
children&#146;s wave pools in the Ottawa area and engaging in
inappropriate play with young girls previously unknown to him,
who also answered to the name of Geoff and so closely resembled
the appellant as to be mistaken in a line-up for the appellant,
that the possibility of coincidence was negatived.
[6]  This case is not unlike the decision of this court in R. v.
Dickinson (1984), 40 C.R. (3d) 384 (Ont. C.A.).  In Dickinson at
p. 389, Martin J.A., in terms not unlike those employed by Cory
J. in Arp, held that the admission of similar fact evidence is
exceptional and requires a strong degree of probative force.
However, he also pointed out that the degree of similarity
required to give the similar fact evidence the high degree of
probative force required will vary according to the other
evidence in the case.  Where, unlike this case, the similar fact
evidence must bear the whole burden of proof of identity, a very
high degree of similarity is required.  In each case, however,
the touchstone for admissibility is the likelihood of
coincidence.  In Dickinson at p. 390, the court found that it
would be an &#147;extraordinary coincidence&#148; that there was another
&#147;peeping Tom&#148; who looked like the accused operating in the very
same small geographical area.  Likewise, the facts of this case
would have to fall within the realm of extraordinary coincidence.
In our view, the trial judge properly exercised his discretion in
admitting the similar fact evidence.  The jury was very carefully
charged as to the use of this evidence.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.
