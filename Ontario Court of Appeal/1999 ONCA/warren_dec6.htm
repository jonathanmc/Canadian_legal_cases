    <pre>HEARD:         November 25, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Mr. Justice D. Rutherford
on December 11, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                       ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals the sentence totalling five years'
imprisonment imposed following his convictions for various sexual
offences and for breach of recognizance.  Counsel for the
appellant made three submissions:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   The trial judge erred in principle 
	       in the manner in which he dealt with 
	       pre-trial custody;
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   The sentences for the sexual
               assaults committed on April 2, 1994 were
               excessive; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               3.   The sentences for the breach of
               recognizance were excessive and the
               sentences for the offences committed on
               August 26, 1997 should have been
               concurrent.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The pre-trial custody</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The normal rule is that credit is given on a two-for-one
basis for pre-trial custody.  In this case, the trial judge
indicated that he would take the &#147;dead time&#148; into account, but he
was not prepared to give it &#147;straight arithmetic credit&#148;.  The
trial judge gave as his reason for not giving full credit for the
pre-trial custody that the appellant was &#147;in jail for one reason
only and it is your fault&#148;.  The trial judge then referred to the
fact that the appellant was eventually held in custody because he
repeatedly violated the conditions of the recognizance.
[3]  The appellant was charged in April 1994 with sexual assault
and unlawful confinement in relation to two complainants.  He was
released on a recognizance with conditions that he not associate
with girls of eighteen years or under unless supervised by an
adult and that he not consume alcohol.
[4]  In early 1996, the appellant was charged with sexual offences
involving another young girl.  He was released on a recognizance
that included terms that he not leave the Kanata Municipality
except for certain specified reasons and not consume alcohol.
[5]  On March 20, 1996, the appellant was observed to be in a hot
tub with a number of young girls and behaving in an inappropriate
manner.  He was thus in breach of the 1994 recognizance.  When he
went to surrender himself on April 22, 1996 as a result of this
allegation, the appellant was observed by the police to have
consumed alcohol.  This too was a violation of the recognizance.
[6]  On August 26, 1997, the appellant was found by the police to
be away from the Kanata region and to be intoxicated.  He was
therefore in violation of two terms of the 1996 recognizance.
[7]  It will be seen that the appellant was repeatedly released in
the period from 1994 to 1997 and that he violated the terms of his
release on many occasions.  These were flagrant violations of
important terms designed to protect society and ensure the good
conduct of the appellant until these serious charges could be
dealt with.  In the circumstances, we are not persuaded that the
trial judge erred in principle in refusing to give full two-for-
one credit for the pre-trial custody.  The appellant had been
given every opportunity to remain at large so that he would not
suffer the prejudice from pre-trial custody.  By his own actions,
he jeopardized his bail status and ultimately he had to be
detained pending his trial.  Like the trial judge, we would not
refuse to give the appellant any credit for pre-trial custody.
However, in the circumstances we cannot say that it was an error
in principle for the trial judge to refuse to give a full two-for-
one credit.
          </pre>
    <pre>The sentences for the sexual offences</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Mr. Shore submits that the three years imposed by the trial
judge for the April 1994 offences was excessive and suggests that
a more appropriate sentence was one of two years' imprisonment.
He does not contest the one-year sentence imposed for the March
1996 sexual offence. The facts of these offences were very
serious.  The appellant attacked the two sixteen-year-old
complainants who had offered to drive him home, because he was in
an intoxicated state.  He confined the complainants in the car,
forced them to disrobe and fondled them.  He threatened the
complainants with death and used force to keep them in the car.
Fortunately, the complainants were able to break away and seek
refuge in a nearby home.
[9]  The appellant has a record for similar offences and, indeed,
his prior conviction for the 1985 incident bears some similarity
to these offences.  In our view the sentence of three years was
fit.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The sentences for breach of recognizance</pre>
    <pre>[10] On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Shore submitted that the
trial judge erred in principle in imposing sentences of three
months consecutive on each of the four breach-of-recognizance
charges.  He suggested that there should have been a gradual
escalation in the sentence and that the sentence for the last
offence should have been concurrent since it arose out of the same
incident and was a violation of the same recognizance.
[11] The deference due the trial judge on matters of sentencing
generally applies to the decision whether or not to make sentences
consecutive or concurrent:  R. v. McDonnell (1997), 114 C.C.C.
(3d) 436 (S.C.C.).  The trial judge did not err in principle in
imposing consecutive sentences for distinct violations.  We are
also not persuaded that the total sentence of twelve months'
imprisonment for these offences was excessive.  These were serious
violations.  The appellant represented a serious danger to the
public if he was drinking and associating with young girls.  He
also has a record for similar offences in 1989 and 1995.
[12] Accordingly, while we would grant leave to appeal sentence,
the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
