      <pre>On appeal from the conviction by Yates J., dated October 4, 1995.</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

      <pre>[1]   The appellant argues that the expert opinion of Dr. Calvert
ought  not  to have been admitted by the trial judge. We  do  not
agree.  The  witness  was  properly qualified  as  an  expert  in
paediatrics with experience in examining and diagnosing  children
for  sexual abuse. No quarrel was taken with that either at trial
or  here. She was, therefore, qualified to give the opinion  that
there was an extremely high probability that this child had  been
sexually abused.
[2]  This opinion was clearly relevant to the issues at trial and
was necessary to assist the trier of fact.
[3]  The appellant’s complaint is that in outlining the
foundations for her opinion the witness relied among other things
on the complainant’s evidence at the preliminary hearing, thereby
prejudicing the appellant by implicitly buttressing the
complainant’s credibility.
[4]  We disagree. This factor was a foundation for the opinion
and the witness was entitled, even obliged, to say so. The
witness indicated that if one were to believe the complainant
then her opinion, based on this and other factors, followed. This
sort of input is a common underpinning of expert evidence and the
trial judge made clear that to accept the opinion the jury must
find the foundations for it to be true. The prejudice suggested
by the appellant simply did not arise.
[5]  Secondly, the appellant argues that the witness went too far
when she said that she had no reason to disbelieve the
complainant.
[6]   Again  we find no error. The witness was simply  explaining
why  she was prepared to use the complainant’s statements as  one
of  the  bases  for  her opinion. She was  not  saying  that  she
believed  the complainant to be a truthful person. Moreover,  the
trial  judge  made very clear to the jury that  they  alone  were
charged with deciding matters of credibility.
[7]  Lastly, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in
not giving a special warning regarding the complainant’s
evidence.
[8]  This was a matter for the trial judge’s discretion. He was
sensitive to the proper legal principles. He thoroughly outlined
the complainant’s evidence to the jury and fully addressed its
inconsistencies. The defence raised no objection to this aspect
of the charge. There is no basis to interfere.
[9]  The appeal must therefore be dismissed.
