    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Michael Wassilyn Jr. appeals with leave from the judgment of
Her Honour Judge Sparrow of the Ontario Court (Provincial
Division). Sparrow J. dismissed his appeal from conviction under
the City of Toronto Municipal Code, c.315 (&#147;Municipal Code&#148;) for
selling tickets to a Blue Jay baseball game outside the Sky Dome
stadium. Specifically, the appellant was charged that he:
        &#133; on or about the 25th day of May, 1996 at the Municipality
     of Metropolitan Toronto in the Toronto Region, did commit the
     offence of vending in a prohibited area to wit: South side of
     Front Street West at John Street in Toronto at 12:30 p.m.,
     contrary to the City of Toronto Municipal Code, Chapter 315,
     Section 315-2.</pre>
    <pre>Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On May 25, 1996, prior to a Toronto Blue Jays game,
Detective Constable Dan Nealon observed the appellant standing on
the sidewalk beside a no vending sign in the area of the Sky Dome
in the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto. Cst. Nealon observed
the appellant yelling to passers-by asking if they wished to
purchase tickets. Cst. Nealon saw another male walk over to the
appellant and exchange money for tickets. Cst. Nealon approached
the appellant and found that he did not have a vendor&#146;s permit to
sell goods of any kind, nor did he have permission to sell
tickets. Cst. Nealon then charged the appellant with the offence
of vending in a prohibited area contrary to the Municipal Code.

[3]  On the failure of the appellant to appear in response to his
summons in the Ontario Court (Provincial Division), His Worship
T. Walton entered a plea of not guilty to the charge in the
appellant&#146;s absence. The appellant was then convicted on the
above evidence, fined $500, and given two years probation with
the standard conditions.

[4]  The matter was appealed to Sparrow J. of the Ontario Court
(Provincial Division). The appellant was represented. The main
issue on appeal was whether the appellant was vending in a
prohibited area contrary to the Municipal Code. It was the
appellant&#146;s submission that s.315-2 of the Municipal Code did not
prohibit the impugned activity, namely, the selling of tickets to
an event on a Toronto sidewalk. In particular, the appellant
submitted that s.315-2 only regulated specific types of vending
activities: the sale of goods and services from food vending
vehicles, from portable display units and from workstations.
Sparrow J. rejected the appellant&#146;s submissions and found that,
subject to s.315-5 of the Municipal Code, the plain wording of
the statute created a clear prohibition against &#147;vending&#148; on city
roads or sidewalks.

[5]  It was the appellant&#146;s submission in this Court that Sparrow
J. erred in her interpretation of ss. 315-1, 315-2 and 315-5 of
the Municipal Code. The appellant also submitted that Sparrow J.
did not properly direct herself on the issues, as she
misinterpreted the relevant provisions of the Municipal Code.

[6]  Notwithstanding the manner in which the parties set out the
issues in their facta, this Court expressed at the outset its
concern with the sufficiency of the statutory underpinning of the
By-law creating the offence for which the appellant was
convicted.

[7]  Sections 315-1, 315-2 and 315-5 are the relevant provisions
of the Municipal Code. Section 315-5 authorizes the issue of
vending permits, while s.315-2 is the operative provision that
creates the offence of vending. It states:
          315-2  Subject to 315-5, 315-19 and 315-20,
          no person shall at any time in, over or upon
          the road, sidewalk or boulevard of any public
          highway vend or otherwise stop, park, place,
          store, stand or leave any object, vehicle or
          thing on the road, sidewalk or boulevard for
          the purposes of vending unless the use of the
          road, sidewalk or boulevard is by a farmer or
          market gardener selling or delivering goods
          to any place of business or residence
          adjacent to the road, sidewalk or boulevard,
          if the farmer or market gardener is not
          selling or delivering from a vehicle parked,
          stopped or standing in a designated area
          established under this Article.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The definition of &#147;vend&#148; is set out in s.315-1 as follows:
       VEND &#150; To sell or offer to sell by retail or to manufacture,
   display, place or expose for the purposes of sale by retail any
   service or any goods, wares, merchandise, products, crafts,
   jewellery, refreshments, foodstuffs, flowers or any other items
   whatsoever, and &#147;vending&#148; shall have a corresponding meaning.
   [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[9]  It is the respondent&#146;s submission that as an aid to confirm
the City&#146;s authority and intent to create a general prohibition
regarding vending upon the City&#146;s street allowances, one may look
towards the enabling provincial legislation. The statutory
authority for the general prohibition is found in the private
legislation known as the City of Toronto Act, 1993 (No. 3).
Section 2 of that Act provides as follows:
          2. (1)    Despite any other Act, the council of the
     Corporation may pass by-laws regulating or prohibiting activities
     carried out on public highways over which the Corporation has
     jurisdiction.
             (2)  The activities that may be
                  regulated or prohibited include,
             (a)  parking on boulevards;
             (b)  operating a boulevard café;
             (c)  carrying on a sidewalk sale;
             (d)  displaying merchandise;
             (e)  installing bicycle stands,
                  marquees, hedges, fences or other objects;
                  and
             (f)  selling, offering to sell,
                  displaying or exposing any goods, wares,
                  merchandise, products, refreshment,
                  foodstuffs or flowers from a portable
                  display unit. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[10] The definition of vending in s.315-1 of the Municipal Code
is broader than the authorizing statute. It adds &#147;crafts&#148; and
&#147;jewellery&#148; to a list of articles of sale stipulated in the
statute followed by &#147;or any other items whatsoever&#148;. It adds
&#147;services&#148; to the list. At the same time, the Municipal Code
excludes the limiting words &#147;from a portable display unit&#148;. The
authorizing statute makes no reference to tickets whatsoever.

[11] It is trite law that a municipal corporation does not have
any power beyond that which is specifically delegated to it by
the provincial legislature. For example, in R. v. Greenbaum,
[1993] 1 S.C.R. 674, Iacobucci J., for the Court, stated at
p.687:
         Municipalities are entirely the creatures of provincial
    statutes. Accordingly, they can exercise only those powers which
    are explicitly conferred upon them by a provincial statute.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The facts of this case cannot sustain a conviction under the
definition of vending in the Municipal Code without the
unauthorized extension of the language of the City of Toronto
Act, 1993 (No. 3). To the extent that the language in the
Municipal Code makes it an offence to sell or display articles of
sale such as tickets, other than from a portable display unit, it
is ultra vires the City and of no force and effect.

[13] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the judgment of Sparrow
J. is set aside, and in its place an order shall go quashing the
conviction against the appellant entered by His Worship T.
Walton.
