    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Pursuant to s. 678(2) of the Criminal Code the Crown seeks
leave to extend the time within which notice of appeal may be
given.
[2]  On May 6, 1999 the respondent was acquitted on a charge of
second degree murder.  The time limit for giving notice of appeal
expired on June 5, 1999.
[3]  On May 17, 1999 Crown counsel at trial requested the Crown
Law Office &#150; Criminal to consider an appeal against acquittal.
As required by its practice, that office had three counsel review
the file and on May 28, 1999 the Director, Crown Law Office &#150;
Criminal, approved the request to appeal against the acquittal.
[4]  On May 31, 1999 the appropriate appeal documents were placed
in the hands of the Durham Regional Police to attempt service on
the respondent.  An attendance at the respondent's residence on
that date revealed that the respondent was out of the country
until June 4, 1999.  Despite repeated attendances on the
respondent's residence and at the airport to which the respondent
was to return, service was not effected within the appeal period.
[5]  On June 7, 1999 Crown counsel contacted trial counsel for
the respondent who, as a result, was in touch with his client
that day, and received instructions to accept service of the
notice seeking an extension of time.
[6]  The respondent quite fairly and properly concedes that the
Crown formed an intention to appeal within the requisite thirty
day period.  Nor does the respondent take issue with the
diligence exercised by the Crown in attempting to locate the
respondent for service.  The respondent takes some issue with the
length of time within the thirty-day period that the Crown took
to form its intention to appeal thereby leaving itself little
time to effect service.  Most importantly, the respondent
challenges this application on the basis that the proposed appeal
lacks sufficient merit.
[7]  It is common ground that on a motion such as this a number
of considerations are in play in the required exercise of
judicial discretion.  These include whether there was a bona fide
intention to appeal formed within the required time, whether
reasonable diligence was exercised in attempting to locate the
party for service, whether undue prejudice would result to the
respondent by an extension of time, whether there is an arguable
appeal, and overall, whether the extension of time is in the
interests of justice.
[8]  The respondent's secondary argument is that the Crown took
too long to make up its mind to appeal and left too little time
to serve him.  In my view, the Crown proceeded entirely normally
in this case.  It was a serious matter which needed to be
considered carefully.  The deadline was missed only because the
respondent was away.
[9]  The central debate on this application is the measure to be
applied to the merits of the proposed appeal.  Mr. Tanovich
submits that the standard to be applied ought to be that of &quot;a
reasonable prospect of success&quot; and that the &quot;arguable&quot; criterion
should be so interpreted.  Ms. Ficek contends that there must
simply be an arguable ground of appeal.
[10] In R. v. Gruener (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 88 (Ont. C.A.),
Thorson J.A. said this at p. 91:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In exercising the discretion vested in me to extend the
          time for serving the notice of appeal, it remains for me to
          consider whether the material submitted by the Crown in support
          of its application discloses sufficient merit in the grounds of
          appeal to warrant the granting of the extension notwithstanding
          that the time limited by Rule 17(1) has expired.  I do not accept
          that the proper test to be applied by me in exercising this
          discretion is that adopted by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court on
          appeal in R. v. Tracey (1944), 81 C.C.C. 246, [1944] 2 D.L.R.
          631, 18 M.P.R. 124, namely, that the Court or the presiding
          Justice of Appeal must be satisfied that the appeal would
          &quot;probably succeed&quot;.  In my view, the proper test is that affirmed
          in R. v. Antoine (1972), 6 C.C.C. (2d) 162, 17 C.R.N.S. 313,
          [1972] 2 W.W.R. 305, namely, that it must be &quot;arguable&quot; that the
          judgment being appealed from was wrong.</pre>
    <pre>[11] In my view, this is the correct articulation of the analysis
to be made of the merits of the proposed appeal and the one which
I propose to apply.  The notion of the proposed appeal being
&quot;arguable&quot; has, I think, some flexibility.  Indeed, that may
assist in making the notion serviceable in a wide variety of
contexts.  The measure of the merits of the proposed appeal is
but one consideration which must be taken together with the
various other relevant considerations that the circumstances of
the particular case reflect.  It may be that the merit required
of the proposed appeal may vary somewhat depending on the
particular mix of relevant factors.  What must be present is that
a proposed appeal has sufficient merit that together with the
other relevant circumstances the Crown is able to discharge the
substantial onus on it to trigger the exercise of discretion
under s. 678(2).
[12] In this case the main ground to be argued in the proposed
appeal is that of similar fact evidence.  Given the disposition I
propose, I will say only a little about that ground.  The Crown's
position is that in excluding the similar fact evidence tendered
by the Crown, the trial judge applied a standard appropriate to
the issue of identification whereas in this case the issue to
which the similar fact evidence was relevant was that of whether
a crime had taken place or not.  The result, it is argued, was
that the admissibility bar was placed rather higher than it
should have been.  In my view, there is sufficient merit in this
ground of appeal to make the proposed appeal arguable, given the
other circumstances present in this case.
[13] As I have indicated, the respondent does not contest that
the intention to appeal was formed within the appropriate time
and that there was no failure of diligence in attempting to serve
the respondent.  Nor is any prejudice asserted.  In effect, the
Crown simply missed the deadline by only two days.
[14] Taking these circumstances together it is my view that an
extension of time is in the interests of justice.  Hence, despite
Mr. Tanovich's able argument I would allow the application.
[15] In addition, the Crown seeks and the respondent does not
oppose an order for substitutional service pursuant to s. 678.1
of the Code.  I would therefore make that order.
[16] In the circumstances, the time within which leave to appeal
may be given is extended to June 25, 1999 and service may be made
on Mr. Tanovich's office.</pre></td>
