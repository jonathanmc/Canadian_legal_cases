[1]  The plaintiffs sued the defendant lawyers for damages
for defamation and related torts.  On a motion under rule
21.01(1)(b), Kruzik J. struck out the plaintiffs&#146; amended
statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of
action, and he therefore dismissed the action.  The
plaintiffs appealed but before the hearing they abandoned
their appeal against Landy and Marr; they proceeded only
against Vickery.
[2]  The appellants advanced two main submissions:  (i)  the
motions judge erred in considering the documents referred to
in the amended statement of claim; and (ii)  the motions
judge erred in finding on a rule 21 motion that Vickery was
a witness and thus had a defence of absolute privilege when
he sent a copy of the RICO complaint to Landy and Marr.  We
called on counsel for Vickery only on the second submission.
[3]  On the first submission, although no evidence is
admissible on a motion under rule 21.01(1)(b) without leave
of the court or on consent (neither was obtained here), we
think that the motions judge was entitled to consider the
documents specifically referred to and relied on in the
amended statement of claim. These documents are not
&#147;evidence&#148; precluded by rule 21.01(1)(b) but are, in effect,
incorporated into the pleading.  See: Montreal Trust Co. of
Canada v. Toronto Dominion Bank (1992), 40 C.P.C. (3d) 389
at 395-396; Lubarevich v. Nurgitz, [1996] O.J. No. 1457;
Vaughan v. Ontario (Minister of Health) (1996), 49 C.P.C.
(3d) 119 at 123.
[4]  On the second point, the motions judge properly applied
the test in Hunt v. Carey:  has the moving party shown it is
plain and obvious that the claim discloses no reasonable
cause of action?  The motions judge then concluded that the
appellants could not succeed because Vickery&#146;s
communications to Landy and Marr were absolutely privileged.
We agree with his conclusion. [5]  For the purpose of the
motion we assume as true the allegations in the statement of
claim.  Therefore, we assume that
the RICO complaint defamed the appellants and that Vickery
published the defamatory words by sending a copy of the
complaint to Landy and Marr.  The issue on the motion, and
on the appeal, is whether the defamatory publication was
protected by absolute privilege.  Although Vickery was not a
&#147;witness&#148; in the usual sense of that word, his
communications to Landy and Marr were absolutely privileged.
As his counsel Mr. Lipton pointed out during oral argument,
where a lawyer seeks out information from another person and
that other person provides the information, then whether
called as a witness or not, the information is absolutely
privileged.  See:  Gatley on Libel and Slander, 9th ed.
pp.289-90.
[6]  Paragraph 14 of the amended statement of claim shows
that Landy and Marr sought information &#150; the RICO complaint
&#150; from Vickery for use on the motion for security for costs.
Thus, Landy and Marr were simply seeking out information
(the RICO complaint) from a possible witness (Vickery) for
use in pending litigation.  The information provided by the
potential witness Vickery was accordingly protected by
absolute privilege.  As Gatley points out public policy
considerations strongly support extending absolute privilege
to these situations.  The appellants&#146; claim for defamation
against Vickery must therefore fail.  The other torts
alleged by the appellants are closely related to the claim
for defamation and must also fail.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal against Vickery is dismissed with costs.</pre>
