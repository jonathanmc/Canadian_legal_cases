    <pre>FELDMAN J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal against conviction and sentence.  The
appellant was charged with importing into Canada a quantity of
hashish contrary to s.5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act.  The
appellant was returning by air from Jamaica, she was searched at
Pearson International Airport by customs officials, and a
quantity of hashish was found in the false bottom of a cooking
pot containing fish that she was carrying.

CONVICTION</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appeal against conviction is based on some improper
questioning of the appellant by Crown counsel during cross-
examination about a Bob Marley T-shirt she was wearing when
arrested.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  This is not a case where the trial judge was required to
declare a mistrial.  The trial judge intervened immediately to
stop the offending line of cross-examination.  The appellant did
not answer the most prejudicial question.  The Crown immediately
withdrew that question.  The trial judge later strongly directed
the jury to disregard the offending questions.  Defence counsel
did not feel it necessary to seek a mistrial.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In the circumstances the trial judge did all he could, and
the Crown's error did not render the trial unfair.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The conviction appeal must be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>SENTENCE</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The trial judge made the following disposition with respect
to sentence:</pre>
    <pre>            Following  a  trial by jury the  accused
            was   found  guilty  of  importing  into
            Canada   from  Jamaica  a  quantity   of
            hashish  shy  of 2 kilos.   The  accused
            testified  she  was  unaware   she   was
            carrying the hashish.  It is implicit by
            the  jury's  verdict that they  did  not
            accept her evidence in that regard.</pre>
    <pre>            The accused is 26 years of age.  She  is
            a  single mother.  She has two children.
            It  is  evident to me from  hearing  her
            testimony   and  observing  during   the
            course   of   the  trial  the  different
            colleges that she attended that she is a
            very   intelligent  woman.    No   doubt
            certain  areas  of her  background  have
            made life difficult for her.  I wish  to
            stress that our senior courts have  made
            it  clear that the importation of  drugs
            into  our  country is one  of  the  most
            pernicious  offences,  and   in   normal
            circumstances a very significant  period
            of time in jail is required.  It was not
            too long ago that there was an automatic
            minimum sentence of seven years for  the
            importation of any drug.</pre>
    <pre>            In  these  circumstances the  Crown  has
            asked  for  a reformatory  term.   I  am
            required  - because I believe the  Crown
            is  right  that  this is an  appropriate
            case  for  a  reformatory penalty  -  to
            consider  whether or not  a  conditional
            sentence  is appropriate.   In  my  view
            only  in  the  rarest  of  circumstances
            ought  an offender who imports narcotics
            into this country be given a conditional
            sentence.   This  is not  one  of  those
            rarest of cases.  In the circumstances I
            am  sentencing  the accused  to  fifteen
            months in jail.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellant submits that this is a case where a
conditional sentence was appropriate and should have been
considered based on all of the factors in s. 742.1 of the
Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In R. v. Ly and Nguyen (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 279 this
court stated that the conditional sentence section &#147;will be
looked to only rarely in cases of drug trafficking&#148; (p.286).
However, subsequent decisions of this court and of other
appellate courts which have considered s.742.1, beginning with R.
v. Wismayer (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.), have made it clear
that there is no prohibition against imposing a conditional
sentence for any particular offence including drug offences,
unless specifically excluded by Parliament.  See also R. v.
Proulx (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 68 (Man. C.A.), R v. L.F.W.
(1997), 155 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 115 (Nfld. C.A.), R. v. R. (R.A.)
(1997), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 558 (Man. C.A.)1  R. c. Gagnon [1998]
A.Q. no. 2775 (Que. C.A.), R. v. Parker (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d)
236 (N.S.C.A.) and R. v. Ursel (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 289
(B.C.C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In R. v. Wismayer, this court pointed out that s. 742.1 by
its terms can apply to any offence where a reformatory sentence
is appropriate, and that the goals of both general deterrence and
denunciation can be achieved by the imposition of a conditional
sentence. Rosenberg J.A. specifically approved the following
statement of Mercer J. in R. v. L.F.W.  (1996), 146 Nfld. &amp;
P.E.I.R. 298:</pre>
    <pre>            It    is    correct    that    appellate
            jurisprudence had established  that  for
            certain   offences,   including   sexual
            offences involving children and  serious
            drug  offences, incarceration was to  be
            the   norm.    It  is  a  principle   of
            statutory interpretation that Parliament
            is  presumed to legislate with knowledge
            of   the  existing  state  of  the  law.
            Parliament   did  not  exclude   certain
            offences from s.742.1, nor did it impose
            more  rigorous standards in  respect  of
            certain  offences before  a  conditional
            sentence   could   be   considered.    I
            therefore reject the contention that for
            certain   offences  incarceration   must
            continue  to be the norm and conditional
            sentences   can  only  be   granted   in
            exceptional  circumstances.    [emphasis
            added by Rosenberg J.A.]
</pre>
    <pre>[10] This court provided further elaboration on the issue of how
the important sentencing objectives of general deterrence and
denunciation are accommodated within the conditional sentencing
regime in the subsequent case of  R. v. Biancofiore (1997), 35
O.R. (3d) 782 (C.A.). There the court addressed the fact that the
offence of drinking and driving is the type of offence which is
more likely to be deterred by the spectre of incarceration, so
that general deterrence can justify incarceration for such a
crime. In the particular case where there were many aggravating
factors including the fact that the offender was in breach of
probation, acted illegally in taking the car and recklessly in
driving it, as well as maimed another person, the court held that
the denunciatory burden should be borne by the offender by a term
of incarceration. However, the court emphasized that a
conditional sentence can still be available in drinking and
driving cases in the appropriate circumstances. The court
concluded at pp. 794-95:</pre>
    <pre>            To  reiterate,  it  is  not  any  single
            factor  that made a conditional sentence
            unfit  in this case.  Nor do the  severe
            consequences of the crime standing alone
            preclude  a  conditional  sentence,  for
            example,  see: R. v. Kontosoros,  [1997]
            O.J. No. 3061 (C.A.).  There may well be
            cases where a conditional sentence is  a
            proper  disposition for a  drinking  and
            driving  offence  resulting  in  serious
            harm.   The sentencing decision involves
            first  and  foremost a consideration  of
            the  mitigating and aggravating  factors
            of  the  particular case.  However,  the
            combination  of aggravating features  in
            this  case and the particular  need  for
            both denunciation and general deterrence
            for  drinking and driving offences  lead
            me to conclude that this was clearly not
            a case for a conditional sentence.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] In a brief endorsement after Wismayer, supra, in R. v.
Berbeck, [1997] O.J. No. 2434 (C.A.) which dismissed an appeal by
the Crown from a conditional sentence imposed at trial in a drug
importing case, this court stated:  &#147;We are not to be taken,
however, as indicating that conditional sentences are ordinarily
appropriate for drug importing offences.  See R. v. Nguyen&#148;.  The
court there was reconfirming its concern that although
conditional sentences are not prohibited for drug importation,
courts must be cautious in imposing conditional sentences for
such offences.</pre>
    <pre>[12] This court has made it clear that in cases involving the
importation of drugs into Canada, sentences must be significant
in order to send a message to those who would not otherwise be
involved but who may be tempted by the payment promised to act as
a drug delivery service, that they will be subject to being
sentenced harshly and severely for their role. The reason of
course is that because it is the otherwise innocent person who
will raise less suspicion at the border and who is more likely to
successfully import the drugs, the courier role is crucial to
drug dealers who do not wish to take the risk themselves, and who
would receive even more substantial sentences upon conviction.</pre>
    <pre>[13] This court has not changed its policy of significant
sentences for importing drugs into Canada with the advent of
conditional sentences.   However, where the sentencing judge
determines that the appropriate duration of sentence in all the
circumstances is less than two years, then the propriety of a
conditional sentence to be served in the community instead of in
custody must be considered in the usual manner.  Therefore,
although statistically conditional sentences will be less
frequent in certain types of cases including drug trafficking and
importing, the approach which a sentencing court is to take when
considering imposing a conditional sentence in any particular
case is the same for all offences.  The court is not to begin
with a rule that the circumstances of the case itself must be
rare or unusual.  Rather, each case must be approached on the
basis that it will be considered on its particular facts taking
into account the nature of the offence, the circumstances
surrounding the commission of the offence, as well as the
personal circumstances of the offender.</pre>
    <pre>[14] For example, where a sentence under two years is appropriate
in the case of importation of drugs into Canada by a courier or
&#147;mule&#148;, some of the factors which are relevant in considering the
propriety of a conditional sentence relating to the commission of
the offence will include the nature and quantity of the drug, the
degree of involvement of the courier in the scheme to import,
including the planning and the timing of her involvement as
disclosed by the evidence, and whether the courier has had any
involvement with illegal drugs in the past.  The court must also
consider all of the relevant facts relating to the personal
circumstances of the offender in order to properly consider
whether a conditional sentence is appropriate.2</pre>
    <pre>[15] In this case, it was incumbent on the trial judge to
consider all of the circumstances in accordance with the
requirements of s.742.1 and the jurisprudence, and not to apply a
perfunctory rule that the case &#147;is not one of those rarest of
case&#148;, without further consideration.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Because it was an error in principle for the trial judge to
apply that rule without giving full consideration to the
availability of a conditional sentence, this court is therefore
able to consider what the appropriate sentence should have been.
See R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227 and R. v. Gagnon,
supra.</pre>
    <pre>[17] In this case, the appellant was 26 years old at the time of
the sentence. She had no criminal record and no involvement with
drugs. The drug involved was hashish, which is a serious illegal
substance, but not nearly as addictive or otherwise dangerous as
cocaine, heroin or some others. The amount was under two kilos
which is not insignificant. The appellant was caught at the
airport with the drug in a false bottom of a pot containing fish.
The appellant denied any knowledge of the drug and said that at
the end of a visit to her grandmother in Jamaica, she was
approached by a neighbour of her grandmother to deliver the pot
of fish to a friend of his in Toronto. This story was clearly
rejected by the jury. However, there is no evidence to suggest
any involvement other than agreeing to deliver the pot containing
the drugs.</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appellant is a single mother with two young children,
one under one year at the time of the sentencing. The older child
who was six years at the time, required special classes in school
for behavioural problems. These were to be provided by the
Toronto Board of Education. However, if the children had to live
with their grandmother during the period of incarceration, they
would have to move to Ajax. There is no information as to what
educational accommodation could be made for the child there. The
presentence report indicated that in the circumstances of a
single parent,  the young age of both children and the special
needs of one, that the children's need for  their mother to
remain with them at that time was critical. The appellant was
employed in training as a receptionist at an automotive shop, and
was acting responsibly towards her family.  She had previously
completed community college and had attended business school. The
presentence report was very favourable and recommended community
supervision.  There appears to be little or no danger to the
community.  There are no aggravating factors.</pre>
    <pre>[19] In my view, these are circumstances where a conditional
sentence of 15 months to be served in the community but with
strict conditions is appropriate to achieve the principles of
sentencing set out in ss. 718 - 718.2 of the Code and in the
jurisprudence.  I would not interfere with the length of sentence
imposed by the trial judge.  Fifteen months is a significant
term, as it should be for this offence. This length of sentence
is imposed to achieve general as well as specific deterrence and
denunciation.  Taking into account all of the factors of the
offence itself, together with the particular circumstances of the
offender including the special needs of her young children, in my
view, it is an appropriate case for the sentence to be served in
the community.  I agree with the analysis of Fish J.A. of the
Quebec Court of Appeal in R. v. Gagnon, supra, where, in
replacing a sentence of 12 months in prison with a conditional
sentence of 12 months including a curfew for two months, he
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>                 [para84]  More particularly, I believe that a conditional
          one-year sentence of imprisonment adequately denounces
          appellant&#146;s unlawful conduct&#133;if she is thereby deprived of her
          liberty in a significant manner for a sufficient period of time.
          It takes into account the objective of general deterrence&#133;.  It
          recognizes that there is no real need to separate appellant from
          the community&#133;.  It will assist in her rehabilitation&#133;.  It helps
          to promote a sense of responsibility in the offender&#133;.  It is
          proportionate to the gravity of the offence and to appellant&#146;s
          degree of responsibility in committing it&#133;.  It takes into
          account the mitigating circumstances (there are no significant
          aggravating circumstances)&#133;.  And, of manifest significance under
          s.742.1(b), it does not unduly deprive the appellant of her
          liberty in circumstances where a less restrictive sanction is
          appropriate.</pre>
    <pre>[20] I would therefore allow the appeal as to sentence, and
impose the same term of 15 months  but to be served in the
community, together with a curfew of 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m.
subject to any special variation granted by the supervisor, 100
hours of community service  (10 hours per month for the first 10
months) as well as the statutory conditions set out in s.
742.3(1). I would also impose a period of probation of 18 months
with reporting as required by the probation officer, and no
travel outside the province except with permission of the officer
and only for emergency reasons.

1 The Supreme Court of Canada has granted leave to appeal in
Proulx, L.F.W. and R. (R..A.) and will be hearing those cases
together, along with three additional cases in 1999.
2 When the offence is committed after May 14, 1997, and the
charge is laid under the Controlled Drug and Substances Act, the
court must also have regard to the purpose of sentencing as set
out in s.10(1) as well as to the aggravating factors set out in
s.10(2) of that Act.  Section 10(3) provides:  &#147;Where, pursuant
to ss.(1) [sic], the court is satisfied of the existence of one
or more of the aggravating factors enumerated in that subsection,
but decides not to sentence the person to imprisonment, the court
shall give reasons for that decision.&#148;  This section gives the
courts further guidance as to the intention of Parliament with
respect to specific circumstances which a court must address when
considering whether a non-custodial sentence is or is not
appropriate.</pre></td>
