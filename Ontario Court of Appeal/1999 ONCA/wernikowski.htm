    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Kenneth Binks dated
December 15, 1998</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of two criminal offences after
two trials in 1992.  He was represented by Mr. Alan Ain at both
trials.  In 1998, the appellant commenced this action against Mr.
Ain&#146;s law firm claiming that Mr. Ain had breached his fiduciary
duty and acted negligently in the defence of the appellant at
both trials.  Unfortunately, Mr. Ain was killed in a car accident
in 1998.
[2]  This action is at the pleadings stage.  No defence has been
filed.  Binks J. struck the appellant&#146;s claim, holding that it
was an improper attempt to relitigate the appellant&#146;s previous
criminal convictions and constituted an abuse of process.
[3]  I would frame the issue raised on this appeal in these
terms:     </pre>
    <pre>          Should a statement of claim alleging negligence against
          a lawyer in the conduct of prior criminal proceedings
          on behalf of the plaintiff be struck as an abuse of
          process if the claim as framed seeks to relitigate the
          correctness of the criminal convictions registered
          against the plaintiff in the prior proceedings?</pre>
    <pre>[4]  I would answer the question &#147;no&#148;, allow the appeal and
direct that the appellant&#146;s action proceed.</pre>
    <pre>The Proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant was convicted in September 1992 on a charge of
sexual interference involving a girl under the age of 14.  He was
also convicted in October 1992 of sexual assault.  The
complainant was a seventeen year old boy who was about 10 years
old at the time of the assault.  The sentencing on both charges
did not take place until November 1, 1993.  The appellant
received a 15-month jail term followed by probation.  He appealed
his convictions without the assistance of counsel.  Both appeals
were dismissed, one in 1995 and the other in 1997.1  The
appellant also made a complaint to the Law Society late in 1993.
Mr. Ain provided a detailed response to that complaint and the
Law Society eventually advised the appellant that as his
complaints involved allegations of negligence, they were beyond
the jurisdiction of the Law Society.
[6]  After the appellant started this action in 1998, the
respondent moved unsuccessfully before Cosgrove J. for an order
striking the claim on the basis that it did not disclose a cause
of action.  The respondent next moved for an order striking the
claim on the basis that it was frivolous and vexatious and, in
the alternative, the respondent sought particulars.  Morin J.
refused to strike the claim but did order that the appellant
prepare a new statement of claim which complied with the rules,
and that he provide particulars of that claim.  The appellant
provided a &#147;fresh statement of claim&#148; which included several
pages of particulars.
[7]  Within a few days of filing the &#147;fresh statement of claim&#148;
and particulars (the &#147;claim&#148;), the appellant, without notice to
the respondent, noted pleadings closed.  The respondent moved to
set aside the noting of pleadings closed and also brought a
motion to strike the claim contending that it was an improper
attempt to &#147;relitigate criminal issues in a civil proceeding.&#148;
[8]  Binks J. set aside the order noting of pleadings closed and
accepted the respondent&#146;s arguments that the appellant&#146;s claim
was a improper collateral challenge to final orders made in the
criminal cases.  He struck the statement of claim.2</pre>
    <pre>The Nature of the Appellant&#146;s Claim</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Having read the appellant&#146;s claim several times, I would
summarize his allegations as follows:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Mr. Ain advanced a defence on the sexual interference charge
  other than the defence he was instructed to advance, and the
  defence he advanced had no chance of success.  He did not advance
  the defence he was instructed to advance by the appellant
  (paragraph 1 of the claim).</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Contrary to the appellant&#146;s instructions, Mr. Ain did not
  call the appellant as a witness on the sexual interference charge
  (paragraph 1).</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Mr. Ain failed to object when certain evidence was tendered
  by the Crown on the sexual interference charge and failed to ask
  questions of witnesses which the appellant had instructed him to
  ask during that trial (paragraph 2).</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Mr. Ain breached his fiduciary duty to the appellant by
  giving the prosecution a copy of a psychiatric assessment of the
  appellant prepared by Dr. Greenburg without first obtaining the
  appellant&#146;s consent (paragraph 3).</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Mr. Ain, without notice, effectively withdrew his services
  during the appellant&#146;s trial on the sexual assault charge
  (paragraph 4).</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Mr. Ain failed to have defence witnesses in attendance,
  failed to call certain defence witnesses, and failed to adduce
  documentary evidence in his possession at the trial of the sexual
  interference charge (paragraphs 5 and 6).</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  At the trial of the sexual assault charge, Mr. Ain failed to
  object to improper cross-examination by the Crown going to the
  character and religious beliefs of the appellant and failed to
  seek a mistrial after those questions were asked (paragraph 7).</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Mr. Ain improperly appeared on sentencing proceedings after
  he was discharged and made representations which were not
  intended to assist the appellant, but rather to protect Mr. Ain&#146;s
  own position (paragraph 8).</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[10] The appellant claims damages for pain and suffering and lost
income.  He alleges that he lost his business because of the
&#147;false accusations&#148; made against him and that no one will hire
him because of the stigma attached to the convictions.  The
appellant also contends that, while incarcerated, he suffered an
emotional breakdown and is now required to take medication.  He
further alleges that even after his release from jail, he &#147;became
a prisoner in his own home&#148; as he feared being attacked if he
went out in public.  Finally, the appellant claims damages for
the restrictions on his freedom imposed while he was on
probation.</pre>
    <pre>The nature of the respondent&#146;s motion</pre>
    <pre>[11] It would appear that the respondent&#146;s motion was brought
under Rule 25.11, Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990,
Reg. 194, which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The court may strike out or expunge all or part of a
          pleading or other document, with or without leave to
	  amend, on the ground that the pleading or other document,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  is an abuse of the process of the
          court.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Like other rules (e.g. Rule 21.01), this provision is
designed to allow for an early and expeditious determination of
claims that cannot succeed.  As the exercise of the power set out
in Rule 25.11 denies a litigant a full trial of the merits of the
claim, it must be exercised only in the clearest of cases.
Claims that are doubtful in law or factually weak should not be
foreclosed.  Allowance must also be made for inadequacies in the
drafting of pleadings:  Nash v. Ontario (1995), 27 O.R. (3d) 1 at
5-6 (C.A.);  Temilini v. Ontario Provincial Police (Commissioner)
(1990), 73 O.R. (2d) 664 at 668 (C.A.).
[13] For the purposes of the respondent&#146;s motion, it must be
assumed that the allegations in the claim are true.  In fairness,
it should, however, be said that Mr. Ain vigorously disputed
these allegations in his detailed correspondence with the Law
Society.
[14] While acknowledging that the remedial power in Rule 25.11
must be used cautiously, there are cases in which pleadings are
properly struck as an abuse of process where they amount to an
improper attempt to relitigate issues that have been finally
decided in earlier proceedings:  Foy v. Foy (1978), 20 O.R. (2d)
747 at 748 (C.A.);  Donmor Industries Ltd. v. Kremlin Canada Inc.
(No. 1) (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 501 at 506 (Gen. Div.).
[15] The respondent accepts the limitations imposed on the
exercise of the power granted by Rule 25.11, but submits that
this claim was properly struck at this early stage of the
proceeding.  The respondent contends that it is an abuse of
process for a plaintiff to bring a negligence action against his
lawyer where that action can only succeed if the plaintiff is
allowed to establish that he was wrongfully convicted in the
criminal proceedings.  The respondent acknowledges that there are
limited circumstances in which relitigation of the correctness of
a criminal conviction in the context of a negligence action would
not amount to an abuse of process.  The respondent contends,
however, that the appellant has not pleaded facts which could
bring him within those limited circumstances and that the claim
was, therefore, properly struck as an abuse of process.</pre>
    <pre>Should the claim have been struck?</pre>
    <pre>[16] The respondent&#146;s argument rests on four submissions:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the appellant&#146;s convictions are final;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  to succeed in his claim and obtain damages, the appellant
  must demonstrate that he was wrongfully convicted;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  absent special circumstances, a plaintiff cannot institute
  civil proceedings in which the plaintiff seeks to relitigate
  issues which have been finally determined against that plaintiff
  in criminal proceedings;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  there are no facts pleaded by the appellant which could
  constitute special circumstances.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[17] It is not the respondent&#146;s submission that all actions in
negligence arising out of a lawyer&#146;s conduct of a criminal
proceeding on behalf of a plaintiff who was convicted are an
abuse of process.  It is accepted that some negligence claims
will not involve an attempt to demonstrate that the plaintiff was
wrongfully convicted.  For example, a client who was convicted
might sue his lawyer for negligence claiming only the return of
the retainer paid to the lawyer, or a plaintiff might claim
damages flowing from consequences other than the conviction:
e.g. see Boudreau v. Benaiah (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 686 at 719-20,
725 (Gen. Div.).3  Those claims could be made without
relitigating the plaintiff&#146;s criminal culpability.
[18] The appellant&#146;s convictions are final.  I also agree with
the respondent&#146;s characterization of the appellant&#146;s claim as an
attempt to relitigate his convictions with one exception.
Subject to that exception, it would appear that the appellant has
no compensable damages absent a finding that he was improperly
convicted.  The exception arises out of the appellant&#146;s claim
that Mr. Ain breached his duty by disclosing confidential
information to the Crown without obtaining the appellant&#146;s
consent (paragraph 3 of the claim).  This claim could be made out
and damages awarded without challenging the correctness of the
convictions.  This part of the claim should not have been struck
even if the rest of the claim should have been struck as an abuse
of process.
[19] The determination of whether the rest of the claim should
have been struck turns on whether an attempt to relitigate the
correctness of a criminal conviction in a subsequent negligence
action amounts to an abuse of process.  In answering that
question in the affirmative, Binks J. referred to two
authorities, one Canadian and one English.  In the first, Conroy
Electronics Inc. v. Webster et al. (1989), 33 C.P.C. (2d) 279
(Ont. H.C.), there was no claim by the plaintiff that his prior
conviction was the result of his lawyer&#146;s negligent
representation.  Instead, the plaintiff commenced an action which
alleged facts which contradicted the plaintiff&#146;s conviction in
prior criminal proceedings.  In doing so, the plaintiff did not
allege that the prior criminal proceedings were improper or
tainted in any way.  The motion judge held, at p. 289, that in
those circumstances it would be &#147;a travesty of justice&#148; to permit
the plaintiff&#146;s claim to proceed.  Assuming Conroy Electronics
was correctly decided, it is of little assistance in this case.
[20] Smith v. Linskills, [1996] 2 All E.R. 353 (C.A.), leave to
appeal to the House of Lords refused, [1996] 2 All E.R. 362, the
second authority cited by Binks J. is directly on point and
offers strong support for his conclusion.  In Smith, the
plaintiff had been convicted of burglary and the Court of Appeal
had refused leave to appeal the conviction.  Some six years
later, the plaintiff commenced an action claiming that his
solicitors in the criminal proceedings were negligent in the
preparation and conduct of his defence.4  The trial court held
that the claim constituted a collateral attack on the conviction
and could not proceed.  The Court of Appeal affirmed that ruling.
In doing so, the court described the relationship between Smith&#146;s
criminal conviction and his lawsuit against his former solicitor
in these words, at pp. 357-58:
          </pre>
    <pre>       &#133; In the Crown Court the question was whether, applying the
       criminal standard of proof, Mr. Smith was shown to have committed
       the crime with which he was charged.  In the present proceedings
       the issue is whether his former solicitor handled his defence
       negligently.  It is, however, plain that the thrust of his case
       in these proceedings is that if his criminal defence had been
       handled with proper care he would not, and should not, have been
       convicted.  Thus the soundness or otherwise of his criminal
       conviction is an issue at the heart of these proceedings.  Were
       he to recover substantial damages, it could only be on the basis
       that he should not have been convicted.  Even if he were to
       establish negligence, he could recover no more than nominal
       damages at best, if the court were to conclude that even if his
       case had been  handled with proper care he would still have been
       convicted.  It follows, in our judgment, that these proceedings
       do involve a collateral attack upon the decision of the Crown
       Court. &#133;  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[21] The words of the Court of Appeal are applicable to the
appellant&#146;s claim, save his allegation relating to the disclosure
of confidential information.
[22] Having determined that the negligence action involved a
collateral attack on the convictions, the court turned to the
pronouncement of the House of Lords in Hunter v. Chief Constable
of the West Midlands, [1982] A.C. 529 at 541, where Lord Diplock
said:
          </pre>
    <pre>      The abuse of process which the instant case exemplifies is
      the initiation of proceedings in a court of justice for the
      purpose of mounting a collateral attack on a final decision
      against the intending plaintiff which has been made by another
      court of competent jurisdiction in previous proceedings in which
      the intending plaintiff had a full opportunity of contesting the
      decision in the court by which it was made.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The court in Smith v. Linskills, supra, at 361, recognized
that the principle announced by Lord Diplock rested on public
policy considerations.  Bingham M.R., for the court, identified
three policy considerations.  As he describes those
considerations with commendable clarity, I will quote him at
length:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  The affront to any coherent system of
	  justice which must necessarily arise if there
	  subsist two final but inconsistent decisions of
	  courts of competent jurisdiction.  Such would,
	  we think, be the case here if there were a subsisting
          Crown Court decision that Mr. Smith was, beyond
	  reasonable doubt, guilty of aggravated burglary
	  and a subsisting civil court decision that if his
	  defence had been properly prepared he would
          and should have been acquitted.  No reasonable
	  observer could view this outcome with equanimity.
          </pre>
    <pre>               We cannot of course shut our eyes to the
          possibility that a criminal defendant may be
          wrongly convicted, perhaps because his
          defence was ineptly prepared or conducted.
          When that occurs, it represents an obvious
          and serious injustice.  There are two
          possible solutions.  One is to relax the
          present restraint on seeking to establish
          that injustice by civil action.  The other is
          to ensure that, in appropriate cases, the
          conviction itself can be reviewed. It seems
          to us clear that it is this second solution
          which has, over the past century, been
          favoured:  by giving a criminal defendant a
          right of appeal; by providing a relatively
          low standard for the admission of fresh
          evidence on appeal;  by empowering the
          appellate court to order a new trial;  by
          giving the Home Secretary power to refer a
          case back to the Court of Appeal;  and by
          proposals to establish a new review body.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  The virtual impossibility of fairly
          retrying at a later date the issue which was
          before the court on the earlier occasion.
          The present case exemplifies the problem.  It
          is over 12 years since the crime was
          committed.  Recollections (of the
          participants and the lawyers involved) must
          have faded.  Witnesses have disappeared.
          Transcripts have been lost or destroyed.  Mr.
          Hayes may, or may not, be available to
          testify.  Evidence of events since the trial
          will be bound to intrude, as it already has.
          It is futile to suppose that the course of
          the Crown Court trial can be authentically
          recreated.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  The importance of finality in
          litigation.  The present rule has been seen
          by some as a rule invented by judges to
          protect their professional brethren.  It is,
          of course, true that no one welcomes a
          negligence claim against him.  But the maxim
          interest reipublicae ut finis sit litium was
          not invented by English judges, and nothing
          (on one view) could better serve the personal
          interests of the legal profession than
          endless relitigation of the same issues.  If,
          as suggested in Dickens&#146; Bleak House:  &#145;The
          one great principle of English law is, to
          make business for itself&#146;, there could be no
          better way of doing so.  But the view has
          long been taken that a final decision should,
          save in special circumstances, be final. &#133;
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[24] Smith v. Linskills, supra, is consistent with a well
developed line of authority in England.  For example, in
Somasundaram v. M. Julius Melchior and Co., [1988] 1 W.L.R. 1394
(C.A.), a plaintiff, who had been convicted on his guilty plea
and unsuccessfully appealed that conviction, sued his solicitors
claiming that they improperly pressured him to plead guilty.  He
alleged that had they not done so, he would have pleaded not
guilty and would have been acquitted or at least received a
shorter sentence.  The solicitors successfully moved to strike
the claim.  They did so on three grounds, one of which is
relevant to this appeal.   May L.J., for the court, said, at p.
1403:
          </pre>
    <pre>     For these reasons it is in our judgment an abuse of the
     process of the court for the plaintiff to bring this action which
     necessarily involves an attack on the conviction and sentence
     imposed by the Crown Court and upheld in the Court of Appeal
     (Criminal Division) subject to the reduction in sentence.</pre>
    <pre>[25] May L.J. relied on a judgment of the House of Lords in
Rondel v. Worsley, [1969] 1 A.C. 191.  In that case, the Law
Lords held that a lawyer could not be sued in negligence for his
or her conduct of the defence in a criminal proceeding.  Their
Lordships held that the immunity was policy-driven and rested
partly on concerns about finality, inconsistent results and the
difficulties associated with fairly relitigating long decided
cases.  These are the exactly the same concerns that drove the
result in Smith v. Linskills, supra.  The doctrine that immunizes
a lawyer from a negligence lawsuit arising out of the conduct of
the defence in a criminal proceeding and the doctrine that
declares as abusive attempts to use a negligence action to
relitigate issues finally decided in a previous criminal
proceeding are closely related in the English jurisprudence.
[26] The English Court of Appeal recently addressed both a
lawyer&#146;s qualified immunity from negligence claims and abuse of
process claims arising out of negligence actions against lawyers.
In Arthur J.S. Hall and Co. v. Simons, [1999] 3 W.L.R. 873 (C.A.
Civ. Div.), the Court considered four cases in which the
plaintiffs had sued their solicitors in negligence.  In each
case, the defendants argued that the proposed suit involved an
attempt to relitigate issues which were the subject of final
court orders.  None of the four cases involved previous criminal
convictions.
[27] The Court of Appeal identified two discrete issues:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Was the lawyer immune from the claim founded in negligence
  (referred to as &#147;forensic immunity&#148;)?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Did the claim amount to an abuse of process in that it was
  an impermissible attempt to relitigate an issue which had been
  decided against the plaintiff in prior proceedings (referred to
  as &#147;the Hunter rule&#148;)?</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[28] Chief Justice Bingham, for the court, analyzed both issues
in detail.  He concluded at p. 900 that the applicability of the
Hunter rule should be decided first and the question of forensic
immunity addressed only if the action was not found to constitute
an abuse of process.  In considering the circumstances in which
an attempt to relitigate a previous criminal conviction in the
context of a negligence action against the lawyer would not
amount to an abuse of process, the Lord Chief Justice said, at p.
900:

      &#133; a collateral challenge in civil proceedings to a
      subsisting criminal conviction, particularly a conviction upheld
      or not challenged on appeal, and whether the defendant was
      convicted on his own admission or on the verdict of a court or
      jury, must always be the hardest to justify.  Nothing short of
      fresh evidence satisfying the Phosphate Sewage test will
      ordinarily suffice.</pre>
    <pre>[29] The reference to &#147;fresh evidence satisfying the Phosphate
Sewage test&#148; is a reference to Phosphate Sewage v. Molleson
(1879), 4 App. Cas. 801 at 814.  That case held that the finality
principle should yield to relitigation in the face of fresh
evidence, but only where that evidence was not available by the
exercise of reasonable diligence at the first proceeding and was
so significant that it &#147;entirely changed&#148; the nature of the case
from that presented at the first proceeding.
[30] Although the above passage refers only to the &#147;fresh
evidence&#148; exception, English authority also permits relitigation
in subsequent proceedings where the initial court order is
tainted by fraud:  R. v. Humphrys, [1977] A.C. 1 at 21 (H.L.);
McIlkenny v. The Chief Constable of the West Midlands, [1980]
Q.B. 283, per Goff L.J. at 333 (C.A.).
[31] It has been argued in some of the English cases that a claim
of negligence against a lawyer displaces the principles
prohibiting collateral attack on final orders, in that the
prohibition assumes that &#147;the intending plaintiff had a full
opportunity of contesting&#148; the first decision:  Hunter v. The
Chief Constable of the West Midlands, supra, at p. 541.  It is
said that an allegation of negligence is an assertion that the
party did not have a full opportunity to contest the initial
decision because of the lawyer&#146;s negligence.  Consequently, it is
argued that there can be no determination of the merits of the
abuse of process claim without an assessment of the merits of the
negligence claim.
[32] The court in Smith v. Linskills, supra, at p. 359, rejected
this argument:
          </pre>
    <pre>     &#133; Even if it be true that valid criticism can be made of the
     conduct of his defence, it seems to us quite impossible to hold
     that Mr. Smith [the plaintiff] lacked a full opportunity to
     contest the charge.  Were this the correct meaning of the rule,
     then the rule itself would be virtually meaningless, since it is
     hard to imagine a case in which a convicted defendant could not
     find some plausible ground upon which to criticise the
     preparation of the defence by his solicitor.  We fully appreciate
     the great difficulty which faces any convicted defendant seeking
     to challenge his conviction on appeal on the grounds that his
     defence had been negligently conducted;  this does not, however,
     lead to the conclusion that such a defendant lacked a full
     opportunity to contest the charge against him.</pre>
    <pre>[33] My review of the English authorities indicates that an
attempt by a plaintiff to relitigate the correctness of a
criminal conviction that is final, by way of a negligence action
against the lawyer who acted for the plaintiff in relation to the
criminal proceedings, will often, but not always, be found to be
an abuse of process.  The plaintiff must plead facts that bring
him within the &#147;fresh evidence&#148; or &#147;fraud&#148; exceptions to avoid
having the claim struck as an abuse of process.  A mere
allegation of ineffective representation will not suffice.
[34] Although the diffuse nature of the appellant&#146;s claim makes
it difficult to say with certainty, it would appear that the
appellant could not bring himself within the limited
circumstances in which the English courts would permit this case
to proceed beyond the pleadings stage.
[35] Before turning to the law in this province, I observe that
the concerns voiced by Bingham M.R. in Smith v. Linskills, supra,
will arise if the appellant&#146;s action is allowed to proceed to
trial.  There will be a risk of inconsistent results;  it will be
difficult to conduct a fair trial because of the passage of time
and the death of Mr. Ain;  and, there will be a significant
intrusion on the finality principle.  Given the nature of the
criminal charges in issue in this case, the concerns are
particularly acute.  The two young complainants have been through
the criminal justice process and endured the well recognized
hardships associated with that process.  If the appellant&#146;s claim
is allowed to proceed, the complainants will find themselves
drawn back into the judicial machinery almost a decade after
their initial exposure to it.
[36] Unlike the well developed  English jurisprudence, I can find
no Canadian authority which addresses the specific issue raised
on this appeal.  There are certainly cases which have premised a
finding of abuse of process on the conclusion that the second
proceeding was an attempt to improperly relitigate matters
decided in earlier proceedings:  e.g. Foy v. Foy, supra.  Those
cases did not, however, involve allegations of negligence against
the lawyer in the first proceeding and do not hold that
relitigation of decided issues is per se an abuse of process.
[37] The case law involving negligence claims against lawyers
arising out of their conduct of litigation is, however, helpful.
The qualified immunity recognized in cases like Rondel v.
Worsley, supra, and Saif Ali v. Sydney Mitchell and Co.,[1980]
A.C. 198 (H.L.) has never been the law in Ontario:  Leslie v.
Ball (1863), 22 U.C.Q.B. 512;  Wade v. Ball (1870), 20 U.C.C.P.
302;  Demarco v. Ungaro et al. (1979), 21 O.R. (2d) 673 (H.C.);
Wong v. Thomson, Rogers, [1994] O.J. No. 1318 (C.A.).  In
Ontario, lawyers can be sued for their negligent conduct of
litigation.
[38] In Demarco v.Ungaro, supra, Krever J. carefully examined
Rondel v. Worsley, supra, and the policies underlying the
&#147;forensic immunity&#148; rule set down in that case.  He concluded
that those policies, including concerns about the relitigation of
stale cases, the need for finality, and the danger of
inconsistent results did not justify shielding lawyers from the
damage caused by their negligence in the conduct of litigation.
[39] Krever J. identified several policy concerns that, in his
view, required that a client be able to sue his lawyer in
negligence even if some relitigation of prior cases resulted.
These policy considerations included:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  accountability:  lawyers should be as accountable as anyone
  else for their misdeeds;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  fairness:  those who suffer loss as a result of a lawyer&#146;s
  negligence should be entitled to compensation through the tort
  system;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the maintenance of minimum standards of competence:  the
  potential exposure to negligence claims serves as a deterrent
  against incompetent representation;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the integrity of the justice system:  lawyers should not
  appear to be given favoured treatment which is not extended to
  other professionals who have, arguably, at least as good a claim
  to immunity from negligence claims as do lawyers.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[40] Krever J. addressed relitigation concerns when he said, at
p. 694:
          </pre>
    <pre>      &#133; As to the second ground &#150; the prospect of relitigating an
      issue already tried, it is my view that the undesirability of
      that event does not justify the recognition of lawyers&#146; immunity
      in Ontario.  It is not a contingency that does not already exist
      in our law and seems to me to be inherently involved in the
      concept of res judicata in the recognition that a party, in an
      action in personam is only precluded from relitigating the same
      matter against a person who was a party to the earlier action.</pre>
    <pre>[41] Krever J.&#146;s view, that problems associated with relitigating
issues decided in the first proceeding should not prevent a
plaintiff from suing his lawyer in negligence, echoed the opinion
of Haggerty C.J. given a hundred years earlier in Wade v. Ball et
al., supra, at p. 304.  The Chief Justice dismissed concerns
about relitigating matters decided in the first proceeding in
four words:  &#147;This cannot be avoided.&#148;
[42] Demarco v. Ungaro has been approved in this court:  Wong v.
Thomson, Rogers, supra.5  In Wong, the plaintiff claimed that the
damages awarded by the jury in an action arising out of a car
accident were inordinately low as a result of his lawyer&#146;s
negligent failure to call certain evidence which would have
enhanced the plaintiff&#146;s damages claim.  At the negligence trial,
the trial judge heard that evidence, concluded that it would not
have changed the result at the first trial, and dismissed the
action.  In affirming that result, this court, at least
implicitly, accepted that a negligence action against a lawyer
may involve relitigation of an issue finally decided in the case
giving rise to the negligence action.
[43] The negligence alleged in Demarco v. Ungaro, supra, and in
Wong v. Thomson, Rogers, supra, arose out of a lawyer&#146;s defence
of civil claims.  I see no reason, however, to come to a
different conclusion where the alleged negligence arises out of
the defence of a criminal case.  Demarco v. Ungaro has been
applied in trial courts to cases involving allegations of
negligence in the defence of criminal cases:  eg. see:  Boudreau
v. Benaiah, supra,;  Bartolovic v. Bennett, [1996] O.J. No. 961
(Gen. Div.).6
[44] Lawyers have no immunity from negligence claims based on
their conduct of litigation in Ontario.  Policy concerns
associated with the relitigation of issues decided in previous
proceedings, while recognized as legitimate, have been
subordinated to other policy interests that are advanced by
permitting clients to sue lawyers for their negligence.  The
policy concerns leading the English courts to hold that lawyers
were immune from negligence actions based on their conduct of
litigation are the same concerns underlying the abuse of process
doctrine in cases arising out of negligence actions against
lawyers in England.  If those policy concerns do not justify any
form of immunity for lawyers conducting litigation, they cannot
justify an abuse of process doctrine that would bar many attempts
to sue lawyers for negligence arising out of their conduct of
litigation.  The right to sue a lawyer for negligence in the
conduct of litigation is inconsistent with a doctrine that would
strike many such claims unless the plaintiff could establish the
very limited special circumstances identified in the English case
law.
[45] I would summarize the law in Ontario as follows.  There is
no per se rule that negligence actions against lawyers that
involve a relitigation of issues decided in a previous proceeding
are an abuse of process.  The mere fact that the negligence
action will involve the relitigation of issues finally decided in
prior proceedings will not, standing alone, warrant the striking
of the claim as an abuse of process. The plaintiff is not
required to plead special circumstances in order to survive a
motion to strike the claim.
[46] I do not suggest that lawsuits like the one brought by the
appellant can never be struck as an abuse of process.  To the
contrary, I would think that the very policy concerns which have
driven the abuse of process doctrine in the English case law
invite close judicial scrutiny of such claims.  That scrutiny
must, however, be directed at the circumstances of each case.
Actions brought for an improper motive (e.g. to harass
complainants), actions brought where the lawyer&#146;s competence was
unsuccessfully litigated by the plaintiff during the criminal
proceedings, actions brought after a considered decision was made
not to litigate the lawyer&#146;s competence in the context of the
criminal proceedings, or actions brought before the plaintiff had
exhausted all remedies in the criminal process could constitute
an abuse of process.  No doubt there will be other situations in
which a negligence action could properly be characterized as an
abuse of process.  Each case will turn on its own facts.  As the
abuse of process inquiry is essentially a factual one, I would
think that defendants would be in a better position to raise that
issue after pleadings are exchanged and discoveries completed.
[47] In rejecting the English position, I do not minimize the
difficulties inherent in fairly trying the merits of the
appellant&#146;s claim.  There is, however, real harm in denying a
litigant like the appellant an opportunity to present the merits
of a claim.  The appellant has been trying for a number of years
to find the proper forum in which to advance his complaints about
his lawyer.  The law should be slow to close the courtroom door
on the appellant without giving him any chance to prove the
merits of his claim.
[48] I also do not suggest that negligence actions provide the
best forum for the resolution of issues concerning the competence
of legal representation in criminal proceedings.  Where possible,
all matters affecting the propriety of a conviction, including
allegations of ineffective representation, should be addressed in
the criminal proceedings.  The development of the jurisprudence
referable to challenges to the competence of representation at
trial should lead to most allegations of ineffective
representation being made and decided in the criminal courts on
direct appeal from conviction:  R. v. Garofoli (1988), 41 C.C.C.
(3d) 97 at 151-52 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Collier (1992), 77 C.C.C.
(3d) 570 at 573 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. W.(W.) (1995), 100 C.C.C.
(3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.);  R. v. Joanisse (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35
(Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused 111 C.C.C. (3d)
vi.  If, on appeal, a convicted person successfully demonstrates
ineffective representation by counsel and the conviction is set
aside, there will be no impediment to a negligence action against
the lawyer.7
[49] In cases where the conviction stands and actions are
commenced against lawyers for negligence, those lawyers will be
able to avail themselves of the various pre-trial means available
to terminate actions that are clearly without merit (eg. see
Rules 20, 21, 25.11).  Those remedies will be particularly
effective where there is a factual basis for an abuse of process
claim or where the negligence allegations amount to no more than
allegations of errors in judgment:  see Bartolovic v. Bennett,
supra;  Blackburn v. Lapkin (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 292 (Gen. Div.).
If, however, none of the pre-trial remedies are appropriate, the
law in this province accepts that the values served by permitting
such cases to go to trial justify the negative consequences
inherent in the relitigation of issues finally determined in
prior proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[50] The respondent relied exclusively on the fact that the
negligence action amounted to an attempt to relitigate the
correctness of the appellant&#146;s criminal convictions.  For the
reasons set out above, that fact alone does not justify striking
the claim as an abuse of process.  Binks J. erred in striking the
claim.  I would set aside his order and direct that the claim
proceed.  In so holding, I would not preclude the respondent&#146;s
right to bring a further motion to strike the claim as an abuse
of process if a factual basis for that claim develops in the
course of litigation.
[51] Given the prolixity of the appellant&#146;s claim and the fact
that Mr. Ain is deceased, I think it is appropriate to give the
respondent 60 days to deliver a statement of defence.  Time for
delivery of the statement of defence shall run from the release
of these reasons.

1 The records of this court confirm that both appeals were
dismissed.  The appeal from the sexual assault charge was
dismissed on December 18, 1995.  Written reasons were given
(C17224).  The appeal from the sexual interference conviction was
dismissed on April 23, 1997.  No reasons were given (C26829).
2 There is no formal order in the appeal book.
3 An appeal from this judgment is presently reserved in this
court.  The issue raised in this appeal is not raised in that
appeal.
4 Smith could not sue the barrister who actually conducted the
defence in court:  Rondel v. Worsley, [1969] 1 A.C. 191.
5 Demarco v. Ungaro has been followed in other provinces at the
trial level:  Garrant v. Moskal, [1985] 2 W.W.R. 80 (Man. Q.B.);
B. Matthews Developments Ltd. v. Hanman, [1988] B.C.J. No. 822
(B.C.S.C.);  Hodge (M.) &amp; Sons Limited v. Monaghan (1985), 150
A.P.R. 173 (Nfld. T.D.);  Sherman v. Ward, [1998] 10 W.W.R. 765
(Alta. Q.B.).
6 It does not appear that it was alleged that the negligence
action constituted an abuse of process in either of those cases.
7 Proposals for some form of review of allegedly &#147;wrongful&#148;
convictions outside of the existing appellate process could offer
another venue in which allegations of ineffective representation
could be tested without mounting a collateral attack on a
criminal conviction.</pre></td>
