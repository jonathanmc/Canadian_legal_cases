    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice John D. Ground dated
January 20, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant now confines this appeal to a challenge to the
order of Ground J. dismissing the claims of S. B. McLaughlin
Associates Inc. (&quot;S.B.M.A.&quot;) for damages arising out of the
alleged breaches by Zurich.
[2]  The motion seeking this relief was based on the assertion
that this plaintiff lacked legal capacity.  The moving party
referenced Rule 21.01(3)(b) in its notice of motion.
[3]  Ground J. disposed of this motion by concluding that
&quot;S.B.M.A. does not have the legal capacity to prosecute the claim
for damages&quot;.
[4]  In our view, Ground J. erred in this conclusion.  The notion
of legal capacity referred to in Rule 21.01(3)(b) is a relatively
narrow and technical one relating to the plaintiff's legal
ability to commence the litigation.  Here, there is no doubt that
S.B.M.A. was at all times a duly incorporated company with the
capacity to commence the action.
[5]  The reasoning used by Ground J. to reach his conclusion
related to the merits of the plaintiff's claim.  While this
reasoning could have been relevant to a Rule 20 motion, or
perhaps a Rule 21.01(1)(a) motion, this motion was neither of
those.  The appellant was put on notice of a motion challenging
its legal capacity and the motions judge disposed of the motion
on that basis.
[6]  While there was reference in the applicant's material to
Rule 21.01(1)(a), it was in the context of the challenge to
S.B.M.A.'s legal capacity.  Indeed, a motion under
Rule 21.01(1)(a) could not be properly brought until the close of
pleadings, which had not yet occurred here.  See Montreal Trust
Co. of Canada v. Toronto-Dominion Bank et al. (1992), 40 C.P.C.
(3d) 389 at 395-6.
[7]  Hence, the appeal must be allowed with costs and the motion
to strike out the statement of claim of S.B.M.A. for want of
legal capacity must be dismissed with costs.  This is without
prejudice to the respondent's right to subsequently bring such
motion or motions as it sees fit and the Rules of Court permit.
