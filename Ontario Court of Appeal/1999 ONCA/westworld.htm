    <pre>On appeal from a decision of Somers J. dated July 16, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  National Trust and Pafco agreed with Westworld that National
Trust would use the latter&#146;s proposal to promote National Trust&#146;s
mortgage products.  Pafco, which was to provide and underwrite
the warranties, agreed with Westworld to pay it a specified
amount for each warranty so issued.
[2]  Putting it more charitably than is deserved, National Trust
failed utterly to carry out its part of the arrangement.  Instead
of acknowledging its failure to Pafco and Westworld, National
Trust chose to deal with Pafco alone.  They settled their
differences without any apparent regard for the interests of
Westworld.
[3]  Not surprisingly, Westworld, the originator of the proposal,
sued both.  Somers J. in a careful analysis of the evidence found
Pafco liable to Westworld in damages and National Trust liable to
provide the accounting necessary to establish the extent of such
damages.  National Trust and Pafco both appeal.
[4]  Somers J. founded liability on the part of Pafco on the
basis of both contract and fiduciary duty.  It is not entirely
clear whether the contractual basis involves an implied term
entitling Westworld to require Pafco to pursue National Trust for
money ultimately due to Westworld.  If such a term cannot be
found in the contract, we would certainly imply it.  Although the
trial judge did not refer to or rely upon Hodgkinson v. Simms,
[1994] 3 S.C.R. 377, relief might also have been available upon
the basis that Westworld had a reasonable expectation that Pafco
would act in their mutual interest.
[5]  The conduct of National Trust and Pafco is, in the
circumstances, unconscionable.  Their appeals as to liability are
dismissed with costs.
[6]  Westworld cross-appealed with respect to two matters.  One
was the definition of the mortgages to be included in the
accounting.  Westworld argues that it should include renewals and
refinancings.  Somers J. considered this question very
thoroughly.  We are not persuaded that he erred in concluding as
he did.
[7]  The second part of Westworld&#146;s cross-appeal concerned the
date from which pre-judgment interest is to run.  The trial judge
chose May 26, 1996, the date of the termination of the
promotions.  He gave no reason for choosing that date and it has
no inherent logic.
[8]  The life of the promotion ran from September 12, 1994 to May
26, 1996.  Pre-judgment interest is payable from the dates when
Westworld could reasonably have expected to be paid its share of
the price of the warranties.  Such evidence as there is indicates
that the issuance of warranties was not spread evenly over the
period in question.  That evidence does not, however, suggest
that calculating pre-judgment interest from the mid-point of the
promotion period, after adjusting for the delays inherent in the
program, would yield an unjust result.  On this basis, pre-
judgment interest will run from September 15, 1995.
[9]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.  The cross-
appeal is allowed only to the extent that the date from which pre-
judgment interest is to run is changed from May 26, 1996 to
September 15, 1995.  As success is divided, there will be no
costs of the cross-appeal.</pre>
