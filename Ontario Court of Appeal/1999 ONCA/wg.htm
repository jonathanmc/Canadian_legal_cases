    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of R. Thompson J. dated October 2, 1997.

</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, a teacher, was convicted on an indictment
alleging three counts of sexual assault on three teenage students
in the school where he taught a shop course.  He was charged with
one act of sexual assault on L.V. between September 1, 1993 and
January 31, 1994; one act of sexual assault on A.R. between
September 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994 and one act of sexual assault
on E.J. between March 1 and April 30, 1995.  In all three cases,
the alleged sexual assaults consisted of momentary touching of
the complainants&#146; breasts over their clothing.
[2]  The appellant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment
(three months consecutive on each count) and three years
probation. The appeal is against conviction and sentence.</pre>
    <pre>     Overview of the case at trial</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant was a shop teacher with the Grey County Board
of Education at High Point School in Dundalk, Ontario. He had 24
years of experience as a teacher in various positions with the
Board.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In 1995, three young teen-age girls came forward and
described assaults committed on them by the appellant.  While two
of the girls knew each other (L.V. and A.R.), they were not good
friends and the third girl (E.J.) was from a different year and,
at most, shared some of the same circle of friends.  While L.V.
and A.R. were aware of the fact of each other&#146;s complaint, the
trial judge held that neither knew the details of the other&#146;s
allegations.
[5]  All three girls told of the appellant assaulting them
somewhere in the school (two in his shop class, one in the
hallway).  The appellant, on the girls&#146; evidence, would approach
them for some apparently innocent purpose - to comment on work
being done (L.V. and A.R.) or to remind them of a school rule
(E.J.) - and use this encounter as an opportunity to fondle the
girl&#146;s breast.
[6]  L.V. described how in a shop class the appellant approached
her while she was working on a lathe.  He walked up to her, stood
behind her and put his one hand on her chest, cupping her breast
in his hand.
[7]  A.R. told of how the appellant had come up to her at a
different time but in the same shop classroom while she was
working with welding equipment and had similarly placed his hand
on her breast in a cupping fashion.
[8]  E.J.&#146;s testimony was that the appellant had stopped her in
the hall for running (a minor breach of school rules) by grabbing
her arm and, after telling her not to run, rubbed her chest with
the back of his hand two or three times before sending her off.
[9]  The appellant denied these complaints and asserted that the
complainants were fabricating their evidence and acting in
collusion, either consciously or unconsciously.  There were
rumours around the school that the appellant was a &#147;pervert&#148; and
this, it was said, inspired the complaints.  The appellant also
relied on evidence that he submitted suggested that the assaults
as described were unlikely, including:
     </pre>
    <pre>         the physical layout of the shop floor made the assaults
       unlikely to have taken place as the complainants described them;
     </pre>
    <pre>         the assaults would have created a situation of danger in the
       shop class;
     </pre>
    <pre>         the appellant would have had dirty hands and marked the
       clothes of the shop victims if he had assaulted them; and
     </pre>
    <pre>         the appellant was on half days (afternoons) when the assault
       on E.J. took place.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The defence witnesses were colleagues of the appellant and
testified as to the physical surroundings at the school and the
appellant&#146;s schedule.  The appellant denied the allegations,
stating that he did not engage in any sort of physical contact
with the victims that might have been misunderstood and that the
complaints were fabricated.
[11] The Crown relied on the credibility of the Crown witnesses,
what he referred to as the striking similarity of their
complaints, the absence of any meaningful opportunity for
collaboration (especially with regard to E.J.), the absence of
any motive to fabricate and lack of credibility of certain
defence witnesses.  The trial Judge found beyond a reasonable
doubt that the assaultive behaviour in question took place and
convicted the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues
          </pre>
    <pre>1.   Whether the trial judge decided the case solely upon the
complainants&#146; demeanor and credibility as witnesses.
2.   Whether the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in the
following particulars:
          </pre>
    <pre>(a)    The alibi evidence with respect to E.J.;
(b)    Evidence of collaboration among the three complainants;
(c)    Certain findings of credibility with respect to the
       appellant&#146;s evidence;
(d)    His treatment of the defence witness Routenberg; and
(e)    Inconsistencies in the evidence of L.V.
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   Whether the sentence was a fit one?</pre>
    <pre>  Analysis</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1.  Whether the trial judge decided the case solely upon
the complainants&#146; demeanor and credibility as witnesses.</pre>
    <pre>[12] This case is one of those unfortunate examples of a trial
judge applying one standard of scrutiny to the evidence led by
the Crown in a sexual assault case involving youthful
complainants and another to the evidence of the adult accused
person and those who testified in his defence.  The complainants
were not children; they were teen-age students attending the
school in which the appellant was a teacher.  L.V. and A.R. were
both 16 when they testified as to events when they were 12.  E.J.
was 14 when she testified as to an event when she was 12.  While
some allowance must be made for minor discrepancies in their
testimony, in my opinion the testimony of all three complainants
must be judged in the overall context of the plausibility of the
conduct they allege. There was but one act with respect to each
of the three complainants.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The trial judge was entirely uncritical of the complainants.
He approached the individual charges against the appellant by
reciting the testimony of each complainant in isolation and
concluded that he believed them on the basis of their demeanor or
performance in the witness box.  There is no analysis of internal
contradictions in their testimony or discussion about matters
raised in cross-examination. At this point in his reasons, the
trial judge had not considered any of the defence evidence
including the evidence of alibi led by the appellant with respect
to E.J..  Nevertheless he stated he was prepared to accept the
unconfirmed and unsupported testimony of the three complainants
before embarking on a cursory review of the defence evidence.  In
so doing, he failed to judge the appellant on the totality of the
evidence.
[14] The proper approach to the burden of proof is to consider
all of the evidence together and not to assess individual items
of evidence in isolation: see R. v. Morin (1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d)
193 (S.C.C.). This is particularly true where the Crown&#146;s case
depends solely on the unsupported evidence of the complainants
and where the principal issue is those witnesses&#146; credibility and
reliability. As Rowles J.A. emphasized in R. v. R.W.B. (1993), 40
W.A.C. 1 (B.C.C.A), these issues are not to be determined in
isolation.  She said at p. 9:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where, as here, the case for the Crown is wholly dependent
          upon the testimony of the complainant, it is essential that the
          credibility and reliability of the complainant&#146;s evidence be
          tested in the light of all of the other evidence presented.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[15] This court has twice adopted the above passage from R. v.
R.W.B.  In R. v. S. (W.) (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 242, I wrote on
behalf of the court. In relation to Rowles J.A.&#146;s admonition to
determine both credibility and reliability on the basis of &#147;all
of the other evidence presented&#148;, I stated at p. 250:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The issue, however, is not the sincerity of the witness but
          the reliability of the witness&#146; testimony. Demeanour alone should
          not suffice to found a conviction where there are significant
          inconsistencies and conflicting evidence on the record &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[16] In particular, I warned against a process of reasoning that
accepts the complainant&#146;s credibility on the basis of demeanour,
at the outset, and then proceeds to discredit the contrary
evidence. I stated, at pp. 251-2:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Here, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the
          complainant, despite its obvious exaggeration, solely on the
          basis of her demeanour &#133; Having decided that he believed the
          complainant, the trial judge sought to discredit the credibility
          of those who contradicted her &#133; He was favourably impressed with
          the complainant and the manner in which she testified and,
          consequently, he believed her. He then subtly shifted the onus to
          the appellant, as accused, to give some explanation as to why the
          complainant would lie &#133; In this manner, the trial judge failed to
          properly apply the presumption of innocence, and to adequately
          found the conviction on the whole of the evidence. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[17] Galligan J.A. (Arbour J.A. concurring) applied these
principles in R. v. G. (M.) (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 347 (Ont.
C.A.), as follows, at pp. 355-6:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    This was a case which depended entirely upon the
          credibility of the complainant. The trial judge accepted her
          evidence based upon her demeanour in the witness-box &#133; when trial
          judges are assessing credibility it is worthwhile to keep in mind
          what was said by O&#146;Halloran J.A. in Faryna v. Chorny, [1952] 2
          D.L.R. 354 at pp. 356-7, 4 W.W.R. (N.S.) 171 (B.C. C.A.):
               </pre>
    <pre>                         If a trial Judge&#146;s finding of
               credibility is to depend solely on which
               person he thinks made the better appearance
               of sincerity in the witness box, we are left
               with a purely arbitrary finding and justice
               would then depend upon the best actors in the
               witness box. On reflection it becomes almost
               axiomatic that the appearance of telling the
               truth is but one of the elements that enter
               into the credibility of the evidence of a
               witness &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>                         The credibility of interested
               witnesses, particularly in cases of
               conflict of evidence, cannot be gauged
               solely by the test of whether the
               personal demeanour of the particular
               witness carried conviction of the truth.
               The test must reasonably subject his
               story to an examination of its
               consistency with the probabilities that
               surround the currently existing
               conditions. In short, the real test of
               the truth of the story of a witness in
               such a case must be its harmony with the
               preponderance of the probabilities which
               a practical and informed person would
               readily recognize as reasonable in that
               place and in those conditions &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    &#133; The law does not clothe the trial
               Judge with a divine insight into the
               hearts and minds of the witnesses. And a
               Court of Appeal must be satisfied that
               the trial Judge&#146;s finding of credibility
               is based not on one element only to the
               exclusion of others, but is based on all
               the elements by which it can be tested
               in the particular case. [Emphasis of
               Galligan J.A.]</pre>
    <pre>[18] I agree with the appellant that the trial judge made
fundamental errors in his assessment of the complainants&#146;
credibility. Upon considering the reasons for judgment as a
whole, it is apparent that the trial judge reached the conclusion
that the three complainants were to be believed on the sole basis
of their apparent honesty and demeanor in the witness box,
without assessing their testimony in the light of the entire
evidence.
[19] In particular, the trial judge never addressed in his
reasons the numerous improbabilities in the evidence. For a
start, it was improbable that the occurrences in the shop
happened as described given the dangerousness of the alleged
acts, the likelihood of detection in a classroom full of students
and the physical impracticality of the acts in the limited space.
Crown counsel at trial himself, in his submissions, characterized
the alleged actions of the appellant as &#147;imprudent, impractical
and dangerous, but&#133; not impossible.&#148; Much of the defence was
focussed on these aspects of the case. In the context of this
case, it was at least incumbent upon the trial judge to test the
complainants&#146; credibility against this evidence. It is not at all
apparent from his reasons that he did so.</pre>
    <pre>     Issue 2.  Misapprehension of the evidence</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  Alibi evidence respecting Erin</pre>
    <pre>[20] E.J. testified that her assault took place &#147;somewhere in
April&#148; of 1995.  It occurred during a recess, after she had gone
to her locker to get her coat and then had gone to the bathroom.
She was in a hurry to go outside and was running down the hall.
Her coat was buttoned up.  The appellant came out of his shop
classroom and observed her running which was contrary to the
rules.  As she ran past him, he grabbed her by one of her arms
near the elbow, stopped her and told her not to run.  She said
that when he let go of her arm he rubbed her breast three times
with the outside of his hand, moving his hand up and down on the
outside of her coat. She walked away and said nothing.
[21] The alibi issue arose because E.J. was apparently quite
clear that this incident happened during the morning recess and
not after lunch.  The appellant had only afternoon classes during
1994-95 because of his own child-care responsibilities at home.
His wife worked in the morning and he looked after the children.
In the afternoon they switched roles.  He testified to this, as
did the school principal, Janice Powell.  The trial judge did not
deal with this important evidence at all.
[22] On appeal, the Crown attempts to make the point that E.J.
was not that clear as to the alleged assault having occurred
during the morning.  Be that as it may, the important thing is
that if there was a conflict, in the circumstances of this case
it was essential that the trial judge make findings of fact and
resolve the conflict either for or against the appellant.  This
failure takes on added significance in this case where the Crown
on appeal concedes that without the evidence of E.J., he would
have difficulty in upholding the convictions of sexual assault on
the other two girls.</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Evidence of collaboration among the complainants</pre>
    <pre>[23] L.V. testified that when she was in grade 7 she took shop
with the appellant for some five months starting in the fall of
1993. On one occasion, she cannot pinpoint it, she stated that
when she was working on a lathe the appellant came up behind her
and cupped his hand on her breasts over her clothes for about
five seconds.  The appellant did not repeat this conduct for the
balance of grade 7 or in grade 8.  L.V. did not report the
incident until the Spring of 1995.  The circumstances of her
reporting require some development.
[24] While L.V. was in grade 8, Cst. Rusk of the O.P.P. spoke to
the class about harassment and other problems in the school.  She
invited any student who had a problem to speak to her privately.
Later that day L.V. and a group of friends, including A.R., met
to talk about a problem the girls were having with a young male
student making rude comments and snapping their brassieres.  L.V.
asked A.R. if she had heard of the appellant &#147;doing anything&#148;.
A.R. replied that &#147;yes, actually, he&#146;d done something to me&#148;.
[25] Later that day the group spoke to Cst. Rusk about the
conduct of the male student who had been bothering them.  One
member of the group asked: &#147;could a teacher get away with this
kind of harassment as well?&#148;  Cst. Rush said that such conduct
was improper, gave the girls her card and told them to get in
touch with her if they wanted to press charges.
[26] L.V. and a group of girls next met with a teacher, Mrs.
Patton, and delivered a list of complaints about the appellant.
We have not seen the list, but it is conceded that there were no
suggestions of sexual improprieties.  Two days after the first
meeting, there was a further meeting with Cst. Rusk, at which
L.V. and A.R. were present. After the meeting, L.V. privately
told the officer about her complaint of sexual touching.  This
was some 18 months after the incident.
[27] The trial judge dealt with this issue in a limited way.  He
said:
          </pre>
    <pre>                   I might interject at this point to note that A.R.&#146;s
          evidence was that at neither the meeting in the change room, the
          meeting with Constable Rusk, nor at the meeting at the A.
          residence, did any of the individual girls ever say what
          specifically the accused had done towards them.  I accept the
          evidence and find as a fact that prior to the individual
          interviews, in private, by Constable Rusk, neither witness was
          aware of what the specifics were concerning the actions of the
          accused.  I state this because I was acutely aware and sensitive
          to the possibility of conscious or sub-conscious contamination of
          either witness&#146;s recollection of the events complained of.  I
          could find no evidence of cross-contamination of the witness&#146;s
          recollection and accept their reciting of the facts as being
          independent of each other.</pre>
    <pre>[28] The appellant submits that there was abundant evidence of
&#147;collaboration&#148; or &#147;contamination&#148; in the legal sense of those
terms.  In R. v. Burke (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 205 (S.C.C.),
Sopinka J. gave the unanimous judgment of the Supreme Court of
Canada.  He stated that the &#147;opportunity&#148; for collusion or the
&#147;possibility&#148; of collaboration (in that case, the mere sharing of
a common lawyer by the two witnesses) was a factor to be weighed
at the end of the case, together with all the other evidence,
before deciding a complainant&#146;s reliability.  He said, at p. 222:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I am prepared to adopt the more conventional approach which
          would leave it to the trier of fact to determine what weight, if
          any, is to be given to evidence that is alleged to have been
          concocted by means of collusion or collaboration.  Under this
          approach, the trier of fact is obliged to consider the
          reliability of the evidence having regard to all the
          circumstances, including the opportunities for collusion or
          collaboration to concoct the evidence and the possibility that
          these opportunities were used for such a purpose. [Emphasis of
          Sopinka J. on word &#147;all&#148;, otherwise emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[29] The appellant submits that the trial judge&#146;s error, in this
regard, was two-fold.  First, he misconceived the issue as being
whether the two complainants had discussed the &#147;specifics&#148; of
their complaint when the real issue of collaboration was much
broader.  Second, he addressed the issue of collaboration
piecemeal, early in his reasons, and then completely eliminated
it from his consideration at the later stages of his reasons. In
his submission, there was overwhelming evidence of &#147;possible&#148;
collaboration and &#147;opportunities&#148; for collusion in the broad
sense described in R. v. Burke, supra, and the trial judge was
obliged to carry this evidence forward to the end of the case and
weigh it, together with the defence evidence, in deciding whether
the Crown&#146;s case had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
[30] I do not have to go as far as the appellant suggests.
However, I am in agreement  that the trial judge gave
insufficient consideration to this issue.  It takes on added
significance because the Crown takes the position that the
evidence of each complainant is admissible as similar fact
evidence to provide some measure of corroboration or support to
the testimony of the other complainants.  Accordingly, where the
statements are to be considered as similar act evidence,
collaboration becomes even more of a problem.  The observations
of Dubin J.A. of this court in Re College of Physicians &amp;
Surgeons of Ontario and K. (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 1 become apt.
There, Dubin J.A., after quoting from Lord Wilberforce in
Director of Public Prosecutions v. Boardman, [1975] A.C. 421 (at
p.444) on collaboration among conspirators, stated at p. 14:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is to be noted that this comment by Lord Wilberforce was
          shared only by Lord Cross.  In any event, I do not take what he
          said to mean that if there is merely a possibility of collusion,
          evidence of similar facts is per se inadmissible.  If there is a
          possibility of collusion, the trier of fact must give anxious
          consideration as to whether the testimony of the witnesses was
          concocted.  However, it is only if either the trier of fact is
          satisfied that there was a real chance that there was such
          concoction, or the facts are such that it could reasonably be
          inferred that there may have been concoction, that the evidence
          of one witness, if otherwise admissible, cannot be used to
          support or confirm the testimony of another witness.  In such
          circumstances, if the evidence is not otherwise admissible, it
          can be given no effect.  If, on the other hand, the trier of fact
          is satisfied that there was no such concoction or collusion and
          where a proper foundation has already been laid for the
          introduction of similar fact evidence, then such evidence can be
          used as supportive or confirmatory of the testimony of another
          witness.  Indeed, as stated by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in
          Boardman, at pp. 441-2:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    The learned judge left the matter fairly
               to the jury.  He mentioned the possibility of
               two people conspiring together and he
               examined the question whether there were or
               were not any indications that S and H had
               conspired together.  That was important
               because one question which the jury may have
               wished to consider was whether it was against
               all the probabilities, if the appellant was
               innocent, that two boys, unless they had
               collaborated, would tell stories having
               considerable features of similarity.</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  Certain findings of credibility with respect to the
appellant&#146;s evidence</pre>
    <pre>[31] The appellant mounted a substantial defence.  However, as is
usual in these cases, he found himself with the task of denying
criminal conduct that is alleged to have occurred in isolation
and within no specific time frame.  He was said to have assaulted
L.V. and A.R. in his classroom in the presence of some 25 other
students sometime when they were in grade seven.  L.V. was
supposed to be working at a lathe and A.R. was said to be doing
some welding.  In both cases, he is said to have come up behind
them when they were engaged in a project and reached around and
fondled their breasts briefly over their clothes.  As to E.J., he
was said to have assaulted her when, on his evidence and that of
his principal, he was not scheduled to be in the school at all.
[32] The appellant submits that the trial judge paid little
attention to any of the defence evidence.  I agree that while he
did recite some of it, he said nothing in his reasons to indicate
that he discerned its significance to the defence.  He recited
what the appellant had said and found that he did not believe
him.
[33] The only specific reason he gave for not believing him is
somewhat strange.  The appellant had testified that when he
worked in his classes, he was an active teacher and his hands
invariably became dirty.  He stated that he did not wash his
hands very often &#147;or any more than he absolutely had to&#148; during
the approximately one hour portion of the class devoted to
&#147;individual project time&#148;. He stated that, had he placed his
hands on the girls clothing, they would have left dirty marks.
As to this, the trial judge stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>                   I might note, although this was not determinative of my
          conclusions, that I found a certain portion of Mr. G.&#146;s evidence
          to be breaching the edges of credulity.  When asked if he had put
          his hands on the breasts of L.V. and A.R. as described by them,
          what would the effect be on their clothing, he responded by
          stating that he probably would have left hand marks on their
          clothing because his hands were always dirty from the debris in
          the shop. He testified he avoided washing his hands because the
          soap supplied by the school was caustic to his hands. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[34] The question of dirty hands was a non-issue.  Even the
complainants acknowledged that their hands became dirty from
debris and dust.  L.V. even commented that after her assault, she
looked at her clothes and expected to find dirt but none was
there.  The trial judge seems to focus on this detail as if it
was dispositive of the credibility of the appellant. The Crown
had asked if there was a sink available so that he and the
students could wash their hands. The answer was yes.  When asked
in re-examination why he did not wash his hands more often, the
appellant replied that the school soap was &#147;pretty brutal stuff&#148;
and frequent washings caused his hands to crack.</pre>
    <pre>  (d)  Treatment of the defence witness Routenberg</pre>
    <pre>[35] In my opinion, the trial judge&#146;s treatment of this witness
was most extraordinary.  John Routenberg was the teacher at the
Dundalk school who took over from the appellant in the shop class
when the appellant was suspended as a result of the police
investigation.  While he had taught at the school for eight years
and knew the appellant, there is no suggestion that there was a
special friendship between them.
[36] Routenberg testified as to certain shop measurements and the
location of the equipment.  He produced a sketch that, in
particular, purported to show the location of the lathe that L.V.
was working at in relation to a broom closet.  He testified that
it would be impossible for the appellant to have come up behind
L.V. in the manner that she described.
[37] The trial judge took a view of the shop classroom.  In his
reasons, he stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>                   I took a view of the classroom and observed the location
          of the lathe in question and the brooms hanging from the wall.
          My observation was that Mr. Routenberg had misstated the
          evidence.  There was ample room for the acts to have taken place.</pre>
    <pre>[38] No objection can be taken to these observations.  It is what
follows immediately after that is disturbing:
          </pre>
    <pre>                   I found Mr. Routenberg to be one of the most biased,
          partisan witnesses I have encountered in two decades of
          litigation.  He obviously slanted his evidence in favour of the
          accused.  He was less than independent as a witness.  He was an
          advocate for the accused &#150; not a witness.  His evidence was
          exaggerated to the extreme.  He was argumentative with counsel.
          He was possibly one of the worst witnesses I have ever seen.  I
          did not give him one ounce of credulity.</pre>
    <pre>[39] Given that there is very little controversy about the
location of the lathe and the broom closet and that the
measurements of all of the witnesses were pretty much the same,
the question of how roomy the space behind the lathe was became a
matter of opinion.  The trial judge&#146;s outburst can not be
justified on the record.  It leaves the impression that the trial
judge may have misapprehended the evidence of the witness. This
is a small community and the witness is a teacher at the school.
While the trial judge was not obliged to accept his evidence, it
is a rare occasion indeed where this type of public condemnation
is merited.  It gives the impression that he was sending a
message to any supporter of the appellant that if they testified
they exposed themselves to this pejorative treatment.  It also
gives the court further reason to believe that the trial judge
may have applied one standard of scrutiny to the evidence led by
the Crown and another to the evidence of the defence witness.</pre>
    <pre>     (e) Inconsistencies in the evidence of Lori V.</pre>
    <pre>[40] The appellant takes issue with inconsistencies in L.V.&#146;s
testimony regarding how she was standing at the lathe.  In
particular, the appellant notes that L.V. originally testified
that she was right-handed and stood with her shoulders parallel
to the lathe.  After hearing the defence witnesses, she testified
in reply that she was &#147;sort of ambidextrous&#148; and stood at a
different angle.  This angle would have created more room for the
appellant to stand behind her.
[41] I do not propose to spend much time on this ground of
appeal; it hardly merits the appellation &#147;major&#148; applied to it by
the appellant. Nevertheless, given the attention the defence
placed upon the unlikelihood of the appellant even being able to
approach L.V. from behind while she was working on the lathe, I
will say this. The trial judge could have resolved the matter by
findings of fact rather than a personal attack on Mr. Routenberg.
Such findings would be particularly helpful having regard to
L.V.&#146;s apparent volte face in reply, when she explained that she
used her left hand, thereby destroying the basic premise of the
appellant as to how she would have been standing in relation to
the lathe.</pre>
    <pre>     Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[42] I am not satisfied that the trial judge subjected the case
for the Crown to the scrutiny required to justify a criminal
conviction.  I find the judgment in appeal unsatisfactory to a
degree that I think there should be a new trial.  Some of my
objections, taken in isolation, could be ignored if the Crown had
a stronger case. However, given the stated reasons of the trial
judge that I have criticized in detail, I have no sense that this
is a safe conviction.
[43] Given my proposed disposition, it is not necessary to deal
with the sentence appeal.  However, I am not to be taken as
endorsing the sentence imposed.  The probation order, in
particular, contains the punitive requirement that the appellant
not be &#147;in the presence of a female under the age of 18 years
unless accompanied by a responsible adult other than your wife&#148;.
While he exempted the appellant&#146;s own two children from this
order, it had the effect of prohibiting them from having their
female cousins and friends and babysitters over to the house.
The order also inferred that the appellant&#146;s wife was
untrustworthy despite the total lack of any evidence to this
effect or anything to connect her with the appellant&#146;s conduct.
The Crown on appeal made no attempt to justify this portion of
the probation order.  I am afraid that it is but another example
of an over-reaction by the trial judge to the appellant and those
associated with him.</pre>
    <pre>     Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[44] Accordingly, for the reasons given, I would allow the appeal
and order a new trial.</pre>
