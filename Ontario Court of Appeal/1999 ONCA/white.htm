    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of sexual assault by a jury and
sentenced to 18 months imprisonment.  He appeals his conviction.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The complainant and appellant had become friends about 8
months prior to the alleged assault.  They had engaged in
consensual sexual activity on various occasions prior to the
incident.  According to the complainant, their relationship had
ceased about 3 months prior to the incident.  According to the
appellant, although he and the complainant had not seen each
other for some time, the nature of their relationship had not
changed prior to the evening of the alleged assault.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The events in issue occurred at the complainant's home
shortly after midnight.  She had been at a pool party earlier
that evening and had spoken briefly with the appellant.  She
denied inviting the appellant to come to her home later that
evening.  The appellant insisted that he had been invited over to
the complainant's house.  The appellant left the complainant's
home a few hours after arriving.  Almost two weeks later, the
complainant went to the hospital and complained that she had been
sexually assaulted.  She testified that she began to feel ill and
thought that perhaps she had some infection as a result of the
attack, which she said included anal and vaginal intercourse, so
she went to the hospital.  There was evidence of bruising on the
complainant's arms which could be viewed as consistent with her
description of the assault.  That bruising was first noticed by a
neighbour a few days after the alleged assault.  Apparently, the
complainant made some effort to conceal those bruises.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The jury's verdict hinged on its assessment of the
credibility of the complainant and the appellant.  She said she
was raped and sodomized.  He said they had consensual sexual
intercourse.  Both the complainant and appellant were subjected
to lengthy and persistent cross-examination.  There was evidence
which could buttress the credibility of the complainant and other
evidence which was capable of  supporting the appellant's
credibility or at least leaving the jury with a reasonable doubt.
This was eminently a case for a jury and the trial judge fairly
and accurately put the case to the jury.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant raised three grounds of appeal:
&#130;    was Crown counsel's cross-examination of the appellant
     improper and did it result in a miscarriage of justice?
&#130;    did the trial judge err in failing to order production of
certain medical records for examination by him to determine
whether they should be turned over to the appellant?
&#130;    did the trial judge err in admitting evidence that the
complainant did not engage in consensual anal intercourse with
her former husband or boyfriend, and did the trial judge err in
not giving any limiting instruction as to the use which could be
made of that evidence?</pre>
    <pre>Crown Counsel's Cross-examination</pre>
    <pre>[6]  There is no need to review the well-established and
unfortunately ever-growing line  of authority relating to
improper cross-examination by Crown counsel.  Improper cross-
examination of an accused may taint a trial either by resulting
in actual prejudice to an accused or by creating the appearance
of unfairness.  Each allegation of improper cross-examination
must be assessed in the context of the particular case.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Counsel for the appellant submitted that Crown counsel's
cross-examination of the appellant was improper in several
respects.  I would summarize them as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          (i)  Crown counsel improperly stated his</pre>
    <pre>          personal opinion of the appellant's guilt</pre>
    <pre>          during his cross-examination;
</pre>
    <pre>          (ii) Crown counsel asked questions which were</pre>
    <pre>          abusive and calculated to belittle the</pre>
    <pre>          appellant in the eyes of the jury;
</pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     Crown counsel improperly asked the</pre>
    <pre>          appellant to explain why other witnesses had</pre>
    <pre>          lied;
</pre>
    <pre>          (iv) Crown counsel, through his questioning,</pre>
    <pre>          improperly planted the suggestion that the</pre>
    <pre>          appellant's evidence should be discounted</pre>
    <pre>          because he had received full disclosure</pre>
    <pre>          before trial and had been subject to cross-</pre>
    <pre>          examination on only one occasion;  and
</pre>
    <pre>          (v)  Crown counsel improperly implied at the</pre>
    <pre>          close of his cross-examination that but for</pre>
    <pre>          an adverse ruling from the trial judge he</pre>
    <pre>          would have been able to present further</pre>
    <pre>          &quot;damning&quot; evidence in the course of the cross-</pre>
    <pre>          examination of the appellant.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Two of the six extracts of the cross-examination relied on
by counsel to support the contention that Crown counsel
improperly placed his personal opinion before the jury reveal no
more than inappropriate factual assertions in the course of
putting questions.  The other four extracts involve the putting
of the Crown's theory to the accused in the form of suggestions
(two extracts);  an acknowledgement that the Crown and the
appellant did not agree on what had happened (one extract) and
one question which, while perhaps improper in its initial form,
was corrected before the appellant was required to answer it.
These six extracts, considered cumulatively and in the context of
the entire trial, do not rise to the level of impropriety, much
less impropriety which occasioned a miscarriage of justice.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Counsel for the appellant referred to three extracts from
the cross-examination to support his submission that the cross-
examination was sarcastic and designed to demean the appellant.
Two of the comments are so trivial as to deserve no further
reference.  The third extract does require some explanation.  In
his examination-in-chief, the appellant provided a detailed
review of his various liaisons with the complainant between
November 1993 and July 1994.  He described one occasion on which
they met at a hotel in Hamilton.  He testified that shortly after
they went to the hotel room he became ill and sick to his
stomach.  He didn't provide any explanation as to the cause of
his illness.  In cross-examination, the Crown sought to
demonstrate that the appellant had become sick to his stomach
because he was very drunk.  Crown counsel suggested to the
appellant that he was &quot;pukingly drunk.&quot;  The appellant eventually
agreed that he &quot;drank so much he got sick.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[10] This cross-examination was relevant to the appellant's
credibility in that it could support the contention that the
appellant had shaded his evidence in-chief to omit details which
presented him in an unfavourable light.  The cross-examination
was also relevant because the appellant's sobriety on the night
of the alleged assault was in issue.  It was the Crown's position
that the appellant was somewhat intoxicated and that his
condition caused him to become aggressive and explained in part
his attack on the complainant.  The appellant insisted that
although he had been drinking earlier in the evening, he was
sober and fully in control of himself when he went to the
complainant's home and engaged in sexual activity with her.
Cross-examination to show that the appellant had failed to refer
to his significant intoxication at the time of an earlier
encounter with the complainant could affect the jury's assessment
of the appellant's evidence of the effect of his consumption of
alcohol on the evening of the alleged attack.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Crown counsel's use of the phrase &quot;pukingly drunk&quot; was
neither sarcastic nor abusive.  It was, on the appellant's own
admission, an accurate description of his condition.  No doubt,
Crown counsel chose such strong and vivid language in an effort
to impress upon the jury the significant degree of intoxication
which the appellant had failed to mention in his description of
the events during examination-in-chief.  There is nothing
improper in this line of cross-examination.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The third complaint made by the appellant arises out of the
following question put by Crown counsel:</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   You say May couldn't have happened,
          didn't happen, you never showed up drunk in
          May, you never frightened her child, all of
          that is either a lie or a figment of her
          imagination in some fashion.</pre>
    <pre>          A.   That's correct.</pre>
    <pre>[13] This question was a reference to an event which the
complainant said occurred in May, about two months before the
alleged assault.  According to her, the appellant arrived at her
home one evening in a drunken state.  He inadvertently frightened
her son when he entered the complainant's bedroom.  The appellant
testified in-chief that the event did not happen.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Crown counsel's question was not improper.  He did not ask
the appellant to explain why some other witness had lied.
Rather, the Crown asked the appellant to confirm his position
that the May incident had never occurred.  There was evidence,
independent of the complainant, suggesting that the event had in
fact occurred.  Crown counsel wanted to pin down the appellant on
his position in the hope that the jury would accept the
independent evidence and find that the May incident did occur.
If they made that finding, they would have to conclude that the
appellant had lied to them on that issue.  A finding that the
appellant lied on that point could undermine his overall
credibility.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The fourth submission made by the appellant raises the only
troubling aspect of the cross-examination.  This part of the
cross-examination begins with the following questions and
answers:
[1]
          Q.   Thank you.  I want to ask you a bit
          about what information was given to you, and
          I concede any accused person gets this
          information, but you see this big red book in
          my hand?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yes.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   That is the Crown brief of this case.
          You got that didn't you, or your lawyer got
          it?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yes.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   You got to see before you testified
          every witness' statement, isn't that right?</pre>
    <pre>          A.   That's right.</pre>
    <pre>          Q.   You got to hear every witness that was
          called before this jury.  Let's be correct.
          Ms. Kaforowski from CFS wasn't called at the
          preliminary inquiry and Dr. Thompson wasn't
          called at the preliminary inquiry and Michael
          Eleftherio wasn't called at the preliminary
          inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>[16] After an objection by defence counsel, the trial judge told
Crown counsel to put a specific question and reminded the jury
that the appellant, like any accused, received disclosure before
testifying.  Crown counsel then proceeded with a series of
questions intended to show that the appellant had a chance to
review the various exhibits and transcripts of the testimony of
various witnesses at the preliminary inquiry before testifying.
This precipitated a further objection from defence counsel.</pre>
    <pre>[17] In the presence of the jury, the trial judge said:</pre>
    <pre>          There is no need to get into that in the
          presence of the jury.  The Crown has a very
          clear obligation under a case called
          Stinchcombe to make full disclosure to an
          accused, and the book Mr. Nadel [Crown
          counsel] was holding up is a book that was
          prepared by the police and the Crown as a
          form of disclosure to defence counsel.  And
          that happens in every trial in Ontario that
          is criminal since we had the case of
          Stinchcombe.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Crown counsel then shifted his cross-examination and
suggested to the appellant that &quot;today before this jury is the
very first time that you have been subject to this cross-
examination.&quot;  The appellant agreed with the suggestion and it
appeared that Crown counsel was about to move to another area
when defence counsel objected.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Again, in the presence of the jury, the trial judge said:</pre>
    <pre>          The only thing the jury should garner from
          that is this is the first time he has given
          evidence and the Crown has had an opportunity
          to cross-examine him.  Nothing else, no other
          inference, should be drawn at all. ...  And
          nothing else should be drawn, members of the
          jury, because the accused does have the right
          to remain silent in any criminal trial.  When
          the accused elects to give evidence the Crown
          has the right to cross-examine.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The line of questioning set out above seems calculated to
suggest to the jury that the appellant's evidence was somehow
suspect because he had received full disclosure and had not been
subject to cross-examination prior to choosing to testify at
trial.  Not only are the suggestions improper, they are
potentially prejudicial.  As a matter of common sense, there may
be considerable force to the suggestion that a person who gets
full advance notice of the other side's evidence and testifies
last is in a position to tailor his or her evidence to fit the
disclosure.1  That inference, no matter how logical, cannot be
drawn without turning fundamental constitutional rights into a
trap for accused persons.  Where any such suggestion seeps into
the cross-examination of an accused, it must be eradicated by the
trial judge.
[1]
[21] The trial judge gave two immediate and direct admonitions to
the jury which undercut the improper suggestions implicit in the
questions put by Crown counsel.  Those instructions were
sufficient to dispel the harm done by the questions.</pre>
    <pre>[22] I do not intend to suggest that every line of cross-
examination involving reference to disclosure is improper.
Sometimes, it will be necessary for the Crown to establish that
an accused received disclosure as a step in a legitimate line of
cross-examination.  For example, the appellant had referred to
telephone records of calls between himself and the complainant in
the course of his examination-in-chief.  He had used those phone
calls to assist him in placing the times and dates of certain
meetings with the complainant.  In cross-examination, Crown
counsel brought out the fact that the appellant had full access
to those records before he testified.  This was proper cross-
examination intended to show that the appellant was aware of the
contents of the phone records before giving his evidence and that
any suggestion that the records confirmed his testimony should be
considered in that light.</pre>
    <pre>[23] While questions concerning disclosure are appropriate in
some situations, they are always potentially dangerous.  I think
the prudent course whenever Crown counsel wish to cross-examine
on matters relating to disclosure is to vet the proposed line of
questioning with the trial judge in the absence of the jury.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The last objection raised by the appellant arises out of
Crown counsel's remarks at the end of his cross-examination.  In
the absence of the jury, Crown counsel asked for a ruling on the
admissibility of a videotape showing the appellant's conduct at a
pool party on the day of the alleged attack.  The trial judge had
previously ruled that the videotape was inadmissible, but had
indicated that the Crown could renew his argument in the course
of the appellant's cross-examination.   After hearing further
argument, the trial judge held that the videotape was
inadmissible.  The jury returned and Crown counsel said:</pre>
    <pre>          In light of our previous discussion prior to
          the jury entering that is all I have for this
          witness.</pre>
    <pre>[25] Counsel for the appellant submits that Crown counsel
intended to create the impression that he had damning evidence
which he could use in cross-examination of the appellant but for
the trial judge's ruling.  This submission reads too much into
Crown counsel's comments.  Crown counsel had alerted the trial
judge on at least two occasions during the cross-examination of
the accused that there may be an issue on which a ruling would be
required.  When the jury was excluded, they would have understood
that the time had come for the evidentiary ruling to which Crown
counsel had referred in their presence on at least two earlier
occasions.  The jury was aware, based on the trial judge's
opening instructions to them, that they would be excluded from
time to time for evidenitary rulings and they knew that they
should not speculate as to what went on in their absence.  They
were assured by the trial judge that they would hear only
admissible evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[26] I cannot assume that the jury ignored this instruction and
went on to speculate as to what had gone on in their absence.
The appellant's speculation that the jury thought &quot;damning&quot;
evidence was kept from them is no more valid than speculation
that the jury merely thought they were being spared further
prolongation of what was already a very long and, at times,
tedious cross-examination.</pre>
    <pre>The Production of the Third Party Records</pre>
    <pre>[27] The appellant brought many pre-trial motions.  In one
(referred to as application #3 in the trial record) the appellant
sought disclosure of records in the possession of the Alcohol and
Drug Assessment Services (the Service).  Those records related to
counselling the complainant received between November 1993 and
August 1994.  The alleged assault occurred in July 1994.  The
trial judge ordered some of the Service's records produced to the
appellant.  The appellant received a copy of the clinical summary
of discharge prepared by a  social worker and case summary notes
of meetings or conversations between the social worker and the
complainant.  Many of the contacts between the social worker and
the complainant were over the telephone.</pre>
    <pre>[28] In the discharge summary, the social worker wrote that the
complainant had been referred to the Service because of abuse of
prescription narcotics.  The social worker also  indicated that
the complainant had a long history of abdominal problems and had
undergone several operations due to stomach abscesses &quot;some of
which she caused.&quot;  The social worker wrote &quot;diagnosed with
Munchausen Syndrome.&quot;  Under the heading &quot;Comments/Possible
Future Action&quot;, the social worker wrote:</pre>
    <pre>          Possible borderline personality.  Issues.
          Presents in constant crisis.</pre>
    <pre>[29] None of the material disclosed to the appellant revealed
whether in fact any diagnosis of Munchausen Syndrome had ever
been made by a competent person.  The social worker was not
qualified to make that diagnosis.  Further, there was no
indication that if such a diagnosis had been made, who made it,
when it was made, or the basis upon which it was made.</pre>
    <pre>[30] The case summary notes dealt mainly with the complainant's
emotional problems, her abuse of prescription drugs, her marital
problems and, to some extent, her relationship with the
appellant.  The notes referred to her allegation that she had
been raped by the appellant.  It is clear that the social worker
was concerned primarily with efforts to provide the complainant
with appropriate psychiatric and counselling services.  One of
the summary notes contains a reference wherein the complainant
apparently acknowledged that she had &quot;inflicted physical pain on
myself.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>[31] In addition to the records from the Service, the appellant
had been provided with medical records relating to the
complainant's hospitalization when she first complained of having
been sexually assaulted by the appellant, records of three later
hospital visits and records from the complainant's family
physician.  Counsel for the appellant had also had certain
psychiatric records available to him at the preliminary inquiry
and had cross-examined the complainant at some length.</pre>
    <pre>[32] Armed with all of this information, the appellant brought a
further motion seeking a production of psychiatric, medical and
hospital records pertaining to the complainant and covering a
period from 1979 to the date of trial (April 1997).  In support
of this application, the appellant filed affidavits which made
the following points:

&#130;    the social worker had referred to a diagnosis of
     Munchausen Syndrome;
&#130;    the records from the Service referred to an admission by the
     complainant that she had inflicted pain on herself;  and
&#130;    expert evidence indicating that Munchausen Syndrome was a
     recognized psychiatric disorder, the symptoms of which were
     fabrication, self-infliction, exaggeration or exacerbation of
     medical ailments or conditions, dramatization of medical history,
     vagueness and inconsistencies with respect to specific ailments, 
     uncontrollable pathological lying with respect to history and 
     symptoms, complaints of pain and request for analgesics.</pre>
    <pre>[33] The appellant argued that the records could confirm that the
complainant suffered from Munchausen Syndrome thereby undermining
her credibility, particularly as it related to her evidence
concerning the cause and nature of any injuries or physical
problems which she claimed were the result of the assault
committed against her by the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[34] When this motion was brought, disclosure of third party
records, like those sought by the appellant, was controlled by
the process set down in R. v. O'Connor (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.).  Under the two-step procedure developed in that case,
the accused had to first satisfy the judge that information in
the records was &quot;likely to be relevant&quot; to an issue in the trial.
If the accused met that onus, the judge was to examine the
records and determine what, if any, part of the records should be
produced to the accused.  If the defence failed to show likely
relevance either by submissions or by evidence, the judge could
not examine the documents and the application would fail.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The trial judge followed the procedure set down in O'Connor.
He began by acknowledging that given the behaviour associated
with those who suffer from Munchausen Syndrome and the issues
raised at trial, that the diagnosis of the complainant as
suffering from that Syndrome could be relevant to her credibility
and reliability.  He had earlier set out the sum total of the
evidence suggesting the complainant suffered from Munchausen
Syndrome:</pre>
    <pre>          The clinical summary and discharge notes
          diagnosed Munchausen Syndrome.2  There is no
          indication of source or foundation for this
          notation and it may well be speculative on
          the part of the case worker.  The case worker
          who prepared the notes is no longer with the
          service and is permanently in New Zealand and
          not available to testify.  There are no
          doctors on staff at the service and case
          workers are not permitted to make medical or
          psychiatric diagnoses in respect to their
          clients.</pre>
    <pre>[36] The trial judge then went on to hold that as Munchausen
Syndrome was a psychiatric condition, and the complainant had
been under psychiatric care from 1990 through April 1995, the
records pertaining to her psychiatric treatment were &quot;likely
relevant.&quot;  He directed that those be produced for his
examination.  He held that the appellant had not shown that any
of the other records met the &quot;likely relevance&quot; standard.</pre>
    <pre>[37] After examining the psychiatric records, the trial judge
ordered that the appellant receive copies of a summary of the
records of the appellant's psychiatric care between January 1990
and April 1995 and copies of some parts of those records.3  The
appellant made no further production application after reviewing
the psychiatric summaries which were produced to him pursuant to
the judge's order.</pre>
    <pre>[38] As I understand the appellant's submission, he argues that
as there is some indication that the appellant suffered from
Munchausen Syndrome, and as that disorder could be relevant to
her credibility, any and all records which might show that the
diagnosis was made, or which might offer some basis for making
that diagnosis as of the trial, should have been deemed to be
&quot;likely relevant&quot; and subject to inspection by the trial judge.

[39] The &quot;likely relevance&quot; standard is not a high one.  Accused
who have not seen the records are at an obvious disadvantage in
attempting to establish their relevance:  R. v. O'Connor, supra,
at pp. 20-21.  &quot;Likely relevance&quot; does, however, require more
than a showing of a mere possibility that there may be something
in the records which could be relevant to an issue in the trial.
As Lamer C.J.C. and Sopinka J. said in O'Connor at p. 19:</pre>
    <pre>          ... the presiding judge must be satisfied
          there is a reasonable possibility that the
          information is logically probative to an
          issue at trial or the competence of the
          witness to testify.  When we speak of
          relevance to &quot;an issue at trial&quot; we are
          referring not only to evidence that may be
          probative to the material issues in the case
          (i.e., the unfolding of events) but also to
          evidence relating to the credibility of
          witnesses and to the reliability of other
          evidence in the case ...  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[40] The majority in O'Connor adopted the &quot;likely relevance&quot; test
from the reasons (dissenting on other issues) of L'Heureux-Dubé
J.  In her discussion of that standard, she said at p. 64:</pre>
    <pre>          Similarly, the mere fact that a witness has a
          medical or psychiatric record cannot be taken
          as indicative of the potential unreliability
          of his or her testimony.  Any suggestion that
          a particular treatment, therapy, illness, or
          disability implies unreliability must be
          informed by cogent evidence rather than
          stereotype, myth or prejudice. ...  [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[41] In the present case, we are one step removed from the
relevance problem identified by L'Heureux-Dubé J.  She was
referring, among other things, to applications based on the fact
that a complainant has a particular illness or psychiatric
problem.  L'Heureux-Dubé J. cautioned against assuming the
relevance of medical or psychiatric records simply because the
complainant had a particular medical or psychiatric problem.
Here, there is precious little to indicate that this complainant
had any psychiatric problem which could have any relevance to an
issue in the trial.  The evidence suggesting that the complainant
suffered from Munchausen Syndrome was so thin as to be almost non-
existent.  There is certainly no evidence that she ever received
treatment for the Syndrome.  The single, unsourced and
unexplained reference in a social worker's notes to that
diagnosis is a slender reed upon which to build a case for
disclosure, even to a judge, of some 17 years of medical and
psychiatric records.</pre>
    <pre>[42] The trial judge was obviously sensitive to the appellant's
right to make full answer and defence.  I think he stretched the
concept of &quot;likely relevance&quot; as far as it would go in deciding
to examine 5 years of the complainant's psychiatric records based
solely on the reference in the social worker's notes.  If there
was any substance behind that reference, I can accept that there
was &quot;a reasonable possibility&quot; that the substance could be found
in those psychiatric records.  I see no error in holding that the
reasonable possibility did not extend to the rest of the medical
records.  It must also be appreciated that the trial judge's
ruling was not immutable.  Had anything come out of the
psychiatric records he ordered produced, no doubt counsel for the
appellant could have brought a further application to have the
trial judge examine the other records.</pre>
    <pre>[43] There is also no merit to the submission that the trial
judge should have looked at all of the records to see if they
could afford some basis for the advancing of an opinion at trial
that the complainant suffered from Munchausen Syndrome even if
that diagnosis had not been previously made.  The trial judge
could not possibly make the kind of expert assessment which would
be needed to determine whether the medical records could support
a diagnosis of Munchausen Syndrome.  Furthermore, although the
defence had received considerable disclosure prior to bringing
this application, there was no attempt made to put expert
evidence before the trial judge suggesting what indications there
were in the disclosed records, apart from the social worker's
notes, which could possibly support a diagnosis of Munchausen
Syndrome.</pre>
    <pre>[44] This submission really comes down to the contention that a
trial judge should, on request, examine a complainant's medical
and psychiatric records to see if they could possibly afford a
basis for an expert opinion at trial that the complainant
suffered from some physical or psychiatric problem which could be
relevant to her credibility or reliability.  This is exactly the
kind of invasive &quot;fishing expedition&quot; which O'Connor declares to
be improper and seeks to prevent.</pre>
    <pre>[45] I find no error in law in the trial judge's ruling with
respect to the production of the third party records.  To the
contrary, it reflects a sensitive appreciation of the accused's
right to make full answer and defence and a firm understanding of
O'Connor.4</pre>
    <pre>The admissibility of the evidence concerning anal intercourse
with persons other than the appellant and the trial judge's
failure to give a limiting instruction.</pre>
    <pre>[46] It was the Crown's contention that the appellant raped and
sodomized the complainant.  The Crown led evidence that in 8
years of marriage the complainant and her former husband had
never had anal intercourse.  The Crown also led evidence that the
complainant and her boyfriend, of some 3 months at the time of
the alleged assault, had never engaged in anal intercourse.  All
of this evidence went in without objection and appellant's
counsel cross-examined both the complainant and the boyfriend on
this issue. When the appellant testified, he denied that he and
the complainant had engaged in anal intercourse on the night of
the alleged assault.  He did, however, testify that they had
engaged in consensual anal intercourse on prior occasions.  He
was cross-examined on this part of his testimony.  While the
trial judge reviewed some of this evidence in his summary of the
evidence, he did not refer to any of this evidence in the context
of the case for the Crown or the case for the appellant.  He also
gave no limiting instruction.</pre>
    <pre>[47] The Crown sought to prove that the appellant had forced the
complainant to engage in anal intercourse.  In support of that
position, the Crown led evidence to show that the complainant had
not engaged in anal intercourse with either her husband or her
boyfriend.  The Crown did not lead evidence that the complainant
had an aversion to anal intercourse, but obviously sought to rely
on the inference that if she had not engaged in consensual anal
intercourse with other partners she would not have willingly
engaged in such conduct with the appellant.  That inference is at
best a weak one, but I cannot say that the evidence had no
probative value:  R. v. Richer (1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 405
(Alta. C.A.), aff., [1994] 2 S.C.R. 486.  It may well have been
that, had counsel sought to exclude the evidence as having
minimal probative value, the trial judge would have acceded to
that submission.  Counsel did not do so, but instead chose to
cross-examine on that issue in an attempt to undermine the
complainant's credibility.  I see no error in the admission of
the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[48] In so far as the instruction to the jury is concerned, the
trial judge obviously considered this evidence to be of little
significance and treated it accordingly in his instruction.  I
think this approach was sensible and I can find no fault with the
failure to instruct the jury that the evidence of the nature of
the complainant's consensual sexual activity with her former
husband and boyfriend was of little assistance in determining the
nature of her consensual sexual activity with the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[49] I would dismiss the appeal.

     *    The trial judge made a non-publication order in respect
of the complainant's identity.  That order remains in force.</pre>
    <pre>1    In Juryman's Tale, Bloomsbury Publishing (1998), Trevor
Grove, a journalist, writes of his experience as a juror in a
lengthy kidnapping case in London.  In referring to the Crown's
closing address, Mr. Grove says, at p. 159:</pre>
    <pre>     The next morning, Day 58, Miss Korner [Crown counsel]
     resumed vigorously, suggesting that the whole defence
     case had been concocted after seeing the evidence
     disclosed by the Crown.  This seemed to me a very
     telling point.  Apart from the mentions of discussions
     in Belmarsh Prison, this was not a notion that had
     occurred to the jury, since the rules on prosecution
     disclosure had never been explained to us.  It suddenly
     became pretty plain, in retrospect, that Korkolis &amp; Co
     [the accused] had had a chance to match their defence
     with great cunning to what they knew would be the main
     thrust of the Crown's argument.
     </pre>
    <pre>2    I could find only one reference in the records of the
Service to Munchausen Syndrome.</pre>
    <pre>3    The trial judge ordered that the material produced to
the appellant should be subject to a publication ban and that the
records should be kept under seal and subject to strict
confidentiality.  That order remains in effect.</pre>
    <pre>4    Apart entirely from the principles governing the
admissibility of third party records, it is difficult, with the
benefit of the entire trial record, to understand how the
complainant's conduct could be viewed as consistent with a person
suffering from Munchausen Syndrome.  In her testimony, the
complainant made reference to only two physical symptoms
following the assault, rectal bleeding and bruising on her arms.
The rectal bleeding was associated with haemorrhoids.
Haemorrhoids created a suspicion of anal trauma of unknown
origin.  There was some suggestion that the bruising of the arms
could have been caused by the complainant herself.  The evidence
was clear, however, that the appellant did not exaggerate or
complain of this bruising in the days following the alleged
assault.  To the contrary, the evidence was that she tried to
hide the bruising by wearing long sleeved blouses and shirts.</pre></td>
