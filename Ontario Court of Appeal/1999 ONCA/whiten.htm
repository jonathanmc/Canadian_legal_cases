    <pre>LASKIN J.A. (Dissenting in Part):</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Pilot Insurance Company appeals a punitive damages award of</pre>
    <pre>$1,000,000, the largest award in Canada against an insurer for</pre>
    <pre>dealing in bad faith with a claim by one of its insureds.

</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Daphne Whiten owned a home on Old Donald Road in Haliburton</pre>
    <pre>County, where she lived with her husband, Keith Whiten. The home</pre>
    <pre>and its contents were insured under a homeowner's policy issued</pre>
    <pre>by Pilot.  In the early morning hours of January 18, 1994, a fire</pre>
    <pre>destroyed the Whitens' home and all of their belongings.  Daphne</pre>
    <pre>Whiten claimed for the fire loss under her insurance policy, but</pre>
    <pre>Pilot refused to pay.  Pilot alleged arson, even though it had</pre>
    <pre>opinions from its adjuster, its expert engineer, an investigative</pre>
    <pre>agency retained by it and the fire chief that the fire was</pre>
    <pre>accidental.  Pilot maintained its defence of arson throughout a</pre>
    <pre>four week trial before Matlow J. and a jury, although it now</pre>
    <pre>concedes that the  evidence unequivocally shows the fire was</pre>
    <pre>accidental.

</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The jury assessed damages at $1,287,300 B $287,300 for the</pre>
    <pre>fire loss and $1,000,000 for punitive damages.  The trial judge</pre>
    <pre>ordered Pilot to pay the costs of the action on a solicitor and</pre>
    <pre>his own client scale.  Pilot restricts its appeal to whether</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages should have been awarded and, if so, the  amount</pre>
    <pre>of the award.  It submits that punitive damages should not have</pre>
    <pre>been awarded either because it did not commit &quot;an independent</pre>
    <pre>actionable wrong&quot;, or because its conduct was not reprehensible</pre>
    <pre>enough to justify an award.  Alternatively Pilot submits that the</pre>
    <pre>jury's assessment was excessive and was influenced by errors in</pre>
    <pre>the trial judge's charge.  Pilot asks this court to set aside the</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages award or reduce it to an amount within the range</pre>
    <pre>of  $15,000 - $25,000.

</pre>
    <pre>[4]  I would not give effect to Pilot's submissions.  In my</pre>
    <pre>opinion, Pilot's breach of its obligation of good faith was an</pre>
    <pre>independent actionable wrong for which punitive damages could be</pre>
    <pre>awarded. Pilot's conduct was so reprehensible that a punitive</pre>
    <pre>award was justified; and the amount of the award is supportable</pre>
    <pre>in the light of the deference to be accorded to the jury's</pre>
    <pre>assessment, the extent of Pilot's reprehensible conduct, the need</pre>
    <pre>to deter this kind of conduct and the need to impose a fine that</pre>
    <pre>is more than a licence fee.  Therefore, I would dismiss the</pre>
    <pre>appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>Overview of the Facts</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The Whitens bought their home in 1985.  It had two storeys,</pre>
    <pre>an unfinished concrete basement and a one storey rear addition.</pre>
    <pre>Daphne and Keith Whiten discovered the fire in the rear addition</pre>
    <pre>as they were getting ready for bed after midnight on January 18,</pre>
    <pre>1994.  They fled their home wearing only their night clothes into</pre>
    <pre>a night temperature of   -18o C.  Their three pet dogs escaped</pre>
    <pre>but their three cats died in the fire.  Keith Whiten suffered a</pre>
    <pre>serious case of frost bite for which he was treated at the local</pre>
    <pre>hospital.  He was confined to a wheelchair for two weeks.  The</pre>
    <pre>fire totally destroyed the Whitens' house and contents, including</pre>
    <pre>a number of valuable antiques and many items of sentimental</pre>
    <pre>value.

</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The origin of the fire was never determined.  But everyone</pre>
    <pre>who investigated the fire in the six months after it occurred</pre>
    <pre>concluded that it was accidental.  The first to investigate were</pre>
    <pre>the fire chief and the firefighter called to the scene; both</pre>
    <pre>considered the fire accidental.  Because they did not suspect</pre>
    <pre>arson, they did not ask the Fire Marshal's office to investigate.

</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Pilot then retained Derek Francis, an experienced</pre>
    <pre>independent insurance adjuster, to investigate the loss.  Francis</pre>
    <pre>inspected the site of the fire, interviewed the Whitens, who told</pre>
    <pre>him they had been unemployed and had financial difficulties, and</pre>
    <pre>also spoke to the firefighter about the speed of the fire, an</pre>
    <pre>important factor in determining whether the fire was deliberately</pre>
    <pre>set.  The physical evidence and the Whitens' conduct satisfied</pre>
    <pre>Francis that the fire was accidental.  He reported to Pilot on</pre>
    <pre>February 3, 1994: &quot;[a]ll of the factors served to confirm that</pre>
    <pre>this is an accidental fire and there is no suspicion of arson on</pre>
    <pre>behalf of the insureds or any members of their family.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Francis continued to investigate.  He verified that although</pre>
    <pre>the mortgage on the Whitens' home was in arrears, refinancing had</pre>
    <pre>been arranged.  He reported to Pilot again on February 25, 1994,</pre>
    <pre>recommending that the claim be paid.  In his reporting letter he</pre>
    <pre>said: &quot;... with the physical evidence we have and the fact that the</pre>
    <pre>insured was attempting to arrange financing through another</pre>
    <pre>source and pay off the existing mortgage, there is little or no</pre>
    <pre>base to deny this claim.&quot;

</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Francis also reviewed Daphne Whitens' contents claim, which</pre>
    <pre>exceeded the policy limit of $117,000.  He concluded: &quot;I have no</pre>
    <pre>reason to doubt the legitimacy of the content claim Y and Y the</pre>
    <pre>contents claim is not unreasonable.&quot;  He recommended issuing a</pre>
    <pre>cheque to Daphne Whiten for the policy limit.  Pilot, however,</pre>
    <pre>refused to accept Francis' recommendations.  Instead, it decided</pre>
    <pre>to deny the claim.  Pilot also refused to tell Francis why it</pre>
    <pre>would not pay the Whitens' claim.  In turn, Francis kept the</pre>
    <pre>Whitens in the dark and became evasive in response to their</pre>
    <pre>questions.

</pre>
    <pre>[10] After the fire, the Whitens moved into a nearby rented</pre>
    <pre>cottage.  At first Pilot paid the rent.  But in March 1994, Pilot</pre>
    <pre>instructed Francis to tell the landlord it was stopping rent</pre>
    <pre>payments.  Francis did so but never told the Whitens. Worse,</pre>
    <pre>Pilot took this step knowing that the Whitens were in desperate</pre>
    <pre>financial circumstances.  Their only assets had been destroyed by</pre>
    <pre>fire, neither was working at the time and Keith Whiten had</pre>
    <pre>declared bankruptcy the previous November.

</pre>
    <pre>[11] Francis was also instructed by Pilot to make further</pre>
    <pre>inquiries about the fire.  He did so and in a letter to Pilot's</pre>
    <pre>counsel on April 28, 1994, he confirmed that he still did not</pre>
    <pre>suspect arson.  He reported:

</pre>
    <pre>                     YWhen  we  attended at  the  scene
          without  any  knowledge of  the  Whitens,  we
          found Mr. and Mrs. Whiten sorting through the
          debris  in  old  clothes, trying  to  salvage
          anything  that  might have  been  left  as  a
          result of the fire.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    I observed Mrs. Whiten with a small
          porcelain  figurine in her hands, wiping  the
          same  off  with  her fingers  in  an  obvious
          attempt  to  salvage  this  item.   Had   the
          Whitens  known I was going to attend  at  the
          scene,  I  would have expected this  type  of
          display  of  sentiment, however  not  knowing
          that  I was going to be at the scene, I  felt
          this  genuine  concern to try  and  see  what
          could  be  salvaged now that the weather  has
          afforded  this opportunity out  of  character
          for  someone  who  might  be  involved  in  a
          suspicious fire.
          

</pre>
    <pre>     After receiving this report Pilot removed Francis from the</pre>
    <pre>case and hired another adjuster.  No one from Pilot testified at</pre>
    <pre>trial about why Francis was told to stop his investigation.

</pre>
    <pre>[12] Because of the Whitens' precarious financial situation and</pre>
    <pre>because he suspected arson, Pilot's claims manager asked the</pre>
    <pre>Insurance Crime Prevention Bureau, a body set up by the insurance</pre>
    <pre>industry, to investigate the fire.  The Bureau reported on</pre>
    <pre>February 25, 1994: &quot;we wouldn't have a leg to stand on as far as</pre>
    <pre>declining the claim.&quot; Having asked for the Bureau's opinion, the</pre>
    <pre>claims manager then said he gave it no credence and refused to</pre>
    <pre>consider it in dealing with the Whitens' claim.  No one from</pre>
    <pre>Pilot testified why the claims manager took this position.

</pre>
    <pre>[13] Shortly after the fire occurred, Pilot retained an</pre>
    <pre>engineering expert, Hugh Carter of Retrach Engineering, to</pre>
    <pre>investigate the loss.  In his report to Pilot on January 28,</pre>
    <pre>1994, Carter concluded that the fire was accidental: &quot;the</pre>
    <pre>circumstances of the fire would strongly refute considerations of</pre>
    <pre>an incendiary fire.&quot; Carter delivered two further reports, giving</pre>
    <pre>the same opinion.  He then received a letter from Pilot's counsel</pre>
    <pre>that led him to believe that his opinion had been misunderstood.</pre>
    <pre>He asked for a meeting to explain his opinion but Pilot refused</pre>
    <pre>to meet with its own expert.

</pre>
    <pre>[14] Hugh Carter did meet with Pilot's counsel Donald Crabbe in</pre>
    <pre>early June.  He then reclassified the fire as &quot;suspicious,</pre>
    <pre>possibly incendiary&quot;.  Pilot concedes that Crabbe likely</pre>
    <pre>influenced Carter to give this opinion.

</pre>
    <pre>[15] After the meeting, Crabbe wrote a rather astonishing letter</pre>
    <pre>to Pilot.  In the letter he suggested that a report supporting a</pre>
    <pre>denial of the claim was a move &quot;in the right direction&quot; and that</pre>
    <pre>an engineer could &quot;freely speculate&quot; the fire was not accidental.</pre>
    <pre>He said that he considered it appropriate to deny the claim six</pre>
    <pre>months after the fire occurred because there was little chance</pre>
    <pre>the Whitens would refuse an offer from Pilot.  He expressed the</pre>
    <pre>view that the punitive damages claim based on bad faith was a</pre>
    <pre>&quot;cloud with a silver lining&quot; because it would make evidence of</pre>
    <pre>two previous fires admissible. One of these fires occurred in a</pre>
    <pre>cottage owned by the Whitens' son-in-law, but was rented out at</pre>
    <pre>the time to a Mrs. Titro; the other occurred in another house</pre>
    <pre>previously occupied by Mrs. Titro.  Crabbe thought that the force</pre>
    <pre>of this evidence of previous fires would be strengthened because</pre>
    <pre>the Whitens would not likely have disclosed anything about them</pre>
    <pre>to their counsel.  He wrote that faced with this evidence counsel</pre>
    <pre>for the Whitens would consider it risky to go to trial and would</pre>
    <pre>likely recommend their clients significantly compromise their</pre>
    <pre>claim.  Pilot now concedes that evidence about these two previous</pre>
    <pre>fires was utterly irrelevant and inadmissible.

</pre>
    <pre>[16] Between July, 1994 and May, 1995, Pilot hired a forensic</pre>
    <pre>engineer, a fire investigator and a firefighter.  Francis'</pre>
    <pre>reports were not disclosed to any of them.  Instead Pilot's</pre>
    <pre>counsel provided these experts with information about the speed</pre>
    <pre>of the fire that was misleading if not inaccurate. Nonetheless,</pre>
    <pre>the firefighter, Deputy Chief Thomas, gave an opinion that the</pre>
    <pre>fire was accidental.  The other two experts, the forensic</pre>
    <pre>engineer and the fire investigator, gave opinions that lent some</pre>
    <pre>support to an arson defence, but again Pilot concedes that these</pre>
    <pre>opinions were influenced by Crabbe.  Indeed, in instructing the</pre>
    <pre>jury on how to weigh the expert evidence, the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>commented unfavourably on Crabbe's role.

</pre>
    <pre>                      Apart   from  this,   with   some
          reluctance,  I  feel that I must  comment  on
          what   I   choose  to  characterize  as   the
          unfortunate role that Mr. Crabbe  assumed  in
          directing  and coordinating  the  development
          of the defence expert evidence to support the
          allegation of arson.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     While I would not attribute to Mr.
          Crabbe  any dishonest attempt to deliberately
          influence the evidence of the experts  called
          by  him, I respectfully express the view that
          his  enthusiasm for his client's case appears
          to  have caused him to exceed the permissible
          limits which ought to confine a lawyer in the
          preparation of witnesses. It may be that  Mr.
          Crabbe unwittingly assumed too active a  role
          in  Pilot's  continuing investigation of this
          fire  and, in the process, did more than just
          prepare himself and his witnesses for  trial.
          Although  a lawyer may properly raise  issues
          with  witnesses and point out  conflicts  and
          weaknesses  in  the  evidence,  he  must   be
          careful  not  to exercise undue influence  on
          witnesses so as to cause them, consciously or
          unconsciously,  to modify their  evidence  to
          suit  the  needs  of the party  who  retained
          them.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In this case, there is evidence by
          Mr.  Crabbe's own letters, that he, at  least
          implicitly,  put  to  some  of   his   expert
          witnesses what evidence to give and  that  he
          purported  &quot;to  lead  them  into  battle&quot;  to
          secure  victory on behalf of  Pilot.   In  my
          view,  it  was improper for him  to  approach
          witnesses   in   this   suggestive    manner,
          especially expert witnesses whose livelihoods
          are  earned  by providing service exclusively
          to insurers such as Pilot.  If you agree with
          my view on this factual issue, and it is your
          right to choose to agree or disagree with me,
          it  is  for you to decide the extent to which
          you  should reduce the weight that you  would
          otherwise give to the evidence of some or all
          of  these  defence B to some or all of  these
          defence experts.
          </pre>
    <pre>[17] Pilot now concedes that the trial judge's comments were</pre>
    <pre>justified.  Of course, Pilot must accept responsibility for its</pre>
    <pre>counsel's conduct. Yet no one from Pilot testified whether it</pre>
    <pre>objected to its counsel's tactics or why it persisted in denying</pre>
    <pre>the Whitens' claim.

</pre>
    <pre>[18] Throughout their long ordeal B nearly two years from the</pre>
    <pre>date of the fire until the trial began B both Keith and Daphne</pre>
    <pre>Whiten co-operated fully with Pilot's investigation.  They</pre>
    <pre>voluntarily submitted to a lengthy taped interview on the day of</pre>
    <pre>the fire.  Later, Keith Whiten gave another long statement at</pre>
    <pre>Pilot's request.  The representatives of Pilot who met with the</pre>
    <pre>Whitens said that they co-operated and assisted in the</pre>
    <pre>investigation.  In the spring of 1995, in an attempt to satisfy</pre>
    <pre>Pilot that they did not set the fire, both Keith Whiten and</pre>
    <pre>Daphne Whiten offered to take a polygraph test administered by an</pre>
    <pre>expert chosen by Pilot.  They attached no conditions to their</pre>
    <pre>offer. Pilot refused the Whitens' offer but gave no reason for</pre>
    <pre>its refusal.  Instead, it continued to allege that the Whitens</pre>
    <pre>had set the fire deliberately.  The Whitens had to live with this</pre>
    <pre>allegation.  They resided in a small community, which was aware</pre>
    <pre>that their home was not being rebuilt because the insurer was</pre>
    <pre>alleging arson.  Only now does Pilot acknowledge the evidence as</pre>
    <pre>a whole unequivocally demonstrates that the fire was accidental.

</pre>
    <pre>[19] At the close of the plaintiff Daphne Whiten's case, Pilot</pre>
    <pre>moved for a nonsuit to dismiss the bad faith claim for punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages.  The trial judge dismissed the motion.  Pilot called a</pre>
    <pre>defence, but it did not call anyone to testify about the handling</pre>
    <pre>of the Whitens' claim. The jury assessed damages as follows:</pre>
    <pre>       *    Replacement of structure  $160,000
       *    Loss of contents           117,500
       *    Increased living expenses    9,800
       *    Punitive damages          1,000,000</pre>
    <pre>               TOTAL                $1,287,300
       </pre>
    <pre>[20] The jury's assessment was incorporated in a judgment of</pre>
    <pre>Matlow J. dated January 25, 1996, from which Pilot appeals.  In</pre>
    <pre>granting judgment he commented that &quot;the jury's assessment of</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages, although very high and perhaps without</pre>
    <pre>precedent, is not perverse but is entirely reasonable in light of</pre>
    <pre>all of the evidence.&quot; I turn now to the issues on the appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>First Issue:   Was Daphne Whiten Entitled to an Award of Punitive
Damages?</pre>
    <pre>[21] Punitive damages are awarded, not to compensate the</pre>
    <pre>plaintiff, but to punish the defendant and to deter the defendant</pre>
    <pre>and others from acting in an outrageous or reprehensible manner.</pre>
    <pre>Cory J. discussed these general principles in Hill v. Church of</pre>
    <pre>Scientology of Toronto,

</pre>
    <pre>                           Punitive  damages   may   be
          awarded  in  situations where the defendant's
          misconduct  is  so malicious, oppressive  and
          high-handed that it offends the court's sense
          of   decency.   Punitive  damages   bear   no
          relation to what the plaintiff should receive
          by  way of compensation.  Their aim is not to
          compensate  the  plaintiff,  but  rather   to
          punish  the  defendant.  It is the  means  by
          which the jury or judge expresses its outrage
          at  the  egregious conduct of the  defendant.
          They  are  in the nature of a fine  which  is
          meant  to act as a deterrent to the defendant
          and to others from acting in this manner.  It
          is   important  to  emphasize  that  punitive
          damages  should  only  be  awarded  in  those
          circumstances  where the  combined  award  of
          general  and  aggravated  damages  would   be
          insufficient   to   achieve   the   goal   of
          punishment and deterrence.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[22] For an award of punitive damages to be made, two</pre>
    <pre>requirements must be met:  first, the defendant must have</pre>
    <pre>committed an independent or separate actionable wrong causing</pre>
    <pre>damage to the plaintiff ; and second, the defendant's conduct</pre>
    <pre>must be sufficiently &quot;harsh, vindictive, reprehensible and</pre>
    <pre>malicious&quot;1 or &quot;so malicious, oppressive and high- handed that it</pre>
    <pre>offends the court's sense of decency.&quot;2  Pilot submits that</pre>
    <pre>neither requirement has been met in this case.

</pre>
    <pre>[23] The first requirement, that of an independent actionable</pre>
    <pre>wrong, emerges from the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada</pre>
    <pre>in Vorvis v. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia, a</pre>
    <pre>wrongful dismissal case.  In Vorvis, McIntyre J. acknowledged</pre>
    <pre>that punitive damages may be awarded in breach of contract cases</pre>
    <pre>although he cautioned that such awards would be rare.  He wrote:

</pre>
    <pre>                     When then can punitive damages  be
awarded? It   must   never  be  forgotten   that   when
          awarded by a judge or a jury, a punishment is
          imposed  upon  a  person by a  court  by  the
          operation of the judicial process.   What  is
          it  that  is punished?  It surely  cannot  be
          merely    conduct   of   which   the    court
          disapproves, however strongly the  judge  may
          feel.   Punishment may not be  imposed  in  a
          civilized  community without a  justification
          in law.  The only basis for the imposition of
          such  punishment  must be a  finding  of  the
          commission  of  an  actionable  wrong   which
          caused  the  injury  complained  of  by   the
          plaintiff.3
          

</pre>
    <pre>[24] The requirement of an independent actionable wrong was</pre>
    <pre>affirmed in Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.4 and has been</pre>
    <pre>consistently applied by provincial appellate courts since Vorvis.</pre>
    <pre>Pilot submits that it did not commit an independent actionable</pre>
    <pre>wrong because it simply breached its contract of insurance with</pre>
    <pre>Daphne Whiten.  Pilot acknowledges that an implied term of that</pre>
    <pre>contract was to deal with Daphne Whiten's claim in good faith.</pre>
    <pre>But, Pilot argues, even a breach of its covenant to act in good</pre>
    <pre>faith is no more than a breach of its contractual obligation, not</pre>
    <pre>an independent actionable wrong as Vorvis requires.  Pilot</pre>
    <pre>submits that to sustain an award of punitive damages what would</pre>
    <pre>have been required was the commission of a separate tort, such as</pre>
    <pre>defamation or deceit, neither of which was pleaded or made out in</pre>
    <pre>this case.

</pre>
    <pre>[25] I do not agree with this submission.  A contract of</pre>
    <pre>insurance between an insurer and its insured is one of utmost</pre>
    <pre>good faith.5  Although the insurer is not a fiduciary, it holds a</pre>
    <pre>position of power over an insured; conversely, the insured is in</pre>
    <pre>a vulnerable  position, entirely dependent on the insurer when a</pre>
    <pre>loss occurs.  For these reasons, in every insurance contract an</pre>
    <pre>insurer has an implied obligation to deal with the claims of its</pre>
    <pre>insureds in good faith.6  That obligation to act in good faith is</pre>
    <pre>separate from the insurer's obligation to compensate its insured</pre>
    <pre>for a loss covered by the policy.  An action for dealing with an</pre>
    <pre>insurance claim in bad faith is different from an action on the</pre>
    <pre>policy for damages for the insured loss.  In other words, breach</pre>
    <pre>of an insurer's obligation to act in good faith is a separate or</pre>
    <pre>independent wrong from the wrong for which compensation is paid.

</pre>
    <pre>[26] Vorvis requires an independent actionable wrong, not an</pre>
    <pre>independent actionable tort.  Indeed, if Pilot's submission were</pre>
    <pre>correct, punitive damages could never be awarded against an</pre>
    <pre>insurer for bad faith in the handling of an insurance claim.</pre>
    <pre>Such a result would be contrary to all Canadian authority and to</pre>
    <pre>four cases since Vorvis, each of which has recognized that</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages may be awarded against insurers in first party</pre>
    <pre>cases, that is in actions brought by insureds against their own</pre>
    <pre>insurer.7  I find support for my position in the following</pre>
    <pre>passage from the Ontario Law Reform Commission's 1991 Report on</pre>
    <pre>Exemplary Damages,8 which endorses punitive damage awards in</pre>
    <pre>first party insurance cases:

</pre>
    <pre>                     There is at least one type of case
          of  breach of contract where the arguments in
          favour  of  punitive damages are  compelling.
          This is the case where the defendant breaches
          the  contract  deliberately, and  refuses  or
          fails  to  tender compensation  known  to  be
          owing to the plaintiff.  This could be a case
          where,  without justification, the  defendant
          fails  to perform and does not tender damages
          for the breach, or a case where the defendant
          declines   to   honour  a  known  contractual
          obligation  to  pay money.   Of  course,  the
          court  would  have to distinguish  between  a
          true  case of denying contractual obligations
          known to exist, and a bona fide dispute  over
          the existence or extent of liability.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     Y
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The  case for punitive damages  in
          these circumstances is much the same as it is
          in  the tort for profit situation, and may be
          justified  on both retributive and deterrence
          grounds.  The fact that the defendant refuses
          to  honour  a known obligation to  pay  money
          suggests that there exists some imbalance  of
          power  in  the  relationship  that  makes  it
          worthwhile for the defendant to do so.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    This approach also seems to address
          the concerns that support punitive damages in
          the  so-called bad faith insurer cases.   One
          variation  occurs  where insurance  companies
          fail to honour clear first party obligations.
          This  latter  type of case might  escape  the
          confines  imposed in Vorvis.   The  statutory
          obligation  to pay first party  benefits  has
          been relied upon to distinguish this from the
          purely    contractual   claim   Y   Insurance
          contracts  are said to be governed by  duties
          of  utmost  good  faith.  This  supports  the
          substantive  case for punitive  damages.   It
          also  provides an avenue for the  development
          of  a  duty  in  tort, if Vorvis  makes  this
          necessary.   This type of case is  one  where
          the  argument for a deterrence  gross  up  is
          also compelling.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     This raises the possibility  of  a
          more restrictive approach to punitive damages
          for  the failure to honour a known obligation
          to  pay  money.  Punitive  damages  might  be
          limited  to wrongful dismissal and  insurance
          cases,  the  types of cases that  have  given
          rise  to punitive damages in Canada to  date.
          Such  cases  typically involve the  abuse  of
          contractual  power, which might  not  be  the
          case in all other circumstance captured by  a
          more general rule.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[27] If Vorvis  makes it necessary, like the Commission, I would</pre>
    <pre>be prepared to hold that an insured has a duty in tort of good</pre>
    <pre>faith towards its insureds. A duty in tort has been propounded by</pre>
    <pre>some Australian and American courts9 and was hinted at by</pre>
    <pre>Mason J. of the Alberta Court of Queen's Bench in Adams v.</pre>
    <pre>Confederation Co.10 The Australian decisions focus on the</pre>
    <pre>insurer's superior bargaining position and on the insured's</pre>
    <pre>dependence and vulnerability.  The nature of the relationship</pre>
    <pre>makes it &quot;just and reasonable&quot; to impose on the insurer a duty of</pre>
    <pre>good faith. The American decisions acknowledge that an insurer</pre>
    <pre>has an implied contractual covenant to deal with its insureds in</pre>
    <pre>good faith, but hold that the insurer also has a duty in tort,</pre>
    <pre>distinct from its implied contractual covenant. These American</pre>
    <pre>cases are consistent with recent Canadian jurisprudence, which</pre>
    <pre>has recognized, in a variety of settings, concurrent liability in</pre>
    <pre>contract and tort.  For example, in  Central Trust Co. v.</pre>
    <pre>Rafuse11, a solicitor's negligence case, Le Dain J. held that a common</pre>
    <pre>law duty of care may be created by a relationship of sufficient</pre>
    <pre>proximity and is not confined to relationships that arise apart</pre>
    <pre>from contract12:

</pre>
    <pre>                     Where the common law duty of  care
          is  co-extensive with that which arises as an
          implied  term  of the contract  it  obviously
          does  not depend on the terms of the contract
          and there is nothing flowing from contractual
          intention which should preclude reliance on a
          concurrent or alternative liability in tort.
          </pre>
    <pre>[28] A strong argument can be made for finding that the</pre>
    <pre>relationship between insurer and insured is of sufficient</pre>
    <pre>proximity to give rise to a concurrent duty in tort alongside the</pre>
    <pre>insurer's implied contractual obligation to act in good faith.</pre>
    <pre>However, I do not think that it is necessary to go this far</pre>
    <pre>because I am satisfied that an insurer's breach of the implied</pre>
    <pre>term of the insurance contract to act in good faith meets the</pre>
    <pre>Vorvis requirement of an independent actionable wrong.

</pre>
    <pre>[29] Pilot also submits that even if acting in bad faith is an</pre>
    <pre>independent actionable wrong, its conduct was not reprehensible</pre>
    <pre>enough or high-handed enough to attract an award of punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages.  This submission has no merit whatsoever.  There was</pre>
    <pre>overwhelming evidence in this case from which the jury could</pre>
    <pre>reasonably conclude that Pilot's handling of the Whitens' claim</pre>
    <pre>was so malicious or vindictive or so reprehensible or high-handed</pre>
    <pre>that an award of punitive damages was warranted.  In summary, the</pre>
    <pre>evidence overwhelmingly shows that Pilot handled the Whitens'</pre>
    <pre>claim unfairly and in bad faith; that it deliberately ignored any</pre>
    <pre>opinion, even of its own adjuster and its own experts, that would</pre>
    <pre>oblige it to comply with its contractual obligation to pay the</pre>
    <pre>claim; and, that it abused its financial position and contrived</pre>
    <pre>an arson defence to avoid payment of the claim or, at least, to</pre>
    <pre>force a significant compromise.  This evidence includes:</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot deliberately ignored the opinion and</pre>
    <pre>          recommendations of Derek Francis, an experienced</pre>
    <pre>          adjuster it retained to investigate the fire loss.</pre>
    <pre>          *    After receiving Francis' strong recommendation to</pre>
    <pre>          pay the claim, Pilot replaced him.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot never provided Francis' reports to the</pre>
    <pre>          experts that it later retained.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot asked the Insurance Crime Prevention Bureau</pre>
    <pre>          to investigate, but when the Bureau concluded that</pre>
    <pre>          Pilot had no defence to the claim, Pilot ignored the</pre>
    <pre>          Bureau's conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot deliberately ignored the opinion of its</pre>
    <pre>          engineering expert Hugh Carter, who gave three reports</pre>
    <pre>          that the fire was accidental; and then Pilot refused to</pre>
    <pre>          meet with Carter when he expressed concern that his</pre>
    <pre>          opinion was being misunderstood.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot admitted that the jury could reasonably</pre>
    <pre>          infer that Carter's later opinion reclassifying the</pre>
    <pre>          fire as &quot;suspicious, possibly incendiary,&quot; was</pre>
    <pre>          influenced by Pilot's counsel.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot pressured its experts to provide opinions</pre>
    <pre>          supporting an arson defence.  Indeed, Pilot</pre>
    <pre>          deliberately withheld relevant information from its</pre>
    <pre>          experts and, instead, provided them with misleading</pre>
    <pre>          information to obtain opinions favourable to its arson</pre>
    <pre>          theory.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot even admitted that the jury could reasonably</pre>
    <pre>          conclude the two later expert opinions supporting an</pre>
    <pre>          arson defence were influenced by Pilot's counsel.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot accepted as justified  the trial judge's</pre>
    <pre>          comment that Pilot's counsel acted improperly in</pre>
    <pre>          suggesting opinions to experts whose livelihood was</pre>
    <pre>          earned by providing services exclusively to the</pre>
    <pre>          insurance industry.</pre>
    <pre>          *    Pilot used the bad faith claim against the Whitens</pre>
    <pre>          to refer to evidence of previous fires B evidence it</pre>
    <pre>          now concedes was irrelevant and inadmissible B in order</pre>
    <pre>          to convince the Whitens' counsel that a trial was</pre>
    <pre>          risky.</pre>
    <pre>          *    At every stage Pilot considered that it could</pre>
    <pre>          safely deny the claim because the Whitens would not</pre>
    <pre>          refuse an offer in the future.  No representative of</pre>
    <pre>          Pilot testified why the claim was denied and therefore</pre>
    <pre>          the jury could reasonably infer that their testimony</pre>
    <pre>          would not have shown that Pilot had a valid reason for</pre>
    <pre>          denying the claim.</pre>
    <pre>          *    When the Whitens had lost everything in the fire</pre>
    <pre>          and when they were unemployed and on welfare, Pilot</pre>
    <pre>          terminated the rent payments on their rented cottage</pre>
    <pre>          and did so without telling them.</pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[30] In the face of this evidence, an award of punitive damages</pre>
    <pre>was fully justified.  I would not give effect to this ground of</pre>
    <pre>appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>Second Issue:  Is the Award of $1,000,000 Excessive?</pre>
    <pre>[31] Pilot submits that even if an award of punitive damages was</pre>
    <pre>justified, an award of $1,000,000 was excessive.  This submission</pre>
    <pre>has two branches: first, the jury likely inflated their</pre>
    <pre>assessment because of errors made by the trial judge in his</pre>
    <pre>charge; and second, apart from these errors in the charge, the</pre>
    <pre>award is much too high.

</pre>
    <pre>               (i)  Alleged Errors in the Charge
          </pre>
    <pre>[32] Pilot submits that the trial judge made three errors in his</pre>
    <pre>charge: he erred by instructing the jury that they could take</pre>
    <pre>into account the Whitens' offer to take a polygraph test as</pre>
    <pre>evidence of their good faith; he erred by failing to instruct the</pre>
    <pre>jury that the letters from Pilot's counsel to Pilot's experts</pre>
    <pre>were not relevant to punitive damages; and, he erred by failing</pre>
    <pre>to give the jury any guidance on how to assess punitive damages.</pre>
    <pre>I am not persuaded that the trial judge made any of the errors</pre>
    <pre>alleged by Pilot.  I will deal briefly with each one.

</pre>
    <pre>[33] The trial judge instructed the jury that they could consider</pre>
    <pre>the Whitens' offer to take a polygraph test as evidence of their</pre>
    <pre>good faith.

</pre>
    <pre>                    You have heard evidence relating to
          the  offer  made by the plaintiff  and  Keith
          Whiten  to Pilot in May 19, 1995, just before
          this  trial was scheduled to begin, to submit
          to  polygraph or lie detector testing  by  an
          examiner  to  be  selected by  Pilot  and  of
          Pilot's  rejection of that offer.   You  have
          also heard evidence that polygraph testing is
          commonly   used   by  insurers   to   resolve
          suspicions in certain  cases, even though the
          results  of  such testing are  not  generally
          admissible in evidence in trials.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In the circumstances of this case,
          the  Whitens' offer may be viewed by  you  as
          evidence  of  good  faith on  their  part  in
          helping  to  resolve the issue of arson  that
          had  been  raised by Pilot, even  though  the
          results of any testing would almost certainly
          not be admitted as evidence in any trial.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[34] Pilot submits that as evidence of a polygraph test is</pre>
    <pre>inadmissible because it is a form of oath helping, the Whitens'</pre>
    <pre>offer to take the test should also be inadmissible and therefore</pre>
    <pre>the trial judge should have instructed the jury to ignore the</pre>
    <pre>offer when they assessed damages.   Moreover, Pilot submits that</pre>
    <pre>the Whitens' good faith cannot assist the jury in determining</pre>
    <pre>Pilot's bad faith.  I do not agree with these submissions.  The</pre>
    <pre>evidence of the Whitens' offer to take a polygraph test was not</pre>
    <pre>tendered to bolster their credibility, but to show their</pre>
    <pre>willingness to co-operate in resolving their claim.  Their good</pre>
    <pre>faith was relevant in assessing Pilot's conduct and thus in</pre>
    <pre>assessing punitive damages because an insurer may be more</pre>
    <pre>justified in rejecting a claim made by an insured who is not</pre>
    <pre>acting in good faith.  The offer to take a polygraph test was but</pre>
    <pre>one part of the total evidence showing the Whitens' co-operation</pre>
    <pre>with Pilot's investigation.  The admissibility of the offer and</pre>
    <pre>the trial judge's instructions on how the jury could use the</pre>
    <pre>offer are consistent with this court's judgment in R. v. B.</pre>
    <pre>(S.C.)13

</pre>
    <pre>[35] The second error in the charge alleged by Pilot concerns its</pre>
    <pre>counsel's letters to its expert witnesses.  Pilot submits that</pre>
    <pre>these letters were relevant only to costs, not to punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages.  Whether or not Pilot's submission is valid, the trial</pre>
    <pre>judge only invited the jury to consider the letters in the</pre>
    <pre>context of the weight to be given to the expert evidence; he did</pre>
    <pre>not instruct them to consider the letters on the issue of</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages.

</pre>
    <pre>[36] Finally, Pilot argues that the trial judge did not give the</pre>
    <pre>jury adequate guidance on how to assess punitive damages.  The</pre>
    <pre>trial judge instructed the jury on the purposes of punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages and when they can be awarded in accordance with Vorvis</pre>
    <pre>and Hill.

</pre>
    <pre>                    And finally, if you determine  that
          Pilot's  defence  of arson  failed  and  that
          Pilot breached the provision of the policy of
          insurance  by denying the plaintiff's  claim,
          you  must then go on to determine whether the
          plaintiff  is entitled, as well,  to  recover
          punitive  damages.  Punitive damages  can  be
          awarded in certain circumstances to serve  as
          a punishment. In this case, depending on your
          finding  of  fact, punitive  damages  can  be
          awarded  to  deter Pilot and  other  insurers
          from  engaging in improper conduct in dealing
          with the claims of their insureds.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     Punitive damages, unlike the other
          types  of  damages claimed in this case,  are
          not  intended to compensate the plaintiff for
          her  loss.   If they are awarded,  they  will
          constitute a windfall for the plaintiff and a
          penalty for Pilot.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     Before  you may properly  make  an
award of punitive     damages,     Pilot's      defence
          of  arson must fail and you must be satisfied
          that  the  plaintiff has  proven  that  Pilot
          failed  to deal with her claim in good  faith
          and  instead dealt with this in a  malicious,
          high-handed, arbitrary or capricious  manner,
          and   that   Pilot's  conduct  warrants   the
          imposition of a penalty.
          

</pre>
    <pre>[37] No valid objection can be taken to this instruction.</pre>
    <pre>However, after the charge, the jury returned with the following</pre>
    <pre>question:

</pre>
    <pre>                     Dear Justice Matlow, we are having
          difficulty   in   agreements  pertaining   to
          assessing   the  amount  of  the  claim   for
          punitive  damages.  Would  you  be  able   to
          provide us some guidelines to help us  arrive
          at a consensus.  Thank you, the jury.
          </pre>
    <pre>     After obtaining the views of both counsel, the trial judge</pre>
    <pre>simply recharged the jury by telling them that punitive damages</pre>
    <pre>were in their discretion.

</pre>
    <pre>                      Members  of  the  jury,  I   have
          considered the question that you sent  to  me
          and  I don't know that I can really be of all
          that much help to you.  All that I can say to
          you  is  that  punitive damages  are  in  the
          discretion of the jury. You have to  be  fair
          and  reasonable to both sides, and apart from
          that, there's not much more or anything  more
          that  I  can  tell you.  It is not surprising
          that   it  is  difficult  to  arrive   at   a
          consensus. I urge you to keep talking to each
          other  and endeavour to find what that  magic
          figure should be.
          </pre>
    <pre>[38] Pilot submits that the jury should have been given more</pre>
    <pre>guidance, presumably by telling them an appropriate range for a</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages award.  This submission rings hollow in the face</pre>
    <pre>of Crabbe's refusal to permit the trial judge to give the jury a</pre>
    <pre>range.   Indeed, Crabbe told the trial judge &quot;... in terms of</pre>
    <pre>suggesting amounts or anything,  I think it ought not to occur.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge might have given the jury more help than he did,</pre>
    <pre>but his short recharge did not amount to a reviewable error.

</pre>
    <pre>               (ii) The Amount of the Award
          </pre>
    <pre>[39] An award of $1,000,000 in punitive damages against an</pre>
    <pre>insured for the bad faith handling of a claim by its own insured</pre>
    <pre>is unprecedented in Canada. Previous awards have been in the</pre>
    <pre>range of $7,500 to $15,000.14  Moreover, as Mr. Cherniak points</pre>
    <pre>out, punitive damage awards in another kind of breach of contract</pre>
    <pre>case, wrongful dismissal, have not exceeded $50,00015.</pre>
    <pre>Nonetheless, I would not disturb the award of $1,000,000.  I rely</pre>
    <pre>on six considerations.

</pre>
    <pre>[40] First, the jury's assessment is entitled to deference on</pre>
    <pre>appeal.  An appellate court should intervene only if the award is</pre>
    <pre>unreasonable or serves no rational purpose. It should not</pre>
    <pre>intervene simply because it would have awarded a different</pre>
    <pre>amount.  In Hill this court emphasized that although an appellate</pre>
    <pre>court should interfere when a punitive damages award serves no</pre>
    <pre>rational purpose, it should be hesitant to interfere with the</pre>
    <pre>amount of an award that does serve the dual purposes of</pre>
    <pre>punishment and deterrence.16

</pre>
    <pre>                    Punitive damages are different from
          compensatory  damages in that  they  are  not
          intended to compensate the plaintiff for  the
          injury caused by the libel.  Rather, they are
          designed  to  express the repugnance  of  the
          public,  which is represented  by  the  jury,
          towards the outrageous and heinous conduct of
          the  defendant. The award of punitive damages
          must  be  sufficient to punish the  defendant
          for  its  conduct and to deter the defendant,
          specifically,  and  others,  generally,  from
          similar  conduct  in  the  future.   Finally,
          punitive  damages should only be  awarded  if
the compensatory    damages    are    considered     by
          the  jury  to be insufficient to express  its
          repugnance  at  the conduct of the  defendant
          and to punish and deter.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     An  appellate court should be very
          hesitant  to substitute its opinion for  that
          of  the  jury regarding the adequacy  of  the
          compensatory award to effect the  purpose  of
          punitive damages.  The appellate court's duty
          to interfere arises when it is convinced that
          an  award of punitive damages, in addition to
          the  compensatory award, serves  no  rational
          purpose.
          </pre>
    <pre>[41] In the Supreme Court's judgment in Hill, Cory J. recognized</pre>
    <pre>that an appellate court has a wider scope to review an award of</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages than an award of compensatory damages, but still</pre>
    <pre>he limited review to whether the punitive damages served a</pre>
    <pre>rational purpose.  He wrote:

</pre>
    <pre>                       Unlike   compensatory   damages,
          punitive   damages   are   not   at    large.
          Consequently,  courts  have  a  much  greater
          scope   and   discretion  on   appeal.    The
          appellate  review should be  based  upon  the
          court's estimation as to whether the punitive
          damages  serve a rational purpose.  In  other
          words, was the misconduct of the defendant so
          outrageous   that   punitive   damages   were
          rationally required to act as deterrence?17
          

</pre>
    <pre>[42] I do not think there is any doubt that the award of punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages in this case serves a rational purpose.  It serves to</pre>
    <pre>punish Pilot for its outrageous conduct in maintaining an</pre>
    <pre>unsupportable arson defence and to deter Pilot and other insurers</pre>
    <pre>from this kind of conduct in the future. The jury, properly in my</pre>
    <pre>opinion, did not think that compensatory damages of under</pre>
    <pre>$300,000 were sufficient to express their repugnance at Pilot's</pre>
    <pre>conduct.  Moreover, in this case, the deference accorded to the</pre>
    <pre>jury's assessment was reinforced by the trial judge's opinion</pre>
    <pre>that the award of $1,000,000 was &quot;entirely reasonable&quot;.  Matlow</pre>
    <pre>J. observed:

</pre>
    <pre>                      And  finally,  for  the  sake  of
          completeness,  I  record  my  view  that  the
          jury's   assessment   of  punitive   damages,
          although   very  high  and  perhaps   without
          precedent,  is not perverse but  is  entirely
          reasonable in light of all of the evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     There was ample evidence that  the
          defendant  continued to deny the  plaintiff's
          claim  even after Francis, its own  adjuster,
          who had conducted a detailed investigation of
          the  plaintiff's claim, had recommended  that
          it   be  paid.   From  that  point  on,   the
          defendant   relied   on  a   few   suspicious
          circumstances   that  were  later   clarified
          adequately by the plaintiff in order to press
          on  with  an  ill-founded  defence  based  on
          allegations  of arson which, I  believe,  the
          jury  concluded were contrived and of no real
          substance.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    As a result, the plaintiff, who was
          already  in  poor  financial  condition,  was
          required to endure the indignity of having to
          make  temporary  living arrangements  without
          the  benefit of insurance coverage for  which
          she  had paid premiums to the defendant  and,
          as  well, she was required to resort to  this
          litigation, including a trial which  went  on
          over  the  course  of about  two  months,  to
          secure the relief to which she was entitled.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      In   light   of  the  defendant's
          admission    that   its   net    worth    was
          approximately  $231 million,  I  cannot  take
          issue with the jury's conclusion that a  very
          substantial  award for punitive  damages  was
          required  to  punish  the  defendant  and  to
          effectively send the implied reminder to  the
          defendant and to other insurers that they owe
          their  insureds  a  duty  of  good  faith  in
          responding  to claims made under policies  of
          insurance issued by them.
          

</pre>
    <pre>I am not persuaded that he erred in these observations.

</pre>
    <pre>[43] Second, an important consideration in assessing the</pre>
    <pre>reasonableness of the award is the extent of Pilot's</pre>
    <pre>reprehensible conduct.  Some wrongs are more blameworthy and more</pre>
    <pre>deserving of punishment than others.  The award should be</pre>
    <pre>proportional to the gravity of the wrong.18  In my view, Pilot's</pre>
    <pre>conduct was exceptionally reprehensible.  The Whitens lost their</pre>
    <pre>home and all of their belongings.  They tried to protect</pre>
    <pre>themselves against this kind of disaster by obtaining and paying</pre>
    <pre>for insurance.  When the disaster occurred, the Whitens, like</pre>
    <pre>other insureds, depended on their insurer to handle their claim</pre>
    <pre>fairly and in good faith. Instead, Pilot acted maliciously and</pre>
    <pre>vindictively by maintaining a serious accusation of arson for two</pre>
    <pre>years in the face of the opinions of an adjuster and several</pre>
    <pre>experts it had retained that the fire was accidental.  It abused</pre>
    <pre>the obvious power imbalance in its relationship with its insured</pre>
    <pre>by refusing to pay a claim that it knew or surely should have</pre>
    <pre>known was valid, and even by cutting off rental payments on the</pre>
    <pre>Whitens' rented cottage.  It took advantage of its dominant</pre>
    <pre>financial position to try to force the Whitens to compromise or</pre>
    <pre>even abandon their claim.  Indeed, throughout the nearly two</pre>
    <pre>years that the claim was outstanding, Pilot entirely disregarded</pre>
    <pre>the Whitens' rights.

</pre>
    <pre>[44] Third, vindicating the goal of deterrence is especially</pre>
    <pre>important in first party insurance cases.  Insurers annually deal</pre>
    <pre>with thousands and thousands of claims by their insureds.  A</pre>
    <pre>significant award was needed to deter Pilot and other insurers</pre>
    <pre>from exploiting the vulnerability of insureds, who are entirely</pre>
    <pre>dependant on their insurers when disaster strikes.

</pre>
    <pre>[45] Fourth, the financial worth of the defendant is relevant to</pre>
    <pre>the reasonableness of the award.  To be meaningful, an award of</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages cannot be perceived as a mere licence fee or as</pre>
    <pre>a cost of doing business.   The award must sting. Pilot admitted</pre>
    <pre>at trial that it had a net worth of $231,000,000.00.  For a</pre>
    <pre>company with such a substantial net worth, an award of $50,000 or</pre>
    <pre>even $100,000, let alone $15,000, is hardly likely to act as a</pre>
    <pre>deterrent.  The comments of Cory J. in Hill are relevant here.

</pre>
    <pre>                    Punitive damages can and do serve a
          useful  purpose.  But for them, it  would  be
          all  too  easy  for  the large,  wealthy  and
          powerful  to persist in libelling  vulnerable
          victims.   Awards of general  and  aggravated
          damages alone might simply be regarded  as  a
          licence   fee  for  continuing  a   character
          assassination.  The protection of a  person's
          reputation  arising from the  publication  of
          false   and  injurious  statements  must   be
          effective.   The  most  effective  means   of
          protection will be supplied by the  knowledge
          that  fines  in the form of punitive  damages
          may be awarded in cases where the defendant's
          conduct is truly outrageous.19
          

</pre>
    <pre>[46] Fifth, although the award in this case is obviously very</pre>
    <pre>large, there have been at least two other punitive damage awards</pre>
    <pre>of $1,000,000 or more in Canada20 and in Hill a jury award of</pre>
    <pre>$800,000.00 was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada.  A</pre>
    <pre>comparison of Hill to the present case shows that the jury award</pre>
    <pre>here is not excessive.  Hill, a former Crown attorney,</pre>
    <pre>successfully sued the Church of Scientology for defamation.  Hill</pre>
    <pre>was the victim of a deliberate attempt to assassinate his</pre>
    <pre>character in the media.  This character assassination was part of</pre>
    <pre>the Church of Scientology's systematic efforts to neutralize</pre>
    <pre>those it considered to be &quot;enemies&quot; of the Church.  The Church's</pre>
    <pre>conduct is distinguishable from the present case where no</pre>
    <pre>evidence was led to suggest Pilot systematically denies the</pre>
    <pre>claims of its insureds to force settlements.

</pre>
    <pre>[47] However, other comparative factors support the award for</pre>
    <pre>Daphne Whiten.  Before Hill, punitive damage awards in defamation</pre>
    <pre>cases were also modest yet the jury's large award in Hill was</pre>
    <pre>upheld both by this court and by the Supreme Court of Canada.21</pre>
    <pre>Therefore, I do not find persuasive Pilot's argument that the</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages in this case should be limited by previous</pre>
    <pre>awards. Moreover, Hill was awarded $500,000 for aggravated</pre>
    <pre>damages in addition to the $300,000 in compensatory damages and</pre>
    <pre>$800,000 in punitive damages.  Although a distinction exists</pre>
    <pre>between aggravated damages and punitive damages22, this</pre>
    <pre>distinction is &quot;more of words than ideas&quot;23 and an award of</pre>
    <pre>aggravated damages, by its very nature, tends to contain a</pre>
    <pre>punitive element.  No aggravated damages were awarded in the</pre>
    <pre>present case. The willingness of this court and the Supreme Court</pre>
    <pre>of Canada to uphold the large amount of damages awarded to Mr.</pre>
    <pre>Hill for his suffering and for punishment and deterrence of the</pre>
    <pre>Church of Scientology, demonstrates that the lesser total damages</pre>
    <pre>awarded to the Whitens is not unreasonable.  Moreover, for the</pre>
    <pre>reasons I have already expressed, the goal of deterrence is very</pre>
    <pre>important in first party insurance cases. Insurers annually deal</pre>
    <pre>with a multitude of claims from their insureds.  The punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages awarded in the present case should serve to deter Pilot</pre>
    <pre>and other insurance companies from acting in a similar  manner.</pre>
    <pre>The effect of deterring the kind of defamation practised by the</pre>
    <pre>Church of Scientology, though important, is not likely as far</pre>
    <pre>reaching.  Comparing Hill with this case, an award of $1,000,000</pre>
    <pre>for Daphne Whiten seems reasonable.

</pre>
    <pre>[48]  Finally, in recent years, both the courts and the</pre>
    <pre>legislatures have increased the amount of fines for companies who</pre>
    <pre>have acted irresponsibly or contrary to the public interest.  For</pre>
    <pre>instance, the Ontario Occupational Health and Safety Act was</pre>
    <pre>amended in 1990 to increase the maximum fine for a breach of the</pre>
    <pre>statute from $25,000 to $500,000.24 Fines recently imposed for</pre>
    <pre>breaches of the Competition Act routinely exceed $1 million, and</pre>
    <pre>in one case in 1998 totalled $16 million against one company.25</pre>
    <pre>This trend reflects an acknowledgement by judges and legislators</pre>
    <pre>that larger fines are needed to deter and punish companies for</pre>
    <pre>socially unacceptable behaviour.

</pre>
    <pre>[49] For these reasons, I am not persuaded that the award of</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages of $1,000,000 is unreasonable. I would dismiss</pre>
    <pre>the appeal with costs.

</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[50] I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Laskin</pre>
    <pre>J.A. and agree with his reasons and conclusions as to the first</pre>
    <pre>issue, namely: Was Daphne Whiten entitled to an award of punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages?  I agree that the answer is in the affirmative and I am</pre>
    <pre>unable to improve on my colleague's analysis.  However, I am</pre>
    <pre>unable to agree with him on the second issue: Is the award made</pre>
    <pre>by the jury of $1,000,000 excessive?  In my opinion, it is.

</pre>
    <pre>[51] I am not entirely happy with the trial judge's charge to the</pre>
    <pre>jury on the issue of punitive damages, but I do not propose to</pre>
    <pre>justify my intervention on any basis other than that I think the</pre>
    <pre>award is simply too high. The conduct of the appellant justifying</pre>
    <pre>the making of an award of punitive award is clearly reprehensible</pre>
    <pre>and I will not attempt to excuse it.  However, awards for</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages against insurers based on bad faith handling of</pre>
    <pre>insurance claims are traditionally in the range of $7,500 to</pre>
    <pre>$15,000, well below the level of this award.  I can think of no</pre>
    <pre>justification for such a radical departure from precedent as is</pre>
    <pre>represented by the award of this jury.

</pre>
    <pre>[52]  A quick review of recent cases illustrates the basis of my</pre>
    <pre>concern with the quantum of damages awarded below.  Labelle v.</pre>
    <pre>Guardian Insurance Co. of Canada (1989), 38 C.C.L.I. 274 (Ont.</pre>
    <pre>H.C.), involved circumstances not dissimilar to those in this</pre>
    <pre>appeal.  There, the defendant insurer had refused to settle the</pre>
    <pre>insured's claim arising from a fire in her home, forcing her to</pre>
    <pre>borrow money in order to make the necessary repairs.  The</pre>
    <pre>adjuster engaged by the defendant was arrogant, unreasonable, and</pre>
    <pre>insulting.  Only some four months after the fire did the</pre>
    <pre>defendant admit that it had any legal responsibility to its</pre>
    <pre>insured. Having found that the defendant failed to act promptly</pre>
    <pre>and fairly, and that it had proceeded with wanton and reckless</pre>
    <pre>disregard for the rights of the insured, Trainor J. concluded at</pre>
    <pre>p. 299:

</pre>
    <pre>                    the cumulative effect of all of
          these matters has led me to the conclusion
          that the defendant deliberately embarked upon
          a course of action designed to starve the
          plaintiff into submission.
          </pre>
    <pre>[53] Trainer J. awarded $10,000 in punitive damages and solicitor</pre>
    <pre>and client costs.

</pre>
    <pre>[54] In Adams v. Confederation Life Insurance Co. (1994), 25</pre>
    <pre>C.C.L.I. (2d) 180 (Alta. Q.B.), the plaintiff was a nurse who</pre>
    <pre>sought a declaration that she was entitled to long term</pre>
    <pre>disability payments under a group disability policy.  She</pre>
    <pre>suffered from fibromyalgia and depression. The defendant insurer</pre>
    <pre>had commenced paying her benefits and then cut them off despite</pre>
    <pre>receiving independent reports confirming the existence of the</pre>
    <pre>disability.  The defendant persisted in its refusal to allow</pre>
    <pre>benefits and placed the plaintiff under surveillance.  It also</pre>
    <pre>demanded a court ordered medical examination but refused to</pre>
    <pre>accept its findings.  The trial judge awarded $7,500 for punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages but declined to award costs on a solicitor and client</pre>
    <pre>basis.

</pre>
    <pre>[55] In Ferguson v. National Life Assurance Company of Canada</pre>
    <pre>(1996), 36 C.C.L.I. (2d) 95 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), affirmed</pre>
    <pre>(1997), 102 O.A.C. 239 (C.A.), a bus driver made a claim under a</pre>
    <pre>group disability policy based on anxiety and depression.</pre>
    <pre>Notwithstanding that the plaintiff lived in Ottawa, the defendant</pre>
    <pre>insurer caused him to travel to Montreal on short notice to be</pre>
    <pre>assessed by a psychologist who it had misrepresented to be a</pre>
    <pre>psychiatrist.  The defendant also falsely asserted that there was</pre>
    <pre>no other specialist in the Ottawa area who was qualified to make</pre>
    <pre>the assessment.  The defendant insurer was aware that the insured</pre>
    <pre>suffered from agoraphobia (a morbid dislike of public places) and</pre>
    <pre>it is difficult to accept that this insistence on travelling to</pre>
    <pre>Montreal was not a form of harassment.  However, the plaintiff</pre>
    <pre>did travel to Montreal; the trial judge found that the trip was a</pre>
    <pre>nightmare for him.  She also found that the defendant never</pre>
    <pre>intended to make an appointment for the plaintiff in the Ottawa</pre>
    <pre>area and intended that the insurer was to see its particular</pre>
    <pre>choice of expert in Montreal.  In addition, the trial judge found</pre>
    <pre>the expert to be lacking in both competence and objectivity.

</pre>
    <pre>[56] In awarding punitive damages, Bell J. found:

</pre>
    <pre>                    I conclude that this is one of
          those rare cases where the defendant's
          conduct has been so harsh, calculated,
          reprehensible, malicious and extreme as to be
          deserving of full condemnation and
          punishment.  In these circumstances an award
          of punitive damages is justified.
          </pre>
    <pre>[57] She awarded $7,500 in punitive damages and solicitor and</pre>
    <pre>client costs on the basis of an application of the sanctions</pre>
    <pre>respecting settlement offers imposed by Rule 49 of the Rules of</pre>
    <pre>Civil Procedure. The award was upheld on appeal to this court.

</pre>
    <pre>[58]  Over and above these cases, two recent appellate awards of</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages arising from claims for wrongful dismissal</pre>
    <pre>further demonstrate that this award cannot be supported.  In</pre>
    <pre>Ribeiro v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (1989), 67 O.R.</pre>
    <pre>(2d) 385 (H.C.), the plaintiff was awarded $10,000 in punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages after the defendant bank had dismissed him on the basis</pre>
    <pre>of a completely untrue allegation of fraud.  On appeal to this</pre>
    <pre>court, the award of punitive damages was increased to $50,000;</pre>
    <pre>see Ribeiro v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (1992), 13 O.R.</pre>
    <pre>(3d) 278 (C.A.).  Similarly, in Francis v. Canadian Imperial Bank</pre>
    <pre>of Commerce (1994), 21 O.R. (3d) 75 (C.A.) this court increased</pre>
    <pre>an award of punitive damages to $40,000 from the $15,000 awarded</pre>
    <pre>at trial.  There, the defendant bank had wrongfully dismissed the</pre>
    <pre>plaintiff on the basis of a shoddy and biased report of its</pre>
    <pre>investigator, who had wrongfully accused the employee of fraud</pre>
    <pre>and serious moral turpitude.

</pre>
    <pre>[59] In the case in appeal, in addition to the $1,000,000 award</pre>
    <pre>for punitive damages, the respondent received her claim in full,</pre>
    <pre>pre- and post-judgment interest and costs on a solicitor and</pre>
    <pre>client basis.  In arguing that the punitive award should be</pre>
    <pre>upheld, the respondent stresses that punitive damages serve a two-</pre>
    <pre>fold purpose.  The first is retributive, i.e to punish the</pre>
    <pre>defendant (appellant) for malicious conduct.  The second is to</pre>
    <pre>deter acts deemed socially unacceptable and consequently to</pre>
    <pre>discourage the perpetuation of objectionable corporate polices.</pre>
    <pre>While acknowledging that the award in this case is very large,</pre>
    <pre>the respondent cites three cases where damage awards of at least</pre>
    <pre>$1,000,000 have been made, and one of $800,000.  They are</pre>
    <pre>Lubrizol Corp. v. Imperial Oil Ltd., [1994] F.C.J. No. 1441</pre>
    <pre>(T.D.)($15,000,000), appeal allowed on other grounds,  [1996]</pre>
    <pre>F.C.J. No. 454 (C.A); Claiborne Industries Ltd. v. National Bank</pre>
    <pre>of Canada (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 65 (C.A.) (over $2,000,000);</pre>
    <pre>Colborne Capital Corporation v. 542775 Alberta Ltd. (1995), 30</pre>
    <pre>Alta. L.R. (3d) 127 (Q.B.) ($1,000,000); and Hill v. Church of</pre>
    <pre>Scientology of Toronto, [1995] 2. S.C.R. 1130 ($800,000).

</pre>
    <pre>[60] None of these cases is remotely similar to the one in</pre>
    <pre>appeal.  They are not bad faith defences to insurance claims and</pre>
    <pre>reflect fact situations that are unique to the particular</pre>
    <pre>litigation.  Moreover, they all reflect the concern of the courts</pre>
    <pre>with respect to &quot;objectionable corporate policies&quot; and the trial</pre>
    <pre>judgments in three of them emphasised the need to force</pre>
    <pre>tortfeasors to disgorge profits flowing from their actions.  In</pre>
    <pre>Lubrizol, a patent infringement case, the defendant continued to</pre>
    <pre>sell the infringing product in &quot;flagrant&quot; and &quot;callous&quot; contempt</pre>
    <pre>of an interlocutory injunction and reaped &quot;enormous&quot; profits.</pre>
    <pre>The award was set aside on appeal for lack of evidence and the</pre>
    <pre>matter remitted to trial for a fresh assessment.  In Claiborne,</pre>
    <pre>the award of punitive damages was fashioned to ensure that the</pre>
    <pre>defendant did not profit from the sale of shares in the plaintiff</pre>
    <pre>corporation that the defendant had acquired through a tortious</pre>
    <pre>conspiracy. In Hill v. Church of Scientology, the plaintiff was</pre>
    <pre>libelled as part of a corporate strategy of punishing any person</pre>
    <pre>on its &quot;enemies list&quot;. This designation was accepted as evidence</pre>
    <pre>of the malicious intention of the Church of Scientology to</pre>
    <pre>&quot;neutralize&quot; the plaintiff, a Crown Attorney acting within the</pre>
    <pre>scope of his employment. Characterizing the defendant's libel as</pre>
    <pre>&quot;devastating&quot; and &quot;a continuing attempt at character</pre>
    <pre>assassination&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages in the amount of $800,000 where the combined awards of</pre>
    <pre>general and aggravated damages were insufficient to achieve the</pre>
    <pre>goal of punishment and deterrence.

</pre>
    <pre>[61] As for Colborne Capital, the defendant had stood to gain</pre>
    <pre>$15,000,000 if its fraudulent scheme had succeeded; it was on</pre>
    <pre>this basis that the trial judge awarded  $1,000,000 in punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages.  However, since this appeal was argued before us, the</pre>
    <pre>Court of Appeal for Alberta has overturned the trial decision,</pre>
    <pre>vacating the award of punitive damages; see [1999] A.J. No. 33</pre>
    <pre>(C.A.).  At paragraph 296 the court indicated that, as there was</pre>
    <pre>in fact no pecuniary gain to the defendant, and thus there were</pre>
    <pre>no profits to disgorge, and as the award of compensatory damages</pre>
    <pre>had indemnified the plaintiffs, there was:

</pre>
    <pre>                    no severable rational purpose
          sustaining a duplicated and substantial
          punitive damage award.  As a head of damage,
          it had already been met within the
          compensatory award of pecuniary damages,
          interest, and a broad-gauged award of legal
          costsY
          </pre>
    <pre>[62] In the case in appeal, there is nothing in the evidence to</pre>
    <pre>suggest that the conduct so rightly condemned was the product of</pre>
    <pre>a corporate strategy by the appellant insurer to avoid payment of</pre>
    <pre>all policy claims or to discourage its insureds from making</pre>
    <pre>claims.  Nor is there any suggestion that the defendant has</pre>
    <pre>profited from its actions.  Rather, it appears to have been an</pre>
    <pre>isolated instance for which the appellant's trial counsel should</pre>
    <pre>take full responsibility, both for the manner in which the claim</pre>
    <pre>was processed and because of the way that the trial was</pre>
    <pre>conducted.  This certainly was the view of the trial judge.  I</pre>
    <pre>will not repeat the excerpt of the trial judge's charge to the</pre>
    <pre>jury which is set out by Laskin J.A. in his reasons, but wish</pre>
    <pre>only to highlight that the trial judge blamed trial counsel for</pre>
    <pre>directing and co-ordinating the expert evidence in support of the</pre>
    <pre>meritless arson defence that was maintained to the bitter end by</pre>
    <pre>the defendant insurer.  As the trial judge put it:

</pre>
    <pre>                    I respectfully express the view
          that his enthusiasm for his client's case
          appears to have caused him to exceed the
          permissible limits which ought to confine a
          lawyer in the preparation of witnesses.
          </pre>
    <pre>[63] While properly holding the appellant insurer fully</pre>
    <pre>accountable for the conduct of the lawyer it retained, the</pre>
    <pre>respondent insured does not attempt to elevate the appellant</pre>
    <pre>insurer's conduct above the level of the particular case. As she</pre>
    <pre>puts it in her factum:

</pre>
    <pre>                            The behaviour towards which
          the award of punitive damages was directed in
          this case was Pilot's malicious conduct in
          handling Mrs. Whiten's claim.  On January 18,
          1994 the Whitens lost their home and their
          belongings.  They had tried to protect
          themselves against precisely this type of
          disaster by obtaining and paying for
          insurance.  When the disaster occurred, the
          Whitens, like other insureds, were dependent
          on the insurer to handle the claim fairly and
          in good faith.  Instead, Pilot acted
          maliciously.  It abused the power imbalance
          in the relationship and refused to pay a
          claim it knew, or by any reasonable standard
          ought to have known, was valid.  There is
          evidence to suggest that Pilot's conduct was
          motivated by a desire to force the Whitens to
          compromise the claim at a discount.  Pilot
          utterly disregarded the rights of its
          insured.  This type of conduct should be
          deterred.
          </pre>
    <pre>[64] I accept the above description of the conduct of the</pre>
    <pre>appellant and, as I have already acknowledged, it embraces the</pre>
    <pre>indicia that merit an award of punitive damages.  However, there</pre>
    <pre>is no justification for an award of $1,000,000 over and above an</pre>
    <pre>award compensating the respondent insured for her claim in full</pre>
    <pre>along with solicitor and client costs that reimburse her for the</pre>
    <pre>expense of pursuing this claim to judgment.  This award for</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages was added to a claim for compensatory damages</pre>
    <pre>that can and was assessed with precision.  Accordingly it must</pre>
    <pre>stand alone in achieving the goal of punishment and deterrence.

</pre>
    <pre>[65] As was said by Cory J. for the majority of the Supreme Court</pre>
    <pre>of Canada in Hill v. Church of Scientology, supra, at p. 1208-09:

</pre>
    <pre>                       Unlike compensatory damages,
          punitive damages are not at large.
          Consequently, courts have a much greater
          scope and direction on appeal.  The appellate
          review should be based upon the court's
          estimation as to whether the punitive damages
          serve a rational purpose.  In other words,
          was the misconduct of the defendant so
          outrageous that punitive damages were
          rationally required to act as deterrence?
          </pre>
    <pre>Reference may also be had to the decision of this court in Walker</pre>
    <pre>et al. v. CFTO et al. (1987), 59 O.R. (2d) 104 (C.A.) at 120-121.

</pre>
    <pre>[66] I agree that an award of punitive damages does serve a</pre>
    <pre>rational purpose in this case and that it is rationally required</pre>
    <pre>to act as deterrence.  However, $1,000,000 is excessive.  This</pre>
    <pre>case does not demonstrate that there was such insidious,</pre>
    <pre>pernicious and persistent malice as would justify an award of</pre>
    <pre>this magnitude.   Nor did the defendant insurer profit by its</pre>
    <pre>intransigence.  In my opinion, an award of $100,000 would be</pre>
    <pre>sufficient to act a deterrent to this insurer and cause it to</pre>
    <pre>take the corporate steps necessary to ensure that in future it is</pre>
    <pre>properly apprised of the nature and kind of the defence its</pre>
    <pre>claims adjusters and counsel are advancing to any claim by a</pre>
    <pre>policy holder.

</pre>
    <pre>[67] In holding that an award of $100,000 is appropriate in this</pre>
    <pre>case, I find guidance from the decision of the United States</pre>
    <pre>Supreme Court in Pacific Life Insurance Co. v. Haslip (1990) 499</pre>
    <pre>U.S. 1.  Although that case turned on the interpretation of the</pre>
    <pre>Fourteenth Amendment and its impact, if any, on the award of</pre>
    <pre>punitive damages,  the court did have occasion to examine what</pre>
    <pre>criteria are to guide appellate courts in their review of jury</pre>
    <pre>awards of punitive damages.  In upholding a jury award of</pre>
    <pre>$1,000,000, Mr. Justice Blackmun, for the majority, listed the</pre>
    <pre>factors that are to be considered in determining whether an award</pre>
    <pre>is reasonably related to the goals of deterrence and retribution.</pre>
    <pre>He said at p.21:

</pre>
    <pre>               Y (a) whether there is a reasonable
          relationship between the punitive damages
          award and the harm likely to result from the
          defendant's conduct as well as the harm that
          has actually occurred; (b) the degree of
          reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct,
          the duration of that conduct, the defendant's
          awareness, any concealment, and the existence
          and frequency of similar past conduct; (c)
          the profitability to the defendant of the
          wrongful conduct and the desirability of
          removing that profit and of having the
          defendant also sustain a loss; (d) the
          &quot;financial position&quot; of the defendant; (e)
          all the costs of the litigation; (f) the
          imposition of criminal sanctions on the
          defendant for its conduct, these to be taken
          in mitigation; and (g) the existence of other
          civil awards against the defendant for the
          same conduct, these also to be taken in
          mitigation.
          </pre>
    <pre>     Blackmun J. made some remarks, which while specific to the</pre>
    <pre>law of Alabama, I find to be apposite in this instance.  He said</pre>
    <pre>at p.22:

</pre>
    <pre>               Y postverdict review ensures that
          punitive damages awards are not grossly out
          of proportion to the severity of the offence
          and have some understandable relationship to
          compensatory damages.  While punitive
          damagesYmay embrace such factors as the
          heinousness of the civil wrong, its effect
          upon the victim, the likelihood of its
          recurrence, and the extent of the defendant's
          wrongful gain, the fact finder must be guided
          by more than the defendant's net
          worthY.plaintiffs do not enjoy a windfall
          because they have the good fortune to have a
          defendant with a deep pocket.
          </pre>
    <pre>[68] Finding an appropriate quantum in cases such as this is</pre>
    <pre>always a delicate matter involving the principled exercise of</pre>
    <pre>discretion and the balancing of factors such as those enumerated</pre>
    <pre>by Blackmun J. supra.  As stated by McIntyre J. in Vorvis v.</pre>
    <pre>Insurance Corp. of British Columbia, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1058 at pp.</pre>
    <pre>1104-1105, &quot;all authorities accept the proposition that an award</pre>
    <pre>of punitive damages should always receive the most careful</pre>
    <pre>consideration and the discretion to award them should be most</pre>
    <pre>cautiously exercised.&quot;  In this appeal, the task before us is to</pre>
    <pre>find a quantum that adequately speaks to the damages found by the</pre>
    <pre>jury, and that might be reconcilable with guiding principles and</pre>
    <pre>quanta found in the Canadian cases discussed at the outset of</pre>
    <pre>these reasons.  It also requires that we find an amount that,</pre>
    <pre>while doing justice to this individual plaintiff, is not so great</pre>
    <pre>so as to overstate the nature of the defendant's conduct.  In</pre>
    <pre>finding an appropriate quantum, we must remind ourselves that the</pre>
    <pre>common law proceeds by induction, moving incrementally from case</pre>
    <pre>to case.  In my opinion, having regard to the facts of this case</pre>
    <pre>and the criteria discussed above, an award of $100,000 adequately</pre>
    <pre>penalizes the defendant without overstating the gravity of its</pre>
    <pre>conduct.

</pre>
    <pre>[69] Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, I would allow</pre>
    <pre>the appeal, set aside the award of $1,000,000 for punitive</pre>
    <pre>damages and substitute an award of $100,000 in its place.  The</pre>
    <pre>cross-appeal had been settled and no other part of the judgment</pre>
    <pre>below was challenged. The appellant does not ask for costs of the</pre>
    <pre>appeal and none are awarded.
