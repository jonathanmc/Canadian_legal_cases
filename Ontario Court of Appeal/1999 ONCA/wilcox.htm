    <pre>[1]  It is the position of the appellant, Carmella Greco, that
she did not borrow any money from the respondent as found by the
trial judge, and that if she did receive the money, her son,
Frank Greco, did not have her authority to enter into a loan
transaction on her behalf with the respondent.  In this regard,
it is the appellant’s position that the trial judge erred in
failing to make the essential finding that in requesting a loan
on her behalf, Frank had her authority to do so.

[2]  In our view, the real issue in this appeal is whether Frank
had the appellant’s actual authority to request a loan on her
behalf from the respondent.  Either Frank possessed her actual
authority to do so, or he did not possess it.

[3]  The evidence in respect to this issue was in conflict.  The
trial judge carefully analyzed the evidence in her reasons for
judgment.  Her findings essential to the result which she reached
are found in the full paragraph of her reasons at page 14 of the
Appeal Book.  In our review, it is implicit from these findings
that the trial judge was satisfied that Frank had his mother’s
actual authority to borrow the money on her behalf.  In our view,
this finding is supported by the evidence and the trial judge’s
analysis of the surrounding circumstances.

[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
