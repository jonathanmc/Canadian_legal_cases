CHARRON J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Bonnie Sue Willenbrecht and Albert Helmut Willenbrecht were
divorced by a judgment dated May 13, 1997. O&#146;Connell J. granted
the divorce pursuant to the terms of Minutes of Settlement agreed
upon by the parties. Mrs. Willenbrecht seeks an order extending
the time for appealing the divorce judgment.
[2]  This motion was heard on April 30, 1999. On May 5, 1999, I
dismissed the motion for reasons to follow. These are those
reasons.
[3]  Mrs. Willenbrecht seeks to appeal the judgment solely on the
ground of jurisdiction. She submits that the Ontario court may
not have had jurisdiction to grant the divorce because, at the
time the divorce was granted, another petition was pending before
the courts in Alberta. The Alberta proceedings had been commenced
before the proceedings were commenced in Ontario. Mrs.
Willenbrecht relies on the strict wording of s.3(2) of the
Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985 (2nd Supp.), c. 3 in support of her
proposed appeal.  That section reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               3(2)  Jurisdiction where two proceedings commenced on
          different days &#150; Where divorce proceedings between the same
          spouses are pending in two courts that would otherwise have
          jurisdiction under subsection (1) and were commenced on different
          days and the proceeding that was commenced first is not
          discontinued within thirty days after it was commenced, the court
          in which a divorce proceeding was commenced first has exclusive
          jurisdiction to hear and determine any divorce proceeding then
          pending between the spouses and the second divorce proceeding
          shall be deemed to be discontinued.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Both parties appeared in person to argue this motion.
Although Mrs. Willenbrecht still wishes to be divorced, she
states that she is bringing this motion out of concern that her
marital status may be questioned in the future. Mr. Willenbrecht
opposes the motion. He takes the position that the divorce
judgment is valid and he questions Mrs. Willenbrecht&#146;s good faith
in bringing this motion. He is anxious to have the matter settled
since he intends to remarry.
[5]  The history of the proceedings does indeed raise serious
concerns about Mrs. Willenbrecht&#146;s good faith.
[6]  The parties were married in 1986 and had a son in 1990.  In
1992, they separated, at which time Mrs. Willenbrecht moved from
Ontario to Calgary with the child.  Mr. Willenbrecht remained in
Ontario.  In February 1995, Mrs. Willenbrecht filed a petition
for divorce in Alberta.  In June 1995, she moved back to Toronto
with the child. In September 1995, Mr. Willenbrecht filed a
petition for divorce in Ontario.
[7]  On April 28, 1997 Benotto J. of the Ontario Court of Justice
(General Division), on a motion brought by Mr. Willenbrecht for
access to the child (amongst other things), held that the court
in Ontario now had jurisdiction because the parties and the child
lived in Ontario. This jurisdiction is provided for in s.3(1) of
the Divorce Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>               3(1)  Jurisdiction in divorce proceedings &#150; A court in a
          province has jurisdiction to hear and determine a divorce
          proceeding if either spouse has been ordinarily resident in the
          province for at least one year immediately preceding the
          commencement of the proceeding.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Section 6(1) further provides that a divorce proceeding may
be transferred to a court in another province where the
proceeding involves a custody and access contest and the child of
the marriage is most substantially connected with that other
province. Benotto J.  held that the child was &#147;clearly more
substantially connected to Ontario than Alberta&#148; and that the
trial should be in Ontario.
[9]  By its wording, s.6(1) appears to contemplate that an
application for transfer be brought in the jurisdiction in which
the divorce proceedings were first commenced &#150; in this case in
Alberta. However, in her reasons for decision, Benotto J. noted
that &#147;the parties have very limited financial resources&#148; and that
&#147;the husband cannot afford to bring a motion in Calgary to have
the matter transferred to Toronto&#148;. Both parties expressed a
desire to have the matter finalized expeditiously. Benotto J.
agreed and, on consent of both parties, set the matter down for
trial during the week of May 19, 1997.
[10] On May 12, 1997 both parties appeared before Benotto J.
Mrs. Willenbrecht was represented by counsel and agreed in
writing that the Alberta proceedings would be transferred to
Toronto. The parties also agreed that Mrs. Willenbrecht would
have custody of the child with generous access to the father.
Both parties signed Minutes of Settlement. The Minutes of
Settlement formed the basis of the divorce judgment which was
granted on consent on May 13, 1997 by O&#146;Connell J. The first
paragraph of the divorce judgment reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1. This Court orders and adjudges that the Divorce
          proceedings instituted in the Court of the Queen&#146;s Bench of
          Alberta in the Judicial District of Calgary by Bonnie
          Willenbrecht is hereby transferred to Toronto.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Mrs. Willenbrecht never sought an order transferring the
Alberta proceedings to Ontario. A certificate of divorce was
issued on September 18, 1997. The parties abided by the terms of
the divorce judgment for about one year until May, 1998 when Mrs.
Willenbrecht, without notice to Mr. Willenbrecht, moved back to
Alberta with the child, effectively thwarting his access rights.
On May 22, 1998, Mr. Willenbrecht obtained an order from
O&#146;Connell J. directing that if the child was not returned to
Ontario within fourteen days Mr. Willenbrecht would be granted
custody.
[12] Subsequently, Mrs. Willenbrecht attempted to pursue the
divorce proceedings in Alberta and, for the first time, brought
into question the validity of the Ontario judgment. She sought a
declaration from the Alberta court that the Ontario proceedings
were invalid. Martin J. denied her request. In his reasons dated
November 18, 1998, he ruled that any challenge to the validity of
the Ontario divorce must be brought to the Court of Appeal for
Ontario. Mrs. Willenbrecht also requested that the Alberta
petition for divorce be granted. Martin J. refused to grant the
relief sought. He noted that by her written agreement and her
subsequent conduct, Mrs. Willenbrecht had &#147;ceded jurisdiction to
the Ontario court&#148; and that
          </pre>
    <pre>               [b]reach of that undertaking cannot now be relied upon to
          resurrect the Alberta action and become the basis of this court
          asserting the jurisdiction it once had.  To permit any party to
          manipulate the process and the court in this way would be a
          prescription for mischief which cannot be tolerated.</pre>
    <pre>     In his view, the only question left to
be determined by the court in Alberta was
whether the Alberta file should be
transferred to Ontario or whether it should
be deemed to be discontinued.</pre>
    <pre>[13] Several factors must be considered on this motion to extend
the time to appeal, including the existence of a bona fide
intention to appeal, the length of the delay, the prejudice to
the other party and the merits of the proposed appeal.
[14] In my view, Mrs. Willenbrecht&#146;s conduct alone provides ample
reasons to deny her motion. I agree entirely with Martin J.&#146;s
comments that the courts cannot permit Mrs. Willenbrecht's
attempts to manipulate the process and the courts. It would be
nothing short of scandalous if she were allowed to rely on her
breach of undertaking to form the grounds of an appeal from a
judgment that is otherwise unimpeachable.
[15] Further, it is my view that, in the circumstances of this
case, the proposed appeal would be very unlikely to succeed. The
Ontario court clearly had jurisdiction under s.3(1) of the
Divorce Act to entertain Mr. Willenbrecht&#146;s petition. Further, at
the time the divorce was granted, the child was more
substantially connected to Ontario and a transfer order could
have been made by the Alberta court on a motion by either of the
parties or on the court&#146;s own motion. Mrs. Willenbrecht agreed,
and undertook, to effect a transfer of the Alberta proceedings to
Ontario. In these circumstances, it is questionable whether the
Alberta proceedings were still &#147;pending&#148; within the meaning of
s.3(2) so as to deprive the Ontario court of its jurisdiction
under s.3(1). A statutory provision should not be read so as to
create an absurd result or in a manner that defeats its
intention. Section 3(2) is clearly intended to resolve disputes
over jurisdiction in cases where each party intends to pursue
divorce proceedings commenced in separate jurisdictions. In this
case, both parties resided in Ontario and intended to continue
the proceedings in Ontario. The Ontario court exercised its
jurisdiction under s.3(1) on that basis.
[16] In any event, an order transferring the Alberta proceedings
would have the effect of validating the Ontario proceedings nunc
pro tunc, that is, as of the date of the divorce judgment since
that judgment was predicated on such a transfer having been made.
The material demonstrates that this is precisely the course of
action that is contemplated by the Alberta court. Therefore, the
intended appeal before this court would likely become moot long
before it was perfected and scheduled to be heard.
[17] It is for these reasons that the motion for leave to extend
the time within which to appeal was dismissed. Neither party is
represented by counsel and, consequently, I make no order as to
costs.</pre></td>
