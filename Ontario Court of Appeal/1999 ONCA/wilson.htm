    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Hurley J., dated February 5, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal.
     1)    The trial judge erred in dismissing the jury absent a
          motion by counsel;
     2)   The trial judge erred in failing to order a mistrial;
     3)   The trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of an expert
          in golf course design.
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We are of the opinion that, in the circumstances, the trial
judge did not err in inferring that there had been a motion to
dismiss the jury and to continue the trial by judge alone.  This
conclusion is supported by the lack of any objection by Mr. Brown
who was counsel for the appellant at trial. Secondly, even if the
trial judge erred in dismissing the jury he did not err in
exercising his discretion to continue the trial himself. If a new
trial before a jury had been held any jury acting reasonably
would inevitably have reached the same result. With respect to
the third ground of appeal, the expert evidence was properly
admissible and the trial judge did not err in dismissing it.
There is no basis for saying that the expert&#146;s report, which was
not formally in evidence, was a factor in the trial judge&#146;s
conclusion. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The cross appeal is withdrawn.
