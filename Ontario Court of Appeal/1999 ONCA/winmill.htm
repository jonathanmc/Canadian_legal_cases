    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The appellant was convicted, by the verdict of a jury, of
first degree murder at a trial presided over by the Honourable
Mr. Justice Nicholls. He was sentenced to life imprisonment
without eligibility for parole for 25 years. He appeals his
conviction.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[2]  The appellant advances three grounds of appeal. He submits
that:</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">·    the trial judge erred in failing to adequately caution the
jury with respect to the evidence of three untrustworthy Crown
witnesses and in failing to direct the jury that the evidence of
any one of the untrustworthy witnesses could not provide support
for the evidence of either of the other untrustworthy witnesses;

·    the trial judge failed to properly alert the jury to the
numerous inconsistencies in the version of events advanced by the
three untrustworthy witnesses and the objectively demonstrable
facts; and

·    the trial judge erred in admitting evidence that the
appellant had previously worked as a butcher in a slaughterhouse.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  At the opening of oral argument of the appeal, the appellant
applied for an order admitting fresh evidence. I will deal with
that application after I review some of the evidence. I propose
to limit my review of the evidence to those aspects of it that
will provide some reasonable background against which the
appellant’s submissions can be considered.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE EVIDENCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  Overview of the Crown’s Case</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[4]  The Crown’s case relied heavily on the testimony of three
witnesses: Robert Winmill, the appellant’s son; the appellant’s
daughter-in-law, Tina Winmill; and Chris Cvetkovic, a friend of
Robert and Tina Winmill’s. For convenience, I will refer to
Robert Winmill as Robert, to Tina Winmill as Tina, to Chris
Cvetkovic as Chris, and to the victim, Brian Brady, as the
deceased.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[5]  Early in the morning of September 22, 1991, the deceased
arrived at Robert and Tina’s apartment. Robert, Tina, Chris and
the appellant were all present in the apartment. Shortly after
his arrival, the deceased began arguing with Robert about the
value Robert had obtained on the sale of property that the two of
them had stolen. The noise awakened the appellant and within a
short time he became involved in the argument.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[6]  Tempers quickly cooled and Robert and the deceased left to
commit more break and enters. At dawn, they returned to the
apartment with the proceeds of their night’s work. The appellant,
Robert, Chris and the deceased stayed up drinking the alcohol
that they had stolen that night. Tina slept. At about 7:30 a.m.
she was woken up and told that they were all leaving to go to a
farm of a friend to deliver a stolen VCR.  She showered and
prepared to join the group on the trip to the farm. She said that
while she was in the bathroom the appellant came into the
bathroom and told her he was going to “do” Brian. I will refer to
Tina’s evidence about her encounter with the appellant in the
bathroom in more detail shortly.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[7]  Chris testified that before they left to go to the farm the
appellant also told him that the appellant was going to kill the
deceased.  The appellant made similar comments to Robert. No one
took the appellant’s comments seriously at the time. Within a
short time Robert, Tina, Chris, the deceased and the appellant
left the apartment in Chris’ car with the VCR loaded in the
trunk. Robert drove. On the way to the farm he turned off the
road and travelled about a half a mile along an unimproved road
where he stopped the car. It was on that isolated stretch of road
that the deceased was stabbed and killed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[8]  Robert, Tina and Chris testified that after they turned onto
the back road, the appellant asked Robert to stop the car so that
he could urinate. When the car stopped, the deceased got out of
the car. When the deceased finished urinating at the side of the
road, the appellant stabbed him twice in the abdomen with Chris’
knife. He then slit the deceased’s throat.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[9]  The evidence of Robert, Tina and Chris, all of whom
testified that they saw the appellant stab and kill the deceased,
was central to the Crown’s case. The Crown also relied on what it
claimed was an inculpatory statement made by the appellant
following his arrest. According to the arresting officers, upon
being told that he was being arrested for the murder of Brian
Brady, the appellant stated, “At 9 o’clock yesterday morning, I
was drunk and I couldn’t even move.”  The Crown alleged that this
statement proved that the appellant knew the time of the
deceased’s death, and it therefore contradicted the appellant’s
claim that he was asleep in the car when the deceased was killed,
and was therefore unaware of the circumstances of the deceased’s
death.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii) The Appellant’s Evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[10] The appellant testified that he could not walk without
assistance on September 22, 1991. He thus took the position that
he could not have stabbed the deceased in the manner described by
the three main Crown witnesses. The appellant said that when the
deceased was stabbed he was asleep in Chris’ car. Thus, he could
shed no light on who stabbed the deceased. However, he made it
clear in his evidence that he was not the culprit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[11] The appellant was 44 years old at the time of trial. He
admitted to a criminal record consisting of contributing to
juvenile delinquency, theft under, uttering, arson, break and
enter and driving with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of
80 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[12] The appellant testified that on Saturday, September 21,
1991, he was at the farm of his friends Earl and Sheila Cyopick.
He had moved into the Cyopicks’ family room at the farm while he
recuperated from a fractured pelvis, which he had suffered in a
car accident on July 1, 1991. The appellant was in bed at the
Cyopick farm trying to sleep while a party was ongoing. He was
awakened by Robert who suggested that he sleep at Robert and
Tina’s apartment that night. The idea was that he would also
spend Sunday at the apartment and return to the Cyopick farm on
Sunday night. The appellant said that he “crutched out” to a
bonfire that was underway at the farm and sat in a wheelchair by
the bonfire and drank. He then got into Chris’ car to go to
Robert and Tina’s apartment. He used crutches to go upstairs to
the apartment. Chris walked up behind him in case he fell.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[13] The appellant consumed two or three beers within a short
time of his arrival in the apartment. In due course he was made
comfortable on a couch in the living room and he went to sleep in
a more or less sitting position on the couch. This sleeping
position was made necessary as a result of his injuries. After
the appellant was asleep, the deceased arrived. In short order
the deceased and Robert got into an argument. The crux of the
argument was the deceased’s contention that Robert had sold
property stolen by Robert and the deceased for too little. The
appellant intervened in the argument, taking Robert’s side as he
did. Essentially, he told the deceased to mind his own business.
Tina also entered the fray; she yelled at the deceased for
getting the appellant upset. When the deceased responded to Tina
with harsh words, Robert said, “You don’t talk to my wife that
way. Get out.”  Robert and the deceased then went outside. Within
a short time they returned and the deceased apologized to
everyone. The apology was accompanied by handshakes.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[14] Robert and the deceased then left briefly to go to a store.
The appellant said at his request they brought him two chocolate
bars. When they returned those present shared some marijuana.
Robert and the deceased then asked Chris if they could use his
car. They then left in Chris’ car to commit some break and enters
in the Crystal Beach area. It was dawn when they returned.
According to the appellant, when the deceased returned from
committing the break and enters, he had a small cut on the edge
of his baby finger, which he had gotten punching a window in.
Each time the deceased squeezed his hand, a drop or two of blood
would ooze from the cut.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[15] Among the goods stolen by Robert and the deceased was some
liquor. The appellant took advantage of the new liquor supply and
drank southern comfort, rye, vodka, cognac and beer. The others,
apart from Tina, joined in. During this part of the morning,
Robert, the deceased and Chris in various ways displayed their
personal knives. Chris had to retrieve his knife from the car in
order to participate in this display.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[16] The appellant stated that the group, other than Tina, who
was sleeping, decided to go to the Cyopick farm to deliver a
recently stolen VCR to Darlene Drake, who lived at the farm.
There was some discussion about whether she had the money to pay
for the VCR, however, they decided to go to the farm in any
event. By the time the appellant left the apartment to go to the
Cyopick farm, he said that he was “pretty wobbly” due to the
alcohol he had consumed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[17] When it was decided to leave the apartment and go to the
Cyopick farm, Robert wakened Tina so that she could get ready for
the trip. When Tina was in the bathroom having a shower, the
appellant entered the bathroom to use the facilities and to
finish cleansing his abdominal wounds where pins had been
inserted when he was provided with a pelvic fixator following his
car accident. The appellant recalled being in the bathroom using
the toilet when Tina was in the shower; however, he denied
telling Tina that he was going to kill the deceased. He testified
that while he and Tina were both in the bathroom there was no
conversation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[18] The appellant said that he “crutched” out to the car and sat
in the right front seat beside Robert, the driver. He almost
immediately fell asleep. He awakened to the sound of a dog
barking at the side of the car. He immediately recognized the
Cyopicks’ Rhodesian Ridgeback and understandably concluded he was
at the Cyopick farm, which was about a 30-minute drive from the
apartment. Before the appellant got out of the car, the others
decided to leave. At this time, the deceased was no longer
present. Unknown to the appellant, who said he slept through the
entire trip from the apartment to the farm, the deceased had been
killed on the way from the apartment to the Cyopick farm. The
appellant recalled that the deceased was in the car when the
group left the apartment. He did not notice that he was not in
the car when they arrived at the Cyopick farm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[19] As they left the Cyopick farm, Robert wakened the appellant
and asked him about a bootlegger. He wanted to find a bootlegger
to whom he might sell some of the stolen liquor. At the
appellant’s direction, they stopped at the house of a local
retired bootlegger. The appellant went into the house and was
given a drink of rye. The others remained in the car. The
appellant testified that he did not try to sell the stolen liquor
to this bootlegger because he did not want his friend, the
bootlegger, to be involved with stolen liquor. When the occupants
of the car became impatient, the appellant returned to the car.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[20] Once the appellant was back in the car, he said, he almost
immediately fell asleep again. He next woke up back at the
Cyopick farm where he left the car to urinate. He recalled that
Darlene Drake helped him into his pyjamas and he said that he
then went to sleep. He slept until about 9:00 p.m. The appellant
did not recall being at the apartment or going from the apartment
back to the farm.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[21] The next morning the police arrived and arrested the
appellant for Brady’s murder. According to the appellant, in an
interview shortly after his arrest he asked the arresting
officer, Detective Bruno, when the murder was supposed to have
taken place, and was told, “early yesterday morning.”  This was
the appellant’s explanation for having said to the police
officers, “At 9 o’clock yesterday morning, I was drunk and I
couldn’t even move.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[22] The appellant testified that he was unable to walk without
assistance of, first a walker, and then crutches, because of his
fractured pelvis. I will review the evidence of the appellant’s
mobility separately. He admitted telling the deceased the night
before the deceased was killed that if he didn’t keep quiet,
“I’ll stick my crutch down his throat”, but he denied the
evidence of Robert, Tina and Chris that he killed the deceased.
He also denied uttering any threats to kill the deceased before
they left the apartment to go to the Cyopick farm. These threats
were referred to in Tina, Robert and Chris’ evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[23] When the appellant was asked on cross-examination to explain
how the deceased’s blood got on his shoe and jeans, he said, “[I
have] no idea. The only thing I could see is, when they came back
from the break and enter and Brian and I were passing drinks back
and forth; that’s the only way I can possibly see it ... because
of the little cut on his hand.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[24] It is clear from the appellant’s testimony that he claimed
not to know what happened in the period extending from the time
he, Robert, Tina, Chris and the deceased left the apartment to
the time when they arrived at the Cyopick farm. It was on that
trip that the deceased was murdered. The appellant said that it
would take 30 minutes or slightly less than that to drive from
the apartment to the Cyopick farm. The appellant also did not
know what happened from the time the group, minus the deceased,
left the Cyopick farm until they arrived at the bootlegger’s. He
did, however, recall getting out of the car at the bootleggers
and going into the bootlegger’s house. In addition, the appellant
did not know what happened from the time the car left the
bootlegger’s to the time when he awoke at the Cyopick farm. The
evidence of Robert, Tina and Chris fills those gaps and I will
turn to it now.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  (iii)   The Evidence of Tina, Robert and Chris</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[25] Tina was 21 years old when the deceased was killed. She
married Robert about 14 months before the trial. They separated
about 5 months before the trial. She said that when she was in
the shower preparing to go to the Cyopick farm to deliver the
stolen VCR, the appellant came into the bathroom and asked her if
she was “solid.”  Tina thought the appellant was referring to her
body, so she flexed her muscles for him in response. According to
Tina, the appellant then said what he wanted to know was whether
she could keep a secret. When she said that she could, the
appellant said, “I am going to do Brian.”  Tina said that a short
time later she heard the appellant talking to someone in the
living room. The appellant said that, “they were going to pull
over on the side of the road and take a leak and that’s where
they would do Brian.”  She could not recall to whom the appellant
made this statement.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[26] Tina testified that from her vantage point inside the car
she saw the appellant stab the deceased at the side of the road.
I will not review her description of the stabbing. She said that
in the aftermath of the stabbing the appellant fell and Chris and
Robert helped him up. Chris took the knife and wiped it in the
sand and then put it in the trunk of the car. Robert dragged the
deceased by the legs across the road and kicked him into the
ditch.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[27] Tina said that after the appellant slit the deceased’s
throat he said that he knew how to stab someone because he used
to be a butcher. The Crown called Homer Vander Meer who said that
the appellant had worked for him at his slaughterhouse, Homer’s
Meats. His duties included work on the kill floor, the cutting
room and loading trucks. The appellant admitted that he had
worked for Mr. Vander Meer on the kill floor.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[28] Tina testified that within a few hours of the stabbing she
wanted to call the police. She realized that she had witnessed a
murder and was doing nothing about it. She said that she did not
want to go to jail for something that she did not do. Thus, she
telephoned her father about her dilemma. He told her to call the
police.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[29] Before Tina called the police she spoke to Robert, who told
her what to say to the police. She testified that her marriage
was an abusive one and that Robert would have beaten her if she
did not do what he told her to do. Thus, she followed his
instructions about what to say to the police. Her initial
statement to the police minimized his involvement and did not
refer to the fact that she and Chris had sexual intercourse on
the night before the murder while Robert was absent committing
break and enters. She testified that her trial evidence was true
since she was, by the time of trial, living far away from her
husband and thus she no longer had any reason to fear him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[30] Robert’s evidence did not differ to any significant degree
from the evidence of Tina and Chris concerning events in the
apartment before and after Robert and the deceased left to commit
break and enters in the Crystal Beach area. Like Tina, Robert
testified that while the group was preparing to leave to go to
the farm, the appellant told him that he was going to kill the
deceased. At the time, he did not take the appellant seriously.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[31] Robert said that when the car stopped on the remote dirt
road, the appellant got out on the passenger side, without his
crutches, and walked to the rear of the car. He saw Chris’ knife
in the appellant’s hand through the rearview mirror. He also saw
the appellant stab the deceased. The appellant then fell. Robert
and Chris helped him up. When Robert saw that Tina was out of the
car on the passenger side he yelled at her to get back into the
car. Robert said that the appellant and Chris told him to move
the body. He grabbed the deceased by the leg, dropped him, and
then grabbed his leg again to drag him across the road where he
rolled him into the ditch. Like Tina, Robert said that Chris
cleaned the knife in the sand. He added that he kicked the sand
where his footprints were and retrieved a beer can that he had
thrown in the ditch.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[32] When they returned to the apartment after the stabbing,
Robert washed the inside and outside of the car to remove all
traces of the deceased and the road where the deceased was
killed. He placed his jean jacket under the appellant’s head. The
appellant continued to sleep in the car throughout this time.
Robert testified that after he washed the car he took a knife and
scraped the bottom of his boots and removed the heels, “so that
they wouldn’t match with anything that was on the road.”  He also
washed blood off his boots. He later went out for a drive to
think things over. The appellant was still in the car at that
time. Robert tried to awaken him but was not successful.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[33] While the appellant slept in the car, Robert and Tina and
Chris discussed what they should do. Eventually, Chris decided to
leave and take the appellant back to the farm. After Chris and
the appellant left, Robert and Tina continued to discuss what to
do about the murder. Robert suggested that Tina was more or less
in control of things at this stage. Tina testified that Robert
wanted to wait until after it had rained to call the police so
that footprints and tire tracks on the road would not be evident.
However, at about 6:35 p.m., after speaking with her father, Tina
telephoned the Welland office of the Niagara Regional Police
Department and she and Robert reported the homicide to Staff
Sergeant Macleod. She was with Robert at the time. The police
quickly responded and within a short time both Tina and Robert
were at the police station being questioned.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[34] Robert admitted that he lied to the police when he first
spoke with them. He maintained that he said what he was told to
say by Tina. He admitted having hit Tina occasionally, but added
that she used to hit him. He acknowledged that he discussed the
murder with Chris and Tina at the apartment within two hours of
the murder. He steadfastly denied accusations that he was
concocting his evidence to protect himself and the others and in
order to have the appellant, his father, sent to jail. He said
that he would rather go to jail himself than see his father go to
jail for something he did not do. He admitted that he felt
animosity towards the appellant because the appellant placed him
in a foster home when he was young; however, he said that his
present love for the appellant over-powered this animosity.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[35] On September 21, 1991, Chris had only known Robert, Tina and
the deceased for a short time. He knew the appellant, but not
well. He testified that shortly before the group left the
apartment for the farm, the appellant told him that he was
“ticked” with the deceased and that, “he was going to kill the
little s.o.b. because he had a big mouth.” Chris did not take the
appellant seriously. He did not believe that the appellant would
kill the deceased. He did, however, acknowledge that, at the
appellant’s request he gave his knife to the appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[36] Chris said that when they arrived at the isolated road where
the deceased was stabbed, the appellant got out of the car first,
followed by Robert, himself and then the deceased. He said that
the appellant walked across the road toward the deceased and that
when the appellant reached the deceased he stabbed the deceased
in the mid-section. When the appellant pulled the knife out,
Chris noticed that it was his knife. He said that Robert told the
appellant to finish him, if he was going to, whereupon the
appellant grabbed Brady by the hair, exposing his throat. The
appellant then slit the deceased’s throat from left to right.
Robert then dragged the body across the road and dropped it in
the ditch where it was not readily visible.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[37] Chris testified that, after the appellant stabbed the
deceased in his abdomen, the deceased said something about
getting him to the hospital. He also asked why the appellant had
done this to him. Chris stated that as the appellant sat on “a
little clump of dirt”, the appellant, apparently in response to
the deceased’s hospital plea, said that he was going to die
anyway because he had stabbed him in the spleen. This occurred
before the deceased’s throat was slit.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[38] Chris testified that after the appellant slit the deceased’s
throat, the appellant returned to the car. He called Chris over
to take the knife. Chris took the knife from the appellant and
put it on top of the floor mat in the back seat area of the car.
As I said earlier, Tina testified that Chris put the knife in the
trunk.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[39] Chris admitted that parts of his first statement to the
police were not true and that he was trying to minimize his
involvement in the murder when he told the police that he was
sitting in the car when the murder occurred. He said that he told
the truth to the police in his third statement, given about a
week after the murder.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[40] Robert,  Tina and Chris all testified that the appellant was
in a “happy” mood as they left the dirt road where the deceased
was stabbed. They said the appellant bragged about killing the
deceased and about previous killings. They testified that the
appellant said, “[s]ee, I told you I could fuckin’ do it. See I
can do it, I got balls.”  This evidence directly conflicts with
the appellant’s evidence. As I have said, he testified that he
was asleep when the deceased was stabbed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[41] Darlene Drake, who was at the farm, testified that Robert,
Tina, Chris and the appellant arrived at the farm about 9:15 to
9:30 a.m. Sheila Cyopick said that they arrived between 9:00 and
9:30 a.m. This would suggest that the murder occurred around 9:00
a.m. Once at the farm Robert and Chris carried the VCR into the
house and Darlene Drake said that she told Robert that she did
not want a VCR right away since she did not have the money to pay
for it. Nonetheless, Robert left the VCR with her.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[42] On Monday, September 23, 1991, Chris put the knife in an oil
drum at his work place. He also disposed of the box in which he
kept the knife by throwing the box in an incinerator used to burn
garbage where he worked. The jean jacket to which I have referred
was recovered from the rear of Chris’ car. Tina, Robert and Chris
gave the police the clothes that they said they were wearing at
the time of the deceased’s stabbing.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[43] There was considerable evidence about the appellant’s
drinking. The trial judge reviewed it thoroughly in his charge.
The appellant takes no issue with that part of the review of the
evidence or with the trial judge’s charge to the jury on
intoxication as it related to the issue whether the appellant had
the intent required for murder and, assuming he had the required
intent, whether the murder was planned and deliberate. It will be
sufficient to note for present purposes that the appellant said
that he was drunk and that he was passed out in the car before,
during and after the murder. There was also evidence that the
appellant was an habitual drinker and that he was not impaired at
relevant times to any significant degree.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[44] It was accepted at the trial that the three main Crown
witnesses Robert, Tina and Chris were witnesses of unsavoury
character and that the Crown’s case depended on their evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[45] Robert had a criminal record that included convictions for
theft, break and enter, uttering forged documents, escaping
custody, obstruct police, armed robbery, possession of prohibited
weapons and uttering threats. He appears to have survived in an
economic sense by stealing. He was at the scene of the crime and
although he said that he did not think the appellant’s threats
were serious, he received some advance indication from the
appellant that the appellant was going to stab the deceased.
After the stabbing, he was involved in efforts to conceal and
destroy evidence. He gave conflicting statements to the police.
In addition, his trial evidence was, in part, in conflict with
the police statements. On October 13, 1992, during the trial, but
before he testified, Robert gave a statement to a defence
investigator in which he said that Chris stabbed the deceased. At
trial, he testified that this statement was false.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[46] Tina was 21 years of age at the time of trial and she too
had a criminal record. She had been convicted of theft, forgery,
uttering, public mischief, obstruct justice and failure to
appear. She admitted that she lied in her first statement to the
police and that her statement was incomplete. As I have said, she
explained that she attempted to minimize her husband’s
involvement because she was afraid of him. At the time she was in
an abusive marriage. By the time of the trial she had separated
from Robert and was no longer concerned about being harmed by
him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[47] Chris gave three statements to the police, the first two on
September 23, 1991. He acknowledged that his testimony at trial
differed from his first two statements. He admitted that he spoke
to Robert before he gave the police a third statement on October
1, 1991. He acknowledged drinking 15 or 16 beers and smoking
marijuana on Saturday evening and said that he continued drinking
and smoking marijuana during the night and morning. He also
admitted that he took his knife up to the apartment and washed it
after the deceased was stabbed. He acknowledged incinerating the
box in which the knife had been stored and depositing the knife
in an oil drum at his place of employment.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[48] Although all of Robert, Tina and Chris attracted a Vetrovec
warning, it is apparent that on the surface Chris was less
untrustworthy than Robert and Tina. He had no criminal record and
was steadily employed. He barely knew the deceased and was a
relatively recent acquaintance of Robert, Tina and the appellant.
His evidence that he threw his knife in a large drum at his work
place was supported by the evidence that the police found the
knife there. It can reasonably be said that on the surface, he
was less untrustworthy than Robert and Tina. In addition, he had
no real motive to kill the deceased or to help Robert or Tina.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iv) The Forensic Evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          1.   The Soil Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[49] Dr. Graves, a chemist from the Centre of Forensic Sciences,
examined soil samples taken from the area where the deceased’s
body was discovered, the nearby roadway and the soles of the
appellant’s running shoes. He said that the soil taken from the
location where the body was discovered was different from the
soil on the roadway. This variation in soil composition was,
according to Dr. Graves, quite common. The soil from the
appellant’s running shoe did not match any of the samples that
Dr. Graves examined. He said that this could mean that the soil
on the appellant’s shoe was from a different location, or it
could simply mean that the soil from the relevant locations had
mixed with other soils from other areas leading to a result that
the soils did not match.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          2.   The Blood Analysis</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[50] Kimberly Johnston, Assistant Head of the Biology Section at
the Centre of Forensic Sciences, was qualified as an expert in
blood analysis. She gave evidence about her analysis of blood
samples with which she was provided. She tested the deceased’s
blood for comparison purposes. She used three blood grouping
systems in her testing – the ABO,  GM and KM systems. The
deceased, like 47% of the population, had group O blood. In the
GM system the deceased’s blood was found to have markers that put
him with 31% of the general population. The deceased’s KM type
was also determined. According to Ms. Johnston, about 3% of the
general population  have the combination of GM and KM blood
disclosed by her analysis of the deceased’s blood.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[51] Ms. Johnston analyzed blood stains on Robert’s denim jacket.
She identified 17 areas of blood staining on the jacket. A group
of stains on the inside of the jacket’s right sleeve matched the
deceased’s GM type, however, tests using other blood systems were
inconclusive. A stain on the left shoulder had the same GM type
as the deceased’s blood. Tests with the other two blood systems
were inconclusive. Stains on the inner surface of the lapel had
the same GM type as the deceased but they belonged to group B, in
the ABO system and thus these stains did not come from the
deceased.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[52] Ms. Johnston found human blood in a soil sample taken from
the appellant’s running shoe. She testified that soil compromises
blood samples and that the particular sample could not therefore
be further analyzed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[53] Ms. Johnston found a blood stain below the knee on the left
leg of the appellant’s jeans that had the same GM type as the
deceased’s blood and a KM “1” test result. She said that this
combination occurs only in 3.2% of the population. Her testing
was inconclusive for the “3” factor in KM typing and the ABO type
could not be determined.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[54] Ms. Johnston found small samples of blood on Robert and
Chris’ jeans. The samples were too small to analyze. Further, she
identified blood on the tip of Robert’s boot, however, the sample
was also too small to analyze.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[55] Blood found in soil samples taken from the road were
consistent with the deceased’s blood. Blood found on the floor
mat of Chris’ car was not the deceased’s.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">               (v)  The Appellant’s Mobility</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[56] There was conflicting evidence on the issue whether the
appellant could walk without crutches on September 22, 1991. The
appellant contended that because of his lack of mobility he was
not physically capable of stabbing the deceased in the manner
described by Robert, Tina and Chris. Thus, he submitted at trial
that the evidence about his lack of mobility (evidence which the
appellant contended included his hospital records) supported the
conclusion that Robert, Tina and Chris were not telling the truth
when they testified that he left the car, walked unaided and
stabbed the deceased.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[57] There is no doubt that the appellant’s mobility was
compromised in July, August and September, 1991. On July 1, 1991,
the appellant sustained a “grade two open book” fractured pelvis
as a result of a car accident. This was about 11½ weeks before
the deceased was stabbed. The fracture was stabilized with screws
and the application of an external pelvic fixator. The fixator
was used to maintain stability and to permit the appellant to be
ambulatory. The fixator was intended to remain in place for about
three months.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[58] On July 8th the appellant was directed to begin walking by
using a walker. By July 17th, he was walking so well that he
attempted to walk without any assistance. He said that he
abandoned this experiment because of leg weakness. He was
discharged from hospital on July 23, 1991. The hospital records
note that he was walking well with the assistance of a walker and
crutches at the time of his discharge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[59] The external fixator was removed on October 1, 1991. The
appellant was instructed to wean himself off crutches on October
16, 1991. By October 29, 1991, he was walking without crutches.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[60] Dr. Rittenhouse, an orthopaedic surgeon who reviewed the
appellant’s hospital medical records, said that patients with a
grade two pelvic fracture (the appellant’s fracture grade) should
be ambulatory in 8 to 12 weeks. He said that the appellant could
have been walking without the assistance of crutches or a walker
within 8 weeks following the surgery. He classified the
appellant’s fracture at the low end of a grade two fracture. He
said that the appellant’s walking limitations were not structural
in the sense that the appellant was capable of walking if he
could withstand the attendant discomfort.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[61] Tina testified that she saw the appellant six or seven times
between the time he moved into the Cyopick farm and the
deceased’s death. She said he sometimes walked with his crutches
and that at other times he walked without them. In the course of
her evidence she demonstrated for the jury how the appellant
appeared as he walked without crutches and with his fixator in
place. She described the appellant leaning forward from the waist
with his legs swinging out to the side as he stepped forward.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[62] Robert testified that the appellant walked leaning
straightforward moving both of his feet in a “kind of comical
walk.”  Chris said that he had seen the appellant walking without
crutches on at least one occasion before the murder.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[63] On the other hand, the appellant, his sister, Darlene Drake
and Earl and Sheila Cyopick said that when they saw the appellant
after his accident and before the stabbing, he was walking only
with the assistance of crutches.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE FRESH EVIDENCE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  Overview</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[64] The appellant seeks to admit fresh evidence. If the fresh
evidence is admissible there must be a new trial: see R. v.
Stolar (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). It makes sense,
therefore, to deal with the fresh evidence issue before I
consider the substantive grounds of appeal raised by the
appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[65] The fresh evidence consists of an affidavit of Beverly Jane
Bacon, sworn on April 30, 1997, and her cross-examination on it.
Ms. Bacon did not give evidence at the appellant’s trial. In
response to Ms. Bacon’s affidavit the Crown tendered the
affidavits of Detectives Joseph Matthews and Paul Bruno.
Detectives Matthews and Bruno were not cross-examined on their
affidavits. We reviewed the proposed fresh evidence and the
Crown’s responding evidence as part of the process of determining
the admissibility of the fresh evidence tendered by the
appellant.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[66] The statutory basis for the admission of fresh evidence is
in s. 683(1)(d) of the Criminal Code:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          683.(1)  For the purpose of an appeal under
          this Part, the court of appeal may, where it
          considers it in the interests of justice,
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          ...
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          (d)  receive the evidence, if tendered, of any witness, 
               including the appellant, who is a competent but
               not compellable witness.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[67] It is well established that the principles guiding the
admission of fresh evidence that concern findings of fact at
trial, as opposed to the validity of the trial process, are:
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     ·    (i)  in deciding whether or not to admit the evidence, the
          court must consider if by due diligence it could have been
          adduced at trial;
·    (ii) the evidence must be relevant and bear upon a decisive,
or potentially decisive, issue in the trial
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iii)     the evidence must be reasonably capable of belief;
          and
     </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iv) the evidence must be such that if believed and
          considered with all of the other evidence it could
          reasonably be expected to have affected the result.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">See R. v. Palmer (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (S.C.C.)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[68] The last three Palmer factors are prerequisites to admission
of fresh evidence: see R. v. M. (P.S.) (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d)
402. The due diligence requirement is not. An absence of due
diligence in the balancing process referred to by Carthy J.A. in
R. v. C.(R.) (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 84 (Ont. C.A.) will not
necessarily lead to the rejection of the proposed fresh evidence
if, in all of the relevant circumstances, it is in the interests
of justice to admit the evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii) The Proposed Fresh Evidence (Ms. Bacon’s Affidavit)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[69] In her affidavit and cross-examination on it, Ms. Bacon said
that she met the appellant in about 1974 and over time Ms. Bacon
developed a close friendship with him. From about 1976 or 1977
the appellant lived periodically at Ms. Bacon’s home. After he
came to live with Ms. Bacon, the appellant, Ms. Bacon and one
Vickery were charged with arson and fraud. Ms. Bacon was
acquitted. The appellant was convicted.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[70] Ms. Bacon said that at early age the appellant’s son Robert
was put in the care of the Children’s Aid Society. When Robert
was 11 or 12, at the appellant’s request, he was placed in Ms.
Bacon’s care. He lived with Ms. Bacon and her husband until he
was 18. Ms. Bacon said that he moved out at that time because he
was not willing to accept authority and he began getting into
trouble.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[71] The core of Ms. Bacon’s proposed fresh evidence concerns
statements allegedly made to her by Robert in September 1991,
after the appellant was arrested and charged with Brian Brady’s
murder. In her affidavit, she stated that on September 23, 1991,
Robert telephoned her and told her that the appellant had been
arrested and charged with Brady’s murder. Robert asked her to
contact the Welland Police to “get him out” because the appellant
“didn’t do it.”  As a result of this telephone call Ms. Bacon
said that she telephoned the Welland Police to inquire about the
appellant. When a police offer asked her how she knew that the
appellant had been arrested, she told him that she had been
informed of the appellant’s arrest by Robert.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[72] Ms. Bacon said that Robert telephoned her again at about
midnight on September 23rd. During that telephone conversation,
he again told her that the appellant “didn’t do it”, and he asked
Ms. Bacon to obtain a lawyer for the appellant. According to
Ms. Bacon, he also told her that Brady had informed him that
Brady had had an affair with Tina, Robert’s wife.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[73] Ms. Bacon stated that the next day, that is September 24th,
she contacted the appellant’s sister Jacklynn Lee, who agreed to
find a lawyer for the appellant. Later that day Ms. Bacon
received a third telephone call from Robert during which he told
her about the murder. Ms. Bacon’s affidavit sets out this part of
the telephone conversation in this way:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          He [Robert] stated that when Brian got out of
          the car to urinate, Chris held Brian while
          Tina stabbed him. Robert stated that he had
          to finish the job and had removed the body
          from the road. Robert told me that he had
          been wearing his father’s jacket and shoes.
          He told me that he had hidden a knife and
          clothes in a dumpster.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Robert further stated to me that Chris had
          deposited the knife in a 45 gallon drum in
          the garage where he was employed. Robert
          stated to me that he, Chris and Tina had
          gathered the clothes and thrown them in a
          dumpster located one or two blocks from
          Robert’s apartment.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[74] Ms. Bacon asked Robert why he had not provided this
information to the police. Robert said that Tina had already
contacted the police and that he thought the police would be
arriving at his apartment shortly. Ms. Bacon assumed at the time
that Robert would tell the truth to the police, that is tell them
that Tina had stabbed the deceased.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[75] Ms. Bacon, in her affidavit, states that on September 25th,
the day after her third telephone conversation with Robert, she
was visited by Detectives Bruno and Matthews who interviewed her
at her residence for about one hour. During this interview she
knew that Detective Matthews was taking notes. Ms. Bacon stated
categorically that she repeated to the detectives what Robert had
said to her about the murder on September 24th, one day before
her police interview.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[76] Ms. Bacon added that from September 1991 until the
appellant’s trial began in October 1992, she received regular
telephone calls from Robert, who, Ms. Bacon said, maintained that
the appellant did not commit the murder.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[77] Ms. Bacon said that in October 1996, that is 4 years after
the appellant’s trial and conviction, Robert was released from
custody on parole. He returned to live in Ms. Bacon’s home. He
lasted for only one week, as a result of getting into a fight
with someone in the house. Ms. Bacon no longer wants to have
anything to do with Robert. She said that that she was “fed up”
with him.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[78] Detectives Bruno and Matthews both filed affidavits in
response to Ms. Bacon’s affidavit. Detective Bruno was the
officer in charge of the investigation into the murder of Brian
Brady. On September 23, 1991, he arrested, and charged the
appellant with first degree murder. Detective Matthews was
Detective Bruno’s partner in the Brady murder investigation.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[79] Detective Bruno stated in his affidavit that on October 3,
1991, he and Detective Matthews interviewed Ms. Bacon “in
furtherance of this investigation.”  The appellant accepts that
the police questioned Ms. Bacon on October 3rd, not on September
25th, the date Ms. Bacon referred to in her affidavit. Detective
Bruno noted in his affidavit that Ms. Bacon had telephoned the
police a few days after Brady’s murder and in the course of that
conversation she told the police that Robert had called her
following the murder and that she wished to confirm some of the
facts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[80] Detectives Bruno and Matthews arrived at Ms. Bacon’s home at
4:00 p.m. on October 3rd. According to both detectives, Ms. Bacon
told them that Robert told her that his father stabbed and cut
the throat of the victim. Ms. Bacon also told the two detective
that Robert told her a denim jacket that belonged to Chris was
covered in blood. She said that Robert said that he had also worn
this jacket.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[81] Both Detectives Bruno and Matthews denied having been told
by Ms. Bacon that Robert had said that Tina stabbed the deceased,
as described in Ms. Bacon’s affidavit. They further denied that
she mentioned anything about the disposal of clothing. Both
police officers stated that the only reference to the disposal of
anything was to a reference to the knife.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[82] Detective Matthews, who took notes during the interview,
stated in his affidavit that the majority of the 30-minute
interview was spent talking about Robert’s criminal activities at
Drag Lake cottages. Detectives Bruno and Matthews both said that
Ms. Bacon told them about a hit and run accident in which Robert
was allegedly involved. I see no need to review this part of the
Crown’s response to Ms. Bacon’s proposed fresh evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[83] Detective Matthews’ affidavit disclosed that during the
conversation at Ms. Bacon’s residence, Ms. Bacon referred to the
deceased as Brian Bartlett. Like Detective Bruno, Detective
Matthews  stated that Ms. Bacon said that Robert told her that
his father had stabbed and cut the throat of Bartlett.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[84] Detective Bruno prepared his own “will say” statement for
the Crown brief at the appellant’s trial. It referred to the
interview with Ms. Bacon. No “will say” statement for Ms. Bacon
was prepared, however, copies of Detective Bruno’s “will say”
statement and his notes in relation to the trip to Haliburton
were included in the disclosure material which was given to the
appellant’s counsel before the preliminary inquiry.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[85] Detective Matthews’ “will say” statement was also included
in the Crown’s brief and in the disclosure material. In his “will
say” statement, Detective Matthews also referred to the meeting
with Ms. Bacon on October 3, 1991. The material given to the
appellant’s defence counsel included Detective Matthews’ notes
made during the Bacon interview.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[86] It is obvious that well before the appellant’s trial, Ms.
Bacon’s existence was known to both the appellant and his trial
counsel, since the disclosure material revealed that two
detectives involved in the murder investigation had interviewed
her. Detective Bruno stated that although there were some
requests for further disclosure from the appellant’s counsel, no
inquiries were made in relation to the police interview with
Ms. Bacon. If the defence wanted further information about Ms.
Bacon’s knowledge of the case, Detectives Bruno and Matthews
would have provided it, if asked.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iii)     The Admissibility of the Fresh Evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[87] It seems to me that had Ms. Bacon told the police officers
that Robert had said that Tina stabbed the deceased as referred
to in Ms. Bacon’s affidavit, Detectives Bruno and Matthews would
have both recalled that significant part of the interview, made a
note of it, and done something about it. Furthermore, Ms. Bacon
made it clear in her cross-examination that she told the
appellant’s sister, Jacklynn Lee, about Robert’s telephone
revelations about the murder. From the appellant’s sister’s
standpoint the critical information from an eyewitness to the
murder was that Tina, not the appellant committed the murder. It
was the appellant’s sister, Jacklynn Lee, who apparently retained
counsel for the appellant. If Ms. Bacon made these significant
disclosures to Ms. Lee, I find it difficult to believe that she
would not have disclosed Ms. Bacon’s revelations about Robert’s
telephone utterances to the appellant’s trial counsel. Jacklynn
Lee was a defence witness at trial and would have been
interviewed before she gave evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[88] In addition, Ms. Bacon said that she confronted Robert after
his alleged telephone disclosure that Tina, not the appellant,
committed the murder. She said that she asked Robert why he had
not told the police what he told her about the murder. Clearly,
Ms. Bacon knew that her friend, the appellant, was charged with a
murder that Robert said, and according to Ms. Bacon continued to
say, he did not commit. It is, to say the least, puzzling that
she sat back and did nothing about Robert’s disclosure, assuming,
of course, that Robert made the disclosure referred to in Ms.
Bacon’s affidavit and cross-examination.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[89] In the course of Robert’s cross-examination, the appellant’s
trial counsel specifically asked him about his conversations with
Ms. Bacon after the appellant was charged with first degree
murder. This would suggest that the defence was aware of some
post-offence telephone dialogue between Robert and Ms. Bacon.
There is no suggestion here that the appellant was incompetently
represented at trial. The fact that defence counsel, who
extensively cross-examined Robert on his prior inconsistent
statements, never referred to Robert’s alleged statement to Ms.
Bacon that Tina stabbed the deceased, would suggest that Ms.
Bacon never told the appellant’s trial counsel that Robert, an
eye witness to the murder, had told her that Tina, not the
appellant, had stabbed the deceased. It is difficult to accept
that the appellant’s trial counsel simply chose to ignore this
alleged prior inconsistent statement. Ms. Bacon’s late blooming
disclosure of Robert’s alleged statements implicating Tina does
not fit comfortably with evidence that is not in dispute.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[90] In the determination of whether the tendered fresh evidence
is reasonably capable of belief, we are required to engage in a
form of credibility assessment. We must determine, not whether we
believe the fresh evidence, rather, we must determine whether the
fresh evidence is “reasonably capable of belief.”  This was the
determining factor in the decision to reject the fresh evidence
in Palmer, supra. In Palmer, McIntyre J. made it clear that if
the proposed fresh evidence does not pass the “reasonably capable
of belief” test, “that ends the matter.”  In my opinion, when
exposed to the required scrutiny, Ms. Bacon’s fresh evidence is
not reasonably capable of belief.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[91] Moreover, as I have said, Robert made a number of prior
inconsistent statements about the murder. The last of them was
his admission to a defence investigator during the trial that
Chris killed the deceased. His alleged statements to Ms. Bacon
that Tina killed the deceased would have constituted one more
entry on a long list of Robert’s prior inconsistent statements,
assuming that, if asked, Robert would have admitting telling
Ms. Bacon that Tina stabbed the deceased.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (iv) Conclusion</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[92] The proposed fresh evidence is relevant; it bears upon
significant trial issues – who killed the deceased and the
credibility of a key witness, Robert Winmill. However, in my
opinion, it fails the due diligence test, is not reasonably
capable of belief, and, if admitted, would not have likely
affected the verdict. I therefore do not think that the fresh
evidence is admissible.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE CHARGE</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (i)  Overview</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[93] In the charge, the trial judge forcefully reminded the jury
that Robert, Tina and Chris had destroyed evidence, manipulated
other evidence and discussed the content of what they would say
to the police. The trial judge bluntly and unequivocally told the
jury that Robert, Tina and Chris were unsavoury witnesses and
that the Crown’s case depended on the jury accepting their
evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[94] The charge was fair. In it the trial judge set out in an
understandable and correct way the constituent elements of
manslaughter and first and second degree murder. He thoroughly,
and in a balanced way, reviewed the evidence. I will deal
separately with the appellant’s submission that the trial judge
did not review alleged inconsistencies in the evidence of Robert,
Tina and Chris and the objectively demonstrable facts.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     (ii)  The Grounds of Appeal</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     1.   The Vetrovec Warning (R. v. Vetrovec, [1982] 1 S.C.R.
811)</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[95] The appellant takes issue with the trial judge’s charge on
the issue of the testimonial trustworthiness of Robert, Tina and
Chris in three respects. First, he submits that the Vetrovec
caution was generally insufficient. Second, he submits that the
trial judge should have directed the jury that the evidence of
any one of the three unsavoury witnesses could not provide
support for the evidence of either of the other unsavoury
witnesses. Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge
should have instructed the jury that evidence that could, in law,
provide support for the evidence of any of Robert, Tina and Chris
“... ought to be independent evidence implicating the accused,
capable of inducing a rational belief that the witness was
telling the truth.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[96] The case that had to be considered by the jury was not
complicated in the sense that the jury’s determination of what
happened on the isolated dirt road where the deceased was killed
depended on the jury’s determination of the credibility of
Robert, Tina and Chris. Had the jury had a reasonable doubt about
their evidence (and here I refer to them collectively), the
appellant would have been acquitted. It is apparent that, in
convicting the appellant of first degree murder, the jury
accepted the evidence of the three unsavoury witnesses that the
appellant stabbed the deceased and that well before he did so, he
announced his intention to kill the deceased. It must have been
this latter evidence that led the jury to conclude that the
murder was planned and deliberate.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[97] The sufficiency of the Vetrovec caution cannot reasonably be
assessed by an isolated review of that part of the charge that
one can identify as the “Vetrovec warning.”  That is to say, the
charge must be read as a whole. The Vetrovec warning is a special
part of the charge on credibility. Thus, I will first consider
how the trial judge dealt with that issue in the charge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[98] At the very outset of the charge the trial judge told the
jury not to be distracted by side issues and he alerted the jury
to the core question, “whether the Crown has proved to you beyond
a reasonable doubt that the accused caused the death of Brian
Brady in such circumstances as amounting to first degree murder.
That is the issue.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[99] After making it clear in his charge that the jury was
responsible for making all findings of fact, the trial judge then
explained the presumption of innocence and the requirement that
the Crown was required to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond
a reasonable doubt before he could be convicted. It was against
that background that the trial judge turned to consider the issue
of credibility generally. His charge on credibility extends over
19 transcript pages. No issue was, or is, taken to the trial
judge’s wide-ranging general instructions on credibility. This
part of the charge would have highlighted what the jury already
knew – the Crown’s case depended on the credibility of Robert,
Tina and Chris.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[100]     In the course of his general instructions on
credibility, the trial judge observed that having seen and heard
the witnesses the jury might well be inclined to believe some
witnesses without much hesitation, but that they would require
confirmation of the evidence of other witnesses before accepting
their evidence. He put it rhetorically, but clearly, in this way:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          You are the sole judges of the facts so it is
          for you to say. But it seems to me when you
          listen to and watch a witness you form an
          impression. You have a reaction. You get a
          certain flavour. Your reaction may be, “I
          would believe him. I would believe if he told
          me the moon is made of cheese”. Or your
          reaction may be, “If he said today was
          Wednesday, I would want to see at least two
          calendars”.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[101]     The trial judge directed the jury to be mindful of
inconsistencies in the evidence of a witness when that evidence
was compared with the evidence of other witnesses that the jury
accepted. He also directed the jury that the fact that a witness
had made a prior inconsistent statement was something the jury
should take into account in its assessment of the witness’s
credibility. When he dealt with the issue of criminal records he
instructed the jury that the fact that a witness had a criminal
record was something that the jury could also take into account
in assessing that witness’s credibility.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[102]     Robert, Tina and Chris were all cross-examined on prior
inconsistent statements that they admitted making. They were also
all extensively cross-examined on false or incomplete statements
that they admitted giving to the police, and in Robert’s case,
others. Robert and Tina had extensive criminal records. Thus,
before the trial judge got to the point in his charge where he
gave his Vetrovec caution, the jury would have known that there
were a number of reasons to question their credibility. In
addition, the differences in their evidence about events
surrounding the stabbing, an issue emphasized by the appellant’s
trial counsel, would have been apparent to the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[103]     It was after his review of the evidence of Robert, Tina
and Chris that the trial judge gave the jury what the Crowns
submits was a clear, sharp, Vetrovec warning. His lead-in to this
part of his charge was a reference to “unsavoury witnesses”. By
way of preliminary explanation, he restated the obvious -- “...
you are no doubt aware that credibility is a very important issue
in this trial ...”.  He then directed the jury to consider
whether any of Robert, Tina or Chris “...was biased or prejudiced
and whether any of them had anything to gain by giving evidence,
a factor which lead him or her to guild his evidence or commit
perjury; in other words, tell lies.”  He reminded the jury at
this point in this charge that Robert and Tina had criminal
records and that Tina was facing outstanding criminal charges. He
then further explained why Robert, Tina and Chris’ evidence
should be exposed to special scrutiny. His comments about Robert,
Tina and Chris’ credibility were in addition to his extensive
general instructions on credibility. He said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Now, you are no doubt aware that credibility
          is a very important issue in this trial and
          you are the sole judges of the credibility of
          the witnesses. The witnesses Rob, Tina and
          Chris were, by their own evidence, each at
          the scene at the time, at the time of the
          incident. You will have to decide whether any
          of those three witnesses was or were biased
          or prejudiced and whether any of them had
          anything to gain by giving evidence, a factor
          which might lead him or her to guild his
          evidence or commit perjury; in other words,
          tell lies. Rob and Tina have criminal records
          and Tina has outstanding charges not related
          to this case. Did Tina lie to get a benefit,
          hoping that the outstanding charges would not
          be proceeded with or that there would be no
          charges arising out of this incident?  Did
          Rob lie, hoping that there would be no
          charges laid against him arising out of this
          case? ... Did Chris the one who admittedly
          had sexual relations with Rob’s wife not many
          hours before the incident, have any similar
          reason to lie?  He knowingly had improper
          license plates on his motor vehicle.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[104]     Then, the trial judge told the jury to carefully
scrutinize the evidence of each of Robert, Tina and Chris and to
look for supporting evidence before relying on it to convict the
appellant. He said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Scrutinize the evidence of each of the three
          very carefully. Does it dovetail with the
          other evidence that you believe?  It would be
          wise for you to look for other supporting
          evidence before convicting the accused.
          Bearing in mind that the burden is on the
          Crown to prove guilt beyond a reasonable
          doubt and bearing in mind all of the other
          evidence, do you find Rob’s evidence
          reliable?  Does it have a ring of truth?  Do
          you find Tina’s evidence reliable; does it
          have a ring of truth?  Do you find Chris’
          evidence reliable; does it have a ring of
          truth? [Emphasis added.]
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[105]     After giving his Vetrovec warning, the trial judge
reviewed the defence position with respect to Robert, Tina and
Chris. In that review, he explained further why their evidence
should attract special scrutiny:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          All three of them are manipulators because
          all three changed, at one time their stories
          to the police. Tina, Chris and Rob all have
          motives to lie, so that they would not be
          charged in connection with the incident. The
          defence would say that perhaps the three,
          Tina, Chris and Rob, committed the act... .
          All three had time to concoct stories ... It
          is the position of the defence that you
          cannot rely on anything that Tina, Chris or
          Rob had said. There were lies, there was
          destruction of evidence, and that must create
          a reasonable doubt in your minds as to the
          guilt of the accused and you should find him
          not guilty.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[106]     Defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Greenspan) objected
to the Vetrovec part of the charge. He sought to have the trial
judge tell the jury that Robert, Tina and Chris “were
discreditable witnesses of demonstrated moral lapse.”  The trial
judge quickly reminded the appellant’s trial counsel that he had
given counsel an advance copy of his proposed Vetrovec charge and
counsel had approved it. In any case, it is clear that the three
witnesses in question were clearly identified in the charge as
unsavoury witnesses and the trial judge explained why these
witnesses were characterized in that way. There was no merit in
defence counsel’s objection and the trial judge was correct in
not giving effect to it. Apart from this, the appellant’s trial
counsel took no issue with the Vetrovec charge.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[107]     Immediately following the trial judge’s Vetrovec
warning with respect to the evidence of Robert, Tina and Chris,
he instructed the jury in accordance with Cory J.’s judgment in
R. v. W.(D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.). In the course
of this part of the charge, he reminded the jury that if, after a
consideration of all of the evidence, the jury was unable to
decide who to believe, the jury must return a verdict of not
guilty.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[108]     If it was not clear to the jury before the charge, it
would have been clear when they retired to deliberate that they
should give special consideration to the credibility of Robert,
Tina and Chris and to the reliability of their evidence. The
direction given by the trial judge in respect of Robert, Tina and
Chris’ evidence clearly set them apart from the other witnesses.
The trial judge directed the jury to scrutinize their evidence
very carefully and to look for evidence that would support their
version of events, before relying on their evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[109]     The trial judge did not review the evidence which, if
accepted, could have supported Robert, Tina and Chris’ evidence.
In their closing submissions, Crown and defence counsel both
referred to some of the evidence from that standpoint.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[110]     Although the blood evidence is somewhat confusing, it
seems to me that the presence of the identified blood on the
appellant’s jeans that is consistent with the blood type of the
deceased and a blood type that is found in only 3.2% of the
population is some evidence that could link the appellant to the
deceased or the knife and thus lend some support to the unsavoury
witness’s evidence. In any case, the trial judge’s review of the
blood evidence, including his review of it in response to the
jury’s question, accurately reflected the expert’s evidence and,
I note, no objection was taken to that part of the charge by
trial counsel.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[111]     In addition, there was other evidence that could
support the evidence of each of Robert, Tina and Chris. For
example, the appellant admitted that he was in the bathroom with
Tina when she was in the shower. They differed as to what the
appellant said when he was there. Finding Chris’ knife in the
drum is confirmatory of and consistent with Chris’ evidence about
the knife.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[112]     The sufficiency of a Vetrovec warning must be assessed
in the context of its purpose.  Dickson J. made it clear in
Vetrovec that the purpose of requiring a clear sharp warning is
to alert the jury to the danger of relying on the evidence of a
witness who for any reason is untrustworthy. The purpose of the
direction to look for supporting evidence is to determine if
there is evidence that would enhance the witness’s
trustworthiness.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[113]     Since Vetrovec the emphasis for purposes of a special
warning is on the untrustworthiness of the witness. We have
stopped slotting witnesses into particular categories. For
example, we are no longer concerned with the issue whether a
witness is an “accomplice”. The idea is to set apart those
witnesses who may, for any reason, be untrustworthy. It is for
the trial judge to determine whether a particular witness’s
evidence will attract a Vetrovec warning. Not all witnesses whose
credibility is in issue will attract such a warning.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[114]     The changes brought about by Vetrovec have resulted in
a simplified, common sense process that permits a duly warned
jury to consider the credibility of an untrustworthy witness
without the trial judge determining what, if any, evidence is
capable of “corroborating” the untrustworthy witness’s evidence.
This change proceeds on the assumption that the jury is competent
to weigh the evidence of all witnesses, including untrustworthy
witnesses who are significant to the Crown case, to determine
what if any part of their evidence the jury will accept:  see R.
v. B.(G.) (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (S.C.C.).</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[115]     On a common sense basis, the jury should be directed to
look for any evidence which the jury accepts, that would cause
the jury to reasonably conclude that the untrustworthy witness is
telling the truth. That evidence does not have to implicate the
accused:  this relic pertaining to the law of corroboration was
jettisoned in Vetrovec. Supporting evidence could come from
another untrustworthy witness, if the duly cautioned jury chooses
to believe it. That is to say, it is for the jury to determine
whether the evidence of one unsavoury witness can provide support
for the evidence of another. If there are circumstances such as
collaboration among the Vetrovec witnesses, the jury should be
alerted to that fact which will obviously militate against using
the evidence of one unsavoury witness to support the evidence of
another. It is for the jury to determine whether an untrustworthy
witness’s evidence is so compromised by collaboration that it
could not reasonably be used to support the evidence of another
untrustworthy witness. The final credibility call is, I
emphasize, for the jury.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[116]     Had the jury concluded that the evidence of Robert,
Tina and Chris was fatally compromised by collaboration, it would
as a matter of common sense follow that the evidence of any one
of them could not be used to provide support for the evidence of
either of the others. As I have said, this is a matter that
should be left to the jury to determine.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[117]     In my opinion, the Vetrovec charge was sufficient. The
jury was directed by clear language to expose the evidence of
Robert, Tina and Chris to special scrutiny. The trial judge
reminded the jury that they discussed what they would say to the
police and that each of them had made false statements to the
police. Consistent with Vetrovec, it was for the jury to
determine whether the evidence of any of Robert, Tina and Chris
was compromised by a desire to protect themselves, or by their
discussions about what they would say, and did say, to the
police. The jury was duly warned about the danger of accepting
their evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[118]     It was not necessary, in the circumstances, for the
trial judge to review evidence that might have supported the
evidence of Robert, Tina or Chris:  see R. v. Bevan (1993), 82
C.C.C. (3d) 310. Moreover, the appellant’s defence counsel did
not ask the trial judge to review the evidence that could have
supported the three unsavoury witnesses’ evidence. In any case, a
review of evidence that could support the evidence of Robert,
Tina and Chris would have enured to the benefit of the Crown. In
Bevan, Major J. also emphasized that the trial judge’s decision
to review, or not review, evidence that might support an
untrustworthy witness’s evidence “... should not be lightly
interfered with on appeal.”</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[119]     The defence position at trial was clear – the evidence
of any one of Robert, Tina or Chris could not provide support for
either of the other two witnesses. Defence counsel put it this
way in his closing submission:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The judge will tell you that in accordance
          with our law, if you get a witness like that
          [an untrustworthy witness] you have to be
          careful before you accept his evidence. It
          would be nice if there was something to
          confirm their evidence. You can’t confirm
          each other. You can’t say, Well, I have three
          liars, but each of them say the same lie so
          I’m going to believe them. [Emphasis added.]
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[120]     I am not prepared to hold that the evidence of one
unsavoury witness cannot provide support for the evidence of
another. See R. v. Walzak (1988), 225 A.P.R. 89 (N.S.S.C. (App.
Div.)). Such an inflexible rule would be inconsistent with
Vetrovec, supra, and Bevan, supra. The jury was very much aware
that Robert, Tina and Chris to some degree collaborated before
they first spoke to the police. Indeed, their credibility was
challenged at both ends of the spectrum during their cross-
examination and in defence counsel’s closing submissions. On the
one hand, it was suggested that they had jointly discussed their
versions of events and that that explained the structural
similarity in their evidence. On the other hand, each of them was
attacked on the basis of inconsistencies in his or her evidence
when it was compared with the evidence of the other two unsavoury
witnesses.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[121]     I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. The
Vetrovec charge was sufficient.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">     2. The Trial Judge’s Review of Inconsistencies in the
Evidence</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[122]     The appellant contends that the trial judge’s review of
the evidence was insufficient in that the charge did not set out,
or adequately emphasize, inconsistencies between the evidence of
Robert, Tina and Chris and the objectively demonstrably facts.
This submission was particularly directed to the appellant’s
mobility at the time of the stabbing and the blood evidence.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[123]     In R. v. Jacquard, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, Lamer C.J.
advocated a functional approach to the appellate review of jury
charges. He said, at p. 326:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          In many cases, a trial judge need only review
          relevant evidence once and has no duty to
          review the evidence in a case in relation to
          every essential issue. See John v. The Queen,
          [1971] S.C.R. 781, Cluett v. The Queen,
          [1985] 2 S.C.R. 216. As long as an appellate
          court, when looking at the trial judge’s
          charge to the jury as a whole, concludes that
          the jury was left with a sufficient
          understanding of the facts as they relate to
          the relevant issues the charge is proper.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[124]     The trial judge dealt extensively with the appellant’s
mobility in his charge. He drew the jury’s attention to this
issue relatively early in the charge:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          Whether he walked with or without crutches or
          aids or in a wheelchair and that sort of
          thing. I will be making reference to it, but
          you might tune yourself into that because
          from what you have heard from addresses of
          counsel this morning that is considered to be
          important evidence as to whether or not he
          was mobile without aids.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[125]     The trial judge returned to this issue when he reviewed
the position of the defence. At that point in his charge he said:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          The defence makes reference to the physical
          disabilities of the accused and point[s] out
          that it is only the three witnesses, Tina,
          Chris and Rob, who say that he could walk
          without crutches. There are other witnesses
          who say that he could not walk without
          crutches and those witnesses should be
          believed. ... The defence would say that
          there should be a reasonable doubt in your
          minds as to whether the accused could walk
          across the road as it has been said. And,
          with that reasonable doubt in your mind, you
          should find the accused not guilty.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          When Rob wheeled the accused to the bonfire,
          the accused had no shoes on. And the defence
          would ask, does that mean that Rob did not
          think that the accused could walk at all, had
          no need for shoes?  It is the position of the
          defence that Doctor Rittenhouse’s evidence is
          not reliable because he never treated or saw
          the accused and that the doctor did not take
          into consideration the difficulty that the
          accused was having with the swelling at the
          base of his spine.
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[126]     The trial judge also referred to the hospital and
detention centre records, both of which were silent on the issue
whether the appellant was capable of walking without assistance.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[127]     As I have said, there was conflicting evidence about
the appellant’s mobility. The medical evidence does not support
the proposition that the appellant was unable to walk without
assistance, that is without crutches or a walker. I do not think
that the trial judge was required to do more than he did in his
charge in dealing with this issue. In my view, he fairly reviewed
the evidence of all of the witnesses including those who
testified about the appellant’s mobility. He set out for the jury
the Crown and defence positions on this issue.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[128]     The appellate also submits that the trial judge’s
review of the blood evidence was inadequate. The defence position
on this issue was that the only blood in the car would, on the
evidence of Robert, Tina and Chris, be the deceased’s blood.
Assuming this to be accurate, the trial judge reviewed the blood
evidence and his review included the reference to the evidence of
Ms. Johnston who said that there was blood in the car that was
not the deceased’s. He also reminded the jury that Chris said
that he placed the knife that the appellant used to stab the
deceased on the floor mat of the car.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[129]     In my view, the jury would have understood the
significance of all of the issues, including the appellant’s
mobility and the importance of the blood evidence. The trial
judge’s review of the evidence, including inconsistencies in the
evidence, was sufficient. I see no merit in this ground of
appeal.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">THE EVIDENCE OF THE APPELLANT’S WORK HISTORY AS A BUTCHER</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[130]     Tina testified that after the stabbing the appellant
said that “he knew how to do it because he was a butcher before.”
Assuming this statement was made (and that was an issue for the
jury to determine in their assessment of the credibility of Tina
and the appellant) the reference was clearly to the appellant
having a certain skill level with a knife that permitted him to
somewhat efficiently dispatch the deceased on September 22, 1991.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[131]     The appellant contends that Tina’s statement about the
appellant’s utterance and the evidence of Mr. Vander Meer
confirming the appellant’s work history as a butcher was
inadmissible since it had minimal probative value and high
prejudicial value.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[132]     In my opinion, when the circumstances of the stabbing
are coupled with the evidence of the appellant’s boast that he
knew how to do it because he was a butcher and his statement
after he first stabbed the deceased that the deceased was going
to die anyway because he had stabbed him in the spleen, I think
that this evidence had probative value and was admissible. In any
case, as the trial unfolded the evidence about the accused’s work
history as a butcher did not appear to play a major part. It was
not referred to by either Crown or defence counsel in their
closing submissions; it was referred to in the trial judge’s
charge only in the context of the appellant’s statement, as
referred to in Tina’s evidence, that he knew how to stab the
deceased. I am satisfied that if the evidence was inadmissible,
its admission occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice under s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">CONCLUSION</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[133]     The jury had the enormous advantage of seeing and
hearing all of the witnesses, particularly the three witnesses
aptly characterized as unsavoury. In my view, the charge,
including the Vetrovec warning, was both fair and sufficient. As
was their right as judges of the facts, the jury manifestly chose
to accept the evidence of the three unsavoury witnesses to the
exclusion of a reasonable doubt. The jury was entitled to reach
this conclusion. In my view, the trial judge comprehensively
reviewed the evidence of the positions of the parties. I would
dismiss the appeal.
