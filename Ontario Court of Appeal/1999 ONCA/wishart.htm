    <pre>HEARD:         June 11, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Dambrot dated June 12, 1997.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]        This is an appeal from a conviction for conspiracy  to
traffic  in  heroin, contrary to s.4(1) of the  Narcotic  Control
Act,  R.S.C.  1985, c. N-1.  The appellant alleges  the  evidence
was  insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he  had
knowledge  that  six wooden deer shipped from Thailand  contained
heroin.   He  contends that the trial judge was not justified  in
drawing   an  inference  of  knowledge  from  the  circumstantial
evidence  of his conduct subsequent to picking up the  deer,  and
absent  that  inference,  an essential  element  of  the  offence
remains unproven.  Essentially, the appellant&#146;s argument is  that
the  verdict  is  unreasonable.  We are not  persuaded  that  the
inference   drawn  by  the  trial  judge  or  the   verdict   was
unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS
[2]     The  appellant  picked up the deer from  his  co-accused,
Hughes,  after  three previous failed attempts  by  the  RCMP  to
execute  a  controlled delivery.  After picking up the deer,  the
appellant  drove  to  Yorkdale shopping  centre,  taking  a  very
circuitous route. Police maintained surveillance.  The  appellant
parked  his  van  at  the shopping centre  and  left  by  subway.
Approximately  three hours later he returned.  He approached  one
of  the drivers of the surveillance vehicles and asked him if  he
was a police officer.  The officer said he was not.</pre>
    <pre>[3]     The next day at 10:00 a.m. a tow truck arrived and  towed
the   van  to  a  different  parking  lot.   The  appellant  then
approached a taxi driver and asked him to take the van  keys,  go
to  the  lot, retrieve the boxes containing the wooden  deer  and
deliver  them  to Shab Decorative and Tribal Art.  The  appellant
then  telephoned the owner of the art shop, Ghavamian, and  asked
for   an  appraisal  of  the  Chinese  artifacts  he  was  having
delivered.   Ghavamian appraised the deer as reproductions  worth
approximately  $40  -  $50 each.  When the appellant  telephoned,
Ghavamian  informed him of the value of the deer.  The  appellant
told  him that the owner wanted $500 each for the deer.   A  half
hour  later the appellant arrived at the shop in a different van,
picked up the deer and haphazardly threw them in the back of  the
van.</pre>
    <pre>[4]     When the appellant drove off he was speeding, making many
turns, and generally driving erratically.  The police decided  to
arrest him, and did so.  They recovered the deer from the back of
the van.</pre>
    <pre>[5]     The appellant maintained in his testimony that the reason
he was so conscious of surveillance, and took such pains to evade
police, was because he was afraid the deer were stolen.  He  said
that  he  is  a &#147;picker&#148; who buys and sells goods for profit  and
that  50%  of the goods he sells are stolen.  He had a record  of
two  convictions for possession of illicit cigarettes and  liquor
and an outstanding fine of $15,000.</pre>
    <pre>[6]      The  trial judge disbelieved the appellant&#146;s explanation
for his erratic behaviour and driving, and convicted him.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION
[7]      The appellant contends that the trial judge erred in his
findings  of credibility and in inferring the appellant knew  the
wooden deer contained heroin.  To succeed on this submission, the
appellant  must show the verdict was unreasonable.  In our  view,
he  has  not done so:  see: R. v. W. (R.) (1992), 74 C.C.C.  (3d)
417.</pre>
    <pre>[8]    The  trial  judge was entitled to reject  the  appellant&#146;s
version  of events .  Having done so, he then correctly  directed
himself to consider whether the Crown had proved its case  beyond
a  reasonable doubt.  He was satisfied, on the evidence, that the
Crown  had met its burden with respect to the key issue  in  this
appeal:  knowledge.  In our view, the trial judge was  reasonably
entitled  to  infer  from  the  evidence  he  accepted  that  the
appellant&#146;s  conduct was consistent with guilt  and  inconsistent
with innocence.  Accordingly, there is no basis for this court to
interfere with the verdict.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION
[9]   The appeal is therefore dismissed.</pre>
