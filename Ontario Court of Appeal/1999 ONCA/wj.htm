           (Defendants/Appellants)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:    ROSENBERG, FELDMAN and MacPHERSON JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:   Neil Kotnala,
           for the appellant Emblematic Jewellery Products of Canada Inc.</pre>
    <pre>           Mark Shields,
           for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:     November 30, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice D. R. McDermid dated
April 26, 1999</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   In our view, this appeal must succeed.  Once the action had
been  settled, the plaintiff was not entitled to move to  enforce
the  settlement without notice.  In any event, we  think  it  was
imprudent for counsel for the respondent to proceed in St. Thomas
without  giving  proper  notice  to  the  appellants  given   the
following circumstances:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.    The motion when originally filed in February 1998  was
brought on notice.
2.   On April 3, 1998, Hockin J. held that the test set out in
Rule 37.03 for leave to bring the motion in St. Thomas had not
been met in relation to the two motions in the two other files
that sought the same relief.
3.   Following the April 3, 1998 hearing, the two solicitors had
continued to deal with each other and had resolved virtually all
of the outstanding issues.
4.   In view of his letter of June 15, 1998, the solicitor for
the appellants might fairly and reasonably assume that, unless he
heard otherwise from the respondent's solicitor, the issues had
been resolved and nothing further would be done in relation to
the adjourned motion.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[2]   We  cannot  leave this case without making some  additional
comments.   The solicitors (not counsel who appeared  before  us)
must  both share some of the blame for what occurred here.  While
the solicitor for the respondent should not have employed Rule 19
in   the   circumstances  nor  proceeded  on  the  motion  before
Misener  J. without giving proper notice, the position  taken  by
counsel for the appellant in his March 6, 1998 letter that he was
technically  not on the record was also not helpful.   Solicitors
should  be  reminded  of  their  professional  obligations  under
Rule 14 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.
[3]  While we are very concerned that these proceedings have
resulted in unnecessary costs to the parties, we are not
persuaded that this is a proper case for solicitor-client costs
or that those costs should be paid by the solicitor personally.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the order of McDermid J.
is set aside, and an order will go setting aside the order of
Misener J. dated July 13, 1998.  The appellants are entitled to
their costs of the appeal and the costs before McDermid J.  There
will be no costs of the motion before Misener J.
