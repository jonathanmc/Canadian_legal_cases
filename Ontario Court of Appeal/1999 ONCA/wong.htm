</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns the liability of a real estate agent
and a lawyer for failing to negotiate for their clients, the
purchasers of a commercial building, security for a warranty on
rental income given by the vendor, a numbered Ontario company.
The real estate agent, Calvin Liang, drafted the agreement of
purchase and sale.  After the agreement was signed the lawyer,
Henry Hui, was retained to close the transaction.  The trial
judge, Gotlib J., found both Liang and his employer Phoenix Real
Estate Limited,  and Hui and his law firm Hui, Hune &amp; Wong liable
in negligence.  She awarded damages against them under the
warranty for the shortfall in rental income.1  Both Phoenix and
Hui, Hune &amp; Wong appeal against liability and damages.</pre>
    <pre>     FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In 1988 the real estate market in Ontario was &#147;white hot.&#148;
The respondents Peter Wong, his wife Jenny Wang, and his business
partner Peter Chan, were looking to buy a commercial property.
They were given a promotional brochure on a two storey commercial
and residential building  in Mississauga by Liang, who was then
working for Phoenix.  The brochure had an asking price of
$990,000 for the property, a listing of tenants (7 residential
and 6 commercial), the rent each paid, and a representation that
the vendor 407527 Ontario Ltd. (&#147;407527&#148;) would guarantee the
rents for the first year.
[3]  In late January, 1988, Peter Wong entered into an agreement
of purchase and sale for himself, his wife, Peter Chan and Chan&#146;s
son Johnny (who did not participate in the litigation) to buy the
property from 407527 for $975,000.  Liang drafted the agreement
of purchase and sale and included in it a clause warranting that
the gross rental income from the property for the year after
closing would be $120,909.36.  The warranty provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Vendor agrees to warrant existing gross income is no less
          than $120,909.36 as per RENTAL INCOME SCHEDULE in appendices A,
          B, and C and this warranty shall survive Closing date, and also
          for one (1) year thereafter upon successful completion of this
          transaction and provide true copies of Leases to verify income is
          true and correct.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The judge held that although the warranty was badly drafted,
it was nonetheless effective against the vendor.
[5]  After the agreement had been signed Wong took it to Hui to
close the transaction, which Hui did.  The closing took place on
March 23, 1988.  The respondents arranged their own financing,
which included a $750,000 first mortgage to the Hong Kong Bank of
Canada.  In the year following the closing the respondents lost
rental income.   Some tenants vacated; some didn&#146;t pay rent; and
others paid with NSF cheques.
[6]  The respondents sued their real estate agent, their lawyer,
the vendor 407527 and its principal Steve Curic. They claimed for
a loss in the value of the property and damages under the
warranty on rent.  Both 407527 and Curic were noted in default
and neither defended the action.
[7]  The trial judge found the respondents&#146; allegation that the
property had fallen in value after closing to be &#147;outrageous&#148; and
she dismissed that claim. Indeed, in the fall of 1989, the
respondents had listed the property for sale at $1,880,000 and
had rejected an offer to purchase of $1,500,000 because it was
too low.
[8]  However, the trial judge found for the respondents on their
claim for damages under the warranty on rent.  She held the
vendor 407527 liable for breach of warranty.  She also held Liang
and Hui liable in negligence for failing to protect their
clients&#146; interests, mainly by failing to obtain security for the
warranty.  Phoenix was held liable, vicariously, for the
negligence of its employee Liang and the law firm was similarly
held liable for the negligence of Hui.
[9]  The trial judge found that although Peter Wong, Jenny Wang
and Peter Chan had extensive business experience in the textile
industry, in marketing, importing, exporting and manufacturing,
they were unsophisticated in acquiring commercial real estate in
Canada, having never done so before, and that &#147;they relied
entirely on professionals who let them down.&#148;  She awarded the
respondents damages of $73,987.22, made up of $62,000 for loss of
rental income in the year after closing and $11,987.22 for legal
fees in trying to collect unpaid rents.  She held that because
the vendor was primarily responsible for the respondents&#146; losses
they first had to try to recover their judgment from 407527.
However, because both 407527 and Curic subsequently declared
bankruptcy, the trial judge granted judgment against Liang,
Phoenix and Hui, Hune &amp; Wong.
[10] In this court both Phoenix and Hui, Hune &amp; Wong submit that
the trial judge erred in her findings of negligence and, in the
alternative, in her award of damages.  I would allow Phoenix&#146;s
appeal in part by awarding the respondents only 20% of the loss
found by the trial judge.  I would allow Hui, Hune &amp; Wong&#146;s
appeal and would dismiss the action against the law firm.</pre>
    <pre>     THE LIABILITY OF LIANG AND PHOENIX</pre>
    <pre>[11] Calvin Liang had been a licenced real estate agent since
1984.  After he was licensed he began working for Phoenix, but he
resigned in 1989.  By the time of trial he was living in the
Dominican Republic.  Although he did not testify at trial,
portions of his examination for discovery were read in as part of
the respondents&#146; case.  Phoenix, which was Liang&#146;s employer and
vicariously liable for his conduct on this transaction, did not
call a defence.
[12] Although Liang was the selling agent on the transaction, he
acted for the respondents.  He was to receive 70% of the selling
broker&#146;s commission and Phoenix was to receive the remaining 30%.
The listing agent, who acted for the vendor, told Liang about the
property and gave him the promotional brochure, which Liang later
gave to the respondents.  When the respondents decided to make an
offer on the property, Liang alone drafted the agreement of
purchase and sale.  He included the vendor&#146;s warranty of gross
rental income, not because the respondents had requested it, but
because the brochure said the vendor would guarantee the rental
income from the building for a year.
[13] The trial judge found that this was the first or second
commercial transaction on which Liang had acted as agent and that
&#147;he was inexperienced in drafting the necessary contracts.&#148;
Still, though she found that &#147;the warranty clause left much to be
desired&#148;, she held it &#147;sufficient to be effective&#148;.  But she
found Liang negligent (and therefore Phoenix liable) on two other
grounds: first, &#150; &#147;his greatest failure&#148; &#150; he failed &#147;to protect
the purchasers&#146; interest by securing either a personal guarantee
or some form of security that is either a holdback on closing or
a vendor take back mortgage with provisions for a right of set
off if the rents failed to be as represented by the vendor&#148;; and,
second, &#147;he was negligent in not seeking advice and in failing to
suggest to the purchasers that legal advice be obtained before
the offer was signed.&#148;  In so finding, the trial judge implicitly
accepted the opinion evidence of the respondents&#146; real estate
expert, Barry Lebow.
[14] Phoenix attacks the trial judge&#146;s findings of negligence on
four grounds.  First, it submits that the trial judge erred in
relying on the opinion evidence of Lebow; second, it submits that
the trial judge should not have found Liang negligent for failing
to tell the respondents to get legal advice before signing the
offer because during the course of the trial she had refused to
allow the respondents to amend their claim to plead that ground
of negligence; third, Phoenix submits that Liang had no duty to
obtain security for the rental income warranty; and fourth, it
submits that even if Liang had a duty to try to obtain security,
his failure to do so did not cause the respondents&#146; loss.  In the
alternative, Phoenix submits that the rental income loss awarded
by the trial judge is not supportable, both because the
respondents failed to prove this loss and because the trial judge
erroneously held that the respondents had no duty to mitigate.
[15] In addition to supporting the trial judge&#146;s findings, the
respondents take the position that Phoenix cannot dispute the
finding of negligence against Liang, because Liang has not
appealed the judgment against him.  Phoenix&#146;s liability is solely
vicarious and on appeal, as at trial, it accepted that it is
vicariously liable for Liang&#146;s actions.  The respondents
therefore argue that Phoenix is barred from questioning Liang&#146;s
liability on appeal because his liability is a matter solely
between him and the respondents.  I disagree.
[16] Persons who are vicariously liable do not themselves breach
any duty nor does their conduct make them liable.  Instead, the
tort of another is imputed to them.  An employer is vicariously
liable for the acts of its employee because the employer is in
charge of the employee and is considered to have authorized the
employee&#146;s acts. In the eyes of the law, the acts of the employee
are the acts of the employer.2  In this case because the acts of
Liang are viewed as the acts of Phoenix, in my opinion Phoenix
retains the right to challenge the underlying finding of
negligence against Liang.  Moreover, I think it impractical to
hold otherwise.  Invariably an employee will be covered by an
employer&#146;s insurance and may have little interest or incentive to
appeal an adverse judgment.  The employer should still be
entitled to dispute the employee&#146;s negligence.  Thus, Phoenix can
maintain its appeal. I now consider its submissions.
</pre>
    <pre>       (i)  Lebow&#146;s Opinion Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[17] Barry Lebow was called as an expert witness by the
respondents.  He had been a real estate broker and an appraiser
of commercial property for about 20 years. He had also been a
certified teacher for the Toronto Real Estate Association and an
arbitrator for the Toronto Real Estate Board.  After he was cross-
examined on his qualifications, the trial judge held that he was
qualified to give opinion evidence in two areas: the value of
rental income producing properties and the standard of care
required of real estate agents.
[18] Phoenix submits that although Lebow was qualified as an
expert his opinion should have been given little or no weight
because he testified only about what he would have done had he
been in Liang&#146;s position, not about what a reasonably competent
real estate agent should have done.  In making this distinction
Phoenix relies on the judgment  of Oliver J. in Midland Bank
Trust Co. Ltd. et al. v. Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp3 a solicitor&#146;s
negligence case:
          </pre>
    <pre>               But evidence which really amounts to no more than an
          expression of opinion by a particular practitioner of what he
          thinks that he would have done had he been placed, hypothetically
          and without the benefit of hindsight, in the position of the
          defendants, is of little assistance to the court;&#133;but I think
          that the court must beware of imposing upon solicitors &#150; or upon
          professional men in other spheres &#150; duties which go beyond the
          scope of what they are requested and undertake to do.  It may be
          that a particularly meticulous and conscientious practitioner
          would, in his client&#146;s general interests, take it upon himself to
          pursue a line of inquiry beyond the strict limits comprehended by
          his instructions. But that is not the test.  The test is what the
          reasonably competent practitioner would do having regard to the
          standards normally adopted in his profession, &#133; .</pre>
    <pre>[19] The distinction made by Oliver J. is valid but Lebow&#146;s
testimony does not support Phoenix&#146;s contention.  Throughout his
examination-in-chief, Lebow testified not about what he would
have done but about what a &#147;knowledgeable real estate agent
should have done.&#148;  I would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>          (ii) The Trial Judge&#146;s Refusal to Permit the
          Respondents to Amend their Claim</pre>
    <pre>[20] The second ground of negligence found by the trial judge &#150;
Liang&#146;s failure to seek advice or failure to suggest to the
respondents that they see a lawyer before signing the offer &#150; was
not pleaded by the respondents in their statement of claim.  On
the third day of trial, during Wong&#146;s examination, the
respondents asked to amend their claim to plead additional
grounds of negligence against Liang, including an allegation that
he did not consult a more experienced agent or advise the
respondents to get legal advice.  The trial judge refused this
amendment on the ground Phoenix would be prejudiced by it because
of Liang&#146;s unavailability.  Having refused the amendment the
trial judge should not have found Liang negligent for failing to
consult another agent or failing to tell the respondents to
consult a lawyer.  To do so after she ruled she would not
entertain this allegation was unfair to Phoenix.  I therefore set
aside this finding of negligence.

          (iii)     Liang&#146;s Duty to Protect the Respondent&#146;s
          Interest by Obtaining Security for the Rental Income
          Warranty</pre>
    <pre>[21] The main ground on which the trial judge found Liang liable
was his failure to protect the respondents&#146; interests by
obtaining security for the warranty on rental income.  In so
finding, the trial judge implicitly assumed that Liang had a duty
to advise the respondents on the risk of an unsecured warranty
from a numbered company, and that if so advised, the respondents
would have instructed him to negotiate for security. Also, I take
the trial judge&#146;s finding to mean that Liang was negligent for
failing to try to obtain security for the warranty because the
evidence did not show security would have been offered had it
been requested.  Phoenix challenges the trial judge&#146;s finding,
arguing that Liang had no duty to address what was for the
respondents a business decision.
[22] However, Lebow, who was the sole witness to give opinion
evidence on the standard of care of a real estate agent,
testified that warranties were commonly secured by a vendor take
back mortgage with a set-off for any rent deficiency, that a
knowledgeable agent would explain to a client the risk of an
unsecured warranty from a numbered company, and that a
knowledgeable agent would also try to obtain some form of
security for the warranty.  Liang did not explain the risk to the
respondents and he did not attempt to obtain security for the
vendor&#146;s warranty.  Overall, Mr. Lebow was of the opinion that
Liang&#146;s handling of the transaction for his clients fell below
the standard of care expected of a licenced real estate agent in
Ontario.
[23] Whether a defendant owes a duty of care and the general
standard by which to measure the defendant&#146;s conduct are
questions of law.  But translating the general duty into the
particular obligation imposed on a defendant in a given case and
deciding whether the defendant has met that obligation are
questions of fact.4 As a matter of law Liang owed the respondents
a duty of care, measured by the standard of a reasonably
competent real estate agent.5  The trial judge found that in this
transaction Liang had an obligation to try to obtain security for
the vendor&#146;s warranty and that he failed to do so.  These are
findings of fact, which are reasonably supported by the
uncontradicted expert evidence led by the respondents at trial.
They are, therefore, entitled to deference from this court.
[24] What underscore the trial judge&#146;s findings are the special
risk posed by looking only to a numbered company to satisfy a
warranty, and the lack of any evidence that the respondents
understood this risk or that Liang bothered to find out whether
they did.  The trial judge concluded that the respondents were
&#147;very unsophisticated people&#148; because this was their first
commercial real estate venture in Canada.  The more pertinent
question is whether the respondents appreciated the risk of
contracting only with an Ontario numbered company. This risk can
arise not just in a commercial real estate transaction, but in
any number of commercial contexts.
[25] Peter Wong, Jenny Wang and Peter Chan did have considerable
business experience in Hong Kong and in Canada, which included
using corporations, presumably to limit their personal liability.
Wong even admitted that he understood the warranty was only as
good as the vendor&#146;s assets.  But contracting with a numbered
company poses a special risk that should have been obvious to any
competent agent.  Liang should have recognized this risk,
explained the danger of accepting an unsecured warranty from the
vendor and sought instructions from the respondents to try to
obtain security.  He acted for the respondents when,
realistically, he could have protected their interests: before
the agreement of purchase and sale was signed.  In Ontario, the
real estate agent is often the only professional advisor on the
terms of an agreement of purchase and sale. Typically lawyers are
not retained until, as in this case, the agreement has been
signed by both sides.  Because agents take on this advisory role,
they must be held accountable for failing to protect their
clients against the special risks of a transaction.  I would
uphold the trial judge&#146;s finding that Liang was negligent for
failing to protect the respondents&#146; interests by trying to obtain
security for the vendor&#146;s warranty.</pre>
    <pre>          (iv) Causation</pre>
    <pre>[26] To recover from Phoenix, the respondents must not only show
that Liang was negligent, but that his negligence caused their
loss.  The trial judge did not address the question of whether
Liang&#146;s negligence was the cause of the respondents&#146; rental loss.
However, she held Liang and Phoenix liable for the entire rental
shortfall and, therefore, implicitly she must have concluded that
had Liang sought security for the warranty, it was more likely
than not that he would have obtained some form of security on
which the respondents could have realized.  I disagree with this
approach to causation and with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that
Phoenix must pay the entire shortfall.
[27] The respondents intended to buy the property whether or not
the vendor&#146;s warranty on rental income was secured.  The court
therefore has to assess what would have happened had Liang
fulfilled his duty to try to negotiate security for the warranty.
The court is called on to decide not what did happen but what
would have happened in hypothetical circumstances.  The proper
approach is not to decide on the balance of probabilities whether
Liang would have obtained security, but to value the lost
opportunity to do so.6  The court must, therefore, value the
probability that Liang&#146;s efforts would have been successful and
award damages proportionally.  At best, this is an uncertain and
difficult exercise; at worst, it is an exercise in speculation.
The court, however, must do the best it can with the available
evidence.
[28] Griffiths J.A. discussed the assessment of damages for a
lost chance or a lost opportunity and the burden of proof on the
plaintiff in Eastwalsh Holmes Ltd. v. Anatal Developments.7
          </pre>
    <pre>               On my analysis these two Supreme Court of Canada decisions
          stand for the following two propositions.  The burden rests on
          the plaintiff alleging breach of contract to prove on the balance
          of probabilities that the breach and not some intervening factor
          or factors has caused loss to the plaintiff.  In this respect the
          courts have not relaxed the basic standard of proof.  Where it is
          clear that the defendant&#146;s breach has caused loss to the
          plaintiff it is no answer to the claim that the loss is difficult
          to assess or calculate. The concept of the loss of a chance then
          begins to operate and the court will estimate the plaintiff&#146;s
          chance of obtaining a benefit had the contract been performed.
          But even in this situation, the Supreme Court of Canada has said
          in Kinkel v. Hyman, [[1939] S.C.R. 364] that proof of the loss of
          a mere chance is not enough: the plaintiff must prove that the
          chance constitutes &#147;some reasonable probability&#148; of realizing &#147;an
          advantage of some real substantial monetary value&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[29] Although the trial judge did not approach the extent of
Phoenix&#146;s liability in this way, I see no benefit in sending the
case back for a new trial.  Whatever evidence assists in
resolving this question has likely already been led.
[30] However, no evidence was led to suggest that the vendor or
Curic would have offered security if asked. One form of security
suggested by the trial judge, a personal guarantee from Curic,
would have proved worthless because he later went bankrupt.  Even
if the vendor was willing to offer the kind of security suggested
by Lebow, it may have insisted on increasing the purchase price
as consideration.  The respondents did not suggest in their
evidence that they were willing to pay more for the property.
Indeed, as I  have said, the respondents wanted to close the
transaction with or without security because they believed they
had made a good deal and they wanted to flip the property in a
rising market.
[31] Still, in my opinion, the lost opportunity to negotiate
security for the warranty had value for which Phoenix should
compensate the respondents.  With no suggestion of any other
prospective purchaser for the building and with a vendor
apparently anxious to sell, the respondents had some negotiating
leverage, however modest.  And, according to Lebow, a holdback on
the purchase price or a vendor take back mortgage with a set-off
for any rental deficiency are common methods of securing a
vendor&#146;s warranty.  Doing the best I can with this evidence, I
would value the reasonable probability of Liang successfully
negotiating realizable security for the vendor&#146;s warranty at 20%.
I therefore hold Phoenix responsible for only twenty percent of
the rental loss and associated costs.  I now address the amount
of that loss.</pre>
    <pre>          iv)  The Loss of Rental Income</pre>
    <pre>[32] The trial judge assessed the respondents&#146; loss of rental
income for the year at $62,000. Phoenix submits that the
respondents failed to prove and failed to mitigate this loss.  I
do not agree with this submission.
[33] On the amount of the loss, both Mr. Lebow and his associate,
Mr. MacLean, testified that the rental deficiency for the first
year was slightly more than $62,000.  Although, as Phoenix
contends, Lebow&#146;s methodology might be open to criticism,
Mr. Stanley Edwardh, a real estate expert called by Hui, also
agreed that the rental deficiency for the year after closing was
about $62,000. Phoenix led no evidence to suggest any other
figure.
[34] On the question of mitigation, Phoenix argues that, contrary
to the holding of the trial judge, the respondents had a duty to
mitigate, and that they did not make reasonable efforts to do so.
In fixing the respondents&#146; damages at $62,000 the trial judge did
comment that &#147;the warranty clause, such as it is, made no mention
of failure of the plaintiff to mitigate nor bad management
practices.&#148;  If by that comment the trial judge meant that the
respondents had no obligation to mitigate then I disagree with
her.  Plaintiffs cannot recover from a defendant losses which
they could have avoided by taking reasonable steps.8  Here,
however, the respondents did take reasonable steps to avoid their
rental loss.  They retained a lawyer to collect unpaid rents for
which the trial judge awarded them their legal costs; their
superintendent advertised locally to attract new tenants; and
they re-leased some of the units vacated by the tenants.  I would
not disturb the amount of the rental loss found by the trial
judge.
[35] However, because I have concluded Phoenix should be
responsible for only 20% of that loss I would reduce the damages
award against Phoenix from $73,987.22 to $14,797.44.</pre>
    <pre>     LIABILITY OF HUI</pre>
    <pre>[36] Henry Hui was called to the Ontario Bar in 1975.  By 1988 he
practised in a partnership with Gordon Hune and Caesar Wong. He
testified that between 55% and 70% of his practice was devoted to
real estate transactions, both residential and commercial.
[37] Hui was retained by the respondents only after the agreement
of purchase and sale had been signed by both sides.  He was not
consulted beforehand.  His instructions were to close the
transaction.  The trial judge found that he treated the agreement
&#147;as a fait accompli, and as a routine matter.  He handed it over
to his law clerk without further consideration.&#148;
[38] Although Hui did close the transaction, the trial judge
strongly criticized his conduct, not for what he did do, but for
what he did not do.  Most of her criticism, in my opinion, was
unjustified and, more important, most of it was unnecessary
because it had no bearing on the respondents&#146; claims. She found
that Hui had failed to protect his clients&#146; interests in at least
seven different ways.
     </pre>
    <pre>(i)   He failed to discuss with the respondents or to negotiate
with the vendor some form of security for the rental income
warranty.
(ii)  He failed to analyze the leases and to discuss with the
respondents the option of not closing or of negotiating an
abatement because one of the commercial tenants, PDI Structures,
had given notice that it intended to vacate shortly after
closing.
(iii) He failed to adequately supervise his law clerk, thus
allowing the clerk to include an incompetently worded warranty.
(iv)  He failed to check the residential rents to confirm that
they were legal and to determine when the last rent increase took
place.
(v)   He failed to explore with the respondents the income tax
possibilities on the transaction.
(vi)  He failed to conduct bankruptcy searches on the vendor and
its principal Curic.
(vii) He failed to investigate the credit worthiness of the
tenants.</pre>
    <pre>[39] The crux of the case against Hui turns on the first two
findings.  Findings (iii) to (vii) cannot possibly support the
trial judge&#146;s award and I therefore will deal with them now and
only briefly.  However incompetently the warranty was drafted,
the trial judge found it was effective and therefore Hui&#146;s
failure to supervise his clerk did not cause the respondents&#146;
loss. Whether Hui failed to check the residential rents was
immaterial because, again, the respondents&#146; loss was not caused
by illegal rents.  Similarly, the respondents&#146; loss had nothing
to do with income tax considerations. Although 407527 and
apparently Curic eventually declared bankruptcy nothing in the
record indicates that bankruptcy searches before closing would
have revealed any useful information. The respondents certainly
never suggested otherwise.  Finally, checking on the financial
viability of tenants seems to me to lie outside the scope of a
lawyer&#146;s duty when closing a commercial real estate transaction
for a purchaser, at least absent a specific request from the
client.  Even Mr. Donald Lamont, a distinguished and respected
real estate solicitor in Ontario who gave expert evidence for the
respondents on the standard of care of  a reasonably prudent
practitioner in the area, stopped short of suggesting that the
standard would include carrying out credit checks on tenants.
[40] I turn now to the two main findings against Hui made by the
trial judge.  These two findings are related in that in both the
trial judge found Hui negligent for failing to negotiate a better
deal for his clients, despite the existence of a binding and
enforceable contract.</pre>
    <pre>  (i)  Failing to Negotiate Security for the Rental Income Warranty</pre>
    <pre>[41] The main support for the judgment against Hui rests on the
trial judge&#146;s finding that he should have discussed the rental
income warranty with the respondents and then should have tried
to negotiate some form of security for the warranty with the
vendor.
[42] Thus to prove Hui liable in negligence the respondents had
to prove that he had a duty to negotiate better security and that
his failure to do so caused their loss.  I doubt that Hui had any
obligation to negotiate better security, but even if he did, his
failure to try to improve their bargain did not cause the damages
awarded by the trial judge.
[43] A lawyer&#146;s duty to a client will vary depending on the
client&#146;s instructions and the limits on the lawyer&#146;s retainer.
Here, Hui was given an executed agreement of purchase and sale by
his clients and instructed to close the transaction.  The
agreement warranted the rental income on the building for a year
after closing.  But the warranty was given only by the vendor, a
numbered Ontario company, and thus if the rent was not as
warranted the respondents could look only to the numbered company
for relief.  The giving of a warranty by a numbered company
should raise a red flag for a reasonably prudent lawyer.
Ordinarily a lawyer should discuss this warranty with the client
and warn the client of the risk of non-recovery should the
warranty be breached.  Mr. Lamont said as much and Hui led no
expert evidence to the contrary. Indeed, if the respondents had
retained Hui before they signed the offer, I would have no
hesitation in holding that Hui should have raised with his
clients the possibility, even the desirability, of obtaining
security for the warranty and sought their instructions on
whether to try to negotiate some form of security, be it at a
holdback on the purchase price or a vendor take back mortgage.
[44] But the respondents did not retain Hui until after they had
signed the agreement of purchase and sale.  Having not sought his
advice beforehand, they then sought to hold him liable for
failing to improve on the deal they had negotiated without him.
In Mr. Lamont&#146;s opinion, Hui still had a duty to try to obtain
security for the warranty.  The trial judge echoed that opinion
when she said &#147;[n]o lawyer should presume that no rights can be
negotiated.&#148;
[45] In my view, the trial judge was not sensitive enough to the
limitation on Hui&#146;s retainer implicit in his being consulted
after the agreement had been signed.  Mr. Lamont&#146;s opinion may
represent a counsel of perfection, but I find it hard to admonish
Hui, let alone make a finding of negligence against him, for
failing to try to negotiate something to which his clients had no
legal entitlement.  Cases may arise where a duty of this kind
should be imposed on a lawyer, but the court should at least take
into account the timing of the lawyer&#146;s retainer.9
[46] I do not, however, rest my concern about Hui&#146;s duty to
negotiate security on any distinction between business advice and
legal advice. Hui submitted that he had no duty to negotiate
security for the warranty because this was a business matter, not
part of a lawyer&#146;s retainer.  I do not accept this submission.
Although ordinarily clients retain lawyers for legal advice not
business advice, on some transactions the two are intermingled
and no clear dividing line can be drawn. Thus, a lawyer may well
have a duty to give advice on the financial or business aspects
of a transaction, depending on the client&#146;s instructions and
sophistication, and on whether the client is relying on the
lawyer for that kind of advice.
[47] As I have said, had the respondents consulted Hui before
signing the agreement they could reasonably have looked to him
for advice on the risk of relying on an unsecured warranty by a
numbered company, be it characterized as business advice or
[48] legal advice or a mixture of the two.  But they consulted
Hui only after they had assumed this risk by signing the
agreement drafted by Liang.  The respondents believed that they
had made a good deal; they did not want to get out of the
transaction; and at no time did they ask Hui to improve the terms
of their agreement. Thus, I am doubtful whether Hui had the duty
imposed on him by the trial judge.
[49] But even if Hui had a duty to try to obtain security for the
warranty, I am not persuaded his failure to do so caused the
respondents&#146; damages.  The trial judge dealt with causation in a
single sentence: &#147;[h]e [Hui] is the proximate cause of the
plaintiffs&#146; loss.&#148;  As with Liang&#146;s negligence, I disagree with
the trial judge&#146;s approach to assessing whether the respondents
suffered a loss because of Hui&#146;s negligence.  The proper approach
is to assess what would have happened had Hui fulfilled his duty.
The court must value the lost opportunity to obtain realizable
security for the warranty.  It must value the probability Hui
would have improved the bargain for his clients.
[50] Even on the most optimistic view of the respondents&#146;
position, the chance of Hui obtaining realizable security for the
rental income warranty was negligible. Curic had no incentive to
give a holdback on the purchase price or a vendor take back
mortgage and the respondents had no leverage to demand security.
Curic&#146;s numbered company already had a binding agreement of
purchase and sale that the respondents were obligated to
complete.  Curic&#146;s personal guarantee would have been worthless.
The respondents led no evidence to suggest any other form of
security would have been forthcoming had Hui tried to negotiate
for it. Even if Curic was prepared to give security, he would
undoubtedly have insisted that the respondents given
consideration for it, and the respondents did not testify that
they were willing to do so.  The agreement was signed in a &#147;hot
market&#148; with rising property values.  Moreover, the respondents
had apparently made a favourable bargain.   Their first
mortgagee, the Hong Kong Bank of Canada, appraised the property
just before closing at $1,045,000, or $70,000 more than the
purchase price. The respondents did not want out of their deal.
[51] Hui&#146;s liability differs from Liang&#146;s liability mainly
because Liang was retained by the respondents when he had a
realistic opportunity to secure the rental income warranty. When
Hui was retained that realistic opportunity had almost certainly
disappeared.  Accordingly, I find no basis to attribute the
respondents&#146; loss to Hui&#146;s failure to attempt to negotiate
security for the rental income warranty.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (ii) Failing to Analyze the Leases</pre>
    <pre>[52] PDI Structures, a month-to-month commercial  tenant, moved
out of the building three weeks after the closing without even
paying its last month&#146;s rent. The trial judge found Hui negligent
for failing to analyze the leases and report to the respondents
far enough before the closing to permit them to make an &#147;informed
decision&#148; on what to do about PDI Structures. She criticized Hui
for failing to discuss with his clients reasons for not closing
and for failing to negotiate an abatement of the purchase price.
[53] I assume that Hui, if acting reasonably competently, should
have reviewed the various leases to see that they were in good
standing and should have discussed PDI Structures&#146; departure with
the respondents to ensure that they were properly informed about
what they were buying.  Nonetheless, for any one of a number of
reasons I do not think that Hui&#146;s failure to review the leases or
to try to address PDI Structures&#146; leaving can support the trial
judge&#146;s award against him.
[54] First, Hui received acknowledgements of leases from all
tenants but PDI Structures and all these tenants were in
possession and paying rent.  The respondents knew well before
closing that PDI Structures was a monthly tenant and would be
moving out shortly after closing.  Indeed, the respondents
inspected the property before closing with the vendor&#146;s agent to
discuss PDI Structures&#146; departure, and whether one of the other
tenants, a karate school, was willing to take over the space.
Thus, the respondents did not rely on advice from Hui about PDI
Structures. They knew the situation for themselves.
[55] Second, three days before closing, Hui discussed PDI
Structures&#146; departure with Wong, who decided on behalf of the
respondents to close anyway, without asking anything more of the
vendor.  Although Hui perhaps should have had this discussion
earlier, nothing turned on when it took place because the
respondents already knew that they were losing a tenant.
[56] Third, as Hui correctly advised the respondents and as the
trial judge recognized, PDI Structures&#146; early departure did not
entitle the respondents to an abatement.  Legally, the
respondents&#146; remedy, which they pursued, was to close and sue for
damages for breach of warranty.10  Equally, PDI Structures&#146;
departure did not afford the respondents a legal basis to refuse
to close.  Mr. Lamont testified that Hui should have tried to
negotiate an abatement or at least should have discussed the
possibility with his clients.  As I said in connection with Hui&#146;s
failure to try to obtain security for the rental income warranty,
I am doubtful he should be held accountable for failing to
negotiate something to which his clients had no legal
entitlement.
[57] Fourth, the record shows that respondents never wanted to
get out of the agreement, and before closing they never expressed
any concern about PDI Structures&#146; departure.  They knew or, at
least, believed that they had made a good deal. Not only was the
sale price less than the appraised value of the building, they
bought in a rising market, intending to flip their purchase. As I
indicated earlier, they apparently turned down an offer of
$1,500,000 made within 18 months of closing.
[58] Fifth, at most the vacancy because of PDI Structures&#146;
departure caused a rental loss of $7,000, far short of the amount
of damages awarded by the trial judge.  Thus the judgment against
the law firm cannot be supported by any failure by Hui to review
the leases with the respondents or to try to address PDI
Structures&#146; departure with the vendor.
[59] For these reasons, I conclude that Hui and therefore his law
firm are not liable for the respondents&#146; loss.  I would allow the
law firm&#146;s appeal and dismiss the action against it.</pre>
    <pre>     CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[60] I would allow the appeal of Phoenix in part, by reducing the
damages awarded against them by 80% from $73,987.22 to
$14,797.44.  I would allow the appeal of Hui, Hune and Wong and
would dismiss the action against the law firm.  I would ask
counsel to make written submissions on how the court should deal
with the costs of the trial and of the appeal.</pre>
