</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Feldman J. dated July 2, 1997.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>NEGLIGENCE</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The trial judge found as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               I find that Dr. Beck’s failure to continue to suspect raised
          intracranial pressure based on his funduscopic findings in
          conjunction with Mrs. Woods’ other symptoms and history and his
          consequent failure to take the step of referring her for an
          urgent consultation with a neurologist and a CT scan fell below
          the standard of care of an internist of his qualifications and
          experience.</pre>
      <pre>[2]  We see no basis upon which to interfere with the trial
judge’s finding that Dr. Beck’s manner of dealing with suspected
raised intracranial pressure fell below the expected standard of
care.  Admissions made by Dr. Beck as to what he noted on his
funduscopic examination and as to the manner in which he
discounted certain observations by reference to pulse and blood
pressure readings, read together with the evidence of the expert
witnesses which the trial judge accepted, provide an adequate
evidential basis for this finding.</pre>
      <pre>CAUSATION</pre>
      <pre>[3]  Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge’s
findings with respect to causation could not be supported.  Four
distinct points, each one critical to establishing a causal link
between Dr. Beck’s negligence and the harm suffered by the
plaintiff, were raised.
[4]  First, the appellant contends that there is no evidence to
support the finding that a referral by Dr. Beck on May 12 would
have resulted in a CT scan within 24 hours.  The trial judge
found that, had Dr. Beck requested an urgent consultation, the
neurologist in Peterborough would have made arrangements for “the
earliest available appointment”.  In our view, it was open to the
trial judge to make this finding.  Dr. Lan testified that if Dr.
Beck had requested an urgent CT scan and consultation, he would
have accommodated such a request.  Indeed, Dr. Lan ordered a CT
scan on an urgent basis, for the first available date, based upon
the respondent’s husband’s request and upon information conveyed
by Dr. Braden, including normal extraocular movements, normal
visual fields and normal fundi.
[5]  The second point relied upon by the appellant is that on Dr.
Tovich’s evidence, even if a prompt CT scan had been arranged,
the respondent would not have been transferred to Sunnybrook
until several days later, after receipt of the results of the HCG
serum test.  On cross-examination, Dr. Tovich was asked whether
he would have awaited the results of the beta HCG test before
making the diagnosis.  He answered:  “In the sequence of events,
it would seem to be right”.  He was further asked as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Q.   And it would have been on the receipt of that [HCG]
          report that the patient would have been transferred to Sunnybrook
          or some other hospital with an oncology service?
          </pre>
      <pre>               A.   Assuming nothing else happened that
          would be the case.</pre>
      <pre>[6]  Despite this evidence, the trial judge found that:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The actions of the Peterborough Hospital as well as logic
          and common sense weigh against Dr. Tovich’s suggestion that he
          and Dr. Bos would have delayed in transferring Mrs. Wood to
          Sunnybrook once they suspected a provisional diagnosis of
          choriocarcinoma.</pre>
      <pre>In making this finding, the trial judge observed as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               In rejecting Dr. Tovich’s suggestion, I take into account
          the fact that he was not able to be cross-examined on this
          statement by counsel for the plaintiffs who had called him as a
          witness, so that the logic of this answer was not able to be
          explored with him or tested more fully.</pre>
      <pre>[7]  Dr. Tovich was called by the plaintiff as the plaintiff’s
witness and it was accordingly inappropriate for the trial judge
to make reference to the absence of any cross-examination of him
by the plaintiff.  Notwithstanding that error, it is our view
that there was ample evidence to support the trial judge’s
finding that the respondent had established on a balance of
probabilities:
          </pre>
      <pre>               …that had the CT scan been done in Peterborough by May 13,
          1988 a provisional diagnosis of choriocarcinoma would have been
          made by May 14 and Mrs. Wood would have been transferred to
          Sunnybrook either on that day or on May 15.</pre>
      <pre>[8]  Both Drs. Tovich and Bos suspected choriocarcinoma.
Although Dr. Bos was not called as a witness, his assessment of
the situation was available to the trial judge as his
consultation note was in evidence.  Dr. Bos specifically noted
the possibility of “gestational trophoblastic disease” and that
if the respondent did suffer from that condition, he would
“expect multiple cannonballs to be seen in the lung”.  That is
precisely what the chest x-ray revealed.
[9]  The appellant’s expert, Dr. Gerulath, agreed that even
without an HCG test, choriocarcinoma would be highly suspected in
these circumstances.  He also agreed that in 1988, a doctor could
use a simple pregnancy test to confirm the diagnosis, the result
of which would be available within minutes.  In our view, there
was ample evidence to permit the trial judge to conclude that in
the circumstances presented to Drs. Tovich and Bos, the chest x-
ray would have led them to make a provisional diagnosis of
choriocarcinoma.  It was also open to the trial judge on this
record to find that, despite what Dr. Tovich said on cross-
examination about awaiting the HCG serum results, if he had
actually been confronted with a chest x-ray showing the multiple
cannonballs in the lungs, he and Dr. Bos would have acted quickly
to transfer the respondent to a hospital with appropriate
facilities to treat on an urgent basis the very aggressive form
of cancer from which the respondent suffered.  We note as well
that Dr. Tovich testified that there were two neurologists on
staff at the Peterborough hospital.  Had Dr. Beck made a prompt
referral, the respondent might well have been seen by a different
neurologist who would have acted with the despatch found to be
appropriate by the trial judge.
[10] The appellant’s third point is that even had the respondent
been transferred to Sunnybrook earlier, there is insufficient
evidence to support the finding that her outcome would have been
different.  In our view,  there was evidence upon which the trial
judge was entitled to find that had the respondent arrived at
Sunnybrook two or three days earlier, it would have made a
material difference.  Dr. Osborne regarded a diagnosis of
choriocarcinoma metastasized to the brain as a matter of the
utmost urgency.  Drugs would have been administered immediately
to reduce swelling.  The beta HCG result was available within
hours at Sunnybrook and chemotherapy could be commenced
immediately upon its receipt.  Dr. Schwartz testified that faster
and speedier treatment would lower the risk of damage to the
brain.
[11] We agree with the appellant’s submission that the trial
judge did not specifically find that earlier treatment would have
prevented the second haemorrhage.  She did find, however, that
even if the second haemorrhage would have occurred in any event,
its effects would have been significantly reduced had it occurred
at Sunnybrook where surgery could have begun immediately.  Again,
we see no reason to interfere with this finding.  In our view,
there was ample evidence to support the trial judge’s finding
that the respondent would have been significantly better off to
suffer a haemorrhage at Sunnybrook where surgery could begin
immediately, rather than in Peterborough where it was necessary
to bring her to Sunnybrook by ambulance with no possibility of
surgery for several hours after the haemorrhage had started.
[12] The appellant’s fourth point is the following:  assuming
that there was a causal link between Dr. Beck’s negligence and
the damage suffered by the respondent, is Dr. Beck liable for the
full extent of the plaintiff’s injury?  The trial judge reduced
the damages by 3% on account of the visual loss observed by Dr.
Tovich and suffered by Mrs. Wood before the haemorrhage, but
otherwise found Dr. Beck liable for the full extent of the
injury.
[13] The trial judge approached this issue on the basis that so
long as the plaintiff was able to establish that the defendant’s
negligence had materially contributed to the occurrence of the
injury then the plaintiff was entitled to full recovery from the
defendant for the damages she had suffered.  Against this must be
placed the trial judge’s finding “on a balance of probabilities
based on a robust and pragmatic approach to the facts that the
effects of the haemorrhage would have been reduced had it
occurred at Sunnybrook and surgery began more quickly either
before or after the institution of the chemotherapy.” [emphasis
added]
[14] The finding that the injury would have been reduced rather
than prevented is consistent with the evidence.  As noted by the
trial judge, Dr. Osborne testified that had Mrs. Wood come to
Sunnybrook two or three days sooner, things would have been
“better”.  It was Dr. Schwartz’s evidence that had the second
haemorrhage occurred at Sunnybrook a quicker operation could have
been arranged and that the respondent “may have recovered some
vision”.  The trial judge also noted that Dr. Osborne testified
that there were no certainties but that it was his view that had
she been treated earlier “she would have turned out better”.
[15] In our view, in light of these findings, given the nature of
the appellant’s condition and its relationship to the negligence
of Dr. Beck, the trial judge erred in finding that Dr. Beck was
responsible for all but 3% of the damage she suffered.
[16] It is clear that the respondent suffered from a
deteriorating condition when she was seen by Dr. Beck.  She was
not a “thin skull” plaintiff who suffered an unexpected or
unexpectedly severe injury owing to a pre-existing condition.
Rather, she was a “crumbling skull” plaintiff with a pre-existing
condition of a deteriorating nature that would have resulted in
some loss even if Dr. Beck had treated her appropriately.  As
pointed out in Athey v. Leonati (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 235
(S.C.C.) at 243-4, in such a case:
          </pre>
      <pre>               The defendant is liable for the injuries caused, even if
          they are extreme, but need not compensate the plaintiff for any
          debilitating effects of the pre-existing condition which the
          plaintiff would have experienced anyway.…This is consistent with
          the general rule that the plaintiff must be returned to the
          position he would have been in with all of its attendant risks
          and shortcomings, and not a better position.</pre>
      <pre>[17] It follows, in our view, that in light of the trial judge’s
findings, she should have reduced the damages for which Dr. Beck
is responsible to take into account the extent to which the
respondent would have suffered a loss even if Dr. Beck had not
been negligent.
[18] We do not have the benefit of any specific findings on this
point nor was the evidence as to the extent to which the
respondent’s losses would have been reduced had she received
earlier treatment put in percentage terms.  In his submissions,
Mr. Underwood submitted that the appropriate reduction in the
circumstances was 50%, a reduction he labelled as generous to the
respondent but one with which the appellant could live.  In our
view, a reduction of that magnitude would be inconsistent with
the factual findings of the trial judge.  It is clear from her
reasons that she found that most of the damage suffered by the
plaintiff was, in fact, caused by Dr. Beck’s negligence.  A more
appropriate reduction would be 25%, inclusive of the 3% already
calculated by the trial judge.
[19] Accordingly, for these reasons, it is our view that the
appeal should be allowed, but only to the extent of varying the
judgment by reducing the damages by an additional 22%.  The
appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal.
