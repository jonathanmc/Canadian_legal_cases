    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Ellen Macdonald J. dated November
20, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants appeal from the judgment of Ellen Macdonald
J. dismissing their action for negligence against the defendant
solicitor Douglas Owens and his law firm.
[2]  The action involved a 7.2 acre parcel of land in the City of
North York owned by the appellants under separate ownership for
separate parts.  The appellant Paul Manchester (&#147;Manchester&#148;)
decided to develop the lands for expensive housing.  The
respondent Owens was retained as the solicitor at some stage
induring the process of the development of these lands.  The
extent and nature of his retainer were very much in issue.
[3]  At the time of the acquisition of this parcel of land, the
relevant zoning provisions in North York required that each lot
consist of 2 acres for each residence.  However, the lands in
question were not subject to what is referred to as &#147;part lot
control&#148; under the provisions of the Planning Act and therefore
the land could be divided up and conveyed under a scheme known as
&#147;checkerboarding&#148;.  Initially, utilising solicitors othere than
the respondents, the appellant Manchester commissioned and
registered a plan creating three lots.  North York refused to
issue building permits and the appellant Manchester retained the
firm of Weir &amp; Foulds to act for him with respect to this problem
and others as it turned out.  At about this time the respondent
Owens was retained with respect to the sale of one of the newly
created lots.
[4]  The appellant Manchester then decided that he wished to
increase the number of lots from three to five.  He contends that
he engaged the respondent Owens to do the conveyancing and create
the easements necessary to provide for services for the lots and
access to the public street.  The respondent Owens did prepare
and register deeds to convey the various parcels, but he did not
prepare and register the various easements.  Approximately one
and one half years later, North York imposed part lot control
without prior notice. The lands in question had been exempted
from part lot control when they were purchased by Manchester in
1981 but, on September 23, 1988, By-law 30649 was registered and
part lot control over the lands was reimposed.  While the
appellant Manchester acknowledged that he knew that part lot
control could be reimposed, he incorrectly thought that he would
receive advance notice and complained that the respondent Owens
did not advise him to the contrary.
[5]  The issue in appeal  was that whether there was
a positive obligation upon the respondent Douglas Owens to warn
the appellant Manchester of the risk attaching to his failure to
register the required easements.  In particular, it was submitted
that the respondent Owens ought to have disabused the appellant
Manchester of his belief that North York was obliged
to serve notice of its intent to pass the by-law reimposing part
lot control and that this, a notice that waswould have to be
sufficient to allow him time to complete the registrations of the
necessary easements and thus protect his properties from the
consequences of such a by-law.
[6]  However, the trial judge took a different
view of the relationship between the appellant Manchester and the
respondents.  She found that the respondents&#146; retainer was much
narrower than that alleged by the appellants and that the guiding
mind of the appellants, namely the appellant Manchester, did not
rely upon the respondent Owen to give him the type of planning
advice that he belatedly maintained he was entitled to receive.
It is apparent from the record at trial, as accepted by the trial
judge, that the easements which are now so much in issue were not
that significant at the relevant time and the imposition of part
lot control was only part of the problems that beset the
appellants in their attempts to develop the lands in question.
[7]  The appellants on appeal stress that this problem about
easements was the single issue in appeal but the trial judge was
of the opinion that the case was &#147;obscured by a complex factual
background, all arising from Mr. Manchester&#146;s complex and
changing plans for the development of the lands.&#148;  She further
said that:
               Having reflected on the matter in great detail, I have
          concluded that the defendants are correct in their theory that
          confining the focus of this case on the issue of part lot control
          is only part of the picture.  The assessment of the performance
          of Mr. Owens&#146; retainer must be in the context of the entire
          history of important events from 1986 to 1991 when Mr. Owens was
          put on notice that his failure to create the easements was
          considered to be actionable by the plaintiffs.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellants attempted to portray the appellant Manchester
as somewhat of a novice in land development. While he carried on
the business of a mortgage broker, he was a chartered accountant
by profession and this was his first venture with land
development.  It is said that he not only looked to the
respondent Owens for legal advice but also relied heavily on his
expertise in land development including instructions as
to what was necessary to protect his exemption
status under the Planning Act.  However, the trial judge took a
different view of the appellant Manchester.  She said that he
&#147;presented himself as an articulate, quick thinking, intelligent
and sophisticated person&#148;.  She was of the opinion that he was
very much in control of the development project and had an
&#147;impressive&#148; understanding of legal issues.  He insisted on co-
ordinating the efforts of all the experts that he retained.
After reviewing some of the correspondence in this trial, she
said of the appellant Manchester that he was:

               &#133; articulate and relentless in attending to all aspects of
          the redevelopment of the lands.  I was struck by the contents of
          much of his correspondence.  It illustrates that he quickly
          grasped complicated concepts which impacted on his plans
          for redevelopment.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellants submitted that the respondent should have
prepared the necessary easements well before lot control was
invoked, but it is apparent on the record that the respondent
Manchester had not made up his mind as to what his final
development was to be and deliberately withheld instructions from
the respondent Owens as to the number of lots he proposed to
create.  Accordingly, even assuming that it was the
responsibility of the respondent Owens to create and register the
necessary easements, he could not have done so until he knew the
number and location of the lots.  As found by the trial judge,
the creation of easements in the context of the respondent
Manchester&#146;s latest checkerboard plan was a complex conveyancing
task, complicated by the number of lots, the existence of present
easements for water and storm sewers, and the desire of the
appellant Manchester to be flexible with respect to the final
configuration of the lots in order to pursue his goal of
&#147;intensification&#148; of the development of his lands. The trial
judge dealt with this issue in the context of the appellant
Manchester&#146;s reluctance to cede control of the development.  She
said:
          Mr. Manning [Garth Manning, the appellants&#146;
          expert] was critical of Mr. Owens for not
          ensuring that the legal documentation was not
          prepared and put in place for the development
          as a whole and not, on a piece meal basis, as
          individual lots were sold.
          As a general statement, I agree with this
          concept.  But, in this case, the idea of
          permanent arrangements was premature because
          the client, Mr. Manchester, created the
          impression in the mind of Mr. Owens, that he
          was uncertain about many matters which would
          impact the conveyancing.  Mr. Manchester
          wanted to maintain flexibility.
          Mr. Manchester was not always forthcoming
          about the details of what was in his mind
          because he had not made final and permanent
          decisions.  These factors made it reasonable
          for Mr. Owens, in the context of 1987, to
          approach the matter as he did.
          Mr. Manchester approached the matters on a
          piece meal basis for understandable reasons.
          He wanted to optimize, as far as possible,
          the real estate market at the time.  He
          understood the fundamental legal concepts
          that affect the creation of easements.  He
          knew that if he finalized the easements too
          early, he would be restricted in the terms of
          the flexibility that he wanted to maintain.
          [Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellants continually stressed the importance of these
easements in this court as if they were the sole basis for the
difficulties that finally overwhelmed the project.  However, this
emphasis on the significance of the easements seems to have been
an afterthought.  On this issue which is pivotal to this appeal,
the trial judge accepted the evidence of the respondents&#146; expert,
Brian Bucknall and said:

               Mr. Bucknall was candid with the court in that he suggested
          that some aspects of Mr. Owens&#146; practice were sloppy.  He viewed
          the project as being overly complex, characterized by the
          presence of many professionals and characterized by the
          uncertainty in the mind of Mr. Manchester as to what he would
          ultimately decide in terms of the configuration of the buildable
          lots and the private roadway.  Mr. Bucknall&#146;s opinion was that,
          in the context of the whole project and what was going on in
          1987, easements were not of great significance.  I have concluded
          that the easements were then put on the &#147;back burner&#148; by Mr.
          Manchester who was attending to other matters.  Both Mr. Bucknall
          and Mr. Manning saw the lack of coordination amongst the
          professionals and the sophistication of the client as important
          considerations in assessing the performance of the retainer.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The trial judge specifically rejected the assertion of the
appellants that the respondent Owens had some overriding
responsibility for the land development as a whole.  He was given
specific retainers with respect to specific activities.  In the
words of the trial judge he &#147;had a specific and limited
retainer&#148;.  It was (1) to prepare a co-users&#146; agreement; (2) to
act on a sale to a Mrs. Milnes; and (3) to complete the
conveyancing on the checkerboard transfers.  There was no reason
for the respondent Owens to think that his responsibilities were
any broader.  As the trial judge said:
               Mr. Owens knew that the project was very much an ongoing
          process and he knew that Weir &amp; Foulds was counsel to
          Mr. Manchester in respect of the ongoing process.
          Mr. Owens believed that Mr. Manchester knew
          and understood about the need for rezoning.
          I conclude that this was a reasonable belief,
          in all of the circumstances.  Mr. Owens was
          aware that Mr. Manchester was getting advice
          from others with respect to rezoning matters.
          It was reasonable for Mr. Owens to proceed on
          the basis that the whole project was a work
          in progress and that the work expected of him
          was only part of the whole process.</pre>
    <pre>[12] In my view, the trial judge was correct in identifying the
real issue in the trial as being the nature and scope of the
respondent Owens&#146; retainer with the various appellants.  In the
last analysis this was a factual question on which the findings
of the trial judge are entitled to great deference.  There is no
basis in this case for this court&#146;s intervention.
[13] Another factor that the trial judge quite properly commented
upon was the delay by the appellant Manchester in making a
complaint to the respondent Owen Owens about his failure to look
after the easements.  It would appear that the appellant
Manchester received a letter in January of 1989 from North York
advising him that part lot control had been imposed.  The trial
judge accepted that he did not advise the respondent Owens of
this fact until around March of 1989.  Notwithstanding his
present position that the respondent Owens was responsible for
the access problems caused by the imposition of part lot control,
the appellant Manchester continued to retain the respondent Owens
and his without any complaint on the subject.    The assertion
that he was negligent in this regard was not made until the fall
of 1991, long after the development had collapsed.  The trial
judge did not accept the appellant Manchester&#146;s explanation for
this delay, namely that he was reluctant to sue a lawyer.  She
held that the real reason for the delay was that Manchester did
not consider that the respondent Owens was responsible and
therefore had no reason to advance the claim.
[14] In summation, I am of the view on this record, as I believe
the trial judge was, that the appellant Manchester was the author
of his own misfortune.  Counsel for the appellants conceded in
argument that checkerboarding was a device, albeit a legal one,
for circumventing planning control.  The North York planning
authorities were understandably unsympathetic to a land
development project over which they would have little control.
The appellant Manchester faced considerable resistance from North
York concerning his First Checkerboard Plan, and this
necessitated several court applications to force the issuance of
building permits. Against this hostile environment, the
appellant Manchester continued to negotiate personally with these 
officials in his attempts to maximise the yield he would receive 
from the proposed development.  He retained his own lawyers, his 
own surveyors and engineers, but put no one in charge.  He insisted
on maintaining personal control over all aspects of the development.
He did not cede responsibility for managing the project to any one
group of experts and did nothing to encourage them to attempt to 
correlate their activities by conferring the one with the other.  In 
short he attempted through his own efforts to extract the maximum
advantage from his land&#146;s exempt status under the Planning Act
despite the ever present threat that this status could be removed
by a lot control by-law.  When the project failed because of his
overreaching, it seems as though he looked around for someone to
blame and, without cause, settled on Mr. Owens.
[15] There was a final and separate argument that I will deal
with briefly.  The appellant Claudia Manchester, the wife of the
appellant Manchester, maintained that the respondent Owens had a
separate retainer with respect to her interests as the owner of
one of the parcels known as 10 Toba Drive.  She executed two
mortgages on this property to the T-D Bank.  The bank and the
respondent Owens thought that she should receive independent
legal advice before executing the documents and she did so.
However, she now claims that the advice she received was
deficient because the respondent Owens did not brief her advisor
of the underlying legal problems affecting her title to the
property in question.  She maintains that it was up to the
respondent Owens to ensure that she received proper independent
legal advice and that he failed in his legal duty to her in this
regard.
[16] There is some confusion as to whether this issue was even
argued below.  Certainly, the trial judge does not deal with it.
The appellant Claudia Manchester did not testify at trial nor had
she been examined for discovery on the subject.  The issue was
not developed as part of the appellants&#146; case at trial and on
appeal counsel was reduced to relying upon some statements made
by the respondent Owens in a different context on the subject of
his duty to Mrs. Manchester.  This allegation of negligence is
separate and distinct to the appellant Claudia Manchester and the
onus was upon her to establish liability.  She did not do so. The
record does not indicate what advice she in fact received from
her independent legal advisor. We are left to assume that he did
not advise her about her title problems because he was not aware
of them and was not himself negligent in not knowing of them.
Further we are asked to accept that had he instructed her as to
the true state of affairs, his client would not have executed the
two mortgages any way.  In view of the manner in which the case
was presented at trial and the state of the record before us, I
am not prepared to find that there is any merit in this ground of
appeal.
[17] For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with
costs.
