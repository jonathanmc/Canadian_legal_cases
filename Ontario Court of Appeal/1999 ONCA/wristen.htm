    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice W. T. Stayshyn,
sitting with a jury, on June 27, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN and ROSENBERG JJ.A.:

[1]  Andrew Norman Wristen appeals from his conviction for second
degree murder of his wife Penny and from the period of parole
ineligibility of seventeen years.  The Crown relied entirely upon
circumstantial evidence to prove that an offence was in fact
committed and that the appellant committed the offence because
Penny Wristen&#146;s body has never been found.  It was the theory of
the Crown that the appellant killed his wife in the matrimonial
home sometime on Wednesday, August 4, 1993.  After that date,
Mrs. Wristen was never seen again by any of her friends or
relatives.  She never contacted her family, including her two
young children to whom she was devoted.  It was the theory of the
defence that Penny Wristen had voluntarily left the home and if
she disappeared thereafter, it was not because of any misconduct
by the appellant.  To support this theory, the defence called
four independent witnesses who testified that they had seen a
woman they believed was Penny Wristen after August 4, 1993.  The
principal ground of appeal concerns the trial judge&#146;s treatment
of the evidence of these four witnesses in his charge to the
jury.  The appellant also argues that the trial judge misdirected
the jury on the burden of proof, consciousness of guilt, and the
position of the defence.  Finally, the appellant appeals from the
period of parole ineligibility of seventeen years.  For the
following reasons, we would dismiss the appeal from conviction
and from the period of parole ineligibility.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>          The disappearance</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant married Penny Wristen in 1984.  This was a
second marriage for the appellant.  The couple lived with their
two children in Hamilton.  Penny was very close to the children
and to other members of her family.  There was evidence that for
several years prior to Penny&#146;s disappearance the marriage was an
unhappy one.  On different occasions, Penny had left the home.
Witnesses reported that in 1990, 1992 and 1993, the appellant
made threats to kill his wife.  In 1992, the appellant was
convicted of assaulting his wife.  In June and July 1993, Penny
began making plans to leave the appellant.  She set up a separate
bank account and consulted a lawyer.  She told friends that she
wanted the appellant to leave the home and leave her with custody
of the children.  The appellant told a friend that he too had
consulted a lawyer about a separation but decided it was too
expensive.  He told several people that he wanted to kill her.
He told one couple that he would take her to Niagara Falls and
throw her over; and that if could not do it himself, he would get
an &#147;Indian friend&#148; to do it.  The couple thought the appellant
was joking; the appellant said:  &#147;Well, I&#146;m not.&#148;  In mid-July,
the appellant and his wife went on a trip to Nashville.  When he
returned from the trip, the appellant told a friend that the trip
was a waste and &#147;maybe I should have had her done or I should do
it myself&#148;.
[3]  Penny Wristen was last seen by her friends and relatives in
the early morning hours of August 4, 1993.  Up to about 1:30 a.m.
she was at her brother&#146;s home.  From about 2:00 a.m. to 5:00
a.m., she was at the home of a very close friend and neighbour.
This friend testified that at 4:45 a.m. and again at 5:00 a.m.
the appellant called the house because he wanted his wife to come
home and look after the children so that he could go to work.
Penny left her friend&#146;s home at about 5:00 a.m.  No one who knew
Penny Wristen ever heard from her or saw her again.
[4]  Although the appellant had wanted his wife to come home so
that he could go to work, neighbours saw his van in the driveway
at 5:45 a.m. and again at 12:00 p.m.  The appellant was a baker
and ordinarily worked between 5:00 a.m. and noon.  According to
his employer, on August 3rd and 4th the appellant worked briefly
and left between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. to arrange for a babysitter.
The appellant came in to work on August 5th and again asked to
leave early.  At his employer&#146;s suggestion the appellant took the
rest of the week off.  During this week the appellant was seen to
have a disheveled appearance.
[5]  The Crown led cogent evidence to show Penny Wristen did not
leave home voluntarily.  Her friends and relatives testified that
it was out of character for Penny Wristen to leave and not
contact her family or her children.  She had also left the home
without her purse, her wallet and her medication for allergies.
She had no alcohol, drug, medical or psychological problems that
might explain her disappearance.
[6]  Circumstantial evidence after August 4 showed the appellant
knew his wife was dead and pointed to him as the killer.  The
appellant gave conflicting accounts of when and why Penny Wristen
left the home.  He told members of the family she had left him,
giving the impression that they had separated.  But he told
others she had gone to a mall in Hamilton and had not returned,
and when he told that story, he gave conflicting times for when
she left, telling various people she went to the mall at 1:30
p.m., 3:00 p.m. and 5:00 p.m.  He first told the police he was at
work when his wife left.  In a later statement, he told the
police he was home when she left.  On September 7, 1993, over a
month after his wife disappeared, he told the police officer that
she had only been missing for two weeks.  He never told his
employer that she was missing.
[7]  Nor did the appellant ever a file a missing person&#146;s report.
Instead, he told several people she was returning home during the
day while he was at work.  He told a number of people that his
wife was menstruating and that she had left her &#147;bloody&#148; or
&#147;soiled&#148; underwear in the house.  He told a female friend with
whom he had sex at their home not to worry because &#147;Penny was
never coming back&#148;.  He told police that a &#147;friend&#148; of his saw
Penny Wristen at the Jockey Club sometime in September.  But when
questioned by the police, he claimed not to know the name of the
friend.  He told a reporter that a &#147;friend&#148;, again unnamed, had
seen Penny Wristen on a country line dancing show on the
Nashville Network.  He told his oldest son and a friend that he
had gone to Nashville in December and found Penny, but that she
had refused to return.
[8]  After Penny Wristen disappeared, the appellant used her
credit and debit cards and cashed cheques made out to her.  But
he told a friend that Penny had returned to the house to pick up
the cheques.  Then he told the police he had not cashed her
cheques or used her credit or debit cards.
[9]  Forensic evidence supported the Crown&#146;s theory that Penny
Wristen was killed in her home.  Forensic experts found
approximately 100 areas of blood staining in the home.  The
stains were concentrated in the kitchen.  All but one of the
eighteen samples taken confirmed the stains to be human blood.
Most of the stains were &#147;projected&#148; droplets, signifying that
they were generated by multiple blows struck by one person
against another person who was already bleeding.  A blood stain
found on the dishwasher was Penny Wristen&#146;s; the other stains
likely were hers as well.</pre>
    <pre>[10] To meet this powerful Crown case, the appellant led the
evidence of four witnesses who said they saw Penny Wristen alive
after August 4, 1993.  The trial judge&#146;s treatment of this
evidence is at the heart of the appellant&#146;s conviction appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     The defence witnesses</pre>
    <pre>[11] Penny Wristen had several distinguishing physical features.
She was bow-legged and walked with her feet pointed inward.  She
had a bunion on the side of her right foot.  She was only five
feet tall and weighed ninety-five pounds.  Finally, she also had
dark brown shoulder length hair and brown eyes.  The four defence
witnesses who claimed to have seen Penny Wristen after her
disappearance gave descriptions that incorporated these features
in varying degrees.
[12] The most important witness was Gerald Seager who, at the
time of the trial, was a prison guard.  He was riding his
motorcycle in the early morning hours of August 5, 1993 and saw a
woman standing on the side of the road, apparently looking for a
ride.  He stopped and asked if she needed assistance.  They had
about a 90-second conversation and were ten feet apart at the
time.  The lighting was good.  Mr. Seager described the woman as
short and petite, with her brunette hair pulled back.  The woman
refused all of his offers to help, including that he contact the
police or take her to a shelter.  She described herself as a
runaway housewife.  Finally, the woman agreed to wait for Seager
while he went to fetch his car.  However, just as he was leaving
the area, Mr. Seager saw a pick-up truck stop and when he
returned she was gone. He contacted the police when he saw Penny
Wristen&#146;s photograph in the newspaper.  He was 98 to 99 percent
sure the woman was Mrs. Wristen.
[13] Shirley Connolly testified that she saw Mrs. Wristen in the
bar of the Carlton Hotel in Hamilton on September 18, 1993.  She
described the woman as short and very tiny with dark brown
shoulder-length hair.  The woman walked bow-legged.  The woman
was seated with two men and looked scared.  Two days later, Ms
Connolly saw a missing person&#146;s poster of Penny Wristen and
recognized her as the woman in the bar, although her hair was
longer and curlier in the photograph.  The next day she contacted
the police.
[14] Karen Pietrangelo and Ann Prevost testified that in early
October 1993 they saw a &#147;bag lady&#148;, outside the Burlington bakery
where Ms Prevost worked.  Both witnesses noted that the woman had
a bunion on her right foot.  Ms Pietrangelo described the woman
as five feet tall, thirty to forty years of age and weighing 100
pounds.  She came within two or three feet of the woman and spoke
to her briefly.  Both witnesses testified that the &#147;bag lady&#148;
resembled Penny Wristen.  They made the connection after
Ms Pietrangelo saw a picture of her in a Toronto newspaper and
contacted the police.
[15] The evidence of one other witness should be mentioned.  John
Traynor was the appellant&#146;s employer and knew Penny Wristen.  He
was a Crown witness and testified about the hours the appellant
worked in the days following his wife&#146;s disappearance.  However,
Crown counsel also elicited from Mr. Traynor, without objection,
that in the summer of 1994 he was out driving with his wife and
noticed a woman pushing a baby carriage who looked a lot like
Penny Wristen.  He was twenty to thirty feet away at the time.
Accordingly, Mr. Traynor turned the car around, but when he had a
better look, he realized he was mistaken.
[16] The appellant did not testify at his trial.</pre>
    <pre>THE CHARGE TO THE JURY</pre>
    <pre>[17] The appellant submits that the trial judge misdirected the
jury on how to approach the defence evidence.  In general, Mr.
Greenspan argues that the trial judge erred in directing the jury
that as a matter of law they must approach this evidence with
special care.  To appreciate this ground of appeal it is
necessary to set out at some length the relevant instructions:

               As I see it, members of the jury, the
	  defence has presented, an in part uninvestigated,
	  alternative.  In considering this alternative
	  always remember that there is no onus upon the
          accused Andrew Wristen in these proceedings.  As
	  I have indicated the onus is upon the Crown 
	  throughout to show beyond a reasonable doubt that
	  the offence charged was committed and that Andrew
          Wristen committed such offence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               What is &quot;such alternative&quot;?  You should
          consider and consider with care and concern
          the evidence of Gerald Seager, Shirley
          Connolly, Karen Pietrangelo and Ann Prevost,
          all of whom testified in respect of seeing
          Penny Wristen long after the date of her
          alleged disappearance.
          </pre>
    <pre>               In considering the evidence of these
          witnesses, you should remember and consider
          many of the general principles of
          identification.
          </pre>
    <pre>               You should understand that observation
          and memory are often unreliable when it comes
          to the identification of people.  In other
          words, this is an area where people often
          make honest mistakes.  When you consider the
          evidence of the eyewitnesses, you should use
          the following guidelines, among others,
          paying particular attention to each
          eyewitness' opportunity to observe the person
          they say is the missing woman Penny Wristen:
          </pre>
    <pre>               How long was the eyewitness looking at
          the person they saw?  How far away was the
          eyewitness?  Was there anything that might
          have obstructed the view of the eyewitness?
          Was there anything else happening at the same
          time which may have distracted the
          eyewitness?  What were the lighting
          conditions at the time?  Did the eyewitness
          appear to have good eyesight?  Did the
          eyewitness appear to have a good memory?  How
          long was it between the time when the
          eyewitness saw the event and the time when
          that witness identified the accused?  Was it
          a matter of hours, or was it several days, or
          was it several months?  Was the eyewitness
          able to give a good description of the person
          they saw?  Has the eyewitness made any
          significant changes to that description?  Did
          other eyewitnesses give a different
          description?  Did the eyewitness explain how
          they were able to identify Penny Wristen as
          the person they saw?  Did they mention
          special features about the person they saw
          which helped them make that identification?
          Was there other evidence which appeared to
          support the identification of the eye
          witness?  Keep in mind that although
          identification by one witness can support
          that of another, even a number of honest
          witnesses can be mistaken.  Consider, was
          Penny Wristen someone who was known to the
          eyewitness before all this took place or were
          they strangers?  If the eyewitness knew Penny
          Wristen before, you may probably attach more
          weight to the identification.  Here, we know
          all four of those eyewitnesses were total
          strangers to Penny Wristen.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Please bear in mind, however, that we
          sometimes make mistakes when we try to
          recognize people we know quite well.  Some of
          you probably had the experience when someone
          comes up to you and says, &quot;I know you.
          Didn't you used to live at such and such a
          place?&quot;, or something similar, only to find
          out that you have been mistaken for someone
          else.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Even in this case, we were confronted by
          a situation of mistaken identification, when
          the individual with previous personal
          knowledge and acquaintanceship with Penny
          Wristen made a mistake.  You will recall the
          testimony of John Traynor, Andrew Wristen's
          employer.  He indicated that he knew Penny
          Wristen.  She used to drop by the place of
          employment sometimes.  He saw her a dozen
          times and he would speak to her.  Sometime,
          during the summer of 1994 &#150; that would be
          almost a year post disappearance &#150; he and his
          wife were driving up to look at the Dream
          Home at number 53 Highway and Garth Street
          and they were driving through the development
          towards the Home, and he said to his wife,
          &quot;That looked a lot like Penny&quot;, and it was a
          woman walking with a baby.  &quot;We were 20 to 30
          feet away.  The wife said no way that's
          Penny.&quot;.  He turned the car around and he
          returned to get a look at the woman and he
          checked the woman with the baby and he told
          you, members of the jury, he was wrong; that
          was not Penny Wristen.  That is an example of
          how easy it is to make a mistake with someone
          that you even know, and as you can see,
          members of the jury, the recognition of
          another person is more complicated than we
          might think it is.  Usually we do not think
          about how we recognize people we have seen
          before.  We take it for granted that we can
          tell the difference between one person and
          another.  However, we cannot afford to be
          casual about the identification of one person
          by another person.  I urge you to consider
          carefully what I have said to you about the
          evidence of eyewitnesses.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[18] The trial judge then fully reviewed the evidence of the four
defence witnesses.  The appellant does not complain about this
review except for a passage relating to Mr. Seager to which we
will refer later.  Following the review of the evidence the trial
judge concluded with the following directions:

               You should again examine the evidence of
	  these honest, helpful citizens in relation to
	  the earlier tests that I have suggested concerning
	  the identification of witnesses, namely that
          experience has shown that mistakes can occur when
	  one, two or more witnesses have made positive
	  identification.  Accordingly, where your 
	  consideration as to whether these witnesses did 
	  see Penny Wristen at the time and place indicated
	  as here depends wholly or substantially on the
	  correctness of identification. You must bear in
	  mind that there have been a number of instances
          where responsible people whose honesty was not in
	  question and whose opportunity for observation had
	  been adequate, made positive identifications, which
	  identifications subsequently proved to be erroneous.
          </pre>
    <pre>               You must be especially cautious before
          accepting such evidence of identification as
          correct.  If, however, after a careful
          examination of such evidence, in the light of
          all of the circumstances and with due regard
          to all of the other evidence in the case, you
          are satisfied or have a reasonable doubt
          raised because of the identification, you
          will act upon it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where a person, in this case Penny
          Wristen, is known by the identifying witness
          before the event in issue, the danger
          inherent in identification largely
          disappears.  But where Penny Wristen had no
          previous acquaintance with the witnesses, as
          in this case, you must consider the
          identifying witness' opportunity to observe,
          the length of time of the observations, their
          ability to observe and their powers of
          retention, and whether or not it is the type
          of event that they would recall with any
          degree of accuracy, as well as the other
          tests for identification that I had earlier
          reviewed with you.
          </pre>
    <pre>               If you accept the evidence of Gerald
          Seager, Shirley Connolly, Karen Pietrangelo
          or Ann Prevost or any of them, you should
          return a verdict of not guilty.  Even if you
          do not accept the evidence of Gerald Seager,
          Shirley Connolly, Karen Pietrangelo or Ann
          Prevost or any of them, but are left in a
          reasonable doubt by such evidence, you should
          return a verdict of not guilty.  Even if you
          are not left with a reasonable doubt by the
          evidence of those four witnesses or any of
          them, you should still proceed to determine
          whether on the basis of all of the evidence
          in these proceedings that the accused Andrew
          Wristen is guilty beyond any reasonable
          doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>               You might ask yourselves, members of the
          jury, if Penny Wristen were alive today, some
          many, many months after she disappeared, do
          you think she would know about the lengthy
          police investigation and the charging of her
          husband Andy Wristen with murder?  Do you
          think that Penny Wristen would know about
          this trial and its attendant publicity and
          wonder about the state of her children?  Does
          the evidence show her to be the type of
          person who would torture her mother and her
          many brothers and sisters and her children,
          and let them continue the search for someone
          who is safe but is playing games?  Does the
          evidence show Penny to be the type of person
          who would sit back and watch Andrew Wristen
          be tried for causing her death when she is in
          fact alive and well?  When you look at the
          totality of all of that, members of the jury,
          are you satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
          that Penny Wristen is dead?  If &quot;no&quot;, then
          your verdict is not guilty and your
          deliberations end right there.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[19] Counsel for the appellant at trial objected to the charge to
the jury.  He submitted that the strong caution concerning the
defence identification witnesses was inappropriate because that
evidence was exculpatory.  Counsel also objected to the charge
concerning Mr. Traynor.  He pointed out that the circumstances
under which Mr. Traynor made his mistaken identification were
very different from the circumstances under which defence
witnesses claimed to have identified Penny Wristen.  The trial
judge refused to recharge the jury.</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[20] The appellant made four submissions in support of his
conviction appeal:</pre>
    <pre>  1.   The trial judge unfairly undermined the position of the
       defence by the way he dealt with the defence identification
       evidence;     </pre>
    <pre>  2.   The trial judge misdirected the jury on the burden of proof
       and on their fact finding function;</pre>
    <pre>  3.   In addition to the defence identification evidence, the
       trial judge failed to adequately present to the jury the
       defence theory on other aspects of the evidence; and</pre>
    <pre>  4.   The trial judge misdirected the jury on the appellant&#146;s post
       offence conduct, that is on the evidence of consciousness of
       guilt;
</pre>
    <pre>[21] The most serious errors alleged concern the treatment of the
defence identification evidence and the position of the defence
in relation to that evidence. We will deal with those issues
first.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     1.   The treatment of the defence identification evidence</pre>
    <pre>[22] The principal error alleged by the appellant with respect to
the treatment of the defence identification evidence concerns the
standard of care the trial judge instructed the jury to apply to
that evidence.  In the context of that submission, it was also
argued that the trial judge misapprehended certain of the
evidence and, accordingly, misdirected the jury on the effect of
that evidence and failed to adequately place the position of the
defence before the jury.</pre>
    <pre>[23] There is little appellate authority to assist in dealing
with the appellant&#146;s principal ground of appeal.  Only two cases
brought to our attention touch the issue:  R. v. Jack (1992), 70
C.C.C. (3d) 67 (Man. C.A.) and R. v. Jeffrey (1989), 35 O.A.C.
321 (C.A.).  In our view, this ground of appeal engages the
following principles:

               a.   The scope of the trial judge&#146;s right
	       to express an opinion on the weight of
	       the evidence.
               </pre>
    <pre>               b.   The need for caution in relying on
               eyewitness identification.
               </pre>
    <pre>               c.   The trial judge&#146;s duty to present
               the position of the defence and the
               evidence in support of that position.
               </pre>
    <pre>               a.   The trial judge&#146;s expression of
               opinion
          
</pre>
    <pre>[24] One can find many statements on the scope of the trial
judge&#146;s right to express an opinion on the weight the jury should
attach to the evidence.  A convenient summary may be found in the
reasons for judgment of Martin J.A. in R. v. Garofoli et al.
(1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.)1 at 133:


	  It is well established that the trial judge is
	  entitled to express his own view of the facts
	  or of the credibility of witnesses and to express
	  his opinion in strong terms provided that he does
	  not use such language as leads the jury to think
          that they must find the facts in the way he
	  indicates, and provided the charge does not deprive
	  the accused of a fair presentation of his case to
	  the jury. Even though the trial judge has properly
	  instructed the jury that they are not bound by his
          views on the evidence, an appellate court may, none
	  the less, intervene if the opinion expressed by the
	  judge is far stronger than the facts warrant, or
	  where the judge has expressed his opinion so 
	  strongly that there is a likelihood of the jury
	  being overawed by them: see R. v. Ruddick (1980),
	  57 C.C.C. (2d) 421 at p. 435 (Ont. C.A.), leave
	  to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused
	  April 6, 1981, loc. cit.; R. v. Yanover and Gerol
          (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300 at pp. 319-20 (Ont. C.A.).
	  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[25] Although there has been some criticism of the broad
discretion conferred on the trial judge to express an opinion on
the facts of the case,2 this is still an accurate statement of
the law in this country.  Thus, it was open to the trial judge to
express his opinion on the facts concerning the defence
identification evidence provided that he made it clear that the
jury was not bound by that opinion.  In this case, the trial
judge gave a strong expression of his opinion about the weight to
be attached to the identification evidence when he told the jury
that they must be especially cautious before accepting the
defence evidence as correct and when he presented  in the form of
a series of rhetorical questions the proposition that if Penny
Wristen were still alive, she would have contacted her family.
[26] The trial judge, however, in terms that cannot be impeached,
had earlier instructed the jury that while they are bound to
apply the law as he would give it to them, they were obliged to
determine the case on their own view of the facts.  They were
also instructed to act upon their &#147;own conclusions as to the
evidence, the credibility of the witnesses and the issues with
which you have to deal&#148; and to disregard any opinions of the
trial judge with which they disagreed.
[27] The trial judge&#146;s opinion, expressed in the form of a series
of rhetorical questions that, if she were alive, Penny Wristen
would have contacted her family was a comment or opinion on the
evidence rather than a legal instruction.  In our view, it would
have been understood as such by the jury.  It therefore falls
within the bounds of permissible comment, given the earlier
instructions that the jury was obliged to disregard the judge&#146;s
opinion if they did not agree with it, provided the opinion was
not &#147;far stronger&#148; than warranted by the facts.
[28] In our view, this opinion did not unfairly undermine the
position of the defence.  We have summarized the prosecution&#146;s
evidence, much of it undisputed, demonstrating that Penny Wristen
had not left her home voluntarily on August 4, 1993.  The opinion
was not far stronger than warranted by the facts nor would it
likely overawe the jury.
[29] The trial judge gave the jury the standard instruction that
they were the sole triers of fact and were entitled to disagree
with any of his opinions on the evidence or credibility of
witnesses.  Moreover, the questions themselves were all directed
to the notion that if Penny Wristen were still alive, she would
not have abandoned her family, a common sense notion that, given
her character, the jurors would undoubtedly have considered
themselves, even without the judge&#146;s questions.  The questions
came after a detailed and, but for two matters we will come to,
accurate summary of the evidence of the four defence witnesses,
whom the trial judge called &#147;honest, helpful citizens&#148;.  Finally,
balanced against the series of rhetorical questions, throughout
his charge the trial judge instructed the jury to exercise
caution in considering the Crown&#146;s circumstantial case.  He told
the jury that they should &#147;proceed with caution&#148; when assessing
circumstantial evidence, that &#147;great care must be exercised by
you in using it&#148;, that they should consider the appellant&#146;s
statements &#147;very carefully&#148; and be &#147;most careful&#148; in assessing
them.  And when he reviewed the Crown&#146;s theory at the end of his
charge, he expressed no opinion on it.  For these reasons, we do
not think that the trial judge&#146;s opinion expressed by his series
of rhetorical questions was &#147;far stronger&#148; than warranted or that
it overwhelmed the jury to favour the Crown&#146;s case.
[30] On behalf of the appellant, Mr. Greenspan points out that
the series of questions fail to take into account the possibility
that the evidence of the defence witnesses is reliable, but
Mrs. Wristen met her death from other persons after she was seen
by the defence witnesses.  However, the jury could not have been
under any misapprehension that the Crown was required to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had caused the death
of his wife.  The same body of evidence that showed Penny Wristen
was dead also pointed to the appellant as the perpetrator.  The
possibility that she met her death at the hands of some other
person was, on the basis of this evidence, fanciful.
[31] To the extent that the trial judge&#146;s comments about the
weight to be attached to, and the care that must be exercised
with, the identification evidence, were merely expressions of
opinion by him on the evidence, there is no error of law.
However, it is at best unclear whether the trial judge was
expressing an opinion or giving instructions on the law.  In our
view, it is probable that the jury would take this part of the
charge as a set of legal instructions on how to deal with
identification evidence.  In view of this ambiguity, the case
must be approached on the basis that the jury would have
understood that these were instructions on the law rather than
mere expressions of opinion: Bigaouette v. The King, [1927]
S.C.R. 112.  We will therefore consider whether the comments
constituted legal misdirection.

     b.   The need for caution in dealing with eye-witness
          identification evidence         
</pre>
    <pre>[32] Where the prosecution&#146;s case depends substantially upon the
accuracy of eye-witness identification, the trial judge is
required to instruct the jury on the need for caution when
dealing with such evidence.  The charge must not only deal with
issues of credibility but also with the inherent frailties of
identification evidence because of the unreliability of human
observation and recollection:  R. v. Sutton, [1970] 2 O.R. 358
(C.A.); R. v. Miaponoose (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 419 (C.A.); R. v.
Mezzo, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 802; R. v. Turnbull (1976), 63 Cr. App. R.
132 (C.A.).  The trial judge should also instruct the jury about
the various factors that can affect the reliability of eye-
witness identification evidence and remind the jury that mistaken
identification has been responsible for miscarriages of justice
by reason of the wrongful conviction of persons who have been
mistakenly identified by one or more honest witnesses.  The
charge to the jury will often track the model charge from The
People v. Casey (No. 2), [1963] I.R. 33 (S.C.), which was
approved by this court in R. v. Sutton.
[33] In R. v. Jeffrey, Lacourciere J.A. speaking for this court
held that it was not an error for the trial judge to have given a
similar instruction to the jury when Crown witnesses gave
exculpatory eye-witness identification.  In that case, the
accused were charged with attempted murder and related offences.
They relied upon the fact that the witnesses who saw the gunman
were not able to identify their features and gave evidence that
tended to exonerate them.  Lacourciere J.A. held that the trial
judge was entitled to give a general caution to the effect that
identification evidence suffers from the inherent frailties of
human observation and that such evidence is notoriously
unreliable, even though the only identification evidence tended
to exonerate the appellants.
[34] Although the witnesses giving the exculpatory evidence in
Jeffrey were Crown witnesses, there is no basis in principle for
limiting the judgment to Crown witnesses. Admittedly, there are
differences between this case and Jeffrey.  The impugned
instructions in Jeffrey were given in the general portion of the
charge.  The directions in this case were made in relation to the
defence witnesses and went beyond a discussion of the frailties
and inherent weaknesses of the evidence.  The trial judge told
the jury that they had to be especially cautious before accepting
the defence evidence.  Nonetheless, the court&#146;s judgment in
Jeffrey shows that a trial judge is entitled to assist the jury
by pointing out, as this trial judge did, the general frailties
of this kind of evidence and why this evidence might be
unreliable.
[35] The other decision to which we were referred is the decision
of the Manitoba Court of Appeal in R. v. Jack.  Jack was an
appeal by the accused from his conviction for the murder of his
wife.  As in this case, the body of the deceased was never found
and the accused relied upon sightings of his wife after the date
she supposedly disappeared.  The trial judge&#146;s task was somewhat
more complicated in Jack because there were two sets of
identification witnesses.  The Crown relied upon the so-called
St. Anne witnesses.  They identified the accused as driving the
family automobile, a distinctive yellow Blazer, the night that he
claimed she had left, with the family car.  There was
circumstantial evidence tending to support the Crown
identification evidence.  However, in the course of the trial,
the Crown disclosed that the police had reports from two
witnesses, the so-called Charter House witnesses, who claimed to
have seen the accused&#146;s wife about a week after she disappeared.
The trial judge refused to declare a mistrial by reason of the
late disclosure but on a defence application called the two
witnesses.
[36] In Jack, as in this case, the defence complained about the
treatment of the exculpatory evidence. Scott C.J.M., speaking for
the court on this issue, described the charge as follows, at p.
106:

          When almost at the very end of the summary of
	  the witnesses' evidence, and indeed of the charge
	  itself, he returned to the issue of identification
	  evidence when reviewing the testimony of Garbutt
	  and Pike [the Charter House witnesses].  He again
	  sounded a warning about being &quot;extremely careful&quot;
	  in considering the evidence of eyewitnesses,
	  particularly when identifying strangers. He then
	  analyzed -- as he had with the Ste. Anne
          witnesses -- some similarities and differences
	  in their evidence. He incorrectly contrasted their
	  evidence with that of George Gershman (but
	  corrected this in his recharge). He then went on
	  to say:
          </pre>
    <pre>               So you can see that there is a need
               for you to be extremely careful when you
               consider this evidence of eyewitness
               identification. Before you accept it, you
               should look for other evidence that might
               support your conclusion that the
               identification of the woman as Christine Jack
               is accurate, even though there may be
               inconsistencies within the evidence of the
               various eyewitnesses who testified.
               </pre>
    <pre>               (Emphasis added.)
          </pre>
    <pre>          The trial judge immediately thereafter noted that
	  whereas with respect to the Ste. Anne witnesses
	  there was other evidence independent of their
	  identification of the man, such as identification
	  of the Blazer by Hudrick and Ste. Marie, which could
	  help decide if, in fact, they had correctly
          identified Brian Jack:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Here, with these witnesses [Pike and Garbutt]
	       you do not have such independent evidence.
	       You have basically identification by two
	       witnesses who primarily relied on the face
	       and hair of the woman. As I've said, you
               should be extremely careful when you consider
               this evidence.
               
</pre>
    <pre>[37] Scott C.J.M. held that this constituted misdirection.  He
explained the error in the following terms at pp. 107-8:
          
          The initial caution about the eyewitness 
	  identification evidence of the Charter House
	  witnesses was not inappropriate in the context
	  of the charge as a whole. There was, however, a
	  clear suggestion that the jury had to &quot;accept&quot;
	  the evidence of the Charter House witnesses
	  presumably before drawing inferences from it 
	  favourable to the accused, but that, unlike the
	  evidence of the Ste. Anne witnesses, there was no
	  supporting independent evidence. This suggestion
	  was wrong. In my opinion, a fair analogy can be
	  made between identification witnesses in this
          case, particularly the Charter House witnesses,
	  and alibi witnesses. Indeed, in a very real sense,
	  the evidence of Garbutt and Pike dealt with the same
	  kind of &quot;time and place&quot; testimony critical to a
	  consideration of alibi evidence called on behalf of
          an accused. Ever since the authoritative decision of
	  the Supreme Court in Lizotte v. The King (1950), 
	  99 C.C.C. 113, [1951] 2 D.L.R. 754, [1951] S.C.R. 115,
	  the law has been clear that an alibi need not be
	  proved; it need only raise a reasonable doubt in the
	  minds of the jury.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In my opinion, the jury in this
          case ought to have been charged as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a) if the jury accepted the evidence of
          the Charter House witnesses, they were
          entitled to (and, indeed, probably should)
          return a verdict of not guilty;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) even if they did not accept the
          evidence of those two witnesses, but were
          left in a reasonable doubt by it, they should
          also return a verdict of not guilty, and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c) even if not left with a reasonable
          doubt by the evidence of Garbutt and Pike,
          they should still go on to determine whether
          or not on the basis of all the evidence the
          accused was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
          [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[38] The trial judge in Jack thus made two errors.  He
erroneously instructed the jury that they had to be extremely
careful before accepting the defence evidence because there was
no independent evidence to support it.  As well, this part of the
charge did not conform to R. v. W. (D.), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.
There is no suggestion, however, that the trial judge erred in
directing the jury to be &#147;extremely careful&#148; in considering the
evidence of eyewitnesses, a direction that in the circumstances
would apply both to the Crown evidence and the exculpatory
witnesses called by the judge.
[39] The trial judge in this case did not fall into either of the
errors identified in Jack. After advising the jury of the need
for caution in dealing with this evidence, the trial judge
charged the jury in accordance with the suggestions in Jack and
in a manner consistent with the suggested charge in R. v. W.
(D.).  Those instructions made it clear that the jury did not
have to &#147;accept&#148; the defence evidence and that this evidence on
its own could raise a reasonable doubt and lead to an acquittal.
The &#147;especially cautious&#148; direction in this case is little
different from the &#147;extremely careful&#148; direction in Jack.
[40] The question of the correct instructions where the defence
relies upon potentially unreliable evidence has arisen in other
contexts.  In several cases, this court has dealt with the
propriety of jury instructions concerning the evidence of alleged
accomplices or persons of disreputable character who give
exculpatory evidence favouring the defence.  In those cases, this
court has held that it is permissible for the trial judge to
direct the jury to view their evidence with caution and explain
the reasons for the caution.  For example, in R. v. Cavanagh and
Donaldson (1976), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 134 (Ont. C.A.) at 144, Evans
J.A. held that it would have been open to the trial judge to
direct the jury that the evidence of the defence witnesses, in
that case, must be viewed with caution because their motives may
be suspect and because of their past criminal records.
[41] However, it is wrong for the trial judge to go further and
give a warning similar to that suggested in R. v. Vetrovec,
[1982] 1 S.C.R. 811 for Crown witnesses.  In Vetrovec, the
Supreme Court of Canada held that where the evidence of a suspect
witness occupies a central position in the demonstration of guilt
the trial judge should warn the jury of the risks of adopting,
without more, the evidence of the witness.  As explained in Jack
and W. (D.), such a warning is inconsistent with the fundamental
principle that the accused must be acquitted if the jury has a
reasonable doubt based upon the defence evidence alone, even if
that evidence emanates from alleged accomplices or persons of
disreputable character. In R. v. Watkins (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d)
341 (Ont. C.A.) at 344-45, this court held that it was
misdirection to give a Vetrovec warning in relation to allegedly
unsavoury defence witnesses.  In that case, the trial judge had
directed the jury to scrutinize the evidence of the defence
witnesses with &#147;great care&#148; and warned them that it is &#147;dangerous
for you to act on the evidence of such a person unless
corroborated&#148;.  Again, however, it seems that it is the warning
that was held to be misdirection and not simply the instruction
to proceed with great care.
[42] To a similar effect is the decision of this court in R. v.
Tzimopoulos (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 304 (Ont. C.A.).  In that
case, the trial judge had given the following direction at
p. 339:

	It is recognized in our law as well that if you 
	find that a witness was a person who had an unsavoury 
	character, I must tell you that the evidence of that 
	person should be scrutinized and weighed by you with 
	great care. I must warn you that it is dangerous for 
	you to act on the evidence of a person whom you find 
	to be of unsavoury character, unless there is some 
	other evidence independent of the evidence of that 
	witness which supports it. There are cases where, 
	no doubt, even the Crown presents to the court, 
	because of its duty to bring out all of the evidence, 
	a person of disreputable character. Sometimes those
        are the only persons who can give evidence. But I warn 
	you, as a matter of law, that the evidence of any such 
	person, whether called by the Crown or by the defence, 
	should be scrutinized and weighed with great care.
          </pre>
    <pre>[43] The court held that this was misdirection, but again because
of the instruction respecting confirmatory evidence.  The court
held as follows at pp. 339-40:

	A trial judge is entitled to express an opinion
	on the credibility of witnesses, including the 
	accused, and to do so in fairly strong language, 
	provided he makes it clear to the jury that the 
	issue of credibility is for them: see R. v. Olson
        (1929), 51 C.C.C. 122, [1929] 2 D.L.R. 300, 23 
	Sask. L.R. 321 (Sask. C.A.); R. v. Dorland (1948), 
	92 C.C.C. 274, [1948] O.R. 913, 6 C.R. 485 (Ont. 
	C.A.); R. v. Cavanagh and Donaldson (1976),
        33 C.C.C. (2d) 134, 75 D.L.R. (3d) 189, 15 O.R. 
	(2d) 173 (Ont. C.A.), and R. v. Yanover and Gerol 
	(1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (Ont. C.A.). However, 
	in the present case the trial judge did far more 
	than express an opinion on credibility. As Mr. 
	Wright pointed out he, in effect, gave a Vetrovec 
	warning to the jury (see Vetrovec v. The Queen 
	(1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1, 136 D.L.R. (3d) 89, 
	[1982] 1 S.C.R. 811 (S.C.C.)) in that he instructed 
	them that it was dangerous for them to act on the 
	evidence of defence witnesses, including that of the 
	appellant, unless there was independent confirmatory 
	evidence. This was wrong. The accomplice rule never 
	applied to witnesses giving evidence favourable to the
        defence: see R. v. Cavanagh and Donaldson, supra, at 
	p. 144. The Vetrovec warning should only be given 
	where a witness is giving evidence that assists in 
	the demonstration of guilt.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[44] In our view, these cases stand for the following
propositions.  It is not misdirection for a trial judge to direct
a jury to approach certain kinds of defence evidence with care.
The need for care may be because of the character of the witness,
as in Cavanagh, or the inherent frailties of the evidence, as in
Jack.  The trial judge may also instruct the jury on the reasons
why caution is needed.  What the trial judge must not do is go
further and direct the jury that it is dangerous to act on that
evidence alone.  That constitutes an error in law.
[45] No case suggests that merely instructing the jury to be
especially cautious or extremely careful in considering defence
evidence constitutes an error of law, especially where that
instruction is accompanied by an instruction that accords with R.
v. W. (D.).  Rather, the instruction must be considered in the
context of the charge.  If the appellate court is satisfied that
when the charge is considered as a whole, an especially cautious
instruction did not unfairly undermine the defence position, the
appeal may be dismissed.  We are satisfied that the &#147;especially
cautious&#148; direction in this case did not unfairly undermine the
defence.  The trial judge was entitled to assist the jury by
pointing out, as this trial judge did, the general frailties of
this kind of evidence and why this evidence might be unreliable.
[46] We would, however, make the following observations.  The
need for special care concerning eye-witness identification
evidence arises because of the danger of a wrongful conviction.
That danger does not exist where the eye-witness evidence tends
to exculpate the accused.  Such a direction may leave the jury
with an erroneous impression about the quality of evidence
required to raise a reasonable doubt.  It follows that such an
instruction should be avoided.  It is far better for the trial
judge to alert the jury to the reasons for the frailties of the
evidence in the particular case, always reminding the jurors that
they need not accept the defence evidence, that it is sufficient
if the defence evidence leaves them with a reasonable doubt.
         
      c.   The duty to present the defence position
          
</pre>
    <pre>[47] The trial judge is required to present the position of the
defence and the evidence in support of that position.  The most
recent expression of that principle by this court is in the
reasons of the majority in R. v. Mullins-Johnson (1996), 112
C.C.C. (3d) 117 (Ont. C.A.)3 at 123:
         
          It is the duty of the trial judge to place the
	  defence before the jury and to refer the jury to
	  the substantial evidence bearing on the defence
	  in a way that will ensure the jury's due 
	  appreciation of the evidence: R. v. Yanover and
	  Gerol (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d) 300 (Ont. C.A.), 
	  at p. 328. The function of this court is not to
	  subject the directions to the jury to minute
          scrutiny and criticism but rather to examine it
	  as a whole to see whether the jurors would
	  adequately understand the issues involved, the
	  law relating to the charge the accused is facing,
          and the evidence they should consider in resolving
	  the issues: R. v. Cooper (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289
	  (S.C.C.), at p. 301.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[48] In our view, the trial judge did carry out the duty as
described in Mullins-Johnson.  The trial judge fully reviewed the
evidence of the four witnesses and related that evidence to the
defence position that the appellant could not have killed Penny
Wristen on August 4, 1993 because she was seen alive by
independent and honest witnesses after that date.  Mr. Greenspan,
however, raised three points about the review of the evidence and
its relation to the defence position as follows:

               i.   The trial judge failed to point out
	  the differences in the circumstances between
	  the mistaken identification by Mr. Traynor and
	  the identifications by the four defence witnesses.
          </pre>
    <pre>               ii.  The trial judge did not accurately
          summarize Crown counsel&#146;s cross-examination
          of Mr. Seager on his statement to the police.
          </pre>
    <pre>               iii. It was not accurate to say that all
          four witnesses testified to seeing Penny
          Wristen long after the date of her alleged
          disappearance.  Mr. Seager testified that he
          saw her the day after the disappearance and
          Shirley Connolly testified that she saw her
          about six weeks later.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[49] While we will deal with each of these points in turn, we are
satisfied that the trial judge adequately carried out his duty to
fairly present the defence position and the evidence in support
of that position.

          i.   Treatment of the evidence of John Traynor
          
</pre>
    <pre>[50] In his instructions about the frailties of eye-witness
identification, the trial judge asked the jury to recall their
own experience of possibly having been mistaken for someone else.
To illustrate the point the trial judge referred to the evidence
of Mr. Traynor.  He reviewed the evidence and concluded with the
observation that this was an example of &#147;how easy it is to make a
mistake with someone that you even know, and as you can see,
members of the jury, the recognition of another person is more
complicated than we might think it is&#148;.  The trial judge
completed that part of the charge by urging the jury to &#147;consider
carefully what I have said to you about the evidence of
eyewitnesses&#148;.  He then turned to a review of the evidence of the
defence witnesses.
[51] Neither at trial nor on appeal was it argued that this part
of Mr. Traynor&#146;s evidence was inadmissible.  Accordingly, we need
not deal with that question.  However, this evidence was of
slight probative value and it was not appropriate to compare that
evidence to the evidence of the defence witnesses. Mr. Traynor&#146;s
evidence was, in this case, a poor example of the possibility of
mistaken eyewitness identification because he had only a fleeting
glance of the person he mistakenly identified as Penny Wristen.
By comparison, the four defence witnesses had an adequate
opportunity to observe the woman they identified and each
provided a description, which included distinctive features
matching those of Penny Wristen.  Still we are not persuaded that
the reference to Mr. Traynor&#146;s evidence prejudiced the defence.
The jury must be given some credit.  They would have understood
that the conditions under which Mr. Traynor mistakenly identified
Penny Wristen were far different from the conditions under which
the defence witnesses made their identification.

          ii.  Treatment of the evidence of Gerald Seager
          
</pre>
    <pre>[52] Mr. Seager&#146;s evidence was important to the defence.  He saw
the woman believed to be Mrs. Wristen the day after her
disappearance.  The trial judge concluded his review of Mr.
Seager&#146;s evidence by reference to a statement he gave to the
police.  In the statement, Mr. Seager said:

          This woman definitely is or was similar in
	  appearance and build to the woman described
	  in the newspaper article.  I don&#146;t know if
          this may be of some help.  It may indeed be
	  another person altogether.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[53] Mr. Seager was cross-examined on this statement as follows:

          [CROWN COUNSEL] Q.:&quot;I don't know if this
	  may be of some help.  It may indeed be
 	  another person altogether.&quot;?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.  Yes, I'm taking into consideration
          it was four in the morning.  There was a
	  slim margin of error, but.
          </pre>
    <pre>          HIS HONOUR:  There was what?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.  Four o'clock in the morning.
          </pre>
    <pre>          HIS HONOUR:  And you said something about
          &quot;There was a margin&quot;?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.  What I am saying is I'm taking into
          consideration there would be a slim margin of
          error.
          </pre>
    <pre>          [CROWN COUNSEL] Q.:  So you are allowing
          for the possibility that you may be mistaken?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.  A small percentage.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[54] In the charge to the jury, after summarizing Mr. Seager&#146;s
evidence in chief, the trial judge referred to the statement to
the police as follows:

          He was confronted with his statement that he
	  gave to the police and that statement read: 
	  &quot;This woman was similar in appearance or build&quot;,
	  and you will recall my earlier instructions to you
          concerning witnesses who made different statements
	  at different times.  That can go to assessing
	  their credibility.  And you will recall in
	  cross-examination he admitted that he doesn't know
	  if this may be of some help, and it may indeed be
	  another person altogether.  [Emphasis added.]
          
[55] We agree with Mr. Greenspan that this was not an entirely
accurate summary of Mr. Seager&#146;s cross-examination.  The cross-
examination is set out above.  Although he conceded a small
percentage of error, this is consistent with his examination in
chief to the effect that he was 98 to 99 percent certain it was
Penny Wristen.  It does not seem that he otherwise adopted the
portion of the statement that it could be another person
altogether.  It would have been more accurate for the trial judge
to add that when confronted with the statement to the police Mr.
Seager conceded the possibility of a slim margin for error.  On
the other hand, the jury was instructed to make its own findings
of fact.  We do not consider the trial judge's omission to be
serious.  The jury would have fairly understood the overall tenor
of Mr. Seager&#146;s evidence and its significance for the defence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          iii. The timing of the sightings          
</pre>
    <pre>[56] The trial judge began his summary of the defence position
with the following statement:

          What is &quot;such alternative&quot;?  You should consider
	  and consider with care and concern the evidence
	  of Gerald Seager, Shirley Connolly, Karen Pietrangelo
	  and Ann Prevost, all of whom testified in respect
	  of seeing Penny Wristen long after the date
          of her alleged disappearance.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[57] The statement that these sightings were &#147;long after&#148; the
alleged disappearance was not accurate, at least for the witness
Seager.  However, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not
intend to disparage the evidence by this comment.  This comment
was no more than a way of summarizing the defence position that
Penny Wristen was still alive well after the Crown claimed that
she was dead.  Moreover, the trial judge later accurately
summarized the evidence of these witnesses, including the dates
of their encounters with the woman they believed to be Mrs.
Wristen.
               d.   Conclusion   
</pre>
    <pre>[58] In summary, therefore, we are not persuaded that these
aspects of the trial judge&#146;s charge on the eyewitness
identification evidence called by the appellant, either
individually or collectively, undermined the appellant&#146;s defence
or rendered his trial unfair.  We would not give effect to this
ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>          2.   The burden of proof and making findings of fact
     </pre>
    <pre>[59] Mr. Greenspan submitted that the trial judge misdirected the
jury in the approach to making findings of fact.  That submission
was based on a portion of the charge where the trial judge
directed the jury along the following lines:

          Again, you decide  what you believe  and you put
	  it into the pool.  You apply the law to the pool
	  and you decide whether or not the vital elements
	  of the alleged offence have been proven beyond a
	  reasonable doubt.        
</pre>
    <pre>[60] Mr. Greenspan argued that this was similar to the error
found by this court in R. v. Miller (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 678
(C.A.).  In that case, the trial judge had used a colourful
example that would have left the jury with the impression that
only evidence accepted as true and reliable could be used on the
crucial application of reasonable doubt.  That error is of
particular importance where there is exculpatory evidence that
may not on its own be true and reliable but may nevertheless be
capable of raising a reasonable doubt.  That was the case in
Miller, where the defence relied upon certain utterances by the
deceased and the accused&#146;s statement to the police.
[61] In our view, when considered in context, the impugned
instruction did not constitute misdirection.  These instructions
were part of a lengthy explanation of the approach to fact-
finding that was generally in accord with the decision of the
Supreme Court in R. v. Morin, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345.  The jury
would understand that they could only find that the Crown had
proved each of the elements of the offence on the basis of
evidence that they accepted.  Thus, Crown evidence that was
suspect or undermined by cross-examination would not make it into
the pool and thus would not be capable of proving the case
against the appellant.  The trial judge dealt with the
exculpatory defence evidence separately and in different terms,
which we have discussed above.</pre>
    <pre>          3.   The position of the defence     
</pre>
    <pre>[62] We have already dealt with the principal defence position,
that Penny Wristen was still alive after her alleged death at the
hands of the appellant.  Mr. Greenspan submitted that the trial
judge also failed to adequately present the defence theory on
certain other aspects of the evidence.  This submission is not
borne out when the charge is considered as a whole.  The charge
contained an exhaustive review of the evidence, including the
cross-examination, that may have weakened certain aspects of the
Crown&#146;s case.  For example, with respect to the blood spatter
evidence, the trial judge read verbatim from a transcript of this
evidence.  While it might have been more helpful to the jury for
the trial judge to have summarized that expert evidence, the
approach he took was not wrong:  Thriault v. The Queen, [1981] 1
S.C.R. 336.</pre>
    <pre>          4.   Post-offence conduct (consciousness of guilt)    
</pre>
    <pre>[63] There was evidence of post-offence conduct by the appellant
that was capable of supporting an inference of guilt,
particularly his conflicting statements concerning the
disappearance of his wife.  The trial judge was therefore
entitled to instruct the jury on the significance of this
evidence.  This case was tried prior to the decisions of this
court and the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. White (1996), 29
O.R. (3d) 577 (C.A.), affirmed [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72.  The trial
judge therefore directed the jury in accordance with a prior
decision of this court4 that the inference of consciousness of
guilt could only be made if the Crown proved beyond a reasonable
doubt that the appellant&#146;s statements were false.  In this sense,
the charge was unduly favourable to the appellant.  The appellant
submits, however, that the trial judge overstated the evidentiary
significance of after-the-fact conduct evidence.  In one portion
of the charge, the trial judge directed the jury that if it is
known and clear that an accused set up a false statement, he is
&#147;obviously trying to cover up and that is a sign from which you
can infer a consciousness of guilt&#148;.  The trial judge also said
that consciousness of guilt &#147;may in some circumstances afford the
strongest evidence &#133; where nothing but hallucination or a mistake
of the extraordinary or bizarre kind could otherwise explain the
conduct&#148;.
[64] These generalizations were unfortunate and are not in
accordance with the decision in White (see in particular p. 85).
However, they are found in a lengthy and somewhat academic
discussion of the concept of consciousness of guilt, divorced
from the facts of the appellant&#146;s case.  When the trial judge
actually turned to the facts of this case and instructed the jury
how to apply the law to those facts he gave a correct, indeed
overly favourable, direction to the jury. He said:

          It is for you, members of the jury, to say 
	  whether the accused made any false statements.
	  The fact that an accused person has made a
	  false statement may be considered evidence of
          consciousness of guilt and be considered by you
	  in the light of all the other proved facts in
	  deciding the question of guilt or innocence.  It
	  is not enough that you do not believe a statement
          made by the accused; you should only infer a
	  consciousness of guilt if a significant statement
	  made by him has been proven beyond a reasonable
	  doubt to have been false.  If you find that the
	  accused did make these statements, or any of them,
	  and that they were proved to be false, then you
	  will ask yourselves whether he made those statements
	  to conceal his part in the affair; that is to say to
	  throw the police onto a false scent or hide his
	  identity and put the blame on someone else, or whether
          there is some other explanation as, for example, fear
	  of authority, embarrassment or panic.  Not every false
	  statement is evidence of a consciousness of guilt.  It
	  is for you to say what is the effect of this evidence
	  and the significance, if any, to be attached to such
	  evidence.
          
</pre>
    <pre>And later:</pre>
    <pre>          As I earlier directed you, the fact that an
	  accused made false statements may be evidence
	  of consciousness of guilt, and may be considered
	  by you in the light of all the other proved
          facts when you are dealing with the guilt or 
	  innocence of the accused Andrew Wristen.
          </pre>
    <pre>          If you find the accused did make the false
          statements to the police and to others, then
          you must ask yourselves whether he made those
          statements to conceal his part in the crime
          and throw the  police on a false scent, hide
          his identity and put the blame on someone
          else, or whether there is some innocent
          explanation; for instance, fear, panic or
          embarrassment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Not every false statement, members of the
          jury, is evidence of consciousness of guilt.
          It is for you to say what is the effect of
          that evidence and the significance, if any,
          to be attached to it.
          
[65] Finally, defence counsel, who was alert to the issue, made
no objection to the charge on consciousness of guilt.  Before the
charge, defence counsel raised with the trial judge what evidence
would be included in the instruction on consciousness of guilt.
The trial judge said that he would refer only to the evidence of
the appellant&#146;s false statements.  That was acceptable to defence
counsel, who never raised the issue again.
[66] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.
Accordingly, we would dismiss the appellant&#146;s conviction appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The Appeal from Parole Ineligibility</pre>
    <pre>[67] The trial judge imposed a period of parole ineligibility of
17 years.  The appellant submits that this period should be
reduced for two reasons:  the trial judge erred in principle in
taking into account the appellant&#146;s failure to disclose the
location of the body as an aggravating factor; and 17 years is
outside an acceptable range.
[68] At the time of trial, the appellant was 48 years old.  He
had a criminal record dating back to 1963 but his only conviction
for a crime of violence was the assault on his wife in October
1992, for which he received a suspended sentence and one year
probation.  Thus, he was on probation when he killed his wife.
After killing his wife, he demeaned her character to others,
including the police.  He also tried to conceal her death, going
as far as conscripting his daughter to assist him in the cover-
up.
[69] The appellant&#146;s pre-sentence report was generally
unfavourable, but did show that he had a difficult childhood.  As
an adult, the appellant had a history of alcohol abuse but
nonetheless had been hardworking throughout most of his life.
[70] In setting the period of parole ineligibility, the trial
judge took into account the appellant&#146;s character, including his
previous criminal record, his history of abusing Penny Wristen,
the nature of the offence, that is spousal murder, the
appellant&#146;s efforts to cover up the killing and the jury&#146;s
recommendations.  The jury was not unanimous.  Six jurors
recommended periods of parole ineligibility ranging from 14 to 16
years, three jurors recommended periods ranging from 18 to 20
years and three jurors made no recommendation.
[71] In sentencing the appellant, the trial judge also referred
to and relied on the appellant&#146;s failure to disclose the location
of Penny Wristen&#146;s body, thus denying the family the opportunity
&#147;to lay her body to rest&#148;.  The trial judge said:

    As well, I have reflected upon the two victim impact
    statements filed.  I note that the sister, Susan Campbell,
    dramatically relates the &#147;trauma and upheaval&#148; the murder
    of her sister has had upon her life.  The sister, Wendy
    Browes, described what she indicates has been a heartrending
    ongoing nightmare.  She also relates that her tears now are
    out of frustration.  &#147;Once she is laid to rest I may cry
    tears of loss and begin to mourn.&#148;  Susan Campbell indicates,
    &#147;Grieving cannot truly take place until we are able, if ever,
    to lay her body to rest.&#148;  You have chosen not to give them
    that opportunity.
</pre>
    <pre>[72] The appellant submits that this passage amounts to an error
in principle because the trial judge then used the appellant&#146;s
refusal to disclose the whereabouts of the body as an aggravating
consideration in fixing the period of parole ineligibility.  We
do not agree with the appellant&#146;s submission.
[73] The appellant was not legally obliged to assist the police.
He was entitled to exercise his right to silence and require the
prosecution to prove the case against him beyond a reasonable
doubt.  Exercising this right is not an aggravating consideration
on sentence.  R. v. Kozy (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 545 (C.A.).
However, the trial judge did not offend this principle in relying
on the appellant&#146;s unwillingness to disclose the location of his
wife&#146;s body.  Under s.744 (now s.745.4) of the Criminal Code, the
trial judge, in fixing the period of parole ineligibility is
required to consider both &#147;the nature of the offence and the
circumstances surrounding its commission.&#148;  The appellant
undoubtedly took elaborate steps to cover up his crime and to
dispose of his wife&#146;s body where it could not be found.  Having
done so, he then refused to tell either the family or the
authorities where the body was located.  These were all
circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence and the
trial judge could properly consider them in fixing the period of
parole ineligibility.
[74] The appellant&#146;s submission is similar to one made by the
accused in R. v. Shropshire, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, and rejected by
the Supreme Court of Canada.  In Shropshire, the accused pleaded
guilty to second degree murder.  The trial judge increased the
period of parole ineligibility, in part, because the accused
offered no explanation for what appeared to be an execution-style
killing.  The Supreme Court held that the trial judge did not err
in doing so.  Iacobucci J. explained that once convicted, an
accused who wants the minimum period of parole ineligibility must
&#147;play a somewhat more active role in the process.&#148;

     At the sentencing stage, the Crown has already proved
     beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused has committed
     the crime for which he or she stood charged or, as in
     this appeal, the accused has pleaded guilty to the
     offence; if the accused then seeks to receive the least
     severe sentence commensurate with his or her conviction
     (i.e., for second degree murder, life imprisonment with
     eligibility for parole after 10 years have elapsed) it is
     incumbent upon the accused to play a somewhat active role
     in the process.  I note that the right to silence is a
     manifestation of the presumption of innocence: R. v.
     Broyles, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595; R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
     151; R. v. Chambers, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293.  The presumption
     of innocence flows to those &#147;charged with an offence&#148; or
     suspected of having committed one; once an individual has
     been convicted of an offence he or she is no longer simply
     &#147;charged&#148;.  (at p. 248)
         
</pre>
    <pre>[75] Therefore, in our view, the appellant&#146;s hiding of the body
and refusal to disclose its whereabouts were &#147;circumstances&#148; to
be considered by the trial judge.  Moreover, the trial judge did
not unreasonably emphasize these circumstances.  Thus, we would
not give effect to the appellant&#146;s first submission on sentence.
[76] The appellant&#146;s second submission is that a period of 17
years parole ineligibility is &#147;demonstrably unfit&#148;, or outside an
acceptable range, even for the brutal murder of a spouse.  In
making this submission, the appellant relies on the recent
decision of this court in R. v. McKnight (1999), 44 O.R. (3d)
263.  In that case, a majority of the court reduced the period of
parole ineligibility of a man convicted of the vicious second
degree murder of his wife from 17 years to 14 years.  Laskin J.A.
canvassed and relied on several cases from this province in which
&#147;brutal second-degree murders of an unarmed wife or girlfriend&#148;
had attracted a range of 12 to 15 years parole ineligibility.
But in McKnight, there were several significant mitigating
circumstances that justified reducing the period of parole
ineligibility and that have no counterpart in the present case.
McKnight had no previous record; he was severely depressed when
the crime occurred and even the Crown&#146;s expert conceded that but
for his depression, he would not likely have killed his wife; he
expressed sincere remorse for what he had done; and he had
positive potential for rehabilitation.  Moreover, he made no
attempt to cover up his crime or hide his wife&#146;s body.
[77] In contrast, the appellant here can claim few, if any,
mitigating circumstances and can hardly deny the many aggravating
considerations associated with his crime.  The trial judge
summarized his view of the appellant in these unflattering words:

     You are a cold and calculating person who viciously
     killed his wife and you then deliberately attempted
     to cloak your  involvement in the crime.  Your acts
     show you to be a person devoid of heart, conscience
     or feelings.          
</pre>
    <pre>[78] This case therefore differs significantly from McKnight.
Unlike in McKnight, nothing in this case justifies interfering
with the 17 year period of parole ineligibility, which the trial
judge imposed in the exercise of his discretion after taking into
account all the considerations in s.745.4 of the Code.  We would
not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[79] We would therefore dismiss both the conviction appeal and
