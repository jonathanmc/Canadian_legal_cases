    <pre>                    ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the finding of the trial judge that
the conveyance of the home of the defendants Stornelli to the
appellant Granab Inc. was contrary to the Fraudulent Conveyances
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F-29 and the Assignment and Preferences Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. A-33.  As a result, the trial judge ordered that
the proceeds from the sale be paid to the plaintiff (judgment
creditor) in each action.  The trial judge also ordered that Grant
Kerr, a solicitor and a non-party in the actions, who had an
interest in the defendant companies, be jointly responsible with
Granab Inc. for the costs of both actions. Kerr seeks leave to
appeal against this order.

[2]  There was ample evidence that the Stornellis (more
particularly Ivy) were experiencing significant financial problems
at the time of the conveyance and that they were not meeting their
obligations.  There was therefore evidence upon which the trial
judge was entitled to draw an inference that the Stornellis were
insolvent within the meaning of the Assignment and Preferences
Act.

[3]  The suspicious circumstances of the conveyance and the
Sbadges of fraud” surrounding the transaction clearly support the
trial judge’s conclusion that the transaction was done with an
intent to defeat, hinder, delay, prejudice or defraud creditors
within the meaning of both acts. These circumstances include the
effect of the transaction on the creditor’s rights, the
relationship between the Stornellis and Kerr, the inadequacy of
the consideration and the involvement of  Kerr’s firm with respect
to the defence of one of the actions.

[4]  It is important to note that in order to arrive at these
conclusions, the trial judge disbelieved Kerr, the only witness to
testify for the defendants in both actions.  More particularly,
the trial judge did not believe that he did not know that the
Stornellis were insolvent and did not accept the alleged reasons
for the sale of the property as a legitimate business arrangement.
The trial judge also did not accept Kerr’s evidence as to
valuation his explanation of certain unusual and suspicious
circumstances of the conveyance.

[5]  In our view, the evidence supported the trial judge’s
conclusion that the conveyance contravened the provisions of the
Assignment and Preferences Act and that it was a fraudulent
conveyance within the meaning of the Fraudulent Conveyances Act.
It was also open to the trial judge to find that the defences
under the Fraudulent Conveyances Act and the Assignment and
Preference Act had not been made out.   We see no proper basis to
interfere with the trial judge’s conclusions.

[6]  As noted, Kerr also seeks leave to appeal the order for costs
against him. In our view leave should be granted and the appeal
allowed. The “straw man” principle enunciated in Re Sturmer and
Beaverton 1912, 2 D.L.R. 501 (Div. Ct.) has no application in this
case. There is no evidence that the corporation is a sham or that
Kerr acted through the corporation in order to avoid liability for
costs.  In Television Real Estate Limited v. Rogers Cable T.V.
Limited (1977), 34 O.R. (3d) 291, this court confirmed that costs
could only be ordered against a non-party under the Sturmer
principle where the test set out in Sturmer, as applied in the
case of Rockwell Developments Ltd. v. Newtonbrook Plaza Ltd.,
[1972] 3 O.R. 199 (C.A.) is met.  Nor is this a case of a
solicitor having been found guilty of misconduct in the
proceedings.

[7]  Although the trial judge's findings about Mr. Kerr's role in
the conveyance may well have warranted a costs order against him
had he been a party, it was incumbent on the plaintiff to join
Kerr as a party to the action for the purpose of costs, had it
wanted to rely on his participation in the transaction as a basis
for such liability.

[8]  Accordingly, we find no basis for the order of costs against
Kerr personally.

[9]  The appeal against judgment in both actions is dismissed with
costs.  Leave to appeal costs is granted, the appeal is allowed,
the order for costs against Kerr is set aside.  We make no order
as to costs on the latter appeal.</pre></td>
