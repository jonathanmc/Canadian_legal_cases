    <pre>HEARD:         November 5, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Gordon J. dismissing an appeal
from the conviction entered by Michel J. dated December 2, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  On December 2, 1998, the appellant was arraigned and charged
as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          CLERK OF THE COURT:  Lilliemay Yarlasky,
          between  01 March 1996 and 30 April 1996 at
          the Town of Latchford in the said region did
          by deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent
          means defraud the Town of Latchford of monies
          not exceeding $5,000.00 by failing to
          disclose a change of address which would have
          disentitled her from received benefits,
          contrary to Section 380(1)(b) of the Criminal
          Code of Canada.
          </pre>
    <pre>          CLERK OF THE COURT:  How is the Crown
          electing to proceed on these charges?
          </pre>
    <pre>          MR. BENSON [Crown]: Summarily.
          </pre>
    <pre>          CLERK OF THE COURT:  How do you plead to this
          charge guilty or not guilty?
          </pre>
    <pre>          MS. YARLASKY:  Guilty.
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:  You may be seated.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The Crown outlined the facts and the trial judge stated:
&#147;Are those facts substantially correct?&#148;  The appellant&#146;s counsel
replied:  &#147;Those facts are correct, Your Honour&#148;.  The trial
judge then stated:  &#147;There will be a finding of guilty&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  After hearing submissions from the Crown and the appellant&#146;s
counsel, the trial judge said: &#147;Miss Yarlasky, is there anything
you wish to tell the court in addition to what your counsel has
said?  Ms. Yarlasky replied:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Yes, I, I, I didn&#146;t pick up the cheque
          intentionally.  I didn&#146;t have any money,
          money coming from anywhere else.  I had just
          moved, so I didn&#146;t really have a chance to
          change my address.  And I did, I am sorry.
          And there was no intention &#150; it was just a
          cheque that I picked up and I didn&#146;t have a
          chance to change my address.  I am sorry.
          </pre>
    <pre>[4]  It is accepted that a guilty plea must be unequivocal; see
R. v. R.T. (1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 514 at 519 (Ont. C.A.).  This
plea is not unequivocal and cannot stand.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Accordingly, leave to appeal from the judgment of Gordon J.
is granted, the appeal is allowed and the plea of guilty is set
aside.  A new trial in the Ontario Court of Justice is ordered.</pre>
    <pre>                              Signed: &#147;G.D. Finlayson J.A.&#148;
                                      &#147;D. O&#146;Connor J.A.&#148;
                                      &#147;J.C. MacPherson J.A.&#148;</pre></td>
