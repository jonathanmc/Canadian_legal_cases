    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of B. Wright J. dated October 26, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is an appeal from the decision of B. Wright J.  dated
October  26,  1998  in  which he declared that  an  agreement  of
purchase and sale between two property development companies  had
terminated.  He also ordered that one of the companies return the
money  it  had received when it drew on a letter of credit  after
the  agreement was terminated.  The application before Wright  J.
turned principally, as does this appeal, on the interpretation of
a single clause in the agreement of purchase and sale.</pre>
    <pre>A.   Factual Background

[2]   The  appellant,  Law Development Group Georgetown  (No.  2)
Limited  (&#147;Law  Development&#148;), is a developer  of  a  residential
subdivision located in the Town of Halton Hills.  On October  22,
1997,  the respondents, Yorkwood Homes (Georgetown) Inc., Laurier
Homes  Limited  and  Yorkwood  Investments  Limited  (&#147;Yorkwood&#148;)
entered  into an agreement of purchase and sale (&#147;the agreement&#148;)
to purchase 164 lots in the subdivision from Law Development.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  agreement  signed by the parties  is  a  comprehensive
document, running to 27 pages and 54 clauses plus appendices.  It
governs all aspects of the relationship between the two companies
concerning  this housing project.  The parties agreed  that  they
had  to perform their contractual obligations in a timely fashion
in  accordance  with  the  various time  lines  set  out  in  the
agreement.  On this count, the agreement provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>    47. Time shall be of the very essence of this Agreement
        and no extension of time for the making of any payment
        or the doing of any act hereunder shall be deemed to 
        be a waiver or a modification of or affect this provision.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  It was mutually understood by the parties that they were not
in  complete  control  of the project.  The  housing  development
would  be  subject  to  the approvals of the  relevant  municipal
authority,  the  Town of Halton Hills, and the Ontario  Municipal
Board.  These approvals would be needed for not only the 164 lots
purchased by Yorkwood, but  for the entire subdivision, including
the   other   residential  lots  and  spaces  for   schools   and
recreational  facilities.   The  parties  contemplated  that  the
required approvals might be given at various times; specifically,
the  authorities  might  approve certain groups  of  lots  before
giving  approval  to  the entire plan of the  subdivision.   They
dealt  with this staged approval process and its potential impact
on  their  agreement in clause 2 of the agreement which provides,
inter alia:

          2.   &#133;
        </pre>
    <pre>          In the event the Plan of Subdivision has
          not  received  draft  plan  approval  in
          final  and binding form by December  31,
          1997,  the Vendor or the Purchaser  may,
          by  notice in writing given to the other
          before or within three (3) Business Days
          following  the foregoing date, terminate
          this  Agreement in respect of those lots
          for  which draft plan approval  has  not
          occurred.       Notwithstanding      the
          foregoing, the Vendor or Purchaser  may,
          by  notice in writing given to the other
          before or within three (3) Business Days
          following the foregoing date, extend the
          foregoing  date by a period of  six  (6)
          calendar months.  In the event that  the
          Vendor  has  not  received  draft   plan
          approval  in final and binding  form  by
          the  expiry  of such period of  six  (6)
          calendar months, the Purchaser  may,  by
          notice  in writing to the Vendor  before
          or   within  three  (3)  Business   Days
          following  the  expiry  of  such  notice
          period   of  six  (6)  calendar  months,
          extend  the foregoing date by a  further
          period  of  six (6) calendar months.  In
          the   event   that  this  Agreement   is
          terminated  with respect to any  of  the
          lots  as  aforesaid,  the  Vendor  shall
          return  the  Letter  of  Credit  to  the
          Purchaser  provided if such  termination
          relates to some but not all of the lots,
          the  Vendor  shall only be obligated  to
          return  the  Letter  of  Credit  to  the
          Purchaser  in exchange for a  Letter  of
          Credit applicable to the lots for  which
          this Agreement has not been terminated.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[5]   The parties, as noted above, entered into the agreement  on
October 22, 1997.  In late December 1997 they mutually agreed  to
extend the December 31 date in the first sentence of clause 2  to
January  14,  1998.  On January 12, 1998, in a  letter  from  its
solicitor  to Yorkwood&#146;s solicitor, Law Development purported  to
exercise  its right to extend the December 31 date contained   in
the second sentence of clause 2:</pre>
    <pre>          We have been instructed by the Vendor to
          advise   that  the  Vendor   is   hereby
          exercising its right pursuant to section
          2(b)  of  the Agreement of Purchase  and
          Sale  to  extend the condition date  for
          achieving draft plan approval  in  final
          and binding form to June 30, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The  third sentence of clause 2 gave Yorkwood, but not  Law
Development, the right to extend the period of time  another  six
months  beyond  June 30.  Yorkwood elected not  to  exercise  its
right,  thereby,  in its mind, terminating the entire  agreement.
Law  Development did not agree with this interpretation of clause
2;  rather  its  position  was that the  agreement  continued  in
operation after June 30.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   Meanwhile, on June 29 Law Development drew on a  letter  of
credit  for  $745,700.   In so doing it was  relying  on  another
portion of clause 2 of the agreement which provides:

         2.   &#133;</pre>
    <pre>            [T]he Vendor may draw for the following payments:
            </pre>
    <pre>             (i)  The sum of $745,700, being five percent (5%)of
                  the purchase price, on the date that the Plan of
                  Subdivision has received draft plan approval in
                  final and binding form;</pre>
    <pre>Yorkwood  contends  that  this money must  be  returned  because,
although  the agreement was still in force (for another  day)  on
June  29,  the  Plan of Subdivision had not received  draft  plan
approval in final and binding form on that date.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The legal status of the Plan of Subdivision, and of the lots
in   the  subdivision  purchased  by  Yorkwood,  depends  on  the
interpretation  of  a  decision of the  Ontario  Municipal  Board
(&#147;OMB&#148;).   On October 6, 1997 the OMB gave oral approval  to  the
draft  plan of subdivision.  The approval covered all 164 of  the
lots  purchased by Yorkwood.  The oral decision was confirmed  in
written form on October 29.</pre>
    <pre>B.   The Decision by Wright J.

[9]   When  Yorkwood realized that Law Development  regarded  the
agreement as still in force after June 30, 1998, and intended  to
keep  the  proceeds  of  the letter of credit,  it  initiated  an
application on September 16, 1998.  Yorkwood sought the following
relief:

     (a)  A declaration that an Agreement of Purchase and Sale entered
          into with Law Development Group Georgetown (No.2) Limited in
          respect of the Lands described therein and in Schedules &#147;A&#148; 
          and &#147;B&#148; attached hereto has been terminated;</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  An Order that Law Development Group Georgetown (No. 2)
          Limited shall forthwith return Letters of Credit as hereinafter
          described to the Applicant;</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  An Order that Law Development Group Georgetown (No. 2)
          Limited repay to this Applicant the sum of $745,700.00 in 
          respect of the amount drawn by Law Development Group 
          Georgetown (No. 2) Limited on Letters of Credit delivered
          in accordance with the Agreement of Purchase and Sale.</pre>
    <pre>     </pre>
    <pre>[10]  The application was heard by Wright J. on October 26,  1998
and  he released his reasons on November 3, 1998.  He granted the
application and made orders for the relief sought by Yorkwood  in
each  of  the above paragraphs.  The essence of his analysis  and
conclusion is set out in these passages from his reasons, at  pp.
4-6:</pre>
    <pre>          Yorkwood  takes  the position  that  the
          draft plan approval in final and binding
          form is a true condition precedent which
          automatically  terminated the  agreement
          when  the  condition was not  fulfilled.
          Further,  Yorkwood  maintains  that  the
          termination clause does not  require  it
          to give written notice of termination.
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>          The   material  components  of  a   true
          condition   precedent   are:   (a)   the
          performance of the condition is  in  the
          control  of  a third party  and  not  of
          either  of  the  two parties;  (b)  that
          neither party had promised to fulfil it;
          and  (c)  there  was  no  provision  for
          unilateral waiver by either party.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  requirement that draft plan  approval
          in  final and binding form occur  by  June
          30,  1998, was a true condition precedent.
          Since that condition was not satisfied  by
          June 30, 1998, the agreement terminated.
          </pre>
    <pre>          On  a  plain  reading of  the  termination
          clause, there is no positive obligation on
          Yorkwood   to  give  written   notice   of
          termination  to  Law  Development  in  the
          event that the condition precedent was not
          satisfied by June 30, 1998.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  only  obligation on Yorkwood  was  to
          give  written  notice to  Law  Development
          before  or within three days of  June  30,
          1998, if it wished to extend the agreement
          for a further six months. It chose not  to
          agree to another six-month extension  and,
          therefore, the agreement terminated.
</pre>
    <pre>      Law Development appealed from Wright J.&#146;s decision.
</pre>
    <pre>C.   Legal Issues</pre>
    <pre>     The legal issues to be determined on this appeal are:
    
 (1)  Was the agreement terminated on June 30, 1998?</pre>
    <pre> (2)  Can the appellant retain the $745,700 it drew pursuant to
      the letter of credit on June 29, 1998?
</pre>
    <pre>D.   Analysis

(1)  The Agreement &#150; In Force or Terminated?</pre>
    <pre>[11] Clause 2 of the agreement is not a well drafted contractual
provision.   Each of the four sentences in the  clause  set  out
earlier  in  these  reasons is very long and contains  difficult
wording.   Nevertheless,  the  essence  of  the  clause  can  be
discerned  by  a  careful reading.  We set out again  the  first
sentence of the relevant part of the clause because it assists in
the identification of that essence:

       2.   &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          In the event the Plan of Subdivision has
          not  received  draft  plan  approval  in
          final  and binding form by December  31,
          1997,  the Vendor or the Purchaser  may,
          by  notice in writing given to the other
          before or within three (3) Business Days
          following  the foregoing date, terminate
          this  Agreement in respect of those lots
          for  which draft plan approval  has  not
          occurred. [Emphasis added]
     
</pre>
    <pre>[12] In our view, there are two factors at work in this sentence.
The  first  factor is the relevant factual context,  namely  the
absence  of a Plan of Subdivision approved in final and  binding
form.   The  second factor is a potential response arising  from
this  factual  context,  namely the right  of  either  party  to
terminate  the  agreement.  However, termination of  the  entire
agreement  is not contemplated; rather, the wording is  clear  &#150;
termination can be obtained for only &#147;those lots for which draft
plan approval has not occurred.&#148;
[13] Against this background, what was the situation on December
31,  1997  (and,  by  extension through mutual  consent  of  the
parties, on January 14, 1998)?  The answer consists of two parts.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  First,  there had been no approval of a Plan of Subdivision
in  final  and  binding form.  The Order issued  by  the  OMB  on
October  29,  1997  had  a lengthy list of &#147;conditions  of  Draft
Approval  for  Plan  of Subdivision&#148;.  This document  began  with
these  words:  &#147;The Conditions which shall be fulfilled prior  to
final approval of this Plan of Subdivision are as follows.&#148;  Many
of  the  56 conditions which follow impose obligations on various
parties which must be fulfilled &#147;prior to final approval&#148; of  the
Plan of Subdivision by the OMB.  Typical of these conditions  are
conditions 2 and 50 which provide:

      2.   That the Owner agrees, prior to final approval, to enter
         into a Subdivision Agreement, to be registered on title, to
         satisfy all requirements, financial, servicing and otherwise to
         the satisfaction of the Town of Halton Hills.</pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;.</pre>
    <pre>      50.  That prior to final approval, the Director of Planning and
         Development Services of the Regional Municipality of Halton be
         advised how Condition 37 has been satisfied.
</pre>
    <pre>[15]  It is clear from the wording of these conditions, and  from
the fact that on October 29 the OMB stated that it &#147;withholds its
order&#148;, that by January 14, 1998 there had been no approval of  a
Plan of Subdivision in final and binding form.</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Second,  the  absence of a final Plan of  Subdivision  gave
either  party the right to terminate the agreement, but for  only
&#147;those  lots  for  which draft plan approval has  not  occurred.&#148;
However,  on  October 6 (orally) and October 29 (in writing)  the
OMB  had  given  draft approval to all of the lots  purchased  by
Yorkwood.   It  is  true  that the OMB  could  later  change  its
approval.   However,  with respect to the termination  rights  of
both  parties, the lots approval component of clause 2  does  not
contain the &#147;final and binding form&#148; language that qualifies  the
Plan of Subdivision approval.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Taking these two points together, on January 14,  1998  the
Plan   of   Subdivision  had  not  been  approved  in  the   form
contemplated  by  clause  2 of the agreement.   However,  neither
party  could  exercise any right of termination  because  all  of
Yorkwood&#146;s  lots  had been approved in the form  contemplated  by
clause 2.</pre>
    <pre>[18] Nothing changed between January 14 and June 30, 1998.   The
OMB made no further order in this time frame.1  Accordingly, the
draft  approval  of Yorkwood&#146;s lots remained  in  place.   Thus,
neither the initial potential six-month extension, open to  both
parties,  in the second sentence of clause 2, nor the additional
potential  six-month extension, open only to  Yorkwood,  in  the
third  sentence of the clause came into play.  That  is  because
those  extensions explicitly confirmed the rights of the parties
to  take the step permitted in the first sentence of the clause.
That  step was the termination of the agreement for &#147;those  lots
for  which  draft plan approval had not occurred.&#148;  As explained
above, after October 29, 1997 there were simply no Yorkwood lots
in this category.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  Interestingly, Yorkwood does not seriously challenge  this
interpretation of the words of clause 2.  It does not assert that
clause  2  created a right to terminate the entire agreement  if
there  was no draft approval of the Plan of Subdivision in final
and binding form by the relevant dates.  Such an assertion could
not  be  maintained in the face of the second component  of  the
wording  of  clause  2,  a component that in  the  circumstances
prohibits  termination  of  the  entire  agreement,  and  allows
termination  of  the agreement with respect to only  those  lots
which had not received draft approval.</pre>
    <pre>[20]  Yorkwood does assert that clause 2 must be interpreted  in
the  context of what it calls the true intent of the parties  at
the time the agreement was formed and the post-formation conduct
of the parties.  Yorkwood urges that the strict interpretation of
the agreement along the lines previously set out would result in
the  agreement continuing in force in perpetuity and  that  this
does  not make commercial sense.  Yorkwood places emphasis on  a
passage from Estey J.&#146;s reasons for judgment in a leading case in
contract law, Consolidated-Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler
and Machinery Insurance Co. (1979), 112 D.L.R. (3d) 49 (S.C.C.),
at p. 58:</pre>
    <pre>          Even  apart from the doctrine of  contra
          preferentem  as it may be applied in the
          construction  of contracts,  the  normal
          rules  of  construction lead a Court  to
          search for an interpretation which, from
          the  whole of the contract, would appear
          to promote or advance the true intent of
          the  parties at the time of  entry  into
          the   contract.   Consequently,  literal
          meaning  should not be applied where  to
          do  so  would bring about an unrealistic
          result  or a result which would  not  be
          contemplated    in    the     commercial
          atmosphere  in  which the insurance  was
          contracted.   Where words may  bear  two
          constructions, the more reasonable  one,
          which  produces  a  fair  result,   must
          certainly be taken as the interpretation
          which would promote the intention of the
          parties.   Similarly, an  interpretation
          which  defeats  the  intentions  of  the
          parties  and their objective in entering
          into  the commercial transaction in  the
          first  place  should  be  discarded   in
          favour  of  an  interpretation  of   the
          policy   which   promotes   a   sensible
          commercial result.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[21]  Yorkwood  contends that several factors  suggest  that  its
interpretation  of clause 2 should prevail.  First,  the  initial
OMB decision was made on October 6, 1997.  The parties signed the
agreement  on  October 22.  If draft approval of Yorkwood&#146;s  lots
took  place  on  the  former  date,  then  all  of  clause  2  is
irrelevant.    Second,  on  January  12,  1998  Law   Development
purported  to  extend the December 31 date in clause  2  for  six
months.   If  the  subject matter of that right had  expired  the
previous October, then Law Development did not need to make  this
extension.   The  fact  that  it did make  the  extension  is  an
indication that Law Development, not just Yorkwood, was operating
on  the assumption that the termination right in clause 2 was not
limited  to  only  unapproved  lots.   Third,  Yorkwood  attaches
significance to the fact that Law Development drew on the  letter
of  credit  on June 29, 1998, not in November 1997 which  it  was
entitled to do if its interpretation of clause 2 is correct.</pre>
    <pre>[22] These arguments are not without merit.  It is true that  Law
Development&#146;s  actions  do not reflect  a  recognition  that  the
agreement bound Yorkwood after October 29, 1997 and that  it  was
entitled  to  receive $745,700 much earlier than it  claimed  it.
However,  Law  Development&#146;s forbearance from  insisting  on  its
strict  legal  rights for several months does  not  amount  to  a
waiver of those rights.</pre>
    <pre>[23] In the end, Yorkwood&#146;s argument grounded in commercial sense
boils down to this: if Law Development&#146;s interpretation of clause
2 is correct, then the agreement continues in perpetuity once the
draft approval of Yorkwood&#146;s lots was granted by the OMB.</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The  answer  to this argument, in our  view,  is  that  the
parties  had  the opportunity to address the issue of termination
of  the  agreement.  In fact, they were not silent on this  issue
and  addressed  it  in two places.  In one of  those  places  the
language  of  the  agreement contemplates a  termination  of  the
entire agreement:
          </pre>
    <pre>       2.   ...
       </pre>
    <pre>          In the event the provisions of paragraph
          2(a)(ii)  [these  provisions  relate  to
          financing for the construction of sewers
          and a rail underpass and the securing of
          water allocations to the lots] have  not
          been  complied  with  by  September  30,
          1998,  the Vendor or the Purchaser  may,
          by  notice in writing given to the other
          before or within three (3) Business Days
          following  the foregoing date  terminate
          this  Agreement in respect  of  all  the
          lots.   [Emphasis added]
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[25] The second place in which the parties addressed the issue of
termination  of the agreement was in the portion of clause  2  in
issue  in this appeal.  Here the parties clearly provided  for  a
limited  right of termination anchored in the failure of the  OMB
to approve Yorkwood&#146;s lots.  This did not happen.</pre>
    <pre>[26]  In  sum,  Yorkwood&#146;s argument that  the  agreement  expired
naturally  on  June 30, 1998 in effect ignores the  existence  of
these  two  provisions in clause 2 and is, therefore,  incorrect.
Our  conclusion is that the parties specifically dealt  with  the
subject  matter of termination in their agreement.  With  respect
to  termination, if the OMB did not grant draft approval  of  the
Plan  of  Subdivision  in  final  and  binding  form  by  certain
prescribed  dates,  the termination right in  the  agreement  was
limited  to  only  those lots which had not received  draft  plan
approval.   On  the  facts,  this limitation  did  not  apply  to
Yorkwood  after  October  29, 1997.  Accordingly,  the  agreement
could not lapse, nor could Yorkwood terminate it for this reason.
It  follows that Law Development must succeed on this  ground  of
appeal.


(2)  The Letter of Credit</pre>
    <pre>[27]  On June 29, 1998 Law Development drew $745,700 on a  letter
of  credit.  In doing so, it purported to act pursuant to another
part  of  clause 2 of the agreement which, for ease of reference,
we set out again:</pre>
    <pre>       2.   &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          [T]he  vendor may draw for the following
          payments:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (i)  The sum of $745,700, being five percent (5%) of the
               purchase price, on the date that the Plan of Subdivision
               has received draft plan approval in final and binding
               form;
          
</pre>
    <pre>[28] In our view, Wright J. was correct to order that this money
be  returned  to  Yorkwood.  We reach this  conclusion  for  two
reasons.  First, as discussed above, at no time prior to June 30,
1998  had  the  OMB  given  the Plan of Subdivision  draft  plan
approval in final and binding form.  Second, in its documentation
to  the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce supporting its  draw,
Law  Development did not certify that the OMB had given such  an
approval.  Since a certification in these terms was required  by
clause 2(a) of the letter of credit, this money must be returned.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[29]  The  appeal  is  allowed with  respect  to  the  issue  of
termination of the agreement.  The agreement continues in force.</pre>
    <pre>[30]  The appeal is dismissed with respect to the issue  of  the
letter  of  credit.   Law Development must  return  $745,700  to
Yorkwood as ordered by Wright J.</pre>
    <pre>[31]  Since success is divided, each party should bear  its  own
costs of the appeal and in the court below.
