    <pre>On appeal from conviction by Beaulieu J. dated December 31, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>ENDORSEMENT
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was charged and convicted of robbery and using
an imitation weapon while committing the robbery.  He was
sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months.  He appeals his
convictions.
[2]  The main issue at trial was identification.  The trial judge
was satisfied that the identification of the appellant by the
victim as the person who robbed the victim while brandishing an
imitation handgun was reliable.  He was thus satisfied beyond a
reasonable doubt that the appellant, who did not testify, was the
person who committed the robbery.
[3]  The robbery occurred on a clear, sunny day; during part of
the robbery the victim and the appellant were about two feet
apart.  In the circumstances the victim had a good, albeit
relatively short, opportunity to see his assailant.
[4]  The victim provided a detailed description of his assailant.
The appellant is somewhat older and heavier than the person who
the victim described.  However, the discrepancies on which the
appellant relies are not so significant as to render the verdict
unreasonable when considered on their own or in the context of
the evidence as a whole.
[5]  Three days after the robbery the victim identified the
appellant in a 12-person photo line-up as the person who robbed
him.  The appellant submits that the photo line-up was flawed
because it contained head and shoulder photographs of 11 male
persons (and the appellant) whose general descriptions were based
upon the description on the appellant, not the description
provided by the victim.  We have reviewed the composition of the
photo line-up and in our opinion it was a fair and reasonable
photo line-up. Furthermore, we think that the victim&#146;s
identification of the appellant in the photo line-up was enhanced
by the victim&#146;s observation that although the photograph he
identified was of a male person who was not wearing glasses, his
assailant was wearing glasses.  Upon his arrest the appellant was
wearing glasses that fit the description of the glasses referred
to by the victim.  In addition, a police officer who knew the
appellant testified that whenever he saw the appellant he was
wearing those glasses.
[6]  A fair reading of the entirety of the trial judge&#146;s reasons
for conviction does not support the appellant&#146;s submission that
the trauma of the robbery &#147;cemented&#148; the appellant&#146;s appearance
in the victim&#146;s mind. In our view, the trial judge considered the
trauma of the moment as part of the narrative as set out in the
victim&#146;s evidence.  On this subject the trial judge said:

               The complainant had the opportunity in this case to observe
          the accused in broad daylight.  There can be no doubt that he was
          under tremendous stress to the extent, as he said, of putting his
          bowels in his underpants.  He nonetheless had the opportunity to
          see the assailant holding the gun in a manner in which it was
          held while he removed money from his wallet and he observed the
          accused&#146;s retreat with the accused warning him not to call the
          police.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The trial judge thoroughly reviewed the identification
evidence.  He was alert to the frailties of eye-witness
identification.  It is this court&#146;s function to review the trial
record, mindful of the dangers inherent in eye-witness
identification evidence, to determine whether the trier of the
fact, acting judicially, could reasonably have found that the
evidence supported the conclusion that the appellant was the
person who robbed the victim.  In our opinion, this evidence does
support the trial judge&#146;s conclusion on the issue of
identification.  We are unable to conclude that the verdict is
unreasonable, or a verdict that is not supported by the evidence.
[8]  The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</pre></td>
