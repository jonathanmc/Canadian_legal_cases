      <pre>HEARD:         September 22, 1999</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the sentenced imposed by Mr. Justice Sharpe dated
March 30, 1999.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The respondent, a first offender, was convicted of selling
50 grams of heroin for $5,500 to a police agent.  He pleaded not
guilty and after his conviction unsuccessfully raised an
entrapment argument.  The trial judge imposed a sentence of 2
years less one day.  The Crown seeks leave to appeal that
sentence and argues that the trial judge erred in principle by
overemphasizing the rehabilitation of the respondent.  The Crown
also argues that the sentence imposed was outside the established
range for sentences in such cases.
[2]  The respondent is 43 years of age, married, has two young
children and a large and supportive family.  He has gotten by
since he came to Canada on social assistance augmented by various
part-time jobs.  There is no suggestion that he is addicted to
any drug and it must be taken that commercial gain was his motive
for trafficking on this occasion.  The author of a pre-sentence
report observed that the respondent expressed no remorse and
displayed “an apathetic attitude” towards the offence.  The
respondent was on bail prior to sentence.
[3]  The trial judge identified denunciation, deterrence and
rehabilitation as the three key factors to be blended in imposing
the appropriate sentence.  In his view, the first and second
requires a significant period of incarceration, but the third
mitigated the length of the period of that incarceration and
permitted the trial judge to impose a maximum reformatory
sentence.
[4]  In our view, this appeal comes down to whether the sentence
imposed is outside the accepted range for this offence and these
circumstances.  Counsel referred us to many cases involving
trafficking in heroin.  No doubt, the offence almost always
attracts a significant jail term and usually calls for a
penitentiary term.  The trial judge could have imposed a sentence
of 3 or 4 years on these facts.  Myself and Osborne A.C.J.O.,
however, cannot say that the imposition of a maximum reformatory
term was outside of the range in these circumstances.  In so
holding, we defer to the trial judge’s conclusion that this
respondent demonstrated a strong potential for rehabilitation.
[5]  We would grant leave to appeal, but would dismiss the appeal
from the sentence imposed.
                                                                 
                               “Coulter Osborne per Doherty J.A.”
                                                                 </pre>
      <pre>                                                   “Doherty J.A.”</pre>
      <pre>CHARRON J.A. (Dissenting):</pre>
      <pre>[6]  I disagree with this result.  In my view, the sentence was
manifestly unfit, having regard to the usual range imposed upon
like accused for this type of offence.  While a lesser sentence
may be appropriate in circumstances where the chance of
rehabilitation can be convincingly demonstrated, in my view, the
record here does not support such a finding.  The sentencing
judge, in his reasons, noted an absence of mitigating factors
other than the fact that the appellant had no record and had a
supportive wife and a young family.  In my view, these factors do
not justify the imposition of a sentence that falls outside the
general range.
[7]  I would allow the appeal and increase the sentence, given
the findings of the trial judge of some chance at rehabilitation,
to 4 years imprisonment.
