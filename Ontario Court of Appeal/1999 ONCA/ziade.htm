    <pre>COUNSEL:    Daniel Kleiman, for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>            Graham Reynolds, Q.C., for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:      December 2, 1999</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Garton J. dated April
17, 1997 and on appeal from the sentence imposed by Garton J.
dated May 21, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]   The appellant was charged with one count of trafficking in
a narcotic contrary to s.4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act.  He
was tried and convicted on an acknowledged statement of facts.  A
motion was then made by counsel for the accused for a stay of the
proceedings arising out of the conduct of a police informant
named Lahham that counsel submitted amounted to entrapment.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In our view, the reasons of the trial judge, which are fully
supported by the evidence, are dispositive of this appeal.  She
said:</pre>
    <pre>          As indicated earlier, the most troubling
          factor in this case is the degree of the
          police agent&#146;s involvement in the offence
          itself.  On the other hand, the accused
          freely agreed to participate in the offence
          to be Lahham&#146;s &#147;front man&#148; for a profit.  He
          agreed to keep the heroin on his person.  He
          went to great lengths to hide it.  He
          attended at the location where he was to sell
          it to Neill [the  undercover police officer].
          As Crown counsel pointed out, the accused had
          plenty of opportunity to back out of the
          deal.  He was not subject to any threats.  He
          was not under any pressure from Lahham at the
          time.  Lahham was not even present at the
          transaction.  The accused was a free agent
          who chose to continue on and to complete the
          sale to traffic in a very dangerous narcotic
          to Officer Neill in return for financial
          gain.  There is no evidence that the accused
          was subjected to persistent pressure by
          anyone.
          </pre>
    <pre>[3]  Further in her reasons, the trial judge determined that:</pre>
    <pre>    (a)  there was a &#145;reasonable suspicion&#146; on the part of the police
         that the appellant was engaged in criminal activity;
         </pre>
    <pre>    (b)  the authorities did not go beyond providing an opportunity
         for the accused to commit the offence and did not engage in
         inducements;</pre>
    <pre>    (c)  the police agent Lahham, in supplying the drugs, was acting
         contrary to instructions, was on a frolic of his own, and in any
         event did not engage in activity which could be described as
         exploitative; and</pre>
    <pre>    (d)  the appellant had not satisfied, upon all of the evidence,
         the burden of establishing that entrapment had occurred.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On the basis of the law set out in R. v. Mack (1988), 44
C.C.C. (3d) 513 (S.C.C.), the conduct as found by the trial judge
does not amount to entrapment.  Accordingly, the appeal against
conviction is dismissed.  We are advised that the appeal against
sentence has been abandoned.</pre>
