    <pre>[1]  In our view, the trial judge seriously misapprehended
important evidence which supported the defence.  Constable Weller
testified in cross-examination that the complainant did not
recall what had happened on the evening of May 31, 1994 and that
what the complainant told her was what the appellant allegedly
had told the complainant.  The trial judge wrongly appears to
have considered the constable&#146;s evidence as being supportive of
the complainant&#146;s evidence, rather than seriously undermining it.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Further, the trial judge failed to deal with a number of
significant inconsistencies external to the complainant&#146;s
evidence in assessing the overall credibility and reliability of
her testimony.  Also, it would appear that the trial judge
regarded the complainant&#146;s earlier disclosures as being
substantive evidence of guilt which supported her trial testimony
and not (which would be permissible) as merely rebuttals of
allegations of recent fabrication.  We, however, express no
concluded opinion on this particular issue.

[3]  For these reasons the appeal is allowed, the conviction is
set aside, and a new trial is ordered.</pre></td>
