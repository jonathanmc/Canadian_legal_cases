    <pre><b>                      ENDORSEMENT</b></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Soli Mehta, raised four arguments in support
of his submission that the trial judge erred in concluding that
the respondent, Brady Zivadinovich, was entitled to damages in
the amount of $120,000.00 plus prejudgment interest from Mehta.</pre>
    <pre>(1)  The first argument was that there was no fiduciary
relationship between the parties giving rise to a duty. The
appellant denied that there was any trust relationship. He argued
that while he was an accountant as well as a close friend of
Zivadinovich, he was not an expert in real estate investments. In
informing Zivadinovich of the investment, he was merely giving
information, not advice. There was no retainer, and Mehta could
not have expected that Zivadinovich would rely on him for advice.
Moreover, Zivadinovich’s version of events about what was to
happen to the money he gave Mehta, was not accepted by the trial
judge. This means that Zivadinovich was deceitful and misleading,
and was therefore not entitled to the equitable relief he was
seeking.</pre>
    <pre>[2]       In our view, the relevant facts are as follows.
Zivadinovich, a plumber, came to Canada from Yugoslavia in 1967.
In the mid-seventies he got to know Mehta, an accountant. Not
only did they become friends, in exchange for plumbing services
Mehta prepared tax returns annually for Zivadinovich and his wife
from 1974 to 1989. The trial judge found that Zivadinovich had
“unbounded confidence” in Mehta, and believed his funds were in
“good hands” with him. These funds were the settlement proceeds
of an accident claim which left Zivadinovich unable to work.
Zivadinovich sought Mehta’s views on how to invest the money, and
was accordingly told about a real estate project.</pre>
    <pre>[3]       The trial judge weighed Zivadinovich’s testimony about
what he thought he was investing in. While he did not accept
Zivadinovich’s version of what he was investing in, he did not
find him to be either misleading or dishonest. He found that
Zivadinovich looked up to Mehta, not only because he was an
accountant but because he was associated with such a prestigious
firm. As the trial judge said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Mehta was an accountant while the plaintiff
          was a skilled artisan from a non-English
          speaking country whose English was far from
          perfect. …  The plaintiff may well have been
          even more impressed with Mehta by virtue of
          the fact that Mehta was associated with a
          prestigious firm of accountants. It is also
          fair to say that accountants, even more so
          than lawyers – perhaps because of their
          alleged fiscal conservatism – are considered
          lay-people as having good judgment in matters
          of finance. The information that no only was
          Mehta involved in promoting the company, but
          that he and a relative – the latter likely on
          the recommendation of Mehta – had actually
          invested in the project, must have been a
          powerful inducement to the plaintiff.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  There was, on this record, sufficient evidence for the trial
judge to conclude that the nature and duration of the
relationship gave rise to a fiduciary duty on Mehta’s part in
giving advice to Zivadinovich, whether or not there was a formal
retainer. This was not merely the giving of information – it was
the offering of advice which Zivadinovich took to be coming from
a trusted advisor in financial matters and a friend. It was also
open to the trial judge to conclude that Mehta’s non-disclosures
about the speculative nature of the investment and his own
interest in it, represented a breach of that duty. These findings
are entitled to a high degree of deference, absent a manifest
error (Hodgkinson v. Simms (1994), 117 D.L.R. (4th) 161). We can
see no such error.  Zivadinovich’s relationship with Mehta
involved trust and dependency on his professional opinion. Mehta
was a professional advisor to Zivadinovich over the years and
Zivadinovich trusted - and relied on – Mehta’s advice. He would
not otherwise have handed to Mehta the bulk of his savings
without knowing anything about the investment other than that it
was related to real estate.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Accordingly, we see no basis for interfering with the trial
judge’s conclusion that Mehta was liable to Zivadinovich for
damages resulting from a breach of his professional duty.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  This makes it unnecessary  to deal extensively with Mr
David’s three other arguments dealing with reliance,
Zivadinovich’s voluntary assumption of risk, and contributory
negligence;  however we conclude:</pre>
    <pre>a)   A part of the finding of a fiduciary duty was the finding of
reliance by the respondent. We would not disturb this finding.</pre>
    <pre>b)   Zivadinovich could not be said to be acting voluntarily when
he did not have complete information about the investment or
Mehta’s role in it.</pre>
    <pre>c)   Zivadinovich did nothing to protect himself because he
trusted Mehta and relied on his advice. There can be no
suggestion of contributory negligence in the face of a finding
that a fiduciary duty has been breached.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  For the above reasons, despite Mr. David’s able argument,
the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
