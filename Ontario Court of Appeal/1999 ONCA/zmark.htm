COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            Z-MARK INTERNATIONAL INC. (Plaintiff (Appellant))

    <pre>COUNSEL:       Peter E.J. Wells and Mark S. Mitchell
               For the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Michael T. Tamblyn

    <pre>               F. Paul Morrison
               For the respondent Pitney Bowes of Canada Ltd.</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         June 7, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Spence J. dated August 30, 1996
made at Toronto, Ontario.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We see no error in the reasons of  Spence J. as to the
liability of Pitney Bowes. There is  no specific discussion in
the reasons as to the period following delivery of the agreement
to Pitney Bowes, but there is a finding supported by the
evidence, that the appellant suffered no loss of business
thereafter and that the respondent made no sales thereafter.
These were the alternative foundations for a damage assessment.

[2]  The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.</pre>
