    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Chadwick dated January
22, 1999</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an  appeal from an order of  Chadwick  J.,  dated
January  22,  1999,  striking  the  Statement  of  Claim  of  the
appellant,  Ernst  Zündel, as against the respondent  members  of
Parliament (Chrétien, Manning, Wayne, McDonough, Duceppe, MacKay,
Boudria, White, Blaikie, Fry, and Gagliano) on the ground that it
discloses no reasonable cause of action.
[2]  The appellant&#146;s claim arose out of a motion passed
unanimously by the House of Commons on June 4, 1998. The motion,
which denied the appellant &#147;admittance to the precincts of the
House of Commons during and for the remainder of the present
session&#148;, effectively prevented him from holding a press
conference in Room 130-S in the Centre Block of the Parliament
Buildings on June 5, 1998. In his action, the appellant sought a
declaration that the respondents violated his right to freedom of
expression guaranteed under s. 2(b) of the Canadian Charter of
Rights and Freedoms and damages for this violation and for
conspiracy to injure, public misfeasance, and abuse of office.
[3]  The respondents brought a motion to strike the claim under
Rules 21.01(1)(b) and 21.01(3) of the Rules of Civil Procedure
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 on the ground that it was founded on
matters of parliamentary privilege that were not subject to
review in the courts.  Chadwick J. agreed that the respondents,
in passing the motion which formed the subject-matter of the
action, had acted in the exercise of the parliamentary privilege
to exclude strangers and struck the claim as disclosing no
reasonable cause of action.
[4]  By further order of Chadwick J., the appellant&#146;s action was
dismissed as against the defendant political parties on the
grounds that they do not constitute legal entities. No appeal is
taken from that order.  The appellant&#146;s action against the
defendants The Canadian Jewish Congress and its president, Mr.
Moshe Ronen, remains intact and is not the subject of this
appeal.
[5]  The test for striking out a pleading is whether it is plain
and obvious that it discloses no cause of action. The facts as
pleaded must be taken to be true and, since the rule is a
limitation on a party&#146;s right to trial, the pleading should be
read generously to accommodate drafting deficiencies. Where
matters of law are not fully settled in the jurisprudence, the
action should be permitted to continue.
[6]  The appellant describes himself in his pleading as &#147;a German-
Canadian publisher, writer, broadcaster and human rights
activist&#148; who &#147;has defended the German ethnic group against false
atrocity allegations made during and after World War II&#148;. He
relies on the following essential facts to found his action.
[7]  The appellant scheduled a press conference for June 5, 1998,
to discuss a case before the Human Rights Tribunal in which he
was accused of exposing Jews to hatred and contempt on an
internet website known as the &#147;Zündelsite.&#148; The title of the
intended press conference was &#147;The New Inquisition in Toronto!
Government tries to grab control of the Internet&#148;. The appellant
booked the Charles Lynch Press Conference Room situated in the
Parliament Buildings for his press conference. The booking was
made with the officials of the Canadian Parliamentary Press
Gallery.
[8]  On June 4, 1998, the respondent House Leaders Blaikie,
White, MacKay and Boudria all rose in the House of Commons
advising the members of Parliament of the appellant&#146;s plans to
hold the press conference and stating that he must not be
permitted to use the Charles Lynch Press Conference Room, given
his well-known position on the Holocaust. The respondent Boudria
acknowledged that the government did not administer the rooms in
question and that the room was in fact accessible to the
appellant. Boudria also advised the members that he had contacted
the officials of the Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery to
express his dissatisfaction and the officials had refused to
cancel the appellant&#146;s booking.
[9]  Later in the day, the following motion was passed
unanimously by the House of Commons:</pre>
    <pre>         That this House order that Ernst Zündel be denied admittance
         to the precincts of the House of Commons during and for the
         remainder of the present session.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  resolution prevented the appellant  from  holding  his
press  conference in the press gallery. Instead,  the  conference
was held outside the Parliament Buildings on the sidewalk.
[11] The motions judge considered these facts, adverted to the
correct test and, in my view, was correct in striking the
pleading on the ground that the claim was founded on matters of
parliamentary privilege.
[12] In New Brunswick Broadcasting Co. v. Nova Scotia, [1993] 1
S.C.R. 319, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized the
constitutional status of parliamentary privileges in Canada. The
Court reviewed the historical tradition of parliamentary
privileges and stated as follows (at 378-79):</pre>
    <pre>          &#147;Privilege&#148; in this context denotes the legal exemption from
          some duty, burden, attendance or liability to which others are
          subject. It has long been accepted that in order to perform their
          functions, legislative bodies require certain privileges relating
          to the conduct of their business. It has also long been accepted
          that these privileges must be held absolutely and
          constitutionally if they are to be effective; the legislative
          branch of our government must enjoy a certain autonomy which even
          the Crown and the courts cannot touch.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 The  Parliamentary  privilege  of  the
          British  Parliament  at  Westminster   sprang
          originally  from the authority of  Parliament
          as  a  court. Over the centuries,  Parliament
          won  for itself the right to control its  own
          affairs, independent of the Crown and of  the
          courts. The courts could determine whether  a
          parliamentary  privilege  existed,  but  once
          they  determined that it did, the courts  had
          no  power  to regulate the exercise  of  that
          power.   One   of   those  privileges,   held
          absolutely  and  deemed to be constitutional,
          was  the power to exclude strangers from  the
          proceedings of the House.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  privileges attaching  to  colonial
          legislatures arose from common law.  Modelled
          on  the  British Parliament, they were deemed
          to  possess such powers and authority as  are
          necessarily   incidental  to   their   proper
          functioning.  These privileges were  governed
          by  the principle of necessity rather than by
          historical incident, and thus may not exactly
          replicate the powers and privileges found  in
          the United Kingdom. [Emphasis in original.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  The  Court  concluded (at 381) that  &#147;Canadian  legislative
bodies  [can] properly claim as inherent privileges those  rights
which  are necessary to their capacity to function as legislative
bodies. There is no dispute in the case law that necessity is the
test.&#148;  While  it  is  up  to  the courts  to  determine  whether
necessity  sufficient to support a privilege is made out,  it  is
important  to clearly delineate the test of necessity. The  point
is made at p.383:</pre>
    <pre>
       The test of necessity is not applied as a standard for
       judging the content of a claimed privilege, but for the purpose
       of determining the necessary sphere of exclusive or absolute
       &#147;parliamentary&#148; or &#147;legislative&#148; jurisdiction. If a matter falls
       within this necessary sphere of matters without which the dignity
       and efficiency of the House cannot be upheld, courts will not
       inquire into questions concerning such privilege. All such
       questions will instead fall to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
       legislative body.
          
</pre>
    <pre>     And further at 384-85:</pre>
    <pre>       The courts may determine if the privilege claimed is
       necessary to the capacity of the legislature to function, but
       have no power to review the rightness or wrongness of a
       particular decision made pursuant to the privilege.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[14] At issue in New Brunswick Broadcasting was the power of  the
House of Assembly of Nova Scotia to restrict what members of  the
public attending the proceedings may do while in the chamber  and
to  expel them if they refused to comply. More specifically,  the
media  sought  the right to film the proceedings with  their  own
cameras. The Speaker of the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia  was
of  the  view that access of this sort would interfere  with  the
decorum  and the efficacious proceedings of the House  and  ruled
against  it.  The Court held that this was a matter of  privilege
and the courts had no jurisdiction to review the decision.
[15] The appellant takes the position that the power to exclude
strangers, which was found by the Supreme Court in New Brunswick
Broadcasting to be a matter of privilege, is restricted to the
chamber of the House and to those strangers who may be viewed by
the Speaker as disruptive of the Assembly&#146;s business.  While
those were the facts in New Brunswick Broadcasting, the governing
principles, in my view, have a wider application.
[16] In this case, the Speaker, instructed by a unanimous
resolution of the House of Commons, saw fit to exclude the
appellant from &#147;the precincts of the House of Commons during and
for the remainder of the present session&#148;. The jurisdictional
question for the court is whether it is necessary to the proper
functioning of the House of Commons for the House, through its
Speaker, to have control over its precincts, including the power
to exclude strangers from the premises. The question cannot be
whether, on the facts of this case, it was necessary to exclude
the appellant for the proper functioning of the House, for that
would be an inquiry into the &#147;rightness or wrongness&#148; of the
decision, an inquiry which would render any existing privilege
nugatory.
[17] The &#147;precincts&#148; are defined by J. P. Joseph Maingot, Q.C. in
Parliamentary Privilege in Canada, 2nd ed. (1997), as follows (at
163):</pre>
    <pre>       In the parliamentary sense, the precincts are the premises
       that the House of Commons and the Senate occupy from time to time
       for their corporate purposes. It includes those premises where
       each House, through its Speaker, exercises physical control to
       enable the Members to perform their parliamentary work without
       obstruction or interference.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[18] In my view, it should be self-evident that control over  the
premises  occupied  by the House of Commons for  the  purpose  of
performing the Members&#146; parliamentary work is a necessary adjunct
to  the proper functioning of Parliament. Surely, someone must be
in  control  of  the premises. Who better than the  Speaker,  who
historically  has  exercised this control for the  House?  In  my
view,  the courts would be overstepping legitimate constitutional
bounds if they sought to interfere with the power of the House to
control  access to its own premises. The following comment  added
by  McLachlin  J.  in  New  Brunswick  Broadcasting  is  entirely
apposite to this case (at 389):</pre>
    <pre>
        I add this.  Our democratic government consists of
        several branches: the Crown, as represented by the Governor
        General and the provincial counterparts of that office; the
        legislative body; the executive; and the courts.  It is
        fundamental to the working of government as a whole that all
        these parts play their proper role.  It is equally fundamental
        that no one of them overstep its bounds, that each show proper
        deference for the legitimate sphere of activity of the other.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      Traditionally,  each  branch   of
          government  has enjoyed autonomy  in  how  it
          conducts   its  affairs.   The  Charter   has
          changed  the  balance of  power  between  the
          legislative branch and the executive  on  the
          one  hand, and the courts on the other  hand,
          by  requiring  that all laws  and  government
          action   must   conform  to  the  fundamental
          principles  laid down in the Charter.   As  a
          practical matter, this means that, subject to
          the  override  provision  in  s.  33  of  the
          Charter,  the  courts may be called  upon  to
          rule  that  laws  and  government  acts   are
          invalid.   To  this extent, the  Charter  has
          impinged  on  the  supreme authority  of  the
          legislative branches.  What we are  asked  to
          do  in  this  case  is to  go  further,  much
          further.   We  are  asked  to  say  that  the
          Charter not only removed from the legislative
          bodies  the right to pass whatever laws  they
          might  choose to adopt, but that  it  removed
          the  long-standing  constitutional  right  of
          Parliament and the legislative assemblies  to
          exclude     strangers,     subjecting     the
          determination  by  the  Speaker  of  what  is
          disruptive  of the operation of the  Assembly
          to  the superior review of the courts.  I see
          nothing in the Charter that would mandate  or
          justify  taking  the reallocation  of  powers
          which it effected to this extreme.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[19] In this case, the motion passed by the House of Commons  was
no  more than an exercise of control over the access by strangers
to the parliamentary precincts. I conclude that the motions judge
was  correct in finding that the test of necessity had been  met.
Hence,  the  appellant&#146;s claim is entirely based  on  matters  of
parliamentary privilege and was rightly struck.
[20] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre>
