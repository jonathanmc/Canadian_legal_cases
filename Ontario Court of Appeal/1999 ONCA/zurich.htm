</pre>
      <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Maloney J. dated June 4, 1998.
</pre>
      <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
      <pre>[1]   The respondent Armour personally guaranteed the liabilities
of  the  Yorkminster Group of companies to the  appellant  Zurich
Indemnity  Company of Canada. In October 1991,  when  Yorkminster
was in serious financial difficulty, Zurich infused a further  $5
million  capital  through  Knight  Financial  Group  Limited,   a
distinct  corporate entity charged with a task of  attempting  to
salvage Yorkminster in a workout scheme. A loan agreement between
Knight  and  Yorkminster  was entered. It  provided  for  the  $5
million  loan and for Knight’s complete control over the  affairs
of  Yorkminster.  In  particular,  paragraph  3.06  of  the  loan
agreement gave Knight extensive rights, powers and authorities to
be  exercised  with  respect to the borrowers “and  all  entities
which they or John M. Armour or Ken Good own or control, directly
or indirectly.”
[2]  After discussion of the specific wording between Knight’s
representative and Armour and his counsel, paragraph 3.07 was
included in the Loan Agreement. It provided as follows:
          </pre>
      <pre>               Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3.06 above, it
          shall not be interpreted or applied so as to allow the Lender to
          attach the personal assets (in the conventional sense) of John M.
          Armour or Ken Good.
          </pre>
      <pre>                For these purposes personal investments
          such as partnership units would be considered
          personal  assets and assets relating  to  the
          ownership of members of the Yorkminster Group
          would not be personal assets.
          </pre>
      <pre>                Should  a dispute arise respecting  the
          classification  of  a particular  asset  this
          dispute  shall  be  settled  by  one   person
          designated  by  the owner  of  the  asset  in
          question  and  one person designated  by  the
          Lender. If these two cannot agree they  shall
          appoint  a third person whose decision  shall
          be binding.</pre>
      <pre>[3]  In the months that followed, Armour worked with Knight in  a
joint  effort  to rescue Yorkminster. During this period  neither
Zurich  nor Knight made any effort to enforce Zurich’s  guarantee
against Armour’s personal assets.
[4]  In August 1992 Zurich issued a statement of claim against
some of the Yorkminster companies and Armour personally on his
guarantee. About the same time, Knight also commenced an action
under the Loan Agreement for the $5 million that had been
advanced. While there was some discussion between the parties to
the Zurich action about judgment being obtained on consent, in
the end, Armour executed consents on behalf of the corporate
defendants, but he did not do so on his own behalf and Zurich
entered default judgment against him.
[5]  When Zurich took steps to enforce its default judgment by
way of judgment debtor examination, Armour took the position that
Zurich had surrendered its rights to execute against his personal
assets by virtue of the agreement reflected by paragraph 3.07 of
the 1991 Knight Loan Agreement. Borins J. directed a trial of an
issue to determine whether there was any such limitation on
Zurich’s rights and the trial proceeded before Maloney J. in June
1998.
[6]  Although the words of paragraph 3.07 relate specifically to
the powers granted to Knight under paragraph 3.06, the trial
judge found that paragraph 3.07 was the reflection of a broader
understanding between the parties to the effect that Armour’s
personal assets be immunized from execution by both Knight and
Zurich. In our view, there was evidence before the trial judge
capable of supporting this finding. Armour testified that he made
available to Knight and to Zurich assets that would have been
otherwise inaccessible in exchange for their commitment not to
execute against his personal assets. His evidence was supported
by that of Passi. While witnesses for Zurich strongly disputed
these claims, the trial judge rejected their evidence and
preferred that of Armour and Passi. In the circumstances, we
cannot say there was any palpable or overriding error in the
findings of the trial judge.
[7]  Nor do we consider that there is any merit to the argument
that the trial judge improperly “pierced the corporate veil” of
Knight. Doherty admitted that Knight was the agent of Zurich and
it is clear from the evidence that Knight was acting throughout
on Zurich’s behalf. In light of that evidence, it was open to the
trial judge to conclude that the agreement of Knight bound
Zurich. Moreover, the trial judge also had evidence of the
discussions between Passi and Zurich’s counsel, Ingram, with
respect to the broader understanding.
[8]  Finally, we reject the submission that this proceeding
represents a collateral attack upon Zurich’s default judgment
against Armour. That judgment stands and nothing in these
proceedings calls it into question. It is open to a party to
agree to surrender or forego rights otherwise secured by way of a
judgment. The trial judge’s finding that there was such an
agreement here does not impugn Zurich’s judgment. Nor is Zurich’s
judgment against Armour rendered an empty shell. Armour admitted
that certain of the Yorkminster assets remained held in his name
personally and pursuant to the agreement with Knight, those
assets remained available to Knight and to Zurich.
[9]  For these reasons we would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre>
