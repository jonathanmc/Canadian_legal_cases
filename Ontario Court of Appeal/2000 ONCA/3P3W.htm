    <pre>[1]  There is some confusion in the record as to the exact roles
played by the various corporate entities.  For our purposes, the
respondents may be referred to collectively as the
franchisor/tenant and the appellant may be referred to as the
franchisee/sub-tenant.
[2]  The respondents claimed possession of premises occupied by
the appellant.  The respondents had leased the property for a
five-year period from the landlord in 1992 and subleased the
premise to the appellant in conjunction with a franchise
agreement in 1995.  The lease expired late in 1997.  The
respondents did not exercise the option under the lease to renew
the lease for a further 10-year period, but the appellant
remained on the premise and continued to operate the franchise
through most of 1998.  By November 1998, the respondents had
terminated the franchise agreement and the working relationship
between the respondents and the appellant had ceased.  It is
accepted that the respondents were entitled to terminate the
franchise agreement and their damage claim arising out of that
termination remains to be tried.
[3]  The respondents claim that they are entitled to possession
of the premises based on a lease dated January 1, 1998 (the new
lease) and, alternatively, they claim possession based on the
overholding provision in the 1992 lease (the original lease).
The appellant claims entitlement to possession based on the new
lease.  Strangely, the landlord is not a party to these
proceedings.
[4]  The respondents failed to make out a claim for possession
based on the new lease.  The respondents are not parties to that
lease.  On its face, it appears to be a lease between the
appellant and the landlord.  The respondents had no knowledge of
the lease until after these proceedings were commenced.  Nor, on
the evidence produced by the respondents, could it be
successfully argued that the appellant entered into the new lease
with the landlord on behalf of the respondents.  Finally, the
respondents adduced no admissible evidence that the landlord
intended to enter into a new lease with the respondents.
[5]  The respondents&#146; claim based on the original lease arises
out of the term of that lease that made the respondents month-to-
month tenants if they remained in possession after the expiration
of the five-year term and had not exercised their option to renew
the lease.  When the five-year term of the original lease expired
late in 1997, the franchise agreement was still operating and,
arguably, the appellant&#146;s possession as franchisee amounted to
possession by the respondents for the purpose of the lease.
[6]  The respondents contend that as month-to-month tenants, they
were entitled to one month&#146;s notice from the landlord in order to
terminate the monthly tenancy.  They submit that as no such
notice was given, the month-to-month tenancy continued despite
any purported lease between the landlord and the appellant.
[7]  Only the respondents and the landlord know whether the
landlord did or did not give notice to terminate the month-to-
month tenancy.  The landlord is in Hong Kong and is not
available.  If the respondents did not receive notice, it would
have been easy for them to so state in their affidavits.  They
had the onus of showing that no notice was given.  Their material
does not address the question of notice.  In our view, they have
failed to show that they did not get notice, and this failure
defeats their claim for possession based on the overholding
provision in the original lease.
[8]  We do not have to decide what the result may have been had
the respondents proved that the landlord did not give the notice
of termination of the month-to-month tenancy but had entered into
the new lease with the appellant.  We would indicate, however,
that as the landlord&#146;s rights would be affected, he would have to
be a party to any proceeding in which that issue was decided.
[9]  The appeal is allowed, the judgment below is set aside, and
the application is dismissed.  The appellant is entitled to his
costs here and in the court below on a party-and-party basis.</pre></td>
