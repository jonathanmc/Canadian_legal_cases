    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Cumming J. dated May 28, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>SHARPE J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  For some 30 years, the appellant, Design Dynamics Limited,
was Canadian Tire&#146;s principal supplier of synthetic seat covers.
The appellant lost that business in June 1984 when Robert Summers
(&#147;Summers&#148;), the head of Canadian Tire&#146;s automotive division,
decided that the respondents Sagaz Industries Canada Inc. and
Sagaz Industries Inc. (collectively &#147;Sagaz&#148;) would be Canadian
Tire&#146;s seat cover supplier.  Summers was subsequently charged and
convicted of accepting a bribe in relation to the Sagaz contract.
The loss of Canadian Tire&#146;s business was devastating to the
appellant and it brought this action alleging that the defendants
had bribed Summers and that, but for those bribes, the appellant
would continue to enjoy Canadian Tire&#146;s business.
[2]  The defendants, Stewart Landow (&#147;Landow), and his company,
American Independent Marketing Inc. (&#147;AIM&#148;), were retained by
Sagaz to assist in marketing the seat covers to Canadian Tire.
The trial judge found that Landow and AIM had bribed Summers and
that those bribes were the cause of the appellant&#146;s loss of the
Canadian Tire business.  He found that Landow and AIM were liable
to the appellant in conspiracy and on the basis that their
conduct amounted to the tort of unlawful interference with
economic relations. The appellant&#146;s damages were assessed in the
amount of $1,857,500. The appellant was also awarded $50,000 in
punitive damages and $3,381,613.51 prejudgment interest.
[3]  The claims against Sagaz and Joseph Kavana (&#147;Kavana&#148;), the
principal officer of Sagaz, were dismissed.  The trial judge
found that AIM was an independent contractor and that,
accordingly, Sagaz was not vicariously liable for the tortious
conduct of Landow and AIM.  The trial judge also found that
Kavana and Sagaz did not know that Landow was bribing the
Canadian Tire buyer and that neither Kavana, nor Sagaz, were
parties to the conspiracy, or otherwise responsible for the
tortious acts of AIM.
[4]  After the release of the trial judge&#146;s reasons, but before
the formal judgment was taken out, Landow, who had not testified
at trial, gave the appellant an affidavit admitting to a
conspiracy to bribe, implicating Kavana in the conspiracy.  A
motion was brought before the trial judge to have the trial re-
opened to hear Landow&#146;s evidence.  The trial judge dismissed that
motion on the grounds that the appellant failed to show that the
new evidence would probably change the result and on the ground
that Landow was available as a witness at trial, but appellant&#146;s
counsel made a tactical choice not to call him.
[5]  Before this court, no issue is taken with the trial judge&#146;s
findings that Landow and AIM were guilty of bribery, that the
bribery caused the loss of the appellant&#146;s Canadian Tire
business, that Landow and AIM were liable for conspiracy and
unlawful interference with economic relations, and that the
appellant suffered damages as a result of their tortious conduct
in the amount assessed by the trial judge.
[6]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal:
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   that the trial judge erred in finding that AIM was an
independent contractor and in rejecting the appellant&#146;s claim
against Sagaz for vicarious liability;

2.   that the trial judge&#146;s factual findings with respect to
Kavana&#146;s knowledge of, or participation in, the bribery scheme
were unreasonable and ought to be set aside; and

3.   that the trial judge erred in refusing to reopen the trial.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Issue 1 &#150; Is Sagaz Vicariously Liable for Landow and AIM?</pre>
    <pre>[7]  While the trial judge gave carefully considered reasons for
judgment, those reasons contain no analysis of the evidence or
legal principles pertaining to the claim against Sagaz for
vicarious liability for the acts of Landow and AIM.  In fairness
to the trial judge, it would appear that this issue was not
pressed as vigorously before him as it was before this court.
Mr. Teplitsky conceded that at trial he relied principally upon
the contention that Kavana was an actual participant in a bribery
conspiracy and that he did not place the same degree of emphasis
on the vicarious liability claim.  However, there is no doubt
that the issue of vicarious liability was raised at trial.  In
his reasons for judgment, the trial judge specifically identified
seven issues to be addressed, one of which was the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>   If the defendants Mr. Landow and AIM Inc. are found to have
   bribed Mr. Summers but it is found that this was done without the
   knowledge of Sagaz, is Sagaz liable to the plaintiff on a basis
   of vicarious liability for the wrongdoing of Mr. Landow and AIM
   Inc.?</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The only findings of the trial judge on this point are three
one sentence, conclusory statements that AIM was an independent
contractor in its relationship with Sagaz. London Drugs Ltd. v.
Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299 was cited
for the proposition that liability should not be imposed on Sagaz
for the tortious acts of its independent contractors. While the
trial judge made no detailed factual findings on this issue, the
pertinent facts are not in dispute. The task of this court is to
determine whether on those facts, it was open in law for the
trial judge to dismiss the appellant&#146;s vicarious liability claim
against Sagaz.
[9]  The strongest evidence to support the finding that AIM was
an independent contractor is the written agreement between Sagaz
and AIM which specifically provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>   3.   AUTHORITY; RELATIONSHIP.  AIM is and shall in all
   events be an independent contractor.  AIM shall not have the
   authority to sign for or bind Sagaz, and nothing herein shall be
   construed as constituting AIM as the partner or legal
   representative of Sagaz.</pre>
    <pre>[10] We were also referred to Kavana&#146;s evidence to the effect
that Landow insisted upon the written agreement designating him
as an independent contractor.  Kavana testified that he
understood this to mean that Landow and his company had no
authority to sign on behalf of or to bind Sagaz. Mr. Goldenberg
also referred us to extracts from the examination-for-discovery
of Landow, read in at the trial by the appellant, in which Landow
described himself as a &#147;consultant&#148;.  Landow also indicated that
he acted in that capacity for many other companies in the United
States, although in situations that were not competitive with
Sagaz.
[11] The contract between Sagaz and AIM designating AIM as
Sagaz&#146;s &#147;independent contractor&#148; does not determine the legal
classification of AIM vis-à-vis Sagaz for purposes of vicarious
liability.  To determine whether one party is vicariously liable
for the tortious acts of another, the court is required to
scrutinize the facts carefully to determine the true nature of
the relationship, rather than base the decision on the label the
parties chose to attach to their relationship.  Although it is a
tax case, Wiebe Door Services Ltd. v. MNR, [1986] 5 W.W.R. 450
(Fed. C.A.) is apposite.  The court rejected the contention that,
with respect to third parties, a principal and agent could
themselves control the legal categorization of the nature of
their relationship by labelling it &#147;independent contractor&#148;.
McGuigan J. stated as follows (at 453): &#147;Such an agreement is not
of itself determinative of the relationship between the parties,
and a court must carefully examine the facts in order to come to
its own conclusion.&#148; In A. (C.) v. Critchley (1998), 166 D.L.R.
(4th) 475 (B.C.C.A.), the court held that vicarious liability
attached despite the fact that, as between the principal and the
agent, the relationship was described as that of independent
contractor.  McEachern C.J.B.C. wrote (at 503) that: &#147;More recent
authorities make it clear, however, that like so many formerly
&#145;well established principles&#146;, this distinction between
independent contractors and employees may be blurred in many
cases where there are overlapping obligations.&#148; McEachern C.J.B.C
added (at 504) that the &#147;designation [of the agent] as an
independent contractor may not be a significant factor in the
modern law that tends to look not at traditional classifications
but rather at the true nature of the relationship&#148;.  In Jacobi v.
Griffiths (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 71 at 99, Binnie J. referred,
with apparent approval, to the Critchley approach &#147;&#133;that it is
the true nature of the relationship, not the traditional
classification, that is determinative&#148;.
[12] In Mayer v. J. Conrad Lavigne Ltd. (1979), 27 O.R. (2d) 129
(C.A.) at 132, MacKinnon A.C.J.O. described the determination of
whether an individual is a servant or independent contractor as
being &#147;completely dependent on the facts&#148;.  MacKinnon A.C.J.O.
went on to refer to &#147;the organization test&#148;, noting that it had
been approved and applied by the Supreme Court of Canada in Co-
operators Insurance Association v. Kearney (1964), 48 D.L.R. (2d)
1. Reference was also made to Stevenson, Jordan and Harrison
Limited v. MacDonald et al, [1952] 1 T.L.R. 101 were Lord Denning
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>   One feature which seems to run through the instances is
   that, under a contract of service, a man is employed as part of
   the business, and his work is done as an integral part of the
   business; whereas, under a contract for services, his work,
   although done for the business, is not integrated into it but is
   only accessory to it.</pre>
    <pre>[13] MacKinnon A.C.J.O. applied the organization test in holding
that a commission agent who sold advertising for a television
station was in a master-servant relationship (at 133):
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133;the relationship satisfies the &#147;organization&#148; test. The
   respondent&#146;s work was a necessary and integral part of the
   appellant&#146;s business. It supplied the financial life-blood of the
   appellant, and his work was subject to the coordinational control
   of management. His work was clearly integrated into the business
   and not merely accessory to it. In my view, applying the common
   law tests, the facts establish that the respondent was a servant
   and employee of the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>[14] These authorities indicate that the &#147;organization test&#148;
inquires into whether the agent or servant functions as part of
the principal&#146;s organization and whether an agent&#146;s work is done
as an integral part of the principal&#146;s business.  If the answer
to these questions is yes, the principal is liable for the
tortious acts of the agent even though, as between themselves,
the principal and the agent have chosen to designate the
relationship as that of independent contractor.
[15] The appellant also relies on the following passage from
Fleming, The Law of Torts (7th ed.) at 342-343:
          </pre>
    <pre>   At other times, the term &#147;agent&#148; crops up to designate
   someone through whose instrumentality the defendant has committed
   a tort of his own, as when he has authorised an &#147;agent&#148; to commit
   a tort or ratified it afterwards.  It also includes situations
   &#147;where the function entrusted is that of representing the person
   who requests its performance in a transaction with others, so
   that the very service to be performed consists in standing in his
   place and assuming to act in his right and not in an independent
   capacity&#148;.  On this basis, an insurance agent was held to have
   made his principal answerable for defaming a competing company in
   the course of soliciting proposals, because &#147;he was authorised to
   speak, and in fact spoke, with the voice of the defendant&#148;.
   Whereas in the ordinary case, an independent contractor carries
   out his work, not as a representative but as principal, here the
   agent acts in a genuinely representative capacity for a principal
   who is accordingly treated as if he were conducting the
   transaction in person.  The liability is therefore personal, not
   vicarious &#150; a true instance of Qui facit per alium facit per se.
   [footnotes omitted]</pre>
    <pre>[16] The passages quoted by Professor Fleming are taken from the
judgment of Dixon J. in Colonial Life Assurance v. Producers
Assurance Co. (1931), 46 C.L.R. 41 (Aust. H.C.) at 48, where
liability was imposed on an insurance company for defamatory
statements made by an agent in soliciting business despite an
explicit term in the agent&#146;s contract forbidding him from saying
anything that would discredit or bring into disrepute any other
person or institution.
[17] There is no doubt that AIM was a legal entity separate from
Sagaz. AIM&#146;s offices were in New York whereas the offices of
Sagaz were in Florida. Kavana testified that Landow was hired to
represent Sagaz in Canada and that his duties on Sagaz&#146;s behalf
were to obtain Canadian Tire&#146;s business and to maintain its
goodwill.  In the portions of Landow&#146;s discovery evidence, read
in as part of the appellant&#146;s case, Landow stated that there was
no requirement as to how much time AIM would have to spend on the
affairs of Sagaz.  He also stated that he decided for himself how
many trips he should take to Toronto to promote Sagaz&#146;s business
with Canadian Tire.
[18] Kavana testified that sales representatives, such as AIM,
cover a territory and work with the sales manager or vice-
president of sales.  The sales representative &#147;introduces the
sales managers to the accounts&#148; and &#147;does the servicing of the
account on a day-to-day basis&#148;.  Sagaz relied on its sales
representatives to &#147;keep up the maintenance of the account&#148;.  It
is clear from Kavana&#146;s evidence that Landow and AIM did their
work as part of the Sagaz team.  In large part, no doubt, this
was due to the fact that Canadian Tire did not wish to deal with
external sales agents.  Although AIM was hired to represent
Sagaz, AIM did not initiate contact with Canadian Tire on its
own.  Kavana testified that initial contact with Canadian Tire
was made by Sagaz&#146;s national sales manager, Mr. David English
(&#147;English&#148;), who gave price quotations.  The initial meeting with
Canadian Tire was attended by Landow, English and Kavana.
Following that meeting, revised price quotations were sent by
English.  Landow&#146;s role was limited to presenting prices that
were set and negotiated by Kavana and English.  In his evidence,
Kavana admitted that Landow worked in a joint effort with the in-
house sales manager and that Landow required instructions with
respect to price, terms and various other aspects of the business
he was conducting on Sagaz&#146;s behalf.
[19] Apart from the AIM &#150; Sagaz agreement, the documentary
evidence does not support a finding that AIM was acting in an
independent capacity, outside the Sagaz organization, but
suggests that AIM was acting throughout as part of the Sagaz
organization.  Quotations to Canadian Tire indicated that the
account was a &#147;house account&#148;.  Kavana could not explain why
neither Landow nor AIM was shown as the agent.  Neither Landow
nor AIM was shown on invoices as sales representatives. On one
significant occasion, the letter of June 12, 1984, Landow
communicated with Canadian Tire directly using Sagaz&#146;s
letterhead. This letter was written at the time Sagaz was
attempting to get Canadian Tire&#146;s business away from the
appellant.  While Kavana at first denied that Landow had been
supplied with Sagaz&#146;s letterhead, he later admitted this to be
the case on cross-examination. The June 12, 1984 letter was
signed by Landow in his own name under &#147;Sagaz Industries, Inc.&#148;.
There is no reference to AIM.  The letter confirmed prices and
terms under which Sagaz would be prepared to supply Canadian
Tire.
[20] In my view, on the evidence that was presented, the
inevitable conclusion is that Landow and AIM were, at all
material times, acting on behalf of Sagaz as part of the Sagaz
organization and sales team.  Neither Landow nor AIM was acting
in an independent capacity.  They worked under the direct
supervision and direction of Sagaz and appear to have exercised
no independent discretion on any significant matter in relation
to dealings with Canadian Tire. They functioned as integrated
elements of the Sagaz organization.
[21] It is my view that the trial judge erred in dismissing the
claim against Sagaz based on vicarious liability for the acts of
Landow and AIM. The evidence brings Landow and AIM squarely
within the &#147;organization test&#148; for vicarious liability and it
follows, accordingly, that Sagaz is liable to the appellant for
the tortious conduct of Landow and AIM.
[22] It is not necessary to consider the alternate argument
advanced by the appellant that by receiving the benefit of the
wrongful activities of Landow and AIM, Sagaz attracted liability.
I would point out, however, that the wrong committed by Landow
and AIM fell squarely within the scope of their mandate to secure
the business of Canadian Tire and that the wrong was committed in
furtherance of the aims and objectives of Sagaz. Even though, on
the findings of the trial judge, the wrongful acts were
unauthorized by Sagaz, they fall within the category of
&#147;unauthorized acts so connected with authorized acts that they
may be regarded as modes (albeit improper modes) of doing an
authorized act&#148; for which the principal is liable as distinct
from &#147;a random act wholly unconnected to the nature of the
enterprise and the employee&#146;s responsibilities&#148; for which the
principal is not liable: Bazley v. Curry (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th)
45 (S.C.C.) at 52-3 and 56, per McLachlin J.
[23] It follows that Sagaz is liable for the tortious conduct of
Landow and AIM.  Vicarious liability should not, however, extend
to the award of punitive damages, in view of the findings of the
trial judge with respect to Kavana&#146;s lack of knowledge and
participation in the bribery scheme:  see:  S. M. Waddams, The
Law of Damages (Canada Law Book: Aurora, 1999 Looseleaf) paras.
11.420 &#150; 11.425.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2 - Are the Trial Judge&#146;s Factual Findings With Respect to
Kavana&#146;s Knowledge of or Participation in the Bribery Scheme
Unreasonable?</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge accepted Kavana&#146;s evidence denying knowledge
of and participation in the bribery scheme. The appellant submits
that the trial judge&#146;s factual findings with respect to Kavana
were unreasonable and ought to be set aside. The appellant
contends that Kavana failed to explain some very suspicious
circumstances and that he was successfully impeached on several
crucial points on cross-examination.
[25] The circumstances in which an appellate court will
substitute its own findings in the face of an explicit finding of
credibility by the trial judge are, to say the least,
exceptional. The best the appellant could hope for in the
circumstances of the present case would be a new trial, and even
that remedy will be rare where the trial judge has considered
contested evidence and found a witness to be credible.
[26] The result of the first ground of appeal is to hold Sagaz
liable.  As will be seen below, I have concluded, under the third
ground of appeal, that a new trial must be ordered with respect
to Kavana&#146;s liability.  In these circumstances, it is neither
necessary, nor desirable, for me to deal with this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 3 - Did the Trial Judge Err in Refusing to Re-Open the
Trial to Hear the Evidence of Landow?</pre>
    <pre>[27] The trial judge dismissed the appellant&#146;s motion pursuant to
rule 59.06(2)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure to re-open the
trial to hear the evidence of Landow. It was common ground
between the parties before the trial judge and before this court
that, in the circumstances of this case, the appellant had to
establish two points:
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.   that the evidence &#147;might probably
	  have altered the judgment&#148; and,
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.   that the evidence &#147;could not with
          reasonable diligence have been discovered
          sooner&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>(See Becker Milk Co. Ltd. v. Consumers&#146; Gas Co. (1974), 2 O.R.
(2d) 554 (C.A.) at 557.) The trial judge found that the appellant
failed to satisfy both elements.  With respect to the first test,
the trial judge concluded that he should not exercise his
discretion in the appellant&#146;s favour because although Landow&#146;s
evidence &#147;may have&#148; affected the result, he was not satisfied
that it &#147;would probably&#148; have changed the outcome.</pre>
    <pre>[28] With respect to the second branch, the trial judge found
that Landow was available to be called as a witness at trial and
that the appellant was stuck with counsel&#146;s tactical decision not
to call him.
[29] In my view, the trial judge erred on both branches of the
test.  The affidavit evidence of Landow, if believed, would
clearly implicate Kavana and Sagaz in the bribery scheme.
Accordingly, there is no doubt that if the trial judge accepted
the evidence as truthful it would have changed the outcome. The
trial judge&#146;s refusal to re-open the trial on the grounds that
Landow&#146;s evidence only &#147;may have&#148; changed the outcome, must have
been based on the fact that Landow&#146;s evidence might not be
believed.
[30] In this regard, I note that a recent English case dealing
with a motion to re-open a trial, Charlesworth v. Relay Roads
Ltd., [1999] 4 All E.R. 397 (Ch.D.) at 404, Neuberger J. adopted
the test laid down by Lord Denning in Ladd v. Marshall, [1954] 3
All E.R. 745 (C.A.) at 748 for admission of new evidence on
appeal:
              </pre>
    <pre>              &#133;first,  it must be shown that the
	      evidence  could   not  have   been
	      obtained with reasonable diligence
	      for use at the trial;  second, the
	      evidence  must  be  such  that, if
	      given, it would probably  have  an
	      important influence on the  result
	      of the case,  although it need not
              be  decisive; third, the  evidence
	      must  be such as is  presumably to
	      be believed, or in other words, it
	      must   be   apparently   credible,
	      though    it    need    not     be
	      incontrovertible.
          </pre>
    <pre>          While    I    think    that    these    three
          factors    should   be   in   the   forefront
          of    the    mind   of   the    court    when
          considering   an   application    to    admit
          new     evidence    after    judgment     has
          been    handed   down,   but    before    the
          order   has   been  drawn   up,   I   incline
          to    the    view   that   the    court    is
          entitled     to     be     somewhat      more
          flexible,   and   not  to  proceed   on   the
          strict    basis    that   each    of    these
          three    conditions   always   has   to    be
          fully       satisfied      before       fresh
          evidence     can    be    admitted     before
          judgment.  (emphasis added)</pre>
    <pre>I note that it has been suggested in Ontario as well that a more
flexible approach may be warranted on motions to re-open a trial:
see Castlerigg Investments Inc. v. Lam (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 216 at
223;  Scott v. Cook, [1970] 2 O.R. 769.  In Canada, the test for
admission of new evidence on appeal includes a similar criterion
of credibility:  &#147;the evidence must be credible in the sense that
it is reasonably capable of belief&#148;.  (See:  R. v. Palmer, [1980]
1 S.C.R. 759 at 775; R. v. Warsing, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579 at 592.
[31] Landow was extensively cross-examined on his affidavit prior
to the motion to re-open.  It was not suggested before this court
that his evidence was significantly undermined.  In my view, it
met the standard of &#147;reasonably capable of belief&#148; or &#147;apparently
credible, though&#133;not&#133;incontrovertible&#148;.  In the circumstances of
this case, I find it difficult to see how, without hearing
Landow, the trial judge could say with a sufficient degree of
certainty that Landow would not be believed.  There are
undoubtedly cases where a late blooming affidavit challenging
findings of fact in reasons for judgment can be rejected out of
hand. It is my view, however, that on this record, it was not
sufficiently clear that Landow would be disbelieved, and that the
appropriate approach in assessing the motion to re-open the trial
was to consider whether Landow&#146;s evidence, if believed, might
probably change the result.
[32] I also find that the trial judge erred with respect to the
second branch of the test.  There was uncontradicted affidavit
evidence before the judge on the motion to re-open that before
the trial the appellant made serious efforts to persuade Landow
to co-operate and to testify against Kavana and Sagaz.  Landow
was a named defendant and was examined for discovery.  On
discovery, he maintained his own innocence as well as that of
Kavana.  Landow did not attend the trial, but he was represented
by counsel throughout. It was only after the trial that he co-
operated with the appellant by giving an affidavit confessing to
his own wrongdoing and implicating Kavana in the scheme.
[33] In these circumstances, it is my view that the appellant
satisfied the test of showing that Landow&#146;s evidence was not
discoverable by reasonable diligence prior to the trial. It is
difficult to see what more the appellant could have done.  The
appellant examined Landow under oath and made repeated efforts to
secure his co-operation.  Landow refused to co-operate and denied
wrongdoing under oath.  While Landow was available to testify,
the evidence he is now prepared to give was not available until
he changed his story.  His change of heart and change of story
after the trial qualify as evidence that could not have been
discovered by reasonable diligence prior to trial.
[34] It is also my view that the motion to re-open should not
have been dismissed on the ground that the appellant exercised a
tactical choice not to call Landow at trial.  The decision not to
call Landow was made on the basis of the facts as they appeared
at trial.  Landow was a named defendant who gave sworn evidence
on discovery denying any wrongdoing. The decision not to call him
was made in that specific factual context. The facts have now
changed significantly and, as I have already indicated, the
appellant cannot be faulted for the change. This is quite unlike
the situation (as in International Corona Resources v. LAC
Minerals Ltd. (1988), 66 O.R. (2d) 610 (H.C.J.)) where counsel is
aware of evidence that might or might not assist the case and
decides, for tactical reasons, to pursue the case without calling
that evidence.
[35] I note that the trial judge quite appropriately observed
that the public interest in the finality of litigation must be
taken into account and that the courts must be wary of motions to
re-open for they have the potential to create an injustice.  As
was said in Charlesworth v. Relay Roads Ltd., supra, at 404,
&#147;there must be a strong presumption against letting [a litigant]
have a second chance, particularly after he has seen in detail
from the judgment why he has lost&#148;.  However, it is my view that
in refusing the appellant&#146;s motion to re-open the trial to hear
Landow&#146;s evidence, the trial judge did not apply the appropriate
principles and that it is open to this court to intervene.
[36] I would add here that we were not asked to consider whether
a trial judge has a broad discretion to re-open the trial &#147;to
avoid a miscarriage of justice&#148;:  see Castlerigg Investments Inc.
v. Lam, supra; Scott v. Cook, supra.  As I have concluded that
the appellant has met the test set out in Beckers Milk Co. Ltd.
v. Consumers&#146; Gas Co., supra, it is unnecessary for me to
consider this issue.
[37] The result of my conclusion with respect to the vicarious
liability issue is that Sagaz is liable to the appellants. The
remaining issue is whether Kavana is personally liable by reason
of his participation in the bribery scheme. In these
circumstances, the appropriate order is to allow the appeal on
the ground that the trial judge should have reopened the trial to
hear Landow&#146;s evidence and to order that there be a new trial on
the issue of Kavana&#146;s liability before a different trial judge. I
hardly need add that the findings that have not been appealed or
reversed will bind the parties on the subsequent trial.</pre>
    <pre>Cross Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[38] The trial judge refused to award Sagaz and Kavana their
costs against the appellant, but did make a &#147;Sanderson order&#148;,
awarding Sagaz and Kavana costs against Landow and AIM.  Landow
and AIM seek leave to appeal against that order.  In view of the
result of the main appeal, leave to appeal is granted and the
costs award against Landow and AIM in favour of Sagaz and Kavana
is set aside.
</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[39] For these reasons, the appeal and cross appeal are allowed
and paragraphs 4, 7, and 8 of the judgment are set aside. The
appellant is entitled to judgment against Sagaz for the damages
and prejudgment interest awarded in paragraphs 1 and 3. There
shall be an order for a new trial with respect to the liability
of Kavana. The appellants are entitled to their costs of the
trial against Sagaz and their costs of the appeal against both
Sagaz and Kavana.  The cross-appellants are entitled to their
costs of the appeal against Sagaz.
