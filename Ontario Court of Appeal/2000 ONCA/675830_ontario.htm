    <pre>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>

	  CORP., WILLIAM J. FRANCIS, IN TRUST and 43 AURIGA DRIVE
	  INC. (Respondents/Defendants)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:   CATZMAN, WEILER and ABELLA JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:  Peter H. Griffin and Mark Veneziano
          for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>          Thomas S. Heintzman for
          for the respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:    February 8, 2000</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Honourable Mr. Justice Binks
dated June 15, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In our view, this appeal does not turn on whether Roy J.
granted judgment on the covenant.  His endorsement resulted in
voluminous correspondence between the parties on the meaning of
his endorsement.  As a result of this exchange, it would have
been very clear to the appellant that the respondents were not
prepared to agree to anything that would render the guarantor
liable.
[2]  The conversion of the action from a foreclosure action to
one for judicial sale, made s. 20(3) of the Mortgages Act and the
choice of parties a central issue.  The consent order of Master
Schreider emanating from the negotiations surrounding this
conversion, was clear and unequivocal.  The appellant seeks to
have it set aside as a nullity despite the clarity of its
language, the prior exchange of letters dealing with the attempt
to protect the guarantor from liability, the fact that no appeal
was taken from Master Schreider&#146;s order, and the fact that the
only clause of that order the appellant sought initially to
challenge dealt with the quantum of damages.
[3]  In our view, this was not a case of mistaken intentions or
of a judgment erroneously failing to reflect the agreement of the
parties.  All the issues were squarely before both parties when
they negotiated the terms which formed the basis of Master
Schreiber&#146;s consent order.  In particular, we agree with Binks J.
that the appellant would have to have known that he had to make a
choice about which defendant he would obtain judgment against and
that there were consequences to that choice.  There is no reason
to conclude that the judgment of Master Schreider, a judgment the
appellant relied on in proceeding with the judicial sale, does
not accurately reflect that choice.  By signing judgment against
43 Auriga Drive Inc., the appellant&#146;s right to recover against
2792231 Canada Inc. was terminated by s. 20(3) of the Mortgages
Act.
[4]  Accordingly, Binks J. was correct in granting a stay of the
action against 2792231 Canada Inc. and this appeal is dismissed
with costs.</pre></td>
