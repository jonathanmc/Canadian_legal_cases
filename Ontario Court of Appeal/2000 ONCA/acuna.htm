    <pre><strong>BEFORE:      McMURTRY C.J.O., MORDEN and CATZMAN JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:     Philip M. Epstein, Q.C., for the appellant</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>             Todd J. McCarthy, for the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:       June 26, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Greer J. dated February 17, 2000.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong>
                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]  Madam Justice Greer erred in holding that she was functus
with respect to the motion under rule 37.14 to set aside her
earlier order.  She further erred in holding that there were no
grounds on which her earlier order should be set aside.
[2]  The uncontradicted evidence before her disclosed that:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>Mr. Elkin had suggested that the outstanding costs be paid
out of the appellant&#146;s recovery at the conclusion of trial 
but that, if Mr. Dow insisted on payment of the costs 
forthwith, Mr.  Elkin&#146;s firm would pay them;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Mr. Dow advised Mr. Elkin that he would seek instructions
and would get back to Mr. Elkin; and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>following that conversation, Mr. Elkin never received any
further demand for payment of costs nor was there any further
discussion regarding costs.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>On that state of the evidence, the order under appeal ought not
to have been made.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appeal is allowed, the order of Madam Justice Greer is
set aside and in its place an order will go for the relief sought
by the appellant on the motion.  The appellant is entitled to
payment forthwith of her costs of the motion and of this appeal,
each of which is fixed, in accordance with the figures agreed by
counsel, in the sum of $5,000.</pre>
