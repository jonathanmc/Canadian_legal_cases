    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction by Thomas J., sitting with a jury,
dated January 14, 1998 in Brampton.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>AUSTIN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction on January 14, 1998  on
one  count  of  importing heroin contrary to s.5 of the  Narcotic
Control  Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.N-1 after a trial before  Thomas  J.
with  a jury in the Ontario Court (General Division) in Brampton,
Ontario.  As  I  conclude  that there  must  be  a  retrial,  the
statement of facts will be necessarily brief.
[2]  On December 10, 1992, the appellant and his wife arrived at
Pearson International Airport in Toronto on a flight originating
in Lahore, Pakistan. While being processed by Customs they were
found to have in their carry-on luggage and on their persons, 9.9
kilograms of heroin. They were both charged under s.5 of the
Narcotic Control Act. They were tried together and the appellant
was convicted while his wife, Mrs. Naheed Ahmad, was acquitted.
On March 13, 1998, the appellant was sentenced to five years
imprisonment. The Crown applied for leave to appeal that sentence
but then abandoned that application.
[3]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal, which may be
summarized as improper refusal to permit a challenge of the jury
for cause, inconsistent verdicts, and improper cross-examination
of the appellant.
[4]  Dealing with these grounds in that order, the Crown concedes
that on the basis of this Court&#146;s decisions in R. v. Koh (1998),
131 C.C.C. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. P. (V.) (1999) 124
O.A.C. 54, the trial judge&#146;s failure to permit a Parks challenge
for cause under s.638(1)(b) of the Criminal Code constitutes
reversible error and that a new trial is therefore warranted in
this case.
[5]  I turn to the issue of inconsistent verdicts.  The appellant
and his wife were tried together.  They were separately
represented, but their common defence was duress.  In particular,
they alleged that while attending the funeral of a relative in
Pakistan, they and their children, who were in Canada, were
threatened by a group of persons as a result of which, when they
returned to Canada they brought with them 9.9 kilograms of heroin
on their persons and in their carry-on luggage, intending to turn
it over in accordance with the instructions of those who were
threatening them.
[6]  The appellant&#146;s position is that husband and wife were
treated and dealt with in identical fashion and that there was no
reasonable ground for distinguishing between them and that,
accordingly, the verdicts are inconsistent.  The appellant argued
that the verdict against him should therefore be set aside and an
acquittal entered.
[7]  The Crown&#146;s position is that although the accused were
husband and wife, they were separate persons and the jury was
bound to consider them separately and that in the circumstances
shown in the evidence the jury was entitled to distinguish
between them.
[8]  In accordance with the law as set out in R. v. Hibbert
(1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Ruzic (1998), 128
C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont. C.A.) the trial judge instructed the jury
that the common law defence of duress contained four elements:
          </pre>
    <pre>               i)    The person acts solely as a  result
	       of threats  of  death  or  serious bodily
	       harm  to himself, herself or to others he
               or she is bound to protect;
          </pre>
    <pre>               ii)   The  threats were of such  gravity
               that  the  accused person believed  that
               the   threats   would  be  carried   out
               immediately,    or   very    soon,    or
               imminently;
          </pre>
    <pre>               iii)  The threats might well have caused
               an ordinary reasonable person, placed in
               the  same  situation as the accused,  to
               act in the same manner as he or she did.
               Would   the   threats,  you   will   ask
               yourself,  overcome  the  will   of   an
               ordinary  person of reasonable firmness,
               sharing  the  characteristics   of   the
               particular accused, such as his  or  her
               age  and  background. It is an objective
               standard   &#150;   that  of   the   ordinary
               reasonable  person &#150;  but  the  personal
               circumstances of the particular  accused
               should   be   taken  into   account   in
               determining  the gravity of the  threats
               to that particular accused;
          </pre>
    <pre>               iv)   The  person must not have  had  an
               obvious  safe avenue of escape.  Whether
               or  not a safe avenue of escape existed,
               is  determined according to an objective
               standard.    However,   when   you   are
               considering   the   perceptions   of   a
               reasonable    person,    an     ordinary
               reasonable    person,    the    personal
               circumstances of the accused  should  be
               taken  into account.  The defence  would
               fail if an ordinary reasonable person of
               his  or  her  age, sex,  background  and
               other  relevant personal characteristics
               or  circumstances, would  have  realized
               there  was  an  obvious safe  avenue  of
               escape   and   would   have   taken   an
               opportunity to escape.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  common  law defence of duress is a personal  plea  for
exemption from the generally applicable criminal law.  In effect,
an  accused  invoking duress asks to be excused  from  conforming
with  those  standards. The fourth element of the duress  defence
entails a determination of whether the person would have  had  an
obvious  avenue of escape from the person or persons  making  the
threats.   An  assessment of this element requires  an  objective
standard   which   is   modified  by  the   particular   personal
circumstances and human frailties of the accused who invokes  it.
Hibbert  supra,  R.  v. Ruzic, supra, R. v. Canhoto  (1999),  140
C.C.C. (3d) 321 at p. 332 (Ont. C.A.).
[10] In this case the jury was properly instructed as to the
elements of this defence, and the respondent&#146;s position is that
its verdict is entirely consistent with a recognition of the
circumstances and frailties of each of the accused tried. The
jury was properly entitled to consider the sex, background, and
other relevant personal characteristics of the appellant and his
wife in the assessment of the fourth element of the defence.
While the events surrounding the importation of the heroin did
not differ as between the Appellant and his wife, this does not
mean, as the appellant puts it, that they stood &#147;in the same
shoes&#148; in so far as the defence of duress is concerned.
[11] In considering the applicability of this defence to each of
the appellant and Naheed Ahmad, it is necessary to consider their
respective personal characteristics and circumstances.  The jury
had ample grounds upon which to distinguish the culpability of
the appellant from that of Naheed Ahmad. It is clear from the
evidence led at trial that the cultural background of the
appellant and his wife led to significant differences in their
personal characteristics and circumstances:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  the  appellant came to Canada  following
          the   lead   of   his  brother  and   seeking
          opportunities; Naheed came to Canada to  join
          her husband following an arranged marriage;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  Naheed testified that women follow their
          husbands&#146;  lead  in   Pakistan  culture;  the
          appellant  testified  that  the  culture   in
          Pakistan is that the men may do all the  work
          for the women.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c) Naheed completed a grade 11 education and
          speaks  little  English and  no  French;  the
          appellant  is an experienced business  person
          involved in the operation of four businesses,
          in which he deals exclusively in English.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)  Naheed  had no relatives in Canada;  the
          appellant had 55 relatives in Canada as  well
          as  a  large  circle of friends and  business
          associates.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (e) Naheed, like the women in her family, did
          not  work  outside of the home; the appellant
          is   involved  in  supplies,  machinery,  and
          purchasing    both    within    Canada    and
          internationally;</pre>
    <pre>[12]  It is not only this evidence but other features of the case
which  could  have led to the jury&#146;s differentiation between  the
appellant and his wife.  The appellant was forthright and calm at
the  Customs  counter  whereas his  wife  was  nervous,  required
repeated  requests  to attend at the counter, and  the  appellant
responded  to a question from the inspector that in Pakistan  the
&#147;gentleman  may do all the work for the ladies&#148;.   As  well,  the
entire  chain  of events in Pakistan as related by the  appellant
and his wife shows the appellant to be taking a dominant role  in
dealings with &#147;Jumma Khan&#148;, the leader of the threatening  group.
As  well, there were occasions where the appellant was alone  and
having  conversations with &#147;Jumma Khan&#148; and the other  abductors.
It  is  submitted that these additional features of the  evidence
support  the  ultimate view of the trial Judge that there  was  a
basis   in   the  evidence  upon  which  the  jury   could   have
differentiated the appellant from his wife.
[13] The assessment of this evidence in the fourth element of the
defence of duress does not, as the appellant submits, entail
impermissible discriminatory analysis, but is rather a mandated
examination of the personal circumstances and human frailties of
each of the accused invoking the defence, along an objective
standard.  The appellant&#146;s position would effectively negate the
assessment of personal characteristics and other relevant factors
in any case of cross-cultural or cross-ethnic circumstances.  The
appellant cannot have it &#147;both ways&#148; &#150; seeking to rely upon
evidence of events in Pakistan and particular cultural features
(such as alleged police corruption in Pakistan) in support of his
defence &#150; but deny the ability of the trier of fact to examine
other evidence of personal circumstances relative to the fourth
element of duress. This is not a proper application of the duress
defence.
[14] In R. v. Hibbert, supra, Lamer C.J.C. expressed the
appropriate approach to the fourth aspect of the defence of
duress as follows at p.227, para. 60:</pre>
    <pre>	Accordingly, I am of the view that while the 
	question of whether a &#147;safe avenue of escape&#148; 
	was open to an accused who pleads duress 
	should be assessed on an objective basis, the
        appropriate objective standard to be employed 
	is one that takes into account the particular 
	circumstances and human frailties of the accused.</pre>
    <pre>[15]  Accordingly, the jury in the instant case not  only  could,
but should have, considered the frailties of husband and wife  on
an  individual basis.  Because, on the evidence, those  frailties
were quite different there was room for differing verdicts and  a
rational legal basis for different verdicts.
[16] The third ground, improper cross-examination of the
appellant involves pre-trial events.  The appellant is a person
of substantial wealth.  Before the trial the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police investigated him with a view to calling evidence
to establish that his wealth had its origin in whole or in part
in the drug trade.  The investigation was unsuccessful in this
respect.
[17] Notwithstanding this lack of success, a Mr. Brydon was
called on behalf of the Crown to testify about the investigation.
He was cross-examined on behalf of the appellant to such an
extent that counsel for the Crown objected but the objection was
not sustained.  That however was not the end of the matter.  When
the appellant testified on his own behalf, the Crown used the
opportunity to renew the inquiry into the source of the
appellant&#146;s wealth.  When the appellant&#146;s counsel objected, his
objection was rejected with a reminder of defence counsel&#146;s cross-
examination of Mr. Brydon.
[18] Defence counsel now renews that objection as irrelevant and
tending to disparage the appellant for no legitimate purpose.  It
is also argued that the unsupported suggestion that the
appellant&#146;s wealth is ill-gotten may be the real reason why the
jury acquitted the wife and convicted the husband.  To so decide
would be, of course, quite improper.  Assuming, without deciding
that this is what the jury did, the appellant would be entitled
not to an acquittal but to a new trial.
[19] In the circumstances, it is not necessary to resolve the
questions raised by the third ground of appeal.  On none of the
grounds argued is there a basis for the granting of an acquittal.
The appeal however is allowed and the matter referred back to the
Superior Court to be retried.</pre>
