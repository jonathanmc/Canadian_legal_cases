    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Matlow J. dated May 3, 1999</pre>
    <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  principal  issue  presented  by  this  appeal  is  the
interpretation of warranties and exclusion clauses in a  contract
between  a manufacturer and a purchaser in the aircraft industry.
A  secondary issue is the relationship between contract  law  and
tort  law  in regards to an exclusion clause purporting to  limit
the liability, in negligence, of a manufacturer to a purchaser.
</pre>
    <pre>A.   Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>(1)  The accident
     </pre>
    <pre>[2]   On  July 21, 1995, a BAe 146-200 aircraft, manufactured  by
British  Aerospace  Plc. (&#147;British Aerospace&#148;) and  operating  as
Air  Nova  flight 889, was on a scheduled passenger  flight  from
Halifax,  Nova  Scotia  to Charlottetown, Prince  Edward  Island.
During the landing on runway 03 in Charlottetown, the right  main
landing gear partially collapsed.  The pilot managed to keep  the
aircraft on the runway as it skidded along on the damaged landing
gear.   The plane came to a stop about 2800 feet down the runway.
There  was  an  emergency evacuation.  Fortunately,  no  one  was
injured.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  Transportation  Safety  Board  (&#147;TSB&#148;)  conducted   an
investigation and determined that the cause of the  accident  was
the  catastrophic failure of a direction link on the  right  main
landing  gear  of  the  aircraft.  The TSB  determined  that  the
direction  link tube became separated from one of its eyes  as  a
result of corrosion in the threads that connected the eye to  the
tube.   The  TSB  concluded that the most  likely  cause  of  the
corrosion  was water which entered the tube through the  key  way
and became trapped inside the tube.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The parties and their relationship
</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  appellant, Air Nova, is a Canadian corporation engaged
in  the  Canadian domestic aviation business.  Its main place  of
business and base of operations is Halifax.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   In January 1989, Air Nova leased and took delivery of a new
BAe 146 Series aircraft from British Aerospace. Prior to delivery
of  the  aircraft, Air Nova and British Aerospace entered into  a
Support  Agreement dated December 18, 1988 with  respect  to  the
aircraft.   Part A of Appendix C to the Support Agreement  is  an
aircraft  warranty.   Part  B  of Appendix  C  obligated  British
Aerospace  to require third party vendors to offer  to  Air  Nova
adequate  warranty  protection  in  respect  of  their  equipment
installed  in the aircraft and to assign to Air Nova the  benefit
of such warranties.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The defendant Messier-Dowty Limited (&#147;Dowty&#148;) is an English
corporation  carrying on business in the design, manufacture  and
supply  of  landing gear and components for fixed wing aircraft.1
Dowty designed and manufactured the landing gear installed in the
aircraft Air Nova leased from British Aerospace.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   Pursuant  to the various agreements among the parties  (Air
Nova-British Aerospace and British Aerospace-Dowty), Air Nova and
Dowty entered into an agreement with respect to the landing  gear
installed in the Air Nova aircraft.  An essential feature of  the
agreement  was  that Dowty offered, and Air Nova accepted,  three
warranties:</pre>
    <pre>(1)  the  General Warranty which provided that the Dowty products
     were free from defect in workmanship,  material  or  design, 
     failing which they  would  be  repaired or  replaced  at  no
     cost, if  the defect was discovered within  a defined period
     of time;
(2)  the  Safe Life Warranty which provided that certain  of  the
     products had a defined life; and
(3)  the  Turnaround  Warranty which provided  that  any  of  the
     products sent back for
     rectification  or  overhaul would be returned  to  Air  Nova
     within a specified period.
     </pre>
    <pre>[8]   These  three  warranties were contained  in  a  package  of
warranties Dowty offered to Air Nova.  The package, the  Standard
Warranty Agreement, consisted of five specific warranties  (Parts
2-6)  and a section containing general provisions (Part 1).   The
General Warranty, Safe Life Warranty and Turnaround Warranty were
found  in Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the general package.  There  is  no
dispute  that  Air Nova accepted these parts.   Nor  is  there  a
dispute  that Air Nova did not accept the warranties in  parts  5
and 6 of the package.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The package of warranties sent to Air Nova by Dowty included
a  five-page document prepared by Dowty entitled &#147;Variations from
Standard  Warranty Agreements&#148;.  The warranty terms  accepted  by
Air  Nova  were those set out in Parts 2, 3 and 4 of the Standard
Warranty Agreement as amended by the Dowty variations.</pre>
    <pre>[10]  Parts  2,  3  and  4  of  the Standard  Warranty  Agreement
contained provisions limiting Dowty&#146;s liability.  Typical of  the
provisions in all three parts is paragraph 8 of Part 2:
          </pre>
    <pre>  8.  The Vendor shall have no liability under this GW otherwise
      than as expressly provided in the foregoing paragraphs hereof.
</pre>
    <pre>[11]  However,  when the Dowty variations were incorporated  into
the Standard Warranty Agreement, paragraph 8 of Part 2 read:
        </pre>
    <pre>  8.  The Vendor shall have no liability under this GW otherwise
      than as expressly provided in the foregoing paragraphs hereof
      together with paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Part 1 of this Appendix
      4. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>Similar  changes  were  made to Parts 3 and  4  of  the  Standard
Warranty Agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[12]  The key provision in this lawsuit is paragraph 7 of Part  1
of the Standard Warranty Agreement, which provides:</pre>
    <pre>  7.  The obligations and liabilities under the Warranties
      pursuant to Paragraph 1 or 2 above and in any Sales Agreement of
      which the Warranties may be part are in lieu of, and B.Ae. and/or
      the Purchaser and/or the Operator waives as to Dowty and its
      associated Companies, all other Warranties (whether of
      merchantability, fitness or otherwise) guarantees or liabilities
      expressed or implied, arising by law or otherwise (including
      without limitation any obligation of Dowty with respect to
      special or consequential damages other than those specifically
      stated in Paragraph 2 of Part 2 of this Appendix 4) and whether
      or not occasioned by Dowty&#146;s negligence. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[13]  It is common ground that the general warranties set out  in
Parts  2, 3 and 4 of the Standard Warranty Agreement do not  come
into  play  in this litigation.  Dowty&#146;s obligation to repair  or
replace  the  defective  landing gear, and  to  do  so  within  a
specified time period, did not arise because the failure  of  the
landing  gear  did not occur within two years of its installation
in the aircraft.</pre>
    <pre>(3)  The litigation</pre>
    <pre>[14]  On  July 21, 1997, Air Nova issued its Statement  of  Claim
against  Dowty.  Air Nova sought damages of $1,500,000  on  three
bases   &#150;   negligent  design  of  the  landing  gear,  negligent
manufacture  of the landing gear, and negligent failure  to  warn
Air Nova about the possible susceptibility of the landing gear to
corrosion.   A  flavour of Air Nova&#146;s claim can be garnered  from
these excerpts from its statement of claim:</pre>
    <pre>     14.  Air Nova pleads that its damages were caused by the
          negligence of Dowty in the following, among other 
	  particulars:
          </pre>
    <pre>     (A)  it manufactured, assembled and distributed the Subject
	  Part to British Aerospace for use in the main landing 
	  gear on its BAe 146 aircraft when it knew or ought to
	  have known that it was susceptible to corrosion;
                               .&#133;.
     (C)  it  failed to provide any or an adequate
          warning  to  Air  Nova,  prior  to   the
          occurrence,  when it knew  or  ought  to
          have known of the corrosion problem with
          the Subject Part;</pre>
    <pre>                                             &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>     18.  Air Nova further pleads that the Subject Part was
          negligently designed and negligently manufactured by 
	  Dowty in the following, among other, respects:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (A)  Dowty failed to ensure that the Subject Part was adequately
          protected from corrosion when it was provided to British
          Aerospace and installed in the Aircraft as part of the landing
          gear;
     </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>     19.  As a result of the negligence of Dowty, considerable damage
          was done to the Aircraft, which damage was repaired at the
          expense of Air Nova.  In addition, Air Nova suffered damages
          occasioned by the loss of the Aircraft while it was being
          repaired.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[15] Dowty issued its Statement of Defence on March 4, 1998.   It
asserted,  inter  alia,  that  Air Nova  had  signed  a  warranty
agreement  with  Dowty by virtue of which Air  Nova  &#147;waived  any
claim  against  the  defendants  for  damages  sustained  to  the
plaintiff&#146;s  aircraft allegedly caused by the negligence  of  the
defendants&#148; (paragraph 10).</pre>
    <pre>[16] Relying on this position, Dowty brought a motion for summary
judgment  pursuant  to Rule 20 of the Rules of  Civil  Procedure,
R.R.O.  1990,  Reg. 194.  The motion was heard by  Matlow  J.  on
April  30,  1999.  On May 3, 1999 the motions judge  granted  the
defendants&#146; motion.  His endorsement reads:
</pre>
    <pre>          Summary  judgment is to issue dismissing
          this  action  with costs  including  the
          costs of this motion.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  am persuaded that amended paragraph 7
          (as  set  out on p. 218 of this  record)
          was   part  of  the  direct  contractual
          relationship  between  the  parties  and
          that  it provides a full defence to  all
          of the plaintiff&#146;s claims.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[17] The plaintiff, Air Nova, appeals from this decision.</pre>
    <pre>B.   Issues</pre>
    <pre>[18] The issues that need to be considered on this appeal are:</pre>
    <pre>(1)  What  are  the  relevant  terms of  the  warranty  agreement
     between Air Nova and Dowty?
(2)  Do  the  terms  of the warranty agreement, as determined  in
     (1),  exclude  Dowty&#146;s  liability for negligence,  including
     negligent design and manufacture?
(3)  If  the  answer  in  (2) is &#145;yes&#146;, then  does  the  warranty
     agreement also exclude Dowty&#146;s liability for negligent failure to
     warn about potential defects in the product?</pre>
    <pre>C.   Analysis

(1)  The terms of the agreement</pre>
    <pre>[19]  Air  Nova  asserts that it accepted only Parts  2  (General
Warranty), 3 (Safe Life Warranty) and 4 (Turnaround Warranty)  of
the  Dowty Standard Warranty Agreement.  It bases this submission
on  the  exchange  of letters between Air Nova  and  Dowty  which
served to create the contract between them.</pre>
    <pre>[20]   After  receiving  Dowty&#146;s  warranty  package,   Air   Nova
communicated its acceptance of Parts 2, 3 and 4 in a letter dated
January 17, 1989:</pre>
    <pre>          In  consideration of the supply  by  you
          direct  to  the undersigned  or  through
          British Aerospace of equipment installed
          in  the  Aircraft or as spare parts  for
          use in connection with the operation  of
          the  BAe 146 aircraft, we hereby confirm
          acceptance  of your Equipment Warranties
          in  the terms of the General, Safe  Life
          and Turnaround Warranties.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[21] By letter dated February 8, 1989, Dowty confirmed Air Nova&#146;s
acceptance:</pre>
    <pre>          Thank  you for your letters of the  17th
          and  25th January 1989, confirming  that
          Air  Nova Inc. has accepted delivery  of
          BAe  146  Series 200 Aircraft&#133; and  that
          you  accept  the General Safe  Life  and
          Turnaround  Warranties  given  by  Dowty
          Rotol Limited.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[22] Air Nova submits that both of these letters contain explicit
language limiting its acceptance of the warranty package to  only
Parts 2, 3 and 4.</pre>
    <pre>[23]  I  cannot accept this submission.  Part 1 of  the  Standard
Warranty  Agreement  is  a  general  and,  for  the  most   part,
descriptive  section  dealing with the entire  warranty  package.
Paragraph  7  of Part 1, however, is much more than a descriptive
umbrella  provision.  It is a far-reaching exclusion of liability
clause,   covering  even  liability  for  negligence.    In   the
Variations from Standard Warranty Agreement which Dowty  sent  to
Air  Nova  with  its  warranty package, it is  clear  that  Dowty
intended  to  link  paragraph  7 of  Part  1  directly  with  the
exclusion clauses that already existed in Parts 2, 3 and 4.  With
respect  to  each  of  these  parts,  the  words  &#147;together  with
paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Part 1 of this Appendix 4&#148; were added
to  the  relevant  paragraphs.  Thus, as  set  out  earlier,  the
wording of section 8 of Part 2 (the General Warranty) became:</pre>
    <pre>  8. The Vendor shall have no liability under this GW otherwise
     than as expressly provided in the foregoing paragraphs hereof
     together with paragraphs 5, 6, 7 and 8 of Part 1 of this Appendix 4.
</pre>
    <pre>[24]  Similar language was used to link paragraphs 5-8 of Part  1
with  comparable  provisions in Part 3 (Safe Life  Warranty)  and
Part 4 (Turnaround Warranty) of the Standard Warranty Agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  It follows that when Air Nova accepted Parts 2, 3 and 4  of
the  Standard Warranty Agreement, it also accepted the provisions
of  Part  1,  which were explicitly referred to in  those  parts.
Accordingly, my conclusion on this issue is the same as  the  one
reached by the motions judge: &#147;amended paragraph 7 [of Part 1]  &#133;
was  part  of  the  direct contractual relationship  between  the
parties&#148;.
</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The interpretation of the exclusion clause
</pre>
    <pre>[26]  Air  Nova&#146;s  second submission is that,  even  if  the  &#145;no
liability for negligence&#146; exclusion in paragraph 7 of Part  1  is
part  of  its  contract  with Dowty, it is  not  a  free-standing
exclusion  of  liability for all negligent acts or  omissions  on
Dowty&#146;s part.  Rather, because paragraph 7 of Part 1 was referred
to in specific paragraphs in Parts 2, 3 and 4, the exclusion must
be read in the context of only the warranties in those parts.</pre>
    <pre>[27]  I do not agree with this submission.  In my view, paragraph
8  of  Part  2  and paragraph 7 of Part 1 must be read  together.
That  is clear from the words &#147;together with&#148; in paragraph  8  of
Part  2;  they are words that link the provisions of the  General
Warranty and four paragraphs, including paragraph 7, from Part 1.</pre>
    <pre>[28]  What,  then,  does paragraph 7 of Part  1  add  to  Dowty&#146;s
protection?   Although it is an overly long  and  poorly  drafted
provision,  its  application to Air Nova in the context  of  this
case comes from these words:</pre>
    <pre>  7.  The obligations and liabilities under the [General Warranty]
      &#133; are in lieu of &#133; and &#133; [Air Nova] waives as to Dowty &#133; all
      other warranties &#133; guarantees or liabilities express or implied,
      arising by law or otherwise &#133; and whether or not occasioned by
      Dowty&#146;s negligence.
      </pre>
    <pre>[29] My interpretation of these words is this:</pre>
    <pre>(1)  Under the General Warranty, Dowty promised to provide
     landing gear &#147;free from defect in workmanship or design
     having regard to the state of the art at the time of design&#148;
     (Paragraph 1 of Part 2);
(2)  This warranty lasts for two years from the date of delivery
     or installation (Paragraph 2 of Part 2);
(3)  The  warranty  in (1) and (2) is &#147;in lieu of&#148; and  Air  Nova
     &#147;waives  as  to Dowty &#133; all other liabilities &#133;  arising  by
     law&#148; (Paragraph 7 of Part 1); and
(4)  The  &#147;other liabilities&#148; Air Nova waives include those  that
     might be &#147;occasioned by Dowty&#146;s  negligence&#148; (Paragraph 7 of
     Part 1).</pre>
    <pre>[30]  In  the  present  case, the landing gear  became  defective
outside  the two-year period prescribed in the General  Warranty.
So  the  contractual warranty cannot assist Air Nova.   Normally,
that  might  not be the end of the matter because, if the  defect
were caused by Dowty&#146;s negligence, a lawsuit grounded in tort law
would  be possible.  That is what Air Nova is attempting in  this
litigation.  However, the language of Paragraph 7 of Part 1 kicks
in  to  prevent  the  lawsuit.  In return  for  the  warranty  it
received,  Air  Nova specifically waived any  other  recourse  it
might  have  had  against Dowty, including recourse  for  Dowty&#146;s
negligence.</pre>
    <pre>[31] For these reasons, I am of the view that the motions judge&#146;s
conclusion that &#147;paragraph 7 &#133; provides a full defence to all  of
the plaintiff&#146;s claims&#148; was correct.</pre>
    <pre>(3)  Negligent failure to warn</pre>
    <pre>[32]  Air  Nova&#146;s  third submission is an  alternative  one.   It
asserts that if the court interprets paragraph 7 of Part 1 of the
Standard  Warranty Agreement to exclude liability in  negligence,
the   exclusion  should  cover  negligent  design  and  negligent
manufacture, but not negligent failure to warn about  the  defect
in the landing gear component once Dowty becomes aware of it.2</pre>
    <pre>[33]  Air  Nova does not assert that parties cannot  by  contract
exclude  liability  for  negligent  failure  to  warn.   Such  an
assertion  would  fail  in light of the recent  decision  of  the
Supreme  Court  of Canada in Bow Valley Husky (Bermuda)  Ltd.  v.
Saint  John  Shipbuilding Ltd., [1997] 3 S.C.R.  1210.   In  that
case, the court held that the common law duty to warn was not  an
absolute  one;  it  gave  way  to a clear  contractual  provision
excluding   liability  except  as  provided  in  the  warranties.
McLachlin J. (dissenting, but not on this point) articulated  the
general proposition of law in this fashion, at p. 1232:</pre>
    <pre>          To  borrow the language of La Forest  J.
          in  London Drugs Ltd. v. Kuehne &amp;  Nagel
          International Ltd., [1992] 3 S.C.R. 299,
          at p. 327, tort liability in a case such
          as  this  falls  to  be  assessed  in  a
          contractual   matrix.    The    parties&#146;
          planned   obligations  must   be   given
          appropriate  pre-eminence.  Where  those
          planned    obligations    negate    tort
          liability, contract &#147;trumps&#148;  tort:  see
          J.   Fleming,  &#147;Tort  in  a  Contractual
          Matrix&#148;  (1993),  5 Canterbury  L.  Rev.
          269, at p. 270, citing P. Cane, Tort Law
          and  Economic  Interests (1991),  at  p.
          293.   It  follows  that  a  tort  claim
          cannot  be  used to escape an  otherwise
          applicable   contractual  exclusion   or
          limitation clause: Central Trust Co.  v.
          Rafuse, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147.
</pre>
    <pre>[34]  Iacobucci  J.,  speaking  for  the  majority,  agreed  with
McLachlin  J&#146;s discussion of the general principles  relating  to
the  intersection of contract and tort law.  He, too,  said  that
&#147;where  the planned contractual obligations of two parties negate
tort  liability, contract will &#145;trump&#146; tort&#148; (at p.  1272).   See
also   BG Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia Hydro  and
Power  Authority,[1993] 1 S.C.R. 12, especially at pp. 26-30  per
La Forest and McLachlin JJ.</pre>
    <pre>[35] In the face of this jurisprudence, Air Nova&#146;s submission  is
not  that Dowty could not exclude liability for negligent failure
to  warn.   Rather, its argument is that paragraph 7 of  Part  1,
properly  interpreted,  does  not  exclude  such  liability.   In
particular,  Air Nova relies on the words &#147;expressed or  implied&#148;
in  that provision; its argument based on these words is set  out
in paragraph 37 of its factum:</pre>
    <pre>          [T]he  exclusion provision relied on  by
          Dowty by its plain meaning only excludes
          liabilities &#147;&#133; expressed or implied  &#133;&#148;,
          i.e.  liabilities  in existence  at  the
          time  of  the  contract,  and  does  not
          address   liabilities   not    in    the
          contemplation of the parties at the time
          of  the  contract.  By  using  the  past
          tense, the clause fails to explicitly or
          emphatically exclude future  liabilities
          that  arise  from negligent  failure  to
          warn &#133; .
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[36]  There are two problems, one minor and the other major, with
Air  Nova&#146;s submission on this point.  First, I do not think that
the  words &#147;expressed or implied&#148; are words that connote only the
past  tense.  They are descriptive words which indicate the types
of liability that are excluded.</pre>
    <pre>[37]  Second, and more fundamentally, the wording of paragraph  7
of  Part 1 is clear: &#147;all &#133; liabilities&#148; are excluded, including,
specifically,  those  that  might  be  &#147;occasioned   by   Dowty&#146;s
negligence.&#148;   One  of  the categories  of  modern  tort  law  is
&#145;negligent failure to warn&#146;.  Air Nova concedes (for the  purpose
of  its  alternative argument) that the exclusion clause captures
negligent design and negligent manufacture.  Given that negligent
failure to warn is as much a part of tort law as negligent design
and negligent manufacture,  I see no good reason for interpreting
the  words  &#147;Dowty&#146;s negligence&#148; in paragraph  7  of  Part  1  as
covering  design and manufacture, but not covering a  failure  to
warn.</pre>
    <pre>[38]  I  make one final observation on the failure to warn issue.
In  my  view, Dowty&#146;s exclusion clause is stronger than the three
exclusion  clauses considered by the Supreme Court of  Canada  in
Bow  Valley Husky (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd.,
supra.  None of the exclusion clauses in that case used the  word
&#145;negligence&#146;.   Yet, the Supreme Court interpreted  the  clauses,
because  of  their broad wording, as excluding  liability  for  a
negligent failure to warn.  In the present appeal, the clause  in
issue  specifically mentions &#145;negligence&#146; as  coming  within  its
ambit.   It  is no stretch, in my view, to interpret &#145;negligence&#146;
to  cover  one of the recognized components of tort  law,  namely
&#145;negligent failure to warn&#146;.</pre>
    <pre>[39] For these reasons, Air Nova&#146;s alternative argument fails.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition
</pre>
    <pre>[40] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
