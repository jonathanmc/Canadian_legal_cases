    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Cameron J. dated July 2, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns one element of a much broader action.
The sole issue on this appeal is whether the motions judge erred
in striking out part of Air Canada&#146;s statement of claim against
the Greater Toronto Airports Authority (&#147;GTAA&#148;).  In the portion
of Air Canada&#146;s statement of claim that was struck out, Air
Canada seeks a declaration that the GTAA has no jurisdiction or
authority to impose fees and charges on the users of Pearson
International Airport (&#147;Pearson&#148;).  The statement of claim
pleads, in paragraphs 94 to 101, that, pursuant to the
Aeronautics Act, the Minister of Transport may make regulations
respecting airport charges; that the power to make regulations
may not be delegated and that the Act is a complete code with the
result that only the Minister may levy airport charges.  The
motions judge held:</pre>
    <pre>          It is plain and obvious on the pleadings and
          the documents referred to therein that GTAA
          has the power and authority to impose rates,
          charges and fees to the extent permitted by
          the PAP, which were incorporated into the
          Ground Lease and GTAA&#146;s letters patent
          subject to the Crown&#146;s legislative authority.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant submits that Cameron J. failed to appreciate
that there was an issue for trial as to whether:</pre>
    <pre>     a)  any statutory jurisdiction existed for the delegation
	 of the right of the Minister of Transport  to impose
	 fees and charges for the use of airports; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     b)  the GTAA was operating Pearson for the benefit of the
         Crown.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  We are of the opinion that it was not necessary for Cameron
J. to resolve the two issues outlined above in order to strike
the portions of the statement of claim that he did.  The basis on
which the GTAA levies fees is not pursuant to a delegation of
power by the Minister of Transport.  The GTAA has a lease of the
Airport property.  The GTAA has power, as part of its corporate
capacity, to charge for the use of its property.  As a result of
the Aeronautics Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.A-3,  s.4 (1),4.2 and 4.4(2),
The Airport Transfers (Miscellaneous Matters) Act (1992), c.5 and
regulations passed pursuant to this legislation, the corporate
power of the GTAA to set rates and charges and to act in the
event of default of payment is recognized.  Pearson was removed
from the list of airports for which the Minister levies service
charges when the Air Services Charges Regulation, SOR/97-258 was
amended in 1992 on the assumption that the GTAA had power and
authority to set the fees.  Whether or not the GTAA is operating
Pearson on behalf of the Crown, it was clearly not the intention
of Parliament to create a complete code so that a designated
airport authority like the GTAA has no authority to impose fees
unless they are set out by regulation.  No legislative lacunae
exists.
[4]    The agreement between the Minister and the GTAA also
supports no other conclusion than that the GTAA can set user fees
and charges.
[5]  The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent.</pre>
