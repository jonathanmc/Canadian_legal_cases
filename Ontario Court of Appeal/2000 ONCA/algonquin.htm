    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[1]  The court released its reasons for judgment in this matter
on October 27, 1998.  Since then, it has been brought to our
attention that paragraphs 16 and 29 contain an error.  Rather
than referring to paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 of the judgment of the
Divisional Court, the parties point out and we agree, that those
paragraphs should have referred to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of the
Divisional Court judgment.  Accordingly, the reasons are amended
to reflect that change.
[2]  Counsel also agree that in addition to vacating paragraphs
2, 3 and 4 of the Divisional Court judgment, the following
paragraph should be substituted:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">   This court declares that paragraphs 4 and 5 of page 3
   of the Forest Management Planning Manual, except in
   respect of the 1995 Forest Management plans and work
   schedules, are ultra vires the CFSA and of no legal
   force and effect, and order that they be and are hereby
   quashed.</font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">[3]  We are prepared to give effect to this request and paragraph
29 of our reasons is amended to read:
          </font></pre>
    <pre><font face="Courier New" size="3">  In the result, an order will go vacating paragraphs 2, 3
  and 4 of the judgment of the Divisional Court and the
  following paragraph is substituted therefor:
