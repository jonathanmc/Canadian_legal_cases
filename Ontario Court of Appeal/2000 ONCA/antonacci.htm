</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice K. E. Swinton dated
March 4, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Vito  Antonacci was dismissed from his employment with  The
Great  Atlantic &amp; Pacific Company of Canada, Limited  (&#147;A  &amp;  P&#148;)
after  33  years of service. He brought this action for  wrongful
dismissal  seeking general, aggravated and punitive damages.  The
trial judge, Swinton J., found that A &amp; P did not have cause  for
dismissing Mr. Antonacci and granted him judgment in the  amounts
of   $26,708.85  for  general  damages,  $15,000  for  aggravated
damages,  $7,209.00 for prejudgment interest and  $28,162.33  for
costs. She dismissed the claim for punitive damages. Both parties
appeal the decision.
[2]  One week before the trial commenced, A &amp; P abandoned its
position that Mr Antonacci had been dismissed for cause.
Therefore, the trial judge&#146;s finding that Mr. Antonacci was
wrongfully dismissed is not in issue on this appeal. A &amp; P&#146;s
appeal raises issues concerning the frustration of the employment
contract arising from Mr. Antonacci&#146;s medical problems, the
quantum of the deduction allowed for  Workers&#146; Compensation
Benefits received by Mr. Antonacci, the award of aggravated
damages, and the quantum of the costs award. Mr. Antonacci&#146;s
cross-appeal raises issues concerning the deductibility of part
of the Workers&#146; Compensation Benefits and the dismissal of the
claim for punitive damages.
[3]  I would allow A &amp; P&#146;s appeal to the extent of setting aside
the award for aggravated damages but would not give effect to the
other grounds of appeal. I would dismiss Mr. Antonacci&#146;s cross-
appeal. I will deal with the issues relating to the general,
aggravated and punitive damages each in turn and will conclude
with the issue of costs.</pre>
    <pre>     A.   General Damages</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The trial judge reviewed the circumstances surrounding  Mr.
Antonacci&#146;s  dismissal  in  considerable  detail  in   order   to
determine  the  appropriate  notice period  in  her  reasons  for
judgment  reported at (1998), 35 C.C.E.L. (2d)  1.  Therefore,  I
will not review the facts beyond what is necessary to dispose  of
the issues raised before this court.
[5]  The trial judge found not only that there was no cause for
dismissal, but that this was a case where the conduct of the
employer justified a longer period of notice in accordance with
the principles established in Wallace v. United Grain Growers
(1997), 152 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.). She concluded that &#147;the
serious but unfounded allegations made against Mr. Antonacci - of
poor performance, harassment, intimidation, and threats cast a
shadow on him that would make it virtually impossible for him to
find another position, especially given his age and physical
condition&#148;. Given these factors, the trial judge held that Mr.
Antonacci was entitled &#147;to the maximum period of notice generally
said to be available in wrongful dismissal cases &#150; namely, 24
months&#148;. This finding is not in issue on this appeal.
[6]  The trial judge held further that the amount of general
damages owing for the wrongful dismissal was the salary that
would have been earned by Mr. Antonacci during this 24-month
period less the actual amount he received in Workers&#146;
Compensation benefits over the period. A &amp; P makes two arguments
with respect to the award of general damages and Mr. Antonacci
raises one issue on his cross-appeal.
[7]  Firstly, the employer argues that no general damages are
owing because the employment contract had been frustrated by the
fact that Mr. Antonacci, for medical reasons, was never able to
work after his dismissal. Secondly, if general damages are
payable, A &amp; P takes the position that the amount deducted for
the Workers&#146; Compensation Benefits received during the notice
period should have been grossed up to account for the fact that
they are non-taxable. It is argued that it is necessary to gross
up the amount of the deduction to avoid double recovery.
[8]  Mr. Antonacci takes the position that only the actual amount
received in benefits should be deducted. On his cross-appeal
however, he argues that no deductions should be made at all for
those benefits received during notice and severance period
prescribed under the Employment Standards Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E-
14, as amended.</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Frustration of contract</pre>
    <pre>[9]  A &amp; P argued at trial that no damages were owing because the
employment  contract had been frustrated due to  Mr.  Antonacci&#146;s
medical  condition. In support of this argument, A &amp; P relied  in
part  on  the  fact that, in June 1995, Mr. Antonacci  was  found
permanently disabled by the Workers&#146; Compensation Board.
[10] The trial judge stated as follows:

   The doctrine of frustration applies when a contract becomes
   incapable of performance because, in the circumstances,
   performance would be radically different from that contemplated
   by the parties at the time they made the contract. Many cases
   have emphasized that the frustrating event must be beyond the
   contemplation of the parties. With respect to employee illness or
   incapacity, modern courts have not treated illness per se as a
   frustrating event; rather, they have looked at the length of the
   illness in relation to both the terms and duration of the
   employment contract.</pre>
    <pre>[11]  After  reviewing some of the relevant case law,  the  trial
judge concluded that, on the facts of this case, it would not  be
appropriate   to  find  that  the  contract  of  employment   was
frustrated.  In  particular, the trial judge noted  that  A  &amp;  P
offered  its employees sick leave and long term disability  plans
and  that the prognosis for Mr. Antonacci&#146;s condition at the time
of dismissal was not total disability. Hence, she concluded that,
at  the time of dismissal, A &amp; P would not have been justified in
dismissing  Mr.  Antonacci  on the basis  that  the  contract  of
employment  was  frustrated because  the  contract  gave  him  an
entitlement to a period of sick leave. In further support of  her
conclusion  that  the contract of employment was not  frustrated,
the trial judge relied on evidence that Mr. Antonacci&#146;s job could
have  been  modified to accommodate a worker with a back  injury,
or,  alternatively, that A &amp; P, with 24,000 workers  in  Ontario,
might  well have been able to find alternative suitable work  for
him.  Finally, the trial judge held that, because A &amp; P  did  not
rely  on  Mr.  Antonacci&#146;s medical condition in  support  of  its
decision to terminate the contract, it would be wrong to allow it
to  invoke  events  arising  at  least  eight  months  after  the
termination of the contract to argue frustration of a contract no
longer in existence.
[12] A &amp; P does not suggest on appeal that the trial judge made
any findings of fact that are not supported by the evidence. A &amp;
P simply reiterates the position it took at trial that no damages
should be awarded for the wrongful dismissal because, as it
turned out, Mr. Antonacci was never able to return to any form of
employment and was later found to be permanently disabled.
[13] I see no reason to interfere with the trial judge&#146;s
conclusion on this issue. Her finding that there was no basis to
argue frustration of the contract of employment at the time of
dismissal, given the terms of the contract and Mr. Antonacci&#146;s
condition at the time, is entirely supported by the evidence.
Indeed A &amp; P never claimed justification for termination on the
basis of frustration. Further, A &amp; P entirely abandoned at trial
its claim that the termination was justified. In these
circumstances, it is my view that it was not open to A &amp; P, in
its argument on damages, to invoke the doctrine of frustration.
In effect, A &amp; P, in advancing this argument was attempting to
reopen the whole issue of justification for the dismissal, a
position that it had clearly abandoned at the commencement of the
trial.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Deductibility of Workers&#146; Compensation Benefits</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Both parties agree that Workers&#146; Compensation Benefits must
be deducted from the award of general damages in order to prevent
double  recovery  for wage loss in accordance with  this  court&#146;s
decision  in  Dowsley v. Viceroy Fluid Power  International  Inc.
(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 57 (C.A.). The parties submit, however, that
Dowsley did not deal with the issues raised in this case. I  will
deal firstly with the cross-appeal.
[15] Mr. Antonacci submits that Workers&#146; Compensation Benefits
received during the notice and severance period under s.58 of the
Employment Standards Act are not deductible from the award of
general damages because of the following provision under s.58(7):

          58(7) &#150; Severance pay under this section is 
	  Payable to the employee in addition to any 
	  other payment under this Act or contract of
	  employment without set-off or deduction, except
	  for,
          
	  (a) supplementary unemployment benefits
          payable to and received by the employee; or

          (b) payments made to the employee under
          a  contractual  severance  pay  scheme  under
          which  payments for loss of employment  based
          upon   length   of  service   are   provided.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Mr.  Antonacci submits that because severance pay,  payable
under  the  Employment  Standards Act,  is  not  subject  to  any
reduction  if  there is mitigation income from other  sources  of
employment,  it  would  be inconsistent to  deduct  the  Workers&#146;
Compensation Benefits received during that same period  from  the
award of general damages.
[17] I see no merit to this argument. The fact that Workers&#146;
Compensation Benefits are not deductible from any severance
payment under s.58 lends no support to Mr. Antonacci given that
severance payments under s.58 are themselves deductible from any
award of damages for wrongful dismissal. See Stevens v. The Globe
and Mail (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.). It follows that all
Workers&#146; Compensation Benefits received during the 24 month
notice period are deductible from the damage award.
[18] A &amp; P maintains, as it did at trial, that the calculation of
damages requires a grossing up of the Workers&#146; Compensation
Benefits to reflect the fact that they are not subject to income
tax.  It is argued that if the amount is not grossed up, Mr.
Antonacci will be overcompensated.
[19] The trial judge rejected A &amp; P&#146;s argument on the basis that
the tax treatment of Workers&#146; Compensation Benefits rests on a
tax policy of the federal government and any resulting benefit to
the employee cannot be claimed by the employer.  The matter is
best left to the legislature.
[20] I agree with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion. The result is
consistent with the general approach adopted in personal injury
cases whereby damages for loss of income are calculated on the
basis of the before-tax income lost:  The Queen in Right of Ont.
v. Jennings (1966), 57 D.L.R. (2d) 644 (S.C.C.).  Much the same
reasoning applies here.
[21] Damages should restore Mr. Antonacci to the position in
which he would have stood but for A &amp; P&#146;s wrongdoing. However,
what Mr. Antonacci would have done, or would have been required
to do, with the employment income he would have received from A &amp;
P, in so far as A &amp; P is concerned, is irrelevant. The &#147;loss&#148;
resulting from any resulting overcompensation is to Revenue
Canada, not to the employer. The rule against double recovery is
not absolute. It admits of certain exceptions, particularly where
there are competing policy considerations. In a case such as this
one, it would be against public policy to make it more profitable
for the employer to pay damages for the breach of contract than
to perform the contract.  Further, to require an assessment of
the plaintiff&#146;s liability to pay tax in every case where
deductions are made from a damage award would give rise to
considerable practical difficulties that would result in an
unwarranted increase in the cost of litigation. Indeed, as the
trial judge concluded, the tax treatment of Workers&#146; Compensation
Benefits and any resulting benefit to the recipient is a question
better left to the legislature.</pre>
    <pre>B.   Aggravated Damages</pre>
    <pre>[22] The trial judge correctly instructed herself on the law with
respect  to  aggravated damages, as re-examined  by  the  Supreme
Court of Canada in Wallace. She noted that aggravated damages are
designed  to  compensate for intangible injuries  and  that  they
generally   supplement   the  damages   awarded   under   general
principles. She also noted that the Supreme Court of  Canada,  in
Vorvis  v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia (1989), 58  D.L.R.
(4th) 193 (S.C.C.), made it clear that an award of aggravated, or
punitive, damages will be rare in cases of contract law and that,
after  Wallace, the conduct giving rise to either type of  damage
must be a separate actionable wrong.
[23] The trial judge then considered the facts. In so far as the
employer&#146;s unfounded claims of misconduct were concerned, she
held that they had been taken into account in the calculation of
the notice period and that, in any event, they could not be
characterized as separate actionable wrongs. In my view, she was
entirely correct in reaching this conclusion. The trial judge
then stated as follows:

    Nevertheless there has been conduct by the employer which is
    harsh and reprehensible and which, in my view, constitutes a
    separate actionable wrong that justifies an award of aggravated
    damages. The employer informed the Workers&#146; Compensation Board
    that Mr. Antonacci had been dismissed for cause in December,
    1994. That information was never corrected.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The letter in question was sent by the employer when it  was
informed  by  the  Workers&#146; Compensation Board (&#147;WCB&#148;)  that  Mr.
Antonacci&#146;s  file was being reviewed by the Re-Employment  Branch
of the WCB. The text of the letter sent by A &amp; P&#146;s representative
reads as follows:

               &#147;Thank you for your letter of 12/5/94.

                     Mr.  Vito  Antonacci has requested
          his  file  be  reviewed by the  Re-employment
          Branch of the WCB.

                     Mr.  Antonacci  last  worked  week
          ending  Oct.15 1994. At this time he received
          a  large  settlement from  the  company.  The
          termination  had nothing to do with  the  WCB
          injury    under    which   Benefits    ceased
          approximately  Aug.25 1994.  Mr.  Antonacci&#146;s
          termination  was based on performance  issues
          which   long   preceded   his   injury.   The
          termination is an employment issue only.

                    Please refer this letter to the Re-
          employment Branch for their consideration.

                    Thank You.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The  trial  judge considered the effect of the  letter  and
concluded as follows:

          The reason for the dismissal was very important,
	  especially once it was determined that Mr. 
	  Antonacci was permanently partially disabled
	  because of a work-related injury. Section 54
          of the Workers&#146; Compensation Act grants rights
	  to re-employment to injured workers.

               &#133;

          By   informing  the  Board  that   Mr.
          Antonacci had been dismissed for cause and by
          never   changing  that  story,  the  employer
          misled  the Board and deprived Mr.  Antonacci
          of the opportunity to avail himself of the re-
          employment rights under the Act.</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The trial judge rejected the submission that s. 54  of  the
Workers&#146;  Compensation Act was irrelevant because Mr.  Antonacci,
for  reasons  that had nothing to do with the employer&#146;s  letter,
had not sought re-employment and stated as follows:

          &#133; the fact that he left his complaint in abeyance
	  while pursuing other avenues of redress does not,
	  in my view, excuse the employer&#146;s conduct in placing
	  obstacles in the way of his  access to re-employment
	  rights.
                The plaintiff is entitled to aggravated
          damages to compensate him for the loss of his
          potential right to re-employment, as well  as
          the  intangible  harms  that  flow  from  the
          employer&#146;s actions.
She held that an award of $15,000 was appropriate in this case.</pre>
    <pre>[27]  A  &amp;  P  disputes the award on four grounds. First,  it  is
argued  that  the employer&#146;s conduct in sending  the  letter  was
never pleaded as a basis for the claim for aggravated or punitive
damages and that, consequently, the award is beyond the scope  of
the  pleadings as particularized. Second, it is argued  that  the
award is based on findings of fact that have no foundation on the
evidence.  Third, it is argued that the submission  made  by  the
employer   to  the  Workers'  Compensation  Board  is  inherently
privileged and cannot constitute an independent actionable  wrong
and,  fourth, because the submission to the Workers' Compensation
Board relates to the issue of reinstatement of the employee  -  a
matter  within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board, it cannot
found a civil action.
[28] I do not find it necessary to deal with the issues of
privilege and exclusive jurisdiction of the Board because I am
persuaded that the award cannot stand for the reasons advanced by
the appellant on the first two grounds.
[29] Counsel for the appellant contends that his client was never
advised by the respondent, at any time during the course of the
proceedings, that the December 14 letter to the WCB was being
relied upon in support of the claim for aggravated damages and
this despite all efforts being made to obtain full particulars of
the claim. Indeed, he states that his client discovered for the
first time that the letter was in issue upon reading the trial
judge&#146;s reasons for decision. In my view, the material before the
court supports the appellant&#146;s contention.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)   the statement of claim

          Mr. Antonacci&#146;s pleading makes no reference either
          to the December 14, 1994 letter to the WCB or generally
          to any submissions made by A &amp; P to the WCB respecting
          re-employment. To the contrary, the statement of claim
          ascribes an entitlement to punitive and aggravated
          damages to A &amp; P&#146;s conduct on or before the date of
          dismissal on October 14, 1994. The conduct relied upon
          by the trial judge occurred two months outside that
          period.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)   the examination for discovery

          During the October 17, 1996 examination for
          discovery, counsel for Mr. Antonacci advised that the
          claim for aggravated and punitive damages was limited
          to the facts contained in the statement of claim and
          examination for discovery. No reference is made to the
          December 14, 1994 letter or to submissions made to the
          WCB during the examination for discovery. Counsel for
          Mr. Antonacci undertook to organize and specify which
          of the facts delineated in the examination for
          discovery and the statement of claim were still being
          relied upon for the claim for aggravated and punitive
          damages.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)   correspondence between counsel

          In answer to his undertaking, counsel for Mr.
          Antonacci confirmed on October 31, 1997 that &#147;the facts
          relied upon in the claim for aggravated and punitive
          damages are contained in the pleadings and further
          particularized in the evidence of Mr. Antonacci on his
          examination for discovery, and relate to the conduct of
          various supervisors throughout the years leading up to
          and including the decision to dismiss him [on October
          14, 1994].&#148; The December 14, 1994 letter falls outside
          this period and its author was not a supervisor but a
          nurse of A &amp; P&#146;s Occupational Health and Safety
          department.
                 Counsel  for  A  &amp;  P  sought  further
          particulars  of  the  facts  relied  upon  in
          support  of  the  claim  for  aggravated  and
          punitive damages by letter dated November 11,
          1997  but  received no response. He therefore
          decided to bring a motion for particulars.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)   motion for particulars

          Sheard J. granted A &amp; P&#146;s motion and ordered Mr.
          Antonacci to provide particulars as requested. In
          compliance with the order, counsel for Mr. Antonacci
          supplied a list on January 21, 1998 entitled &#147;Facts
          Relied Upon for Claim for Punitive Damages.&#148; No
          particulars were provided with respect to the claim for
          aggravated damages. More importantly, no reference was
          made to the December 14, 1994 letter or to any aspect
          of A &amp; P&#146;s position before the WCB.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (e)   further correspondence

          Counsel for A &amp; P requested further particulars by
          letter dated January 23, 1998 and suggested that these
          claims be abandoned. Counsel for Mr. Antonacci
          responded that the claim for punitive damages was not
          being abandoned and provided further particulars by
          letter dated January 23, 1998. No reference was made to
          any claim for aggravated damages or to the conduct in
          question.  By letter dated January 24, 1998, counsel
          for A &amp; P advised counsel for Mr. Antonacci that he
          would vigorously oppose any attempt to adduce
          undisclosed evidence at trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (f)   the trial

          At the commencement of the trial on January 26,
          1998, counsel for A &amp; P objected to the admissibility
          of evidence in relation to most of the particulars
          provided by counsel for Mr. Antonacci in his list dated
          January 21, 1998. In making his submissions, he
          informed the trial judge of all the steps he had taken
          in an effort to obtain full particulars. No reference
          is made whatsoever to the letter in question, nor to
          any communications between A &amp; P and the WCB in the
          exchange that followed between counsel and the trial
          judge.</pre>
    <pre>[30] A &amp; P submits that because the December 14, 1994 letter  was
not  placed  in issue by the particulars, it did not  adduce  any
evidence at trial as to its position before the WCB following the
letter,  as to any other submissions it may have made in response
to  Mr. Antonacci&#146;s re-employment application, or specifically as
to  whether  the  December  14, 1994 letter  was  ever  modified.
Further, A &amp; P did not inquire into, nor adduce evidence on,  the
question  whether the WCB was at all misled by  the  contents  of
that letter as found by the trial judge.
[31] A &amp; P further submits that there was no evidentiary basis
for the trial judge&#146;s crucial finding that:

    By informing the Board that Mr. Antonacci had been dismissed
    for cause and by never changing that story, the employer misled
    the Board and deprived Mr. Antonacci of the opportunity to avail
    himself of the re-employment rights under the Act.</pre>
    <pre>[32]  It  is A &amp; P&#146;s position that there was no evidence that  it
had never &#147;chang[ed] that story&#148;, that the Board was &#147;misled&#148;  or
that  Mr. Antonacci was deprived of any opportunity as a  result.
Counsel  for A &amp; P also submits that the letter itself  does  not
state that Mr. Antonacci had been dismissed for cause. While  the
reference  in  the  letter to the fact that his  termination  was
&#147;based  on  performance issues&#148; may support this  inference,  the
earlier  statement in the letter that Mr. Antonacci  &#147;received  a
large settlement from the company&#148; is inconsistent with dismissal
for cause.
[33] I agree with the counsel for A &amp; P that the letter was
ambiguous on the question of cause for dismissal. I also agree
that the trial judge&#146;s inference that the WCB was misled as a
result of the letter is difficult to support on the record. In
any event, it is my view, in the circumstances of this case, that
it was not open to the trial judge to make a finding of liability
and award damages for aggravated damages on the basis of this
letter.  The conduct in question fell outside the scope of the
pleadings as particularized.
[34] This court in Int. Nickel Co. v. Travellers Ind. Co, [1962]
1 O.W.N. 109 adopted the following statement in Mexican N. Power
Co. v. Pearson (1913), 25 O.W.R. 422 at 425 on the function of
particulars:

     The function of particulars is to limit the generality of
     pleadings and thus to define the issues which have to be tried
     and as to which discovery must be given. Each party is entitled
     to know the case to be made against him at the trial and to have
     such particulars of his opponent&#146;s case as will prevent him from
     being taken by surprise.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The purposes of particulars are also well summarized in Tse-
Ching  v. Wesbild Holdings Ltd (1994), 98 B.C.L.R. (2d) 92 (S.C.)
at 100:
               1. to inform the other side of the nature
	  of the case they have to meet;
               2. to  prevent  the other side from being
          taken by surprise at trial;
               3. to enable  the other side to determine
          what  evidence  will   be  necessary  and   to
          prepare for trial;
               4. to  limit the generality of pleadings;
               5. to  limit  and decide the issues to be
          tried  and  as  to  which discovery  will  be
          conducted;
               6.  to  tie  the  hands   of  the   party
          providing particulars.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  To  give effect to the finding of the trial judge  and  the
consequent  award  of aggravated damages would defeat  the  whole
purpose  of particulars. Full particulars were repeatedly  sought
by  counsel  for A &amp; P and the claim for aggravated and  punitive
damages   was  vigorously  opposed  throughout.  Mr.  Antonacci&#146;s
failure   to   put   forth  any  allegation   relating   to   the
communications between A &amp; P and the WCB as a basis for his claim
precludes  him  from relying on this conduct in  support  of  the
trial judge&#146;s award of aggravated damages.
[37] I would therefore give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>C.   Punitive Damages</pre>
    <pre>[38]  I  see no merit to Mr. Antonacci&#146;s cross-claim on  punitive
damages.  In my view the trial judge was correct in her  findings
and  in  her  conclusion on this issue. There  is  no  reason  to
interfere with the dismissal of the claim for punitive damages.</pre>
    <pre>D.   Costs</pre>
    <pre>[39]  The appellant&#146;s sole argument on the issue of costs is that
the   amount  of  $28,000  is  excessive  because  it  represents
approximately   90%  of  the total damage award  for  the  notice
period.  In  my  view, this fact, in and of itself,  provides  no
reason  to  interfere  with  the award.  The  appellant  has  not
provided  any  basis  upon  which this  court  could  assess  the
reasonableness  of the award. Consequently, I see  no  basis  for
interfering  with  the trial judge&#146;s exercise  of  discretion  in
fixing the costs at that amount.</pre>
    <pre>E.   Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[40] I would allow the appeal to the extent of deleting the award
for aggravated damages and I would dismiss the cross-appeal.   In
view of the divided success,  I would award the appellant half of
its costs of the appeal and all of its costs of the cross-appeal.
