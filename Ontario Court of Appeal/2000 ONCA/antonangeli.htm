    <pre><strong>MACPHERSON J.A.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Pursuant to s. 678 (2) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-46,  the Crown seeks leave to extend the time within which
notice of appeal may be given.  The application is necessary
because the Crown did not serve the notice of appeal on the
respondent, Vincenzo Antonangeli, within the 30-day period
prescribed by rule 4(1) of the Criminal Appeal Rules.</pre>
    <pre><strong>A.   FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[2]  On August 31, 1999, the respondent was found guilty after a
trial before Libman J. of the Ontario Court of Justice of an
offence under s. 253(1) of the Criminal Code, operating a motor
vehicle with a blood alcohol reading exceeding 80 milligrams of
alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.
[3]  The respondent appealed.  On April 7, 2000, Dyson J.,
sitting as a summary conviction appeal court, allowed the appeal,
quashed the conviction and entered an acquittal.
[4]  The Crown decided to appeal Dyson J.&#146;s decision to this
court.  By the time the Crown took steps to serve the respondent
with the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal and the Notice
of Appeal, the respondent was on a golf trip to the United
States.  He did not return to Brampton until May 8, one day after
the expiry of the 30-day notice period.  The Crown served the
respondent with the relevant documents on May 9.

<strong>B.   ISSUE</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  The sole issue posed by this application is whether the
court, pursuant to s. 678(2) of the Criminal Code, should
exercise its discretion and extend the time within which notice
of application for leave to appeal and notice of appeal may be
given.</pre>
    <pre><strong>C.   ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[6]  In R. v. Watkins (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 405 at 408 (C.A.),
Goudge J.A. referred to &#147;the substantial onus&#148; on the Crown in an
application under s. 678(2).  He also set out clearly the factors
that must be considered on this type of application, at p. 407:
          </pre>
    <pre>          [O]n  a  motion  such  as  this  a number  of
          considerations  are in play in  the  required
          exercise   of  judicial  discretion.    These
          include   whether  there  is  a   bona   fide
          intention   to  appeal  formed   within   the
          required  time, whether reasonable  diligence
          was  exercised  in attempting to  locate  the
          party  for  service, whether undue  prejudice
          would   result  to  the  respondent   by   an
          extension  of  time,  whether  there  is   an
          arguable  appeal,  and overall,  whether  the
          extension  of  time is in  the  interests  of
          justice.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(a)  Timely intention to appeal
</strong>          </pre>
    <pre>[7]  Dyson J. rendered his decision on April 7.  The Crown made
its formal decision to apply for leave to appeal on April 27.
The decision was made within the 30-day period, but it used up 20
of those days.
[8]  I find no fault with the Crown&#146;s decision-making process,
including the time it took to make the decision.  On April 11,
Elaine Penelagan, the Crown Attorney who had argued the summary
conviction appeal, prepared a Checklist for Crown Attorney
requesting a Crown appeal. On April 13, Paul Culver, the Crown
Attorney for the Toronto Region, prepared a memorandum agreeing
with the request.
[9]  A package of documents, including the Penelagan request and
Checklist and the Culver memorandum, was forwarded to the Crown
Law Office &#150; Criminal and received on April 18, 2000.
[10] In accordance with the office practice of the Crown Law
Office &#150; Criminal, the request for appeal was circulated to three
counsel for review.  In light of the time constraints inherent in
the 30-day appeal period, the review commenced without the
benefit of the written reasons of the summary conviction appeal
court.
[11] The request for an appeal in this matter was approved by
Carol Brewer, the Acting Director of the Crown Law Office &#150;
Criminal, on April 27.  On April 28, Crown Attorney Beverley
Brown learned that she had carriage of the appeal.  On the same
day, Ms. Brown took initial steps to set in motion the service of
the appropriate documents on the respondent.
[12] The respondent relied on the decision of the Alberta Court
of Appeal in R. v. Finley, [1995] A.J. No. 829.  In that case,
the court was critical of the decision-making process relating to
criminal appeals in Alberta&#146;s Crown office.  Harradence J.A.
said, at paras. 2 and 3:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Twenty-three    days   of   the   thirty  day
          appeal  period were taken up by the Crown  in
          deciding whether they would proceed with  the
          appeal.   The Crown cannot claim  that  there
          has  been  a  problem with service  during  a
          period of time when it is the source of  that
          problem.  The Crown has submitted a guide  to
          the   procedure  it  uses  when   determining
          whether an appeal should be pursued.   Before
          a  notice of appeal is filed, a case may pass
          through   four  levels  of  decision  makers.
          Those   decision  makers  include  the  Crown
          prosecutor assigned to the case, Chief  Crown
          Prosecutor, Appeals and Criminal  Law  Policy
          Branch  and  finally,  in  some  cases,   the
          Assistant  Deputy Minister.  In  the  instant
          case  the Assistant Deputy Minister  was  not
          part of the procedure and the majority of the
          delay  seems  to  have  occurred  within  the
          Appeals  Criminal  Law  Policy  Branch.   The
          Crown  points  out that part of  this  period
          involved Good Friday and Easter Monday, but I
          do  not  consider  this to be  an  acceptable
          explanation for the delay.
          After  considering the material presented  by
          the  Crown  with  a  view to  explaining  the
          procedure in determining whether to launch an
          appeal, I am left wondering if the reason for
          the  delay  is not due to the four levels  of
          decision  makers  needed to determine  if  an
          appeal should be sought.  However, it is  not
          for  the  Court  to comment on  the  internal
          workings  of  the Department of Justice.   If
          the  Department  wants to have  a  four  step
          procedure   for  obtaining  instructions   to
          appeal  that is their choice, but they cannot
          then use that as a reason for delay.
          </pre>
    <pre>[13] It seems that the Ontario and Alberta decision-making
processes are similar. With respect, I do not share Harradence
J.A.&#146;s negative view of the Crown&#146;s decision-making process.  In
my view, a Crown appeal in a criminal case should be undertaken
only after the most careful consideration.  By definition, the
context for the decision is that a person has been acquitted of a
criminal offence.  For the Crown to seek to overturn such a
disposition is a serious matter indeed.
[14] In my view, the decision-making process in the Ontario Crown
office should be welcomed, not criticized.  A review that
requires positive recommendations for appeal at two levels (the
original counsel and the senior Crown Attorney in the region)
followed by a positive decision at a third level (the Crown Law
Office &#150; Criminal), where the decision-maker has a view not only
of the discrete case but also of the administration of justice on
a province-wide basis, is, in my view, both a fair process and,
importantly, a process that in many cases will benefit the person
who has been acquitted of a criminal offence.
[15] Of course, this type of structured decision-making process
takes time.  In Finley, the final decision was not made for 23
days.  In the present case, it took 20 days.  I do not think the
20-day period is at all unreasonable.  The Crown should be
encouraged not to jump quickly and launch appeals without truly
careful reflection.  A good, careful decision-making process,
like Ontario&#146;s, will require a few days to produce a considered
final decision.  Twenty days, as the actual progress of the file
in this case demonstrates, is a reasonable, not an unreasonable,
period of time.

<strong>(b)  Reasonable diligence in attempting to locate party for
     service</strong></pre>
    <pre>[16] The attempts made by the Crown Attorney with carriage of the
appeal and by the police to serve the respondent with the
appropriate documents within the 30-day period easily comply with
the &#145;reasonable diligence&#146; factor.  This is not a case like R. v.
Rosenthal, [1998] O.J. No. 4424 (C.A.), relied on by the
respondent, where the Crown did not send the documents to the
police until two days before the 30-day period expired, and where
the police did not try to serve the respondent until the last
possible day.
[17] In the present case, the Crown Attorney took steps
commencing April 28 to locate the respondent.  She spoke to the
Crown Attorney who had handled the summary conviction appeal and
received information about the respondent&#146;s vehicle licence
number,  residence and place of business.  She tried to contact
the respondent&#146;s lawyer.  She delivered the documents to the
police and confirmed that they had been received by May 2.  Later
that day, when she learned that the respondent might be out of
the country, she renewed her efforts to contact his counsel.
When she did talk to him, he told her that he did not have
instructions to accept service on behalf of his client.
[18] The police were also diligent in trying to serve the
respondent. Constable Bridgette Brosseau attended at the
respondent&#146;s home and business office on May 2.  At the office,
employees told her that the respondent was in the United States
on a golfing trip and would not return until May 8.  On May 9
Constable John DeSouza personally served the respondent with the
documents.1
[19] In my view, this chronology of the efforts of the Crown and
the police establishes  that they exercised reasonable diligence
in trying to serve the respondent with the relevant documents
within the 30-day period prescribed by the Criminal Appeal Rules.
The reason that the period was missed had nothing to do with
their efforts; rather the reason was the mundane one that the
respondent was away on vacation.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(3)  Prejudice to the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre>[20] Neither the respondent in his affidavit nor his counsel in
his able submissions claims that the respondent is prejudiced by
service two days outside the statutory period.

<strong>(4)  Arguable appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre>[21] The operative word with respect to this factor is
&#145;arguable&#146;.  The appeal must have some merit, some prospect of
success.  The test is no higher than that; it does not, for
example, require the court to evaluate the appeal in terms of
certainty, or even likelihood, of success.
[22] The Crown&#146;s appeal in this case is eminently arguable.  The
main issue raised in the appeal relates to the admissibility of
statements of an accused made at the roadside in the course of an
investigation for drinking and driving, prior to the police
officer providing s. 10 Charter rights to the accused.  This
issue arises in the case of R. v. Huff, [1990] O.J. No. 5153,
which is scheduled to be argued in this court on August 11, 2000.
In my view, the issue is an important and contentious one; it is
also, therefore, an arguable one.

<strong>(5)  Interests of justice</strong></pre>
    <pre>[23] This is, in a sense, an umbrella factor.  I suspect that it
would be utilized as a balancing factor if some of the other
Watkins factors favoured the Crown while others favoured the
respondent.  Since I have found in favour of the Crown on all
four of the specific factors, it follows that it is in the
interests of justice to extend the time within which the Crown
can appeal in this case.

<strong>DISPOSITION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[24] The application for an Order extending the time for filing
the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal and Notice of
Appeal against the summary conviction appeal judgment of Dyson J.
dated April 7, 2000 is granted.  Crown counsel undertook to file
these documents by May 29.  The Order should reflect this date.
</pre>
    <pre>Released: May 30, 2000                    &#147;J.C. MacPherson J.A.&#148;

</pre>
    <pre>_______________________________
1  There is no suggestion that the respondent was trying to evade
service  at  any time from April 28 to May 9.  In his  affidavit,
the  respondent states - and I accept - that he was  out  of  the
country  from  April 28 to May 8 on &#147;a previously scheduled  golf
vacation.&#148;</pre></td>
