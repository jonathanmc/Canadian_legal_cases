    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Festeryga J. dated March 11, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Modern  companies  require excellent senior  management  in
order  to  prosper  in  a competitive marketplace.   Striving  to
attract  and  retain such personnel, companies  will  offer  high
salaries,  attractive  benefits and,  sometimes,  share  purchase
options to underline the connection between management&#146;s and  the
company&#146;s performance.  In return, companies insist on scrupulous
loyalty from their senior management.</pre>
    <pre>[2]   It  is  a rare senior manager who will stay with  a  single
company  for  his  or her entire professional career.  Companies,
recognizing  this,  worry  about a  manager  taking  confidential
information  when  he or she leaves and embarks  upon  employment
with  a  different company.  Companies also worry that the skills
which   raised  the  manager  to  a  senior  position  in   their
organization  (knowledge, experience, energy  and  even  personal
charm)  might  enable the manager to entice some of  its  current
customers and obtain them for the manager&#146;s new company.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   Companies try to guard against the loss of information  and
customers in a number of ways.  One of the most common methods is
through  a  term  in  the employment contract  known  as  a  non-
solicitation clause. This type of provision prohibits a departing
employee  from  soliciting the customers of his or  her  previous
employer.</pre>
    <pre>[4]   A  more drastic weapon in a company&#146;s arsenal is  the  non-
competition  clause  in an employment contract.   It  forbids  an
employee, when he or she leaves the company, from even  taking  a
new  position in the same industry.  Usually these provisions are
limited  in  terms  of geography (kilometers, province,  country,
occasionally continent) and time (months, years).</pre>
    <pre>[5]   The  Canadian employment law jurisprudence is replete  with
cases dealing with the enforceability of non-competition clauses.
Because  such  clauses are, at bottom, restraints on  trade,  the
courts are vigilant in assessing their legality. As expressed  by
Dickson  J.  in  the  leading Canadian  case  dealing  with  non-
competition  clauses,  Elsley v. J.G.  Collins  Insurance  Agency
Ltd., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 916 at 923:
          </pre>
    <pre>          There is an important public interest in
          discouraging  restraints on  trade,  and
          maintaining  free  and open  competition
          unencumbered   by   the    fetters    of
          restrictive covenants.
          </pre>
    <pre>[6]   I  note  the  word  &#145;discouraging&#146; in  this  passage.   The
Canadian  courts have not enunciated an absolute rule prohibiting
non-competition clauses.  That is because, in spite of  centuries
of common law jurisprudence against restraints of trade, the non-
competition  clause is anchored in another profound principle  of
the common law &#150; freedom of contract.  As noted by Dickson J.  in
Elsley  at p. 923, &#147;the courts have been disinclined to  restrict
the  right  to  contract, particularly when that right  has  been
exercised by knowledgeable persons of equal bargaining power.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[7]  This appeal raises both non-solicitation and non-competition
issues.   It  does  so  in  the context of  motions  for  summary
judgment  brought by both sides in the dispute.  Thus the  appeal
raises  both  substantive and procedural issues.  The substantive
issues  raise questions in contract law, employment law  and  the
growing  field relating to fiduciary obligation.  The  procedural
issue centers on the appropriateness, but also the limits,  of  a
motion for summary judgment.

</pre>
    <pre>A.   Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>  (1)  The parties and the key events
  </pre>
    <pre>[8]   The  appellant  (and plaintiff) Ash  Temple  Limited  (&#147;Ash
Temple&#148;)  is  involved  in  the  business  of  supplying   dental
equipment and consumable products to dentists.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  defendant  Healthco (Canada) Limited  (&#147;Healthco&#148;)  is
involved   in  the  same  business  as  Ash  Temple.   They   are
competitors.   Both  carry on business across  Canada  through  a
number of branch offices.</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  defendant Kenneth Croney (&#147;Mr. Croney&#148;) has worked  in
the  dental supply industry since 1965.  From 1967-1974 and 1978-
1983  he  worked for National Refining Co.  He serviced  a  sales
territory  in Ontario and rose to the position of Vice-President.
On July 1, 1983, National Refining Co. sold certain of its assets
to  Ash Temple.  At that time, Mr. Croney became employed by  Ash
Temple.</pre>
    <pre>[11]  In  late 1983, Mr. Croney became Toronto branch manager  of
Ash  Temple.  The Toronto branch was Ash Temple&#146;s largest and  it
was  situated in the same building as the company&#146;s head  office.
Mr.  Croney remained Toronto branch manager until 1990.  He  also
became a Vice-President of Ash Temple.</pre>
    <pre>[12]    On June 23, 1989, Ash Temple and Mr. Croney entered  into
an  agreement  referred  to  as  an  Employee  &#147;A&#148;  Shareholders&#146;
Agreement.   It  provided Mr. Croney with certain share  purchase
options.  On October 31, 1989, he purchased 3263 Class &#147;A&#148; shares
for $52,500.  On June 20, 1990, Mr. Croney received an additional
698 Class &#147;A&#148; shares as a managing shareholders&#146; bonus.</pre>
    <pre>[13] One of the clauses of the shareholders&#146; agreement was a non-
competition clause.  Section 3 of the agreement provided:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The    Shareholder   agrees   with   the
          Corporation  that, in  consideration  of
          his  employment and continued employment
          with  the  Corporation  and  the  mutual
          covenants and benefits set forth in this
          Agreement,  during  the  period  of  the
          employment  of  the Shareholder  by  the
          Corporation  and  for  the   period   of
          eighteen  (18)  months  thereafter,  the
          Shareholder   will  not,   directly   or
          indirectly,  without the  prior  written
          consent   of  the  Corporation,   either
          individually  or  in partnership  or  in
          conjunction   with  any  one   or   more
          individuals, entities, persons, firms or
          corporations,  as  principal,  agent  or
          shareholder,  or  in  any  other  manner
          whatsoever, carry on or be engaged in or
          concerned  or interested in  or  advise,
          manage,  lend money to or guarantee  the
          debts  or  obligations of or permit  his
          name  to be used or employed in carrying
          on  within Canada a business similar  to
          or  competitive with the business of the
          Corporation (as such business shall then
          consist).
          </pre>
    <pre>[14]  In  April 1990, Mr. Croney resigned as a Vice-President  of
Ash  Temple and as Toronto branch manager and agreed to become  a
sales  agent.   In May 1990, he resigned from the employ  of  Ash
Temple effective June 30, 1990.</pre>
    <pre>[15]  Mr.  Croney was very highly regarded in the  dental  supply
business.   He was quickly able to obtain alternative  employment
that  did  not  violate the non-competition clause which  he  had
accepted.   In  September  and  October  1990,  he  worked  as  a
manufacturer&#146;s  representative with Dental-Ez. In November  1990,
he obtained employment with Siemens.</pre>
    <pre>[16]  In addition, on September 20, 1990, Mr. Croney entered into
an  employment contract with Healthco, a major competitor of  Ash
Temple.   The  term  of  Mr.  Croney&#146;s employment  was  to  begin
&#147;January 1, 1992 or such earlier date as the company and you  may
agree.&#148;  If Mr. Croney started to work for Healthco on January 1,
1992,  as  contemplated  by  the agreement,  he  would  not  have
violated  the 18-month non-competition clause he had signed  with
Ash Temple.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  Interestingly, the employment contract between  Mr.  Croney
and Healthco contained a non-competition clause quite similar  to
clause  3 of the Ash Temple-Croney agreement.  Mr. Croney  agreed
that  if  he  left Healthco he would not engage in a  competitive
business  anywhere in Canada for a period of one year.   He  also
agreed  to  a  non-solicitation  clause.  He  would  not  solicit
Healthco&#146;s  customers or its employees for a year  after  leaving
Healthco.</pre>
    <pre>[18] On November 15, 1990, Mr. Croney sold 1450 of his Class  &#147;A&#148;
shares  in  Ash Temple. The company then redeemed his   remaining
2546  Class  &#147;A&#148; shares.  In total, Mr. Croney received  $162,839
for  his  shares.  Since he had purchased 3263 shares for $52,500
just  over a year before, it can be seen that Mr. Croney  made  a
quick   and   healthy  profit  pursuant  to  the   Employee   &#147;A&#148;
Shareholders&#146; Agreement he had signed in June 1989.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  On  May 2, 1991, Mr. Croney appeared at the annual  Ontario
Dental  Association  Convention in  his  new  capacity  as  Vice-
President  and regional manager of Healthco.  This  was  a  clear
violation  of  clause 3 of his agreement with  Ash  Temple  which
prohibited  him from accepting employment anywhere in Canada  for
18 months after leaving Ash Temple.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The litigation
  </pre>
    <pre>[20]  On  May  23, 1991, Ash Temple commenced this  action.   Ash
Temple  alleged  that Mr. Croney had violated the non-competition
clause  of  the  shareholders&#146; agreement by accepting  employment
with Healthco and that he had breached his fiduciary duty to  Ash
Temple  by soliciting Ash Temple&#146;s customers (i.e. dentists)  and
by attempting to lure some of Ash Temple&#146;s employees to positions
at  Healthco.   Healthco was joined as a defendant.   Ash  Temple
wants it to disgorge any profits it may have received through Mr.
Croney&#146;s unlawful acts.</pre>
    <pre>[21]  For some reason, the lawsuit meandered for about six years.
Then  in the autumn of 1997, the defendants brought a motion  for
partial  summary  judgment pursuant to Rule 20 of  the  Rules  of
Civil  Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  They  sought  an  order
that there was no genuine issue for trial with respect to the non-
solicitation  components (both customers and  employees)  of  Ash
Temple&#146;s statement of claim.  The defendants did not seek summary
judgment  with  respect to the non-competition component  of  the
claim.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Ash Temple responded with its own motion for partial summary
judgment.   It sought a declaration that Mr. Croney had  breached
his  fiduciary duty to Ash Temple by soliciting its customers and
employees.  In addition, Ash Temple sought a declaration that Mr.
Croney   had   violated  the  non-competition   clause   in   the
shareholders&#146;  agreement  he  had signed.   Finally,  Ash  Temple
sought  an  order  for a trial of the issue of  damages  for  Mr.
Croney&#146;s  violation of his fiduciary duty and  the  shareholders&#146;
agreement.</pre>
    <pre>[23]  The  duelling motions for summary judgment  were  heard  by
Festeryga J. on October 7 and 10, 1997.  He rendered his decision
on March 11, 1998.  He held:</pre>
    <pre>(1)  The non-competition clause was unenforceable.
(2)  There was a genuine issue for trial as to whether Mr. Croney
     was a fiduciary.
(3)  There  was  a  genuine issue for trial with respect  to  the
     solicitation of a single dentist.
(4)  There  was  no genuine issue for trial with respect  to  the
     solicitation of 20 other dentists.
(5)  There  was  a  genuine issue for trial with respect  to  the
     solicitation of seven employees.
(6)  There  was  no genuine issue for trial with respect  to  the
     solicitation of two other employees.
(7)  The action should proceed to trial on the issue of damages.
(8)  The  defendants should have their costs of their motion  and
     the action to date on a party and party basis.  Each side should
     bear its own costs of the plaintiff&#146;s motion.</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The plaintiff, Ash Temple, appeals from the motions judge&#146;s
conclusions in (1) concerning the non-enforceability of the  non-
competition clause, in (4) with respect to six dentists,  and  in
(8)  on  the  issue  of  costs. Neither  the  plaintiff  nor  the
defendants  appeal  any of the other components  of  the  motions
judge&#146;s decision.</pre>
    <pre>B.   Issues</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The issues on this appeal are:</pre>
    <pre>(1)  Did the motions judge err in declaring that the non-
     competition clause in the shareholders&#146; agreement was
     unenforceable?
(2)  Did  the  motions judge err in deciding that  there  was  no
     genuine issue for trial with respect to the solicitation of three
     different groups of Ash Temple&#146;s dentist customers:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)  Drs. Maggisano, M. Papini and E. Papini (Allied Health),
(b)  Dr. McCutcheon (Meadowvale Dental), and
(c)  Drs. Watt and McGrath (King Dental)?
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>(3)  Did the motions judge err in his disposition of costs of the
     motions and of the action to date?</pre>
    <pre>C.   Analysis</pre>
    <pre>  (1)  The non-competition clause issue
</pre>
    <pre>[26]   It  will  be  recalled that clause 3 of the  shareholders&#146;
agreement signed by Mr. Croney forbade him from taking a position
with  a competing company anywhere in Canada for a period  of  18
months following the cessation of his employment with Ash Temple.
Mr.  Croney  left  Ash  Temple on June 30,  1990.   He  commenced
employment with Healthco, a competitor, in Ontario no later  than
May  2,  1991.  This was a clear and open violation of  the  non-
competition clause.</pre>
    <pre>[27]   The  motions judge held that the non-competition  covenant
was  invalid.   The essence of his reasons is contained  in  this
passage:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The   principles  to   be   applied   in
          considering  restrictive  covenants   of
          employment    are   well    established,
          discussed and reviewed in Elsley v. J.G.
          Collins  Insurance Agencies Ltd. (1978),
          83  D.L.R. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  I have come
          to the conclusion that the clause is not
          enforceable  since it is not  reasonable
          and that it is against public interest.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  am satisfied that the covenant is too
          broad  in that it prevented Croney  from
          competing anywhere in Canada.  The facts
          are  quite clear that his entire working
          career  was  restricted to  Ontario  and
          mostly  in  Toronto.  To prevent  Croney
          from competing outside of Ontario is  an
          unreasonable restraint of trade.   I  am
          also  of  the view that the covenant  is
          unenforceable    as    being     against
          competition generally and not limited to
          proscribing solicitation of  clients  of
          the former employer, Ash.</pre>
    <pre>[28]   The  leading  Canadian case dealing  with  non-competition
clauses  is,  as  the motions judge recognized,  Elsley  v.  J.G.
Collins  Insurance Agency Limited, supra.  In that case,  Dickson
J.  identified the competing factors that come into play  in  the
interpretation of such clauses.  In favour of the clauses is  the
principle  of  freedom of contract; opposing the clauses  is  the
public interest in discouraging restraints on trade.</pre>
    <pre>[29]  How is the balance between these factors to be struck in  a
particular  case?   Dickson J. addressed this  question  in  this
fashion, at pp. 923, 924 and 926:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In assessing the opposing interests the
          word one finds repeated throughout  the
          cases  is  the word &#147;reasonable&#148;.   The
          test  of reasonableness can be applied,
          however,    only   in   the    peculiar
          circumstances of the particular case.
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>          The validity, or otherwise, of a
          restrictive covenant can be determined
          only upon an overall assessment, of the
          clause, the agreement within which it
          is found, and all of the surrounding
          circumstances.
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>          Whether a restriction is reasonably
          required for the protection of the
          covenantee can only be decided by
          considering the nature of the
          covenantee&#146;s business and the nature
          and character of the employment.
</pre>
    <pre>[30]   In  the present case, it is important to recall  that  Ash
Temple  seeks  a declaration that its non-competition  clause  is
enforceable in the context of a motion for summary judgment.  Did
Ash  Temple place before the motions judge sufficient information
about  the  nature  of  its business and  the  character  of  Mr.
Croney&#146;s  employment to justify the declaration it  sought  on  a
summary judgment basis?</pre>
    <pre>[31]   In my view, the answer to this question must be &#145;No&#146;.   In
support  of  its  motion for summary judgment, Ash  Temple  filed
three  affidavits from company personnel &#150; John Adamski, a  sales
representative   who   was  appointed  Toronto   branch   manager
approximately  four  months  after Mr.  Croney&#146;s  departure,  and
Edward  Adamski  and  Tom Platt, two sales representatives.   All
three  of  the  affidavits of the Ash Temple representatives  are
directed  to the alleged solicitation activities (of both  former
employees and former customers) of Mr. Croney after he  left  Ash
Temple.   In none of the affidavits is there more than a fleeting
reference to the nature of Ash Temple&#146;s business or the character
of  Mr.  Croney&#146;s employment that would be relevant to  the  non-
competition clause.  For example, there is not a word  about  Ash
Temple&#146;s  Canada-wide dental supply business which might underpin
the  geographic  scope (&#147;within  Canada&#148;) of the  non-competition
clause.</pre>
    <pre>[32]   Ash  Temple  admits  in  its factum  that  non-competition
clauses  will  be upheld &#147;in exceptional cases.&#148;   Yet  the  main
argument  it  advances about the geographic  scope  of  its  non-
competition  clause in this case is one based on analogy  &#150;  when
Mr.  Croney signed on with Healthco he again accepted  a  Canada-
wide  non-competition  clause.   Ash  Temple  submits  that  this
establishes the reasonableness of its non-competition clause.</pre>
    <pre>[33]   I  disagree.   I do not question that  Mr.  Croney&#146;s  non-
competition  clause  with  Healthco  is  a  relevant  factor   in
assessing  the  reasonableness  of  Ash  Temple&#146;s  clause.    The
Healthco  clause  speaks, potentially, to industry  practice  and
even to Mr. Croney&#146;s understanding of what is appropriate in  the
industry.   However, the argument by analogy is  not  conclusive.
It  is necessary to consider the factors set out by Dickson J. in
Elsley,  supra, namely the nature of the employer&#146;s business  and
the  character of the employee&#146;s position.  In the record  before
the motions judge, there was very little that would have assisted
him  in making his inquiry into these factors.  Accordingly,  the
motions  judge was correct to refuse a declaration that the  non-
competition clause was enforceable.</pre>
    <pre>[34]   However, the motions judge went farther.  He declared that
the non-competition clause was unenforceable.  He was of the view
that   the  clause  was  an  unlawful  restraint  of  competition
generally, and that the Canada-wide scope of the restraint on Mr.
Croney&#146;s future employment in the industry was too broad in light
of the fact that Mr. Croney had never worked outside Ontario.</pre>
    <pre>[35]   It  is  important  to note the context  within  which  the
motions judge made this declaration.  Ash Temple brought a motion
for   summary  judgment  on  the  non-competition   issue.    The
defendants  responded to this motion.  In addition, they  brought
their  own motion for summary judgment, but only on the fiduciary
obligation  (non-solicitation of employees and customers)  issue.
They  did  not bring a motion for summary judgment  on  the  non-
competition  clause issue.  Accordingly, if Ash  Temple  had  not
brought its motion for summary judgment with respect to the  non-
competition clause, this issue would have proceeded to trial.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  In light of this context, was the motions judge correct  to
declare that the non-competition clause was unenforceable?   With
respect, I think that he was not correct.</pre>
    <pre>[37]  The normal result when a judge does not grant a plaintiff&#146;s
motion  for summary judgment is that the motion is dismissed  and
the  matter proceeds to trial.  In some cases, it is possible for
a  judge to determine the entire action against the plaintiff who
loses  on  its  motion for summary judgment.  Such  a  result  is
possible &#150; I would think on a very occasional basis &#150; because  of
rule 20.04(4) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, which provides  in
part:
          </pre>
    <pre>           20.04(4)   Where the court is satisfied
           that  the  only  genuine  issue  is   a
           question   of   law,  the   court   may
           determine   the  question   and   grant
           judgment accordingly &#133; .
           </pre>
    <pre>           
[38] The present case is not one in which the motions judge could
decide  the  entire issue against the plaintiff  which  lost  its
motion  for  summary  judgment. Since the defendants  brought  no
motion  for  summary judgment on the non-competition clause,  the
motions judge erred in not referring the issue for trial.   Based
on  Elsley,  there were at least two elements of the Ash  Temple-
Croney relationship that required the issue of the enforceability
of the non-competition clause to proceed to trial.</pre>
    <pre>[39]     First,   in  Elsley  Dickson  J.  discussed   employment
situations  in  which there is a special relationship  between  a
senior employee and the customers of the company.  He said, at p.
926:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In the present case, when the clause was
          drafted it was known that Elsley had, or
          would  acquire, a special  and  intimate
          knowledge  of  the  customers   of   his
          prospective  employer and the  means  of
          influence over them.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[40]   The same can, potentially, be said about Mr. Croney.   The
record  before  the motions judge is replete with testimony  from
many  dentists  about their relationship with  Mr.  Croney.   Mr.
Croney  helped set up the practices of some dentists, he provided
excellent service for long years to many of the dentists, and  he
became  personal friends with several of them.  In her affidavit,
Dr. Peggy Watt spoke of &#147;a sense of loyalty to Ash Temple because
of  the help we received from Croney&#148;.  That statement is typical
of  the views expressed by a large number of dentists who came to
know, trust and rely on Mr. Croney and Ash Temple.</pre>
    <pre>[41]   The consequence of statements like Dr. Watt&#146;s is that  Mr.
Croney  may have had, in Dickson J.&#146;s words in Elsley, &#147;a special
and  intimate knowledge&#148; of Ash Temple&#146;s customers and &#147; a  means
of  influence  over  them.&#148;   If he  did,  this  would  have  the
potential  to  be an important factor telling in  favour  of  the
enforceability   of  the  non-competition  clause.    There   is,
therefore, a genuine issue for trial on this point.</pre>
    <pre>[42]   Second,  the  issue of the geographic scope  of  the  non-
competition clause also presents a genuine issue for  trial.  The
motions  judge did mention this issue.  He said that Mr. Croney&#146;s
&#147;entire  working career was restricted to Ontario and  mostly  in
Toronto.&#148;   In  my view, that was not sufficient to  justify  the
conclusion   that   Ash  Temple&#146;s  non-competition   clause   was
unenforceable  in  the face of the competing inference  available
from Mr. Croney&#146;s non-competition clause with Healthco.</pre>
    <pre>[43]   An  instructive case on this point is Cameron v.  Canadian
Factors Corp. Ltd., [1971] S.C.R. 148.  In that case, the Supreme
Court  of  Canada  declared  that a  Canada-wide  non-competition
clause  for  a  comptroller employed by a factoring  company  was
unenforceable.  In reaching his conclusion, Laskin  J.  said,  at
pp. 163 and 164:

          The  evidence  in  this  case  does  not
          support   a   finding   of   protectible
          business  operations of  the  respondent
          beyond the Province of Quebec.
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
          </pre>
    <pre>          Paragraph    3   presents   even    less
          difficulty for the conclusion that it is
          offensive  to  the principle  of  public
          order.   I am satisfied to deal with  it
          as  exceeding, in its Canada-wide ambit,
          any   reasonable  requirement   of   the
          respondent  for  the protection  of  its
          business interests which, on the record,
          are  centred in the Province of  Quebec.
          [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[44]   In  the present case, there is simply not enough  evidence
&#147;on  the  record&#148; to support the motions judge&#146;s conclusion  that
the  non-competition clause is unenforceable.  In their Statement
of  Defence,  the  defendants admit  that  both  Ash  Temple  and
Healthco  carry on business across Canada.  Moreover, Mr.  Croney
signed  a  Canada-wide  non-competition  clause  when  he  joined
Healthco  which  is,  at a minimum, some evidence  in  favour  of
industry  practice.   In the face of these factors,  the  motions
judge  went  too  far  when he declared that the  non-competition
clause was unenforceable.  Just as the record before him did  not
support  a  declaration pursuant to Rule 20 that the  clause  was
enforceable,  so  too  the record did not  support  the  opposite
conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>[45]  In conclusion, the issue of the enforceability of the  non-
competition  clause  requires a trial.   The  motions  judge  was
correct  to  dismiss Ash Temple&#146;s motion for summary judgment  on
this issue.  However, he should have made the order that normally
flows from such a decision, namely that there was a genuine issue
for  trial.  He erred when he took the second step and  declared,
without  a sufficient supporting record, that the non-competition
clause was entirely unenforceable.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The solicitation issue
</pre>
    <pre>[46]  On  this issue there are what I would call duelling motions
for summary judgment.  The plaintiff brought a motion for summary
judgment seeking declarations that the defendants breached  their
fiduciary  duties  by  soliciting  Ash  Temple&#146;s  customers   and
employees.  The defendants brought a motion for summary  judgment
seeking the opposite, namely declarations that they engaged in no
such conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[47]  Both  sides  prepared many affidavits in support  of  their
motions.  There were extensive cross-examinations on most of  the
affidavits. The duelling motions were heard together by Festeryga
J. who decided:</pre>
    <pre>(1)  There  was  a  genuine issue for trial with respect  to  the
     solicitation of a single customer (dentist).
(2)  There  was  no genuine issue for trial with respect  to  the
     solicitation of 20 other dentists.
(3)  There was a genuine issue for trial concerning the
     solicitation of seven of Ash Temple&#146;s employees.
(4)  There was no genuine issue for trial concerning the
     solicitation of two other employees.
</pre>
    <pre>[48]  The  defendants do not appeal (1) and (3).   The  plaintiff
does  not  appeal (4).  Nor does the plaintiff appeal (2)  as  it
relates  to 14 of the 20 dentists. All that is in issue  on  this
appeal is Ash Temple&#146;s appeal relating to six of the dentists  in
category  (2).  Ash Temple contends that the motions judge  erred
in  deciding  that  there was no genuine  issue  for  trial  with
respect to these six dentists.</pre>
    <pre>[49]  The  six dentists should be considered in three  groupings:
(a)  Drs. Maggisano, M. Papini and E. Papini (Allied Heath);  (b)
Dr. McCutcheon (Meadowvale Dental); and (c) Drs. Watt and McGrath
(King   Dental).    However,  before  turning   to   a   specific
consideration  of these groups of dentists, I want  to  make  two
observations, one about general principles, the other  about  the
record before the motions judge on this issue.</pre>
    <pre>[50]  First,  with reference to general principles,  the  leading
Canadian  case dealing with the fiduciary obligations  of  senior
employees  is  Canadian  Aero Service Ltd.  v.  O&#146;Malley,  [1974]
S.C.R.  592.   In  that  case, Laskin J. spoke  of  the  &#147;general
standards  of loyalty, good faith and avoidance of a conflict  of
duty and self-interest to which the conduct of a &#133; senior officer
must conform&#148; (at p. 620).  He referred to &#147;the pervasiveness  of
a  strict ethic in this area of the law&#148; (at p. 607), and  stated
that  in certain circumstances the fiduciary duties of the senior
officer stayed with him &#147;even after his resignation&#148; (at p. 607).</pre>
    <pre>[51]  Second,  the  record  before  the  motions  judge  was   an
interesting, perhaps unusual, one.  In support of its motion  for
summary   judgment,  the  defendants  placed  before  the   court
affidavits  from  nine dentists saying that Mr.  Croney  had  not
solicited their business after he left Ash Temple.  In support of
its   motion  for  summary  judgment,  Ash  Temple  provided   no
affidavits  in which any of the 21 dentists it alleged  were  the
subject of improper solicitation by the defendants stated that to
be the case. In light of this dichotomy in the direct evidence on
the  solicitation  issue, it is not surprising that  the  motions
judge   granted   the  defendants&#146;  motion  (and  dismissed   the
plaintiff&#146;s  motion) with respect to 20 of the 21 dentists.   Nor
is  it  surprising, perhaps, that Ash Temple has decided  not  to
appeal the judge&#146;s decision with respect to 14 of the 20 judges.</pre>
    <pre>[52]  Against the backdrop of these two observations, I  turn  to
the three groups of dentists in issue on this appeal.

</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  Allied Health</pre>
    <pre>          
[53]  Mr. Croney left his employment with Ash Temple on June  30,
1990.  In May 1990, he had sold dental equipment on behalf of Ash
Temple  to  a  number  of  dentists at the  1990  Ontario  Dental
Association  Conference.  With the agreement of Ash  Temple,  Mr.
Croney  supervised the installation of the equipment and received
commissions on the sales.  This responsibility, and corresponding
benefit, continued until November 1990.</pre>
    <pre>[54]  In spite of this continuing relationship between Ash Temple
and  Mr.  Croney,  it is clear from the record  that  Mr.  Croney
engaged  in  conduct that encouraged the Allied Health  group  of
dentists to change their business from Ash Temple to Healthco.</pre>
    <pre>[55]  In  his affidavit in support of the defendants&#146; motion  for
summary judgment, Dr. Gerry Maggisano said:

  11.   In or about the early fall, 1990, I contacted Croney 
	to determine his status and whether or not he would 
	be working for another dental supplier or distributor.
	Croney advised me that there was little he could do 
	for me in the circumstances having regard to an 
	agreement he had with Ash Temple.  I insisted that
        Croney provide me with a recommendation as to where 
	I ought to direct the business of our practices.  
	He suggested that I call Dave Deeley at Healthco.
          </pre>
    <pre>  In  his  examination  for  discovery,  Mr.  Croney  essentially
confirmed Dr. Maggisano&#146;s account.</pre>
    <pre>[56] It needs to be recalled that Mr. Croney signed an employment
contract  with  Healthco on September 20,  1990,  albeit  with  a
prospective  commencement date of January 1,  1992.   It  appears
that, with respect to the Allied Health dentists, Mr. Croney  may
have  jumped  the  gun and solicited them for Healthco,  even  if
indirectly in response to questions from the dentists,  while  he
still had a relationship (until November) with Ash Temple.</pre>
    <pre>[57]  The  motions  judge did not provide  separate  reasons  for
including  the  Allied  Health dentists in  the  category  of  20
dentists  for which he concluded there was no genuine  issue  for
trial.  In my view, on the record before him, and in light of the
&#145;strict  ethic&#146;  in this area, a trial is required  to  determine
whether,  when  Dr. Maggisano contacted Mr. Croney and  expressed
dissatisfaction with Ash Temple&#146;s service, Mr. Croney had a  duty
to  bring  this to Ash Temple&#146;s attention and even to  assist  in
trying  to  remedy the problem rather than simply recommend  that
Dr.  Maggisano contact Healthco, Mr. Croney&#146;s imminent  employer.
The  factual  determination of the nature of the contact  between
Dr.  Maggisano  and  Mr. Croney and the nature  of  the  latter&#146;s
ongoing  relationship with Ash Temple would be  crucial  to  this
issue.   Accordingly,  there is a genuine issue  for  trial  with
respect to the solicitation of the Allied Health dentists.
          </pre>
    <pre>(b)  Meadowvale Dental
</pre>
    <pre>[58]  Although  both  parties  in  their  facta  seem  to  equate
Meadowvale  Dental  with  only  a  single  dentist,  Dr.   Elaine
McCutcheon,  in  fact  it was a partnership  consisting  of  four
dentists  &#150;  Dr.  McCutcheon and the three dentists  from  Allied
Health,  Drs. Maggisano, M. Papini and E. Papini.  Dr. McCutcheon
was  the partner responsible for the administration and operation
of the practice.</pre>
    <pre>[59]  In  1990,  Dr.  McCutcheon  decided  to  switch  Meadowvale
Dental&#146;s  business from Ash Temple to Pro-Mart.  She also  signed
an   agreement  with  Healthco  to  service  Meadowvale  Dental&#146;s
equipment and she purchased some supplies from Healthco  if  they
were  unavailable from Pro-Mart.  In her affidavit Dr. McCutcheon
said:
</pre>
    <pre>  11.   My decision to minimize and/or cease purchasing from 
	Ash Temple &#133; had nothing whatsoever to do with Croney 
	leaving the employ of Ash Temple or due to any efforts 
	he made to solicit my business.
          </pre>
    <pre>Dr. McCutcheon also stated in her affidavit:
             </pre>
    <pre>  9.    &#133; Upon returning from the Canadian Dental Association
        convention, I discussed the matter with Dr. Maggisano.
	Dr. Maggisano advised me that he had no preference as 
	to the supplier from which I bought sundries or dental 
	products for the Meadowvale Dental practice.
          </pre>
    <pre>[60]  This  is  strong  evidence in support  of  the  defendants&#146;
position.   However,  in  his affidavit  Dr.  Massimo  Papini,  a
partner of both Dr. McCutcheon and Dr. Maggisano, stated:

  3.    My brother Egidio and I always had our own practice
	and were also part of the Allied Health Group with 
	Dr. Gerry Maggisano and partners in Meadowvale Dental.
	Dr. Maggisano handled the purchasing of sundries, 
	dental products and equipment for the group, which 
	included Meadowvale Dental in which Dr. Elaine 
	McCutcheon was also a partner. Dr. McCutcheon was
        responsible for the administration and operation of 
	Meadowvale Dental.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
Moreover, in the cross-examination on his affidavit, Dr.
Maggisano stated: &#147;Generally, Dr. McCutcheon would do what we
decided the Papinis and I.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[61]  The  motions  judge  did  not  give  separate  reasons  for
including  the Meadowvale Dental dentists in the category  of  20
dentists  for which he concluded there was no genuine  issue  for
trial.  In my view, in spite of the strong and direct evidence of
Dr.   McCutcheon  on  the  solicitation  issue,  there  is   some
conflicting evidence in the record which requires that  the issue
concerning this group of dentists proceed to trial.</pre>
    <pre>(c)    King Dental</pre>
    <pre>[62] In her affidavit, Dr. Peggy Watt of King Dental stated:</pre>
    <pre>  9.    At no time prior to leaving the employ of Ash
	Temple did Croney contact me or Dr. Paul McGrath
	to solicit our business for Healthco.  Croney 
	did not contact either me or Dr. McGrath
        between June, 1990 and the spring of 1997 to 
	solicit our business for Healthco.</pre>
    <pre>[63]  There is nothing in the record before the motions judge  to
contradict  this  statement.   Accordingly,  he  was  correct  to
include  the King Dental dentists in the category of 20  dentists
for which he concluded there was no genuine issue for trial.</pre>
    <pre>(3)  Costs of the summary judgment motions
  </pre>
    <pre>[64]  The  motions judge awarded the defendants  their  costs  of
their  summary judgment motion and the action to date on a  party
and  party  basis because &#147;[m]ost of the defendants&#146;  motion  was
successful   whereas   the  plaintiff   was   successful   on   a
significantly lesser scale&#148;.  He made no order as to costs of the
plaintiff&#146;s motion for summary judgment.</pre>
    <pre>[65]  Although  success on the motions for summary  judgment  was
divided,  I  would be disinclined to interfere with  the  motions
judge&#146;s  disposition of costs if this appeal had been  dismissed.
I  say that because I think the motions judge&#146;s comparison of the
success of the parties on the two motions was an accurate one.</pre>
    <pre>[66]   However,  the  plaintiff-appellant  has  achieved  partial
success on this appeal.  The lay of the land at this stage of the
action  is this: the non-competition issue must proceed to trial;
so  too  must  the solicitation issue with respect  to  5  of  21
dentists  and  7  of 9 employees.  It follows  that  the  motions
judge&#146;s costs order, which was almost entirely in the defendants&#146;
favour, cannot stand.  In these circumstances, the parties should
bear their own costs of the motions for summary judgment.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[67] The appeal is allowed in part.  There is a genuine issue for
trial  with  respect to the enforceability of the non-competition
clause.  There is also a genuine issue for trial on the fiduciary
obligation/solicitation issue with respect to the  Allied  Health
and Meadowvale groups of dentists.  There is no genuine issue for
trial  with  respect to the King Dental group of  dentists.   The
costs  order of the motions judge is varied to provide  that  all
parties  should bear their own costs of the motions  for  summary
judgment.</pre>
    <pre>[68]  Success  on  the appeal is divided.  On the non-competition
issue,  the  appellant  did not obtain the  principal  relief  it
sought,  namely a declaration that the restrictive  covenant  was
enforceable.  However, contrary to the conclusion of the  motions
judge,  the non-competition issue must proceed to trial.  On  the
fiduciary   obligation/solicitation  issue,  the  appellant   was
successful   with   respect  to  two  groups  of   dentists   and
unsuccessful with respect to one group.  In my view, there  is  a
sufficiently close division of success to justify an  order  that
all parties bear their own costs of the appeal.
