    <pre>On appeal from the order of the Kozak J. dated May 26, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals pursuant to s.193 of the Bankruptcy
and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, from the order of Kozak
J. setting aside the trustee&#146;s disallowance of the appellant&#146;s
claim that it was a secured creditor because it held a valid
Purchase Money Security Interest (&#147;PMSI&#148;).
[2]  The bankrupt is a company that operated a convenience store
in Thunder Bay that sold and rented videotapes provided by a
subsidiary of the respondent Astral Communications.  The
relationship between the parties commenced on October 22, 1992
with a document referred to as a Credit and Dealership
Application.  That document was not signed by the bankrupt
company and indeed there was no place on the application for a
signature.  On the second page of the agreement, there is a
guarantee signed by a principal of the company in his personal
capacity.  Astral registered the document more than five and one-
half years later, on May 5, 1998.  The bankruptcy took place on
March 30, 1999.
[3]  After the bankruptcy, Astral submitted a claim as a secured
creditor.  The trustee issued a disallowance of the secured claim
on the basis that the security agreement had not been signed by
the debtor.  To have a security interest effective against the
trustee, Astral was required to have a perfected security
interest (s.20(1)(b)).  A perfected security interest must both
be registered and attached to the property.  Attachment occurs
when the debtor signs the security agreement.  Subsections 11(1)
and (2) of the Personal Property Security Act, R.S.O. 1990
(&#147;PPSA&#148;) read:

          11.&#150;(1) A security interest is not enforceable against a
          third party unless it has attached.

              (2) A security interest, including a
          security interest in the nature of a floating
          charge, attaches when,

                  (a) the secured party or a person on
             behalf of the secured party other than the
             debtor or the debtor&#146;s agent obtains
             possession of the collateral or when the
             debtor signs a security agreement that
             contains a description of the collateral
             sufficient to enable it to be identified;

                (b) value is given; and

                (c) the debtor has rights in the collateral,

          unless the parties have agreed to postpone the
	  time for attachment, in which case the security
	  interest attaches at the agreed time.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Inasmuch as the credit application was not signed by the
respondent, the trustee held that no attachment had taken place
and, hence, the respondent was not a secured creditor.  On the
appeal from the trustee&#146;s decision, Kozak J. held that the
trustee had erred.  He held that the omission of the signature
was cured by s.9(2) of the PPSA.  That section provides:

     (2) A security agreement is not unenforceable against a
    third party by reason only of a defect, irregularity, omission or
    error therein or in the execution thereof unless the third party
    is actually misled by the defect, irregularity, omission or
    error.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  We are of the opinion that Kozak J. erred.
[6]  The general curative provision of s.9(2) cannot override the
specific provisions of s.11 regarding the conditions necessary
for a security interest to attach.
[7]  The words, &#147;defect, irregularity, omission or error&#148; are all
referable to the agreement itself or to the execution of the
agreement.  The term &#147;execution&#148; implies some form of signature
for the curative provisions to apply.  Where there is a complete
absence of execution, the curative provisions would not apply.
Such an interpretation is consistent with the requirement
contained in s.11 (2) that the debtor must sign the security
agreement for attachment to occur.  To interpret s.9(2) so as to
cure the complete absence of a signature would completely
undermine the requirement of a signature in s.11.  An
interpretation of legislation that is consistent and compatible
with other sections of the same legislation is to be preferred to
one that is not.  This interpretation is also consistent with the
decision of this court in State Bank of India (Canada) v.
Trutzschler GmbH &amp; Co. KG. (1997), 44 C.B.R. (3d) 299 which
implicitly rejected s.9(2) as a tool to save a security agreement
which had no debtor signature even where the debtor signed a
related document to the underlying transaction.
[8]  We would therefore allow the appeal from the decision of
Kozak J., set aside his order dated May 26, 1999 and declare that
the respondent&#146;s security interest in the inventory of the
bankrupt is not effective against the appellant.</pre>
