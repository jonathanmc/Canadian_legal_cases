    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  applicant  applies for bail pending  his  appeal  from
conviction for second degree murder.  The applicant was convicted
on  March  31,  1992  and sentenced to life imprisonment  without
parole for seventeen years on May 1, 1992.  The deceased was  the
applicant&#146;s girl friend and the Crown alleged that the  applicant
killed  her  when he learned that she wished to break  off  their
relationship.   The  case  against  the  applicant   was   wholly
circumstantial.  While the deceased&#146;s car, containing  traces  of
her  blood,  was  found  a few days after  she  disappeared,  the
deceased&#146;s body has never been found.
[2]  On October 8, 1992, the applicant&#146;s trial counsel applied
for bail pending appeal on the applicant&#146;s behalf.  Goodman J.A.
dismissed that application on October 14, 1992. On January 25,
1993, Dubin C.J.O. dismissed an application for a review of that
decision.  That application was brought pursuant to s. 680 of the
Criminal Code.  The applicant now brings a fresh application for
release pending appeal in accordance with the doctrine set out in
R. v. Daniels (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 413 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>THE DANIELS THRESHOLD</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In Daniels, this court held at p. 427 that a second original
application for release pending appeal may be brought pursuant to
s.  679  of  the Criminal Code where there has been  a  &#147;material
change  in  circumstances after the initial application&#148;.   There
was some dispute between the parties as to the test to be applied
in  bringing a Daniels application and, specifically, whether  it
was sufficient that there be a change in circumstances or whether
there  must be a material change in circumstances.  In  my  view,
the  judge&#146;s  jurisdiction  to deal  with  a  second  application
depends upon there being a material change in circumstances.
[4]  There was also some difference of opinion as to the
consequences of a finding of a material change in circumstances
and, in particular, the degree of deference that must be paid to
the first decision if this threshold is met.  Since this is a
fresh application, not a review of the previous decision, it
seems to me that the parties must accept that the first decision
was correct.  Of course, that decision would have been based on
different material.  I intend to only briefly set out my reasons
for those conclusions.
[5]  The scheme of Part XXI of the Criminal Code is that
ordinarily there will be one opportunity to apply for release
pending appeal.  The scheme is very different from that set out
in Part XVI, which governs release pending trial, where an
elaborate process has been established permitting multiple
applications and opportunities for review at all stages up to
conviction and sentence.  Under Part XXI, there is a narrow right
of review that depends upon the applicant first obtaining a
direction from the chief justice or the acting chief justice.
Such applications are relatively rare and are rarely granted.
[6]  While Daniels recognized that subsequent applications may be
brought, I think it unlikely that this court intended that an
applicant could bring a fresh application every time there was a
change in circumstances.  This would virtually subvert the scheme
set out in Part XXI.  In my view, a judge hearing a subsequent
&#147;original&#148; application only has jurisdiction to deal with the
application on the merits if he or she is satisfied that there
has been a material change in circumstances.  A material change
in circumstances, for this purpose, would require additional
information that could lead the judge hearing the application to
alter the assessment of one or more of the statutory factors set
out in s. 679(3), namely, (a) whether the appeal is frivolous;
(b) whether the applicant will surrender into custody in
accordance with the terms of the release order; and (c) whether
the applicant&#146;s detention is necessary in the public interest.
If there is a material change in circumstances, the judge must
then consider all of the statutory grounds and must be satisfied
that the applicant has met the onus in s. 679(3).
[7]  Since a Daniels application is not a review, the parties
must accept the correctness of the decision of the first judge.
In my view, this means that the parties and the judge hearing the
subsequent application accept that on the basis of the material
that was before the first judge, the decision was correct.
Nevertheless, assuming the material change in circumstances
threshold has been met, the judge&#146;s reasons on the initial
application will be of assistance in determining whether the case
is a proper one for release.  For example, if the judge in
refusing release expressed concern only about one particular
factor, and that concern has been addressed on the subsequent
application, this will be of assistance in deciding that the
applicant has met the test in s. 679(3).
[8]  For reasons that follow, I am satisfied that there has been
a material change in circumstances and that I therefore have
jurisdiction to consider this second fresh application.</pre>
    <pre>THE HEARING BEFORE GOODMAN J.A.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The parties have filed the material that was before Goodman
J.A.   This  material  included  the  charge  to  the  jury,  the
objections  and  the  additional charge, an  affidavit  from  the
applicant, an affidavit from his mother, an affidavit from  trial
counsel  setting  out  some of the facts  of  the  case  and  the
proposed  grounds of appeal, and an affidavit  from  one  of  the
trial Crown attorneys.
[10] The grounds of appeal as they are set out in the affidavit
of the applicant&#146;s trial counsel are not compelling.  Goodman
J.A. said that the grounds of appeal, &#147;although clearly arguable,
cannot be said to be so forceful as to exhibit a strong
probability of the success of the appeal&#148;.  For example, in the
affidavit, counsel relied upon grounds of appeal based upon the
theory that the victim might still be alive, that there was no
evidence of foul play and that the Crown had failed to prove that
the murder had taken place at the time and place specified in the
indictment.  In light of the substantial evidence that the victim
had been murdered, that alone would have affected the strength of
the proposed appeal.  Based on the material placed before me,
which I will expand upon below, the grounds of appeal now appear
much more substantial.  Indeed, Crown counsel characterized the
grounds of appeal as &#147;highly arguable&#148;.
[11] Goodman J.A. was also not satisfied that the applicant had
shown that he would surrender into custody in accordance with the
terms of a release order.  After noting that this court had
previously ordered the applicant&#146;s release pending the trial,1
Goodman J.A. pointed out that his situation was greatly different
after conviction.  The prosecution&#146;s case was sufficiently strong
that  he was convicted of  murder and  he had been sentenced
to  life  imprisonment without parole for seventeen  years.
That  prospect,  as Goodman J.A. observed, &#147;might  reasonably  be
expected  to  have a negative effect on a decision  to  surrender
into  custody&#148;.  Goodman J.A. described the applicant as a &#147;young
unattached male facing a lengthy term of imprisonment subject  to
a  very  real  uncertainty with respect to  the  success  of  his
appeal&#148;.   Goodman J.A. also pointed out that, while  members  of
the  applicant&#146;s  family had volunteered to be his  sureties  and
supervise  him,  some of them testified in support  of  an  alibi
defence and were obviously disbelieved.
[12]  There  has  been  a material change of  circumstances  with
regard  to the likelihood the applicant would surrender.   Before
Goodman  J.A.,  the only proposed sureties were  the  applicant&#146;s
mother and father.  The applicant&#146;s mother is now deceased.   The
applicant&#146;s  father still puts himself forth  as  a  surety.   In
addition,  six  other members of the family  or  friends  of  the
family  are prepared to act as sureties offering a total of  over
$800,000.   The affidavit evidence also shows that the  applicant
has  considerable ties to the community where he  would  live  if
released  and  that he has an offer of employment.  Further,  the
applicant  has  now  served over half of  the  period  of  parole
ineligibility imposed by the trial judge.
[13] In considering the public interest, Goodman J.A. was
influenced by the fact that at the time he heard the application,
it was expected that the appeal would be heard within six months.
Considering the seriousness of the conviction, he did not
consider that an &#147;undue delay&#148;.  Regrettably, Goodman J.A.&#146;s
expectations have not been met.  It is now eight years to the day
since the applicant was convicted.  There have been serious
delays in perfecting the appeal because the applicant&#146;s counsel
have been pursuing fresh evidence.  Very little was said before
me as to why it was taking so long to complete this aspect of the
case.  It was agreed, however, that it would be at least another
year before the appeal could be argued.  Considering the time
that the applicant has already spent in custody, it can no longer
be said that there has not been an undue delay and it will be
some time before the appeal is heard.
[14] To conclude, there has been a material change in
circumstances with respect to the strength of the grounds of
appeal, the likelihood that the appellant will surrender and, in
general, the public interest.  I therefore conclude that I have
jurisdiction to consider this application for release.  For the
reasons that follow, I would grant the application.</pre>
    <pre>THE APPEAL IS NOT FRIVOLOUS</pre>
    <pre>[15]  Section  679(3)  sets  out the pre-conditions  for  release
pending the appeal.  The appellant must first establish that  the
appeal is not frivolous.  This condition is not in dispute.  As I
said,  the Crown concedes that some of the grounds of appeal  are
highly arguable.  I will have more to say about the merits of the
appeal when considering the public interest ground.</pre>
    <pre>THE APPLICANT WILL SURRENDER</pre>
    <pre>[16]  The  second  pre-condition is that the applicant  establish
that  he  will surrender himself into custody in accordance  with
the  terms  of the order.  I am satisfied that the applicant  has
demonstrated that he will surrender prior to the hearing  of  the
appeal  as  required by the release order.  The applicant  is  34
years of age.  Until his incarceration, he lived all of his  life
in  Scarborough with his parents and older brothers.  He  has  no
prior  record.   He was released pending his trial  and  complied
with all of the conditions of that release order. He is not known
to  abuse  alcohol  or drugs.  He obtained an honours  degree  in
psychology.   He  worked in the summers while a student  and  had
commenced  regular  employment in September  1990  where  he  was
working until his arrest in November 1990.  After he was released
on  bail following the preliminary inquiry, the applicant  worked
part  time at his father&#146;s store.  The applicant now has an offer
of employment if he is released pending his appeal.
[17] The applicant&#146;s record in the penitentiary has been
exemplary.  But for his continued protestations of innocence, and
therefore his refusal to take courses or treatment premised on
his guilt, he would probably have been transferred to a medium
security institution.  In the applicant&#146;s voluminous
institutional record, a letter dated June 8, 1999 is telling.
The writer is explaining why the applicant should not be
considered for an anger management programme:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>When doing assessments for candidacy for the 
program, we look at a number of factors, i.e. 
previous criminal charges, institutional 
adjustments, escalations of violence, patterns 
of angry or aggressive behaviour, OIA [sic] 
indicators, previous treatment plans, psychology 
reports etc.  This writer has checked over and 
over and can find no concrete evidence in any of the
above sources that would indicate a need to take the 
program.   Therefore, accordingly, his name should 
be removed from any Anger Management lists.
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18] I have already referred to a number of other matters bearing
upon  the  likelihood  that  the applicant  will  surrender  into
custody  prior to his appeal.  He has many substantial  sureties,
he  will  live with his father, he has the support of his  family
and neighbours and he has already served a substantial portion of
the sentence.  I am satisfied that the applicant will surrender.</pre>
    <pre>THE PUBLIC INTEREST</pre>
    <pre>[19] The public-interest ground takes on particular importance in
cases  where  an applicant has been convicted of a  very  serious
offence   and  faces  the  prospect  of  a  lengthy   period   of
incarceration.  In his reasons on the first application,  Goodman
J.A.  referred to the decision in R. v. Demyen (1975), 26  C.C.C.
(2d)  324 (Sask. C.A.) at p. 326 where Culliton C.J.S. wrote  the
following:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>I think it can be said that the release of a prisoner
convicted of a serious crime involving violence to the 
person pending the determination of his appeal is a 
matter of real concern to the public. I think it can 
be said, as well, that the public does not take the 
same view to the release of an accused while awaiting 
trial. This is understandable, as in the latter instance 
the accused is presumed to be innocent, while in the
former he is a convicted criminal. The automatic release 
from custody of a person convicted of a serious crime 
such as murder upon being satisfied that the appeal is 
not frivolous and that the convicted person will surrender 
himself into custody in accordance with the order that 
may be made, may undermine the public confidence in and 
respect for the Court and for the administration and 
enforcement of the criminal law. Thus, in my opinion, it 
is encumbent upon the appellant to show something more 
than the requirements prescribed by paras. (a) and (b) of 
s. 608(3) to establish that his detention is not necessary 
in the public interest. What that requirement is will 
depend upon the circumstances of each particular case.  
[Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20]  This  court  and other appellate courts have  applied  this
reasoning  in  murder cases with the result that  an  appellant&#146;s
release  pending  appeal  of  a  murder  conviction,  while   not
unprecedented, is rare.  On the other hand, appellate courts have
recognized that, where the grounds of appeal are strong and where
there  is serious concern about the accuracy of the verdict,  the
public  interest  may well shift in favour  of  release.   In  an
excerpt  from his reasons in R. v. Parsons (1994), 30 C.R.  (4th)
169  (Nfld. C.A.) at 186-87, subsequently approved on  review  by
the Court of Appeal,2 Marshall J.A. put the matter this way:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The use of the notion &#147;public perception&#148; in this decision
comprehends the perception of the repute of the administration 
of justice by a public reasonably informed of the criminal 
process and the circumstances of this case.  In my opinion, 
such an opinion would conclude in the circumstances prevailing 
that in the interests of fairness and justice, this verdict 
should be reviewed before it is enforced.
          
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21]  This  echoes  the explanation of public interest  given  by
Arbour  J.A. in R. v. Farinacci (1993), 86 C.C.C. (3d)  32  (Ont.
C.A.) at 47-8:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Section 679(3)(c) of the Criminal Code provides, in my
opinion, a clear standard against which the correctness of 
any decision granting or denying bail pending appeal can be 
reviewed.    The concerns reflecting public interest, as 
expressed in the case-law, relate both to the protection 
and safety of the public and to the need to maintain a 
balance between the competing dictates of enforceability 
and reviewability. It is the need to maintain that balance 
which is expressed by reference to the public image of the 
criminal law, or the public confidence in the administration 
of justice. The &quot;public interest&quot; criterion in s. 679(3)(c) 
of the Code requires a judicial assessment of the need to 
review the conviction leading to imprisonment, in which case 
execution of the sentence may have to be temporarily suspended, 
and the need to respect the general rule of immediate
enforceability of judgments.</pre>
      <pre>Public confidence in the administration of justice requires  
that judgments be enforced.  The public interest may require
that a person convicted of a very serious offence, particularly 
a repeat offender who is advancing grounds of appeal that are
arguable but weak, be denied bail. In such a case, the grounds 
favouring enforceability need not yield to the grounds favouring
reviewability.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>On the other hand, public confidence in the administration of
justice requires that judgments be reviewed and that errors, if
any, be corrected. This is particularly so in the criminal 
field where liberty is at stake.  Public confidence would be  
shaken, in my view, if a youthful first offender, sentenced to
a few months' imprisonment for a property offence,  was 
compelled to serve his or her entire sentence before having an 
opportunity to challenge the conviction on appeal.  Assuming   
that the requirements of s. 679(3)(a) and (b) of the Criminal  
Code are met, entitlement to bail is strongest when denial of
bail would render the appeal nugatory,  for all practical 
purposes.  This same principle animates the civil law dealing
with stays of judgments and orders pending appeal.  It is a 
principle which  vindicates the value of  reviewability. [Emphasis
added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[22]  Most  contested bail applications fall in between  the  two
extremes referred to by Arbour J.A., that is, between the case of
the  repeat offender with weak grounds of appeal convicted  of  a
serious  offence  and a youthful first offender  convicted  of  a
minor  property  offence.  This is one  of  those  cases.   I  am
dealing  with a mature offender, with no prior record,  convicted
of  one of the most serious offences.  I have concluded that  the
interest    in   reviewability   outweighs   the   interest    in
enforceability.
[23] The public interest, in the sense of reasonably informed
public opinion, is difficult to gauge.  The applicant has filed a
number of affidavits from persons in the community which indicate
their support for him and their belief in his innocence.  This
evidence, like a statement filed in the Parsons case and the
similar affidavits filed in the Morin3 case, are entitled to some
weight.  However, I take into consideration that this is only a
very small segment of the public and that their opinion of the
case may have been swayed by information that has not been tested
in court.  I think it would also be unfair to place too much
weight on such evidence without bearing in mind the contrary
opinion likely held by the family of the deceased and their
associates.
[24] It is therefore necessary to consider other public interest
factors.  There is no suggestion by the Crown that the applicant
represents a danger to the public or that he would interfere with
the administration of justice if released.  This factor therefore
suggests that his release may be in the public interest.
[25] In my view, the matter that is most influential on the
question of the public interest is the strength of the grounds of
appeal and I turn to those issues now.  I must, however, preface
that review with the following comments.  While I have had the
benefit of considerably more material than did Goodman J.A., I do
not have a complete appeal record.  The applicant has filed a
lengthy and detailed factum running to 390 pages that will be
used at the hearing of the appeal.  The Crown has not yet filed
its respondent&#146;s factum.  I did have the benefit of a
respondent&#146;s factum filed on this application, but it does not
respond to all of the matters raised in the applicant&#146;s appeal
factum.  The applicant has also filed material that demonstrates
the nature of the fresh evidence he hopes to tender on the
hearing of the appeal.  However, much of that material, while it
may well be reliable, based as it is on police interviews, is
double or triple hearsay.  Some of the actual fresh evidence in
the sense of affidavits from the first-hand witnesses has not
been filed and there has only been cross-examination on some of
that material.  It follows that I cannot reach any final
conclusion of the strength of the grounds of appeal and it is
certainly possible that the panel of the Court of Appeal hearing
the appeal would take a different view of the sufficiency of the
grounds of appeal.  With these caveats, I turn to some of the
grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     The burden of proof</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The  applicant submits that there was serious  misdirection
with  respect  to  the burden of proof.  This case  preceded  the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Lifchus  (1997),
118  C.C.C.  (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  Thus, the charge contains  certain
phrases  that are no longer in use.  In particular, in  referring
to the strength of circumstantial evidence, the trial judge said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Nor is it very often that adequate evidence is not 
afforded by the attendant and surrounding facts, to 
remove all mystery, and to afford such a reasonable 
degree of certainty as men and women are daily 
accustomed to regard as sufficient in the most important 
concerns of life; to expect more would be equally 
needless and absurd.         
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27] In Lifchus, Cory J. wrote as follows at p. 9:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Jurors should not be invited to apply to the 
determination of guilt in a criminal trial the same 
standard of proof that they would apply to the 
decisions they are required to make in their everyday 
lives, or even to the most important of these decisions.        
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[28]  As  Ms. Brewer pointed out, the charge must be  read  as  a
whole  and  the  trial judge gave a correct  explanation  of  the
burden  of  proof  in  other  parts  of  the  charge.   This   is
nevertheless a very arguable ground of appeal that was not  drawn
to the attention of Goodman J.A.</pre>
    <pre>     Fabricated alibi</pre>
    <pre>[29]  Several  of  the  grounds of  appeal  concern  the  Crown&#146;s
reliance  upon evidence of consciousness of guilt and  the  trial
judge&#146;s  charge with respect to that evidence.  The  trial  judge
directed  the jury that it could find that the applicant&#146;s  alibi
was concocted and this could support the identification evidence.
There  does  not seem to have been any extrinsic  evidence  of  a
concocted alibi and this direction may have been improper.</pre>
    <pre>     Other evidence of consciousness of guilt</pre>
    <pre>[30]   The   trial  judge  left  a  large  number  of  items   as
demonstrating  the  applicant&#146;s  consciousness  of  guilt.    The
applicant  argues that many of these items were  not  capable  of
constituting  evidence of consciousness of guilt.   The  risk  of
placing   undue   emphasis  on  this  kind  of  evidence   in   a
circumstantial case like this has been referred to in a number of
cases.   I  agree with the applicant that this is  a  significant
ground of appeal.
[31] The applicant also argues that certain items of evidence
that tended to exculpate the applicant were turned around by the
trial judge and converted into pieces of inculpatory evidence.
He points, for example, to the directions concerning the
applicant&#146;s inability to drive a car with a standard
transmission, like the deceased&#146;s car.  The trial judge said the
following:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Robert Baltovich&#146;s ability to drive a standard 
transmission.  You will note that Robert Baltovich 
makes protestations throughout his statements about 
his inability to drive a standard gear shift.  I 
suppose it is a valid question for you to ask yourself:  
Why all the protestations?  Is it a big deal for a 26
year old male to drive a so-called &#147;four on the floor&#148;?          
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[32] On the application before me, the Crown did not dispute that
these directions may be in error.  Considering the importance  of
this evidence to the Crown&#146;s case and the emphasis given to it by
the  trial  judge in his charge to the jury, this is an important
ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Guilty knowledge</pre>
    <pre>[33]  The trial judge left a number of items of evidence  to  the
jury  as  evidence of guilty knowledge, presumably statements  by
the  applicant demonstrating knowledge that only the killer could
have  had.   It is not apparent that this evidence was accurately
categorized.  The Crown did not dispute before me that  this  may
be  an  error.   However, I emphasize that I  did  not  have  any
argument on the point.</pre>
    <pre>     The charge on identification evidence</pre>
    <pre>[34]  The  identification evidence was subject  to  a  number  of
frailties.  The applicant argues that the trial judge  failed  to
relate  the  particular frailties to the evidence in  this  case.
For  example,  it was the theory of the Crown that, several  days
after  the  killing,  the applicant used the  deceased&#146;s  car  to
transport her body up north to a swampy area where it would never
be  discovered.   The  Crown relied upon the  evidence  of  David
Dibben that he saw the applicant driving the deceased&#146;s car early
on Friday morning, June 22nd, at the intersections of Highways 7A
and  12.   There  were  a number of problems  with  Mr.  Dibben&#146;s
evidence  that, the applicant argues, were not adequately  placed
before the jury by the trial judge.  For example, his description
of  the driver of the car changed over time to more closely match
the   applicant&#146;s   appearance.   The   applicant   argues   that
Mr.   Dibben's  original  description  tended  to  eliminate  the
applicant as the driver of the vehicle and this should have  been
pointed out to the jury.</pre>
    <pre>     The applicant&#146;s opportunity to commit the offence</pre>
    <pre>[35] The applicant argued that a careful analysis of the evidence
shows that the applicant had a limited opportunity to commit  the
offence and this was not set out for the jury in a manner whereby
they  would  appreciate  the force  of  the  defence  case.   The
applicant also submits that the evidence suggests that, if Dibben
saw anyone driving the deceased&#146;s car, it could not have been  on
Friday  following  the  disappearance,  but  must  have  been  on
Wednesday.  The applicant appears to have had an alibi  for  that
time on Wednesday as he was speaking to the deceased&#146;s mother  at
the relevant time.</pre>
    <pre>     The applicant&#146;s attendance at the deceased&#146;s class</pre>
    <pre>[36]  A  puzzling  piece  of evidence at  the  applicant&#146;s  trial
concerned his statements to the police that after working out  at
the  gym  he  went to the classroom to wait for the  deceased  at
about  9:00  p.m.  He told the police that when he  came  to  the
classroom,  he saw a man waiting outside.  He thought  that  this
man  might  be  waiting  for  the  deceased  and  accordingly  he
concealed himself.  As it turned out, the man was there  to  meet
another student and the deceased did not show up.  At trial,  the
Crown seems to have relied upon these statements as an attempt by
the  applicant to fabricate evidence.  The Crown argued that  the
applicant never did go to the classroom since, having killed  the
deceased,  he knew she was not there, and he lied to the  police.
Proposed   fresh  evidence  tends  to  support  the   applicant&#146;s
statements that he did go to the classroom.  The applicant argues
that this evidence is important exculpatory evidence.  If he  had
killed  the  deceased, he would not have gone to  the  classroom.
Or,  if he had killed the deceased but then went to the classroom
to  try  to  create  exculpatory  evidence,  he  would  not  have
concealed himself so that no one would be able to confirm that he
had  been  there.   I  did  not  understand  the  Crown  on  this
application to dispute that this was a highly arguable ground  of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     The Bernardo fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[37]  At  trial, the defence attempted, with limited success,  to
suggest  that the deceased may have been abducted and  killed  by
the  Scarborough rapist.  The identity of the Scarborough  rapist
was  then unknown.  It is now known that he was Paul Bernardo and
that  he went on to kill three women.  The applicant has obtained
further  evidence that he suggests now points to  Bernardo  as  a
likely  perpetrator of this offence as well.  While  the  defence
does  have  additional evidence about Bernardo, which it  may  be
able to develop more fully, at this stage I would place only very
limited  reliance  upon  that  proposed  fresh  evidence  in   my
assessment of the strength of the grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION ON THE PUBLIC INTEREST</pre>
    <pre>[38]  In  an  interesting submission, Mr.  Lockyer  urged  me  to
approach  this  case  on  the basis that there  is  a  reasonable
possibility that an innocent man has been convicted.  He referred
to  several  recent  decisions to support this  submission.   For
example, In R. v. Khan (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Man. C.A.) at
445,  Twaddle  J.A.  took into account that  there  was  &#147;a  real
possibility  that  the applicant will eventually  be  acquitted&#148;.
However, that comment was made in relation to an application  for
bail  pending  a  new  trial  ordered following  the  applicant&#146;s
successful  appeal from conviction for murdering his sister.   In
that  case,  the  applicant  had  regained  the  presumption   of
innocence.  In the companion application, where the applicant was
seeking release pending the appeal from conviction for the murder
of  his  wife,  Twaddle  J.A. used the  more  traditional  public
interest  language, which looks to the merits of the appeal.   He
said at p. 448:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Taking into account the delay already encountered, the 
further delay due to counsel's ability to argue this case 
on a timely basis and the strength of the prisoner's 
appeal, I am of the view that the prisoner should be 
released pending his appeal to this Court from his 
conviction on the charge of murdering his wife. A          
reasonable, well-informed member of the public is less 
likely, in my view, to lose confidence in a system which 
admits a person to bail in such circumstances than one 
which tolerates delay and ignores the strength of the 
prisoner's appeal.          
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[39]  In  R.  v.  Johnson (1998), 21 C.R. (5th)  135  (N.S.C.A.),
Freeman  J.A.  also took into account the reasonable  possibility
that  the applicant was innocent. The applicant was applying  for
release pending a hearing before the Court of Appeal directed  by
the  Minister  of  Justice under s. 690 of the Criminal  Code  to
consider  the admissibility of fresh evidence.  The prosecution&#146;s
case  depended  upon expert evidence as to the manner  of  death.
New  expert evidence suggested that the death was accidental  and
some  of  the  expert prosecution witnesses from the  trial  also
appeared to have altered their opinion.  In that context, Freeman
J.A. said the following at p. 138:</pre>
    <pre>
          It would be unrealistic to deny that, at the 
	  end of the day, there is at least a reasonable 
	  possibility that he has been wrongly convicted.
          </pre>
    <pre>          If    that  should  be  the   final  outcome,
          neither  justice nor the public interest  can
          be  served  by  requiring him  to  remain  in
          prison  until  the process has worked  itself
          through  what  appears  to  be  two  separate
          hearings  in  this court and possibly  a  new
          trial.  As his counsel points out, the months
          unjustly  taken from him, if he is  innocent,
          can  never be restored to him, but if at  the
          end  of  the  day  he is still  found  to  be
          guilty, they can be added to the time he must
          serve.   I  find that Mr. Johnson&#146;s detention
          is not necessary in the public interest.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[40]  Johnson is an unusual case.  The focus of the  new  hearing
before the court of appeal was narrow, involving a single, albeit
possibly difficult issue.  The fresh evidence seems to have  been
relatively well developed.  The case before me is much different.
The  prosecution's case was complex and did not depend  upon  any
one  piece  of  information.  The case for the applicant's  being
&#147;factually innocent&#148; turns upon the applicant&#146;s statements to the
police, as he did not testify at trial, the alleged frailties  in
the  prosecution's  case and the strength of the  fresh  evidence
pointing  to  someone  else  as  the  perpetrator.   As  I   have
indicated,  the fresh evidence is simply not at a stage  where  I
could  safely  come  to  a conclusion on  the  strength  of  that
submission.  In the circumstances, it is my view that the  better
course  is  to consider the public interest from the  traditional
standpoint as articulated by this court in many decisions.
[41] In his reasons for refusing to release the applicant back in
1992, Goodman J.A. said that there will no doubt be cases where
the hearing of the appeal &#147;will be so long delayed and the
probability of success in the appeal so strong that it will be
contrary to the public interest to refuse a release and a
fortiori an applicant&#146;s detention would not be necessary in the
public interest&#148;.  In my view, this is now one of those cases.
[42] In reaching that conclusion, I not only take into account
the lengthy period of time that remains before this appeal can be
heard, but the very long delay to this point.  While it may be
said that the applicant &#147;caused&#148; the delay in that he instructed
his counsel to pursue difficult and complex matters of fresh
evidence, there is no suggestion that the applicant has
personally been responsible for any delay or that he has sought
to avoid the hearing of the appeal.
[43] At least some of the grounds of appeal, which I have only
briefly touched upon, are sufficiently compelling that it is not
necessary in the public interest that the applicant be further
detained.

        DISPOSITION
          
[44]  Accordingly, the application is granted and  the  applicant
will  be released pending his appeal in accordance with the terms
set out in the draft order.
