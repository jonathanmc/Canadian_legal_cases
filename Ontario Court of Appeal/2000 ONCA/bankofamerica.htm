213 (Ont. Gen. Div.)</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>GOUDGE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   In the real estate boom of the late 1980s, Reemark Sterling
I  Limited  (&#147;Reemark&#148;)  undertook the  building  of  a  300-unit
residential  condominium  project in  Scarborough,  Ontario.  The
respondent  Bank  of  America Canada (&#147;BAC&#148;)  agreed  to  provide
Reemark with a construction loan of $33 million for the project.
[2]  On November 12, 1987, the appellant Mutual Trust Company
(&#147;MT&#148;) contracted with Reemark to provide long-term mortgage
financing for the project in the aggregate amount of $36.5
million. This agreement was known as the Takeout Mortgage
Commitment (the &#147;TOC&#148;). On December 16, 1988, BAC, Reemark and MT
executed an Assignment of Takeout Financing (the &#147;TOC
Assignment&#148;) by which BAC would receive repayment of the
construction loan it had made from the funds advanced by MT under
the TOC.
[3]  On July 31, 1991, against the background of the collapsing
real estate market of the early 1990s, MT declared that it was
legally entitled to decline to advance funds under the TOC and
would not do so unless additional conditions were met.
[4]  Following further negotiations, MT, BAC and Reemark executed
a further agreement on December 18, 1991, known as the Amended
Takeout Mortgage Commitment (the &#147;ATOC&#148;), providing a
renegotiated  basis upon which MT was to advance the long-term
mortgage financing.
[5]  Shortly thereafter, on February 28, 1992, MT took the
position that because it had not received satisfactory answers to
requisitions it had submitted, it would not advance any funds
pursuant to the ATOC and considered its commitment to be at an
end.
[6]  As a result, BAC commenced this litigation. At trial, Farley
J. found that MT had breached the TOC, the TOC Assignment, and
the ATOC. He awarded damages to BAC together with both pre-
judgment and post-judgment interest calculated on a compound
basis.
[7]  On appeal MT contests the findings of liability and the
award of compound interest.
[8]  For the reasons that follow, I agree with the conclusions
reached by Farley J. except for that relating to interest. In the
circumstances of this case, I can find no basis for awarding
compound interest. Rather, it should be simple interest
calculated in the usual way as provided for in the Courts of
Justice Act. I would therefore allow the appeal, but only to this
limited extent.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The additional facts needed for my analysis are as follows.
[10] The TOC was executed by MT and Reemark on November 12, 1987.
While it contained many terms, the principal one relied on by MT
in these proceedings was &#147;Other Condition 3&#148;, which provided that
there shall be no material change in any representation or
information in regard to the project.
[11] MT was a wholly owned subsidiary of Mutual Trustco Inc.
(&#147;MTrustco&#148;). On November 25, 1987, almost two weeks after MT and
Reemark entered the TOC, MTrustco, Reemark, and several Reemark
related companies, negotiated an agreement called the Support
Agreement. It required that when legal title to the condominium
units was transferred to individual investors, Reemark would
establish a trust fund of some $5.6 million in favour of
MTrustco. This was to protect MTrustco in the event that it was
called upon to satisfy its  guarantee of certain undertakings of
cash flow given by Reemark to the investors in the project. MT
was not a party to the Support Agreement.
[12] On December 16, 1988, MT, Reemark and BAC entered into the
TOC Assignment. As part of this contract MT agreed that as of
that date the TOC was valid and in good standing, that the
takeout financing was fully available to all 300 units of the
project, that Reemark was entitled to receive all of the proceeds
of the takeout financing and that all such proceeds were to be
advanced by it to BAC pursuant to the irrevocable direction from
Reemark to do so.
[13] In the spring of 1991 MT learned that Reemark had granted a
further mortgage on the project for $5 million, which had then
been assigned to Royal Trust for $3 million.
[14] On June 18, 1991, MT asserted to both Reemark and BAC that
there had been a material change in the representations and
information provided in relation to the project in contravention
of Other Condition 3 of the TOC. MT provided no particulars of
the alleged material change either then or at trial. Then on July
23, 1991, MT made clear that it would only advance funds under
the TOC if Reemark agreed to a holdback of $5.6 million from the
advance in order to cover the cash flow assurances that had been
guaranteed by its parent MTrustco. MT asserted that if the
funding did not proceed on this basis by July 31, 1991, it would
cancel its commitment and consider the matter closed.
[15] After MT took this position, BAC and Reemark, rather than
immediately litigating, attempted to reach a negotiated business
solution with MT. These negotiations concluded on December 18,
1991, with the execution by all three parties of the ATOC. That
agreement amended the TOC.
[16] Included in its provisions was confirmation that the full
amount of the takeout financing provided by MT was to be
$36,555,835 commencing with the first advance to be $18.25
million less a holdback of  $2.5 million. The parties were to use
all reasonable and diligent efforts to ensure that this first
advance was made by January 31, 1992 and if not made by February
29, 1992, MT was to be released of its obligation to fund if the
delay was not its fault. MT expressly confirmed that all of the
conditions precedent to funding which were set out on page two of
the TOC had been satisfied and that there had been no material
changes in the representations or information in regard to the
project which would prevent it from proceeding with the advances.
It was further agreed that contemporaneously with the first
advance, BAC would release MT from all claims in relation to the
TOC and the TOC Assignment.
[17] A few days before the target date of January 31, 1992, MT
changed solicitors. On February 6, 1992, the new solicitor
forwarded to Reemark a list of 52 purported requisitions on
title. Without admitting his right to make these requisitions,
Reemark responded to each of them. Nonetheless, on February 28,
1992, MT took the position that these responses were
unsatisfactory, that it would not advance any funds and that its
commitment was at an end.
[18] This litigation followed.
[19] At trial, Farley J. held that MT was in breach of the TOC
and the TOC Assignment as of July 31, 1991, when it failed to
advance funds and cancelled its commitment. He found that while
Reemark may have breached the Security Agreement by giving the
mortgage that was assigned to Royal Trust (something which he
said might have provided MT with a defence to a claim from
Reemark), BAC&#146;s claim was undiminished by this, since it was an
assignee from Reemark for value without notice of the Support
Agreement.
[20] Second, Farley J. held that MT was in breach of the ATOC
when it refused to advance as of  February 29, 1992. He found
that the requisitions submitted by MT were invalid and need not
have been answered, but were reasonably answered in any event.
Moreover, MT acted in bad faith in making them since it did so
simply to further its intention of escaping its obligations.
[21] The trial judge then went on to calculate the damages
suffered by BAC as a result of these breaches taking into account
the mitigation efforts which it had undertaken following February
29, 1992. Damages are not an issue in this appeal.
[22] Finally, Farley J. determined that in the circumstances of
the case pre-judgment interest should be calculated on a
compounded basis. He thus awarded BAC pre-judgment and
postjudgment interest at its prime rate plus 1% compounded
monthly.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[23]  In  argument before this court, the appellant raised  three
issues. I will deal with each of them in turn.
[24] The first issue is whether MT breached the TOC and the TOC
Assignment when in July 1991 it declared that it would only
advance funds if Reemark agreed to a holdback of $5.6 million and
otherwise would cancel its commitment.
[25] I agree with Farley J. that this constituted a breach of
contract by MT. First, the holdback insisted on by MT was a
unilateral demand not provided for by the TOC. Second, MT&#146;s claim
that there had been  material change in the representations
provided in relation to the project was never substantiated in
any way. MT neither alleged nor proved a specific material
change.
[26] Finally, in my view, the mortgage given by Reemark and
assigned to Royal Trust could not serve to excuse MT from its
funding obligation either to BAC or to Reemark. That mortgage
could not be said to have reduced Reemark&#146;s equity in the project
below any agreed upon level since the TOC contained no such
requirement.
[27] Nor could it be said to have been a breach of Reemark&#146;s
obligation under the Support Agreement to establish a $5.6
million trust fund in favour of MTrustco. That obligation was
only to arise at the point when legal title to the condominium
units was transferred to the investors. Hence, in July 1991 when
MT declared  that it would no longer comply with the TOC there
could not have been a breach of that obligation since there was
as yet no requirement that legal title be transferred to the
individual investors.
[28] Finally, Reemark&#146;s obligations under the Support Agreement
were owed to MTrustco not to MT and if breached could not be
relied on by MT to excuse its own performance under the TOC.
[29] For these reasons, I do not agree that MT may have had the
right to refuse to perform at the instance of Reemark. I
therefore need not deal with whether BAC was subject to the
equities between Reemark and MT, or could be treated as an
assignee for value without notice of the Support Agreement.
[30] MT therefore had no lawful basis for its assertion that as
of July 31, 1991, it would not comply with its funding obligation
under the TOC. This was an anticipatory breach of the TOC.
Similarly, it was a breach of the TOC Assignment under which BAC
had the right to receive the proceeds from the funding that MT
was obliged to make under the TOC. This ground of appeal must
fail.
[31] The second issue is whether MT breached the ATOC as of
February 29, 1992, when it refused to advance any funds and
declared its commitment to be at an end.
[32] Here, again I agree with Farley J. MT had no lawful basis
upon which to take this position.
[33] On appeal, MT offered as its justification the answers given
to three of the requisitions made on February 6, 1992. It argued
that these were unsatisfactory and excused all further
performance under the ATOC. The thrust of these requisitions was
to require, as a precondition to making the first advance of
$18.25 million, that Reemark demonstrate that the individual
investors had reconfirmed their deals by producing the security
documents said to be required of these investors.
[34] In my view there was nothing in the ATOC that entitled MT to
submit these requisitions. That contract expressly provided that
all of the conditions precedent set forth on page two of the TOC
had been satisfied. The ATOC contained no provision for MT to do
further due diligence. Indeed, the trial judge found that MT&#146;s
new solicitor had acknowledged that his client had no right to
refuse to close if the requested information was not given.
[35] Moreover, I agree with the trial judge that the ATOC clearly
contemplated that individual investors would assume their
security obligations only after MT made the first advance of
$18.25 million. MT&#146;s funding obligation was not conditioned on
individual investors having provided the security documents which
would ultimately be required of them.
[36] I therefore conclude that MT had no right to advance these
requisitions. Moreover, the ATOC did not accord to MT the rights
suggested by these requisitions. As a result, MT had no lawful
basis to terminate its contractual obligations under the ATOC as
of February 29, 1992.
[37] Given this conclusion, it is not necessary to address the
finding by the trial judge that these requisitions were advanced
in bad faith and that this provides another reason for concluding
that MT cannot rely on the requisitions and the answers to them
as a basis for refusing to meet its obligations under the ATOC.
[38] Because of its breach of the ATOC, MT never made the first
advance called for by the ATOC. Since making this advance was a
precondition to the release of MT from its breach of the TOC and
the TOC Assignment, that release never became effective. As a
result, as the trial judge found, BAC was entitled to damages for
MT&#146;s breach of the earlier agreements as well as its breach of
the ATOC.
[39] Those damages run from the date upon which MT breached the
TOC and the TOC assignment. I agree with Farley J. that July 31,
1991 is that date, since it was as of that date that MT
unlawfully cancelled its commitment under the TOC and the TOC
Assignment and indicated that it considered the matter to be
closed.
[40] These 1991 breaches entitled BAC to the full measure of
damages resulting from MT&#146;s repudiation of its contractual
obligations and its complete refusal to provide any takeout
financing whatsoever. Hence, it is unnecessary to consider
whether the damages flowing from the breach of the ATOC should be
limited to compensation for failure to make the first advance
only. BAC is entitled to the full measure of damages in any
event. The second ground of appeal must also fail.
[41] The third issue addresses the basis upon which interest
should be calculated. The entitlement to interest runs from the
date of the breach, namely, July 31, 1991. Farley J. ordered that
interest throughout be on a compounded basis. The debate is
whether he was correct to do so.
[42] He did so on two grounds: first, in the exercise of his
discretion under s. 130 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O.
1990, c.C.43 and, second, as a component of the damages sustained
by BAC.
[43] With respect, I disagree with his conclusion that BAC proved
an entitlement to compound interest as a matter of damages. It is
not enough for BAC to simply describe the nature of its lending
business. It must also demonstrate that the failure of MT to
provide it with the financing contracted for deprived it of
lending opportunities that would have yielded compound interest
and that its lost profits on these missed opportunities were
equal to that quantum of interest without discounting for such
things as the possible impact of non-performing loans. There was
simply no such evidence here and these gaps cannot be filled by
making assumptions based on the nature of BAC&#146;s business. Indeed
the respondent did not strenuously defend this basis for the
awarding of compound interest.
[44] Moreover, in finding that he had jurisdiction under s.130 of
the Courts of Justice Act, to award compound interest, I conclude
that Farley J. erred in law.
[45] The relevant sections of that Act are as follows:
          </pre>

               </pre>
    <pre>                    (g)  any other relevant consideration.</pre>
    <pre>[46]  Clause  128(4)(b) is a clear statutory prohibition  against
awarding  compound interest under s.128(1). This prohibition  was
in  the predecessor legislation, the Judicature Act, R.S.O. 1980,
c.  223,  s.36(5)(b) and has been in the Courts  of  Justice  Act
since its inception in 1984.
[47] Section 129 has a similar history and in combination with
s.127, it defines the rate of post-judgment interest for the
purposes of the legislation. That definition does not encompass
compounding. Similar to s.128(4)(g) for pre-judgment interest,
s.129(5) provides an exception where the right to post-judgment
interest is found outside the legislation.
[48] Section 130 of the Courts of Justice Act permits certain
types of modification to the interest payable under ss. 128 and
129, but compounding is not among them. This provision too was in
the Judicature Act (s.36(6)) and has been in the Courts of
Justice since 1984. While it gives the court discretion to
disallow statutory interest or to allow it at a higher or lower
rate or for a different period of time, it simply cannot be read
to empower the court to override the clear legislative intent
found in ss.128 and 129 that both pre-judgment and post-judgment
interest be awarded on a simple not a compounded basis:  See
Koukounakis v. Stainrod (1996), 3 C.P.C. (4th) 56 (Ont. Gen.
Div.), aff&#146;d., (1998), 22 C.P.C. (4th) 104 (Ont. C.A.).
[49] The relevant jurisprudence makes clear that the court&#146;s
jurisdiction to award compound interest is not found in s.130 of
the Courts of Justice Act, but rather in the court&#146;s general
equitable jurisdiction. Where principles of equity warrant an
award of compound interest, it is, in the language of s.128(4)(g)
and s.129(5) &#147;payable by a right other than under this section.&#148;
Where this jurisdiction rather than the legislation underpins the
award of interest, the express legislative intent that interest
awarded under ss. 128 and 129 be on a simple basis has no
application.
[50] In the leading case of Brock v. Cole et al. (1983), 40 O.R.
(2d) 97 (C.A.), this court considered s.36 of the Judicature Act,
the predecessor of ss.128 and 130 of the Courts of Justice Act.
In particular, it scrutinized s.36(5)(f) the predecessor to
s.128(4)(g). Thorson J.A. writing for the court said this at p.
102:
          </pre>
    <pre>    I, of course, accept that s. 36(5)(f) constitutes a
    statutory recognition that there continue to be rights
    to interest on judgment claims that are found outside
    the general provisions of s. 36. Moreover, in my opinion,
    there is nothing in s. 36 from which it is to be concluded
    that the Legislature, in enacting s. 36 in its present
    form, intended to do away with the authority of a court,
    applying well-recognized principles of equity, to award
    interest including compound interest in those cases in
    which it is just and proper to do so. I also accept that
    once it is established that the conditions which must be
    met in order to warrant the exercise of the court&#146;s
    equitable jurisdiction to order compound interest have
    been met, it can properly be said that the plaintiff has
    a right to such interest of the kind described in s.36(5)(f)
    of the Judicature Act, that is to say a right other than
    under the general provisions of s.36 respecting pre-judgment
    interest.</pre>
    <pre>[51] In locating the authority to award compound interest outside
the  relevant  legislation,  in  the  court&#146;s  general  equitable
jurisdiction, Thorson J.A. saw no need to discuss s.36(6) of  the
Judicature Act, the predecessor to s.130 of the Courts of Justice
Act.  This confirms what I take to be the plain meaning of s.130,
namely,  that  it  does  not  confer the  jurisdiction  to  award
interest on a compounded basis either pre- or post-judgment.
[52] Since Brock v. Cole, subsequent jurisprudence has looked to
the court&#146;s general equitable jurisdiction rather than to the
Courts of Justice Act in considering pre-judgment interest on a
compounded basis. See, for example, Claiborne Industries Ltd. v.
National Bank of Canada (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 65 (C.A.);
Confederation Life Insurance Co. v. Shepherd MacKenzie Plaxton
Little and Jenkins (1996), 88 O.A.C. 398 (C.A.); Oceanic
Exploration Company v. Denison Mines Ltd., a judgment of the
Ontario Court (General Division, Commercial List), released May
8, 1998 (per Feldman J.).
[53] In my view, neither of the two cases put forward by the
respondent undermine this conclusion. In the first of these,
Niagara Airbus Inc. v. Camerman (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 108 (C.A.),
Carthy J.A. for the court utilized the predecessor of s.130 of
the Courts of Justice Act as a discretionary basis for awarding
compound interest. The court was not invited to consider the
legislative prohibition in the predecessor to s.128 of the Act
nor the general equitable jurisdiction, outside the legislation,
to award compound interest. In my respectful view, this case must
be seen as per incuriam of the issue.
[54] The second case is Air Canada v. Ontario (Liquor Control
Board), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 581. As I read that case, the court&#146;s
obiter reference to compound interest is anchored in the judgment
in Brock v. Cole, supra, hence in the court&#146;s general equitable
jurisdiction. In noting that such an award is a matter of
discretion, Iacobucci J. simply recites s.130 of the Courts of
Justice Act without elaboration. I cannot take this brief
reference to indicate any sea change in the well-established
jurisprudence that finds the jurisdiction to award interest on a
compounded basis not in the Courts of Justice Act, but in the
general equitable jurisdiction of the court.
[55] Hence, I conclude that Farley J. erred in law in grounding
his order for compound interest in s.130 of the Courts of Justice
Act.
[56] It remains only to determine whether his interest award can
be defended as a proper exercise of the court&#146;s equitable
jurisdiction to make such an order. In Brock v. Cole the court
utilized this jurisdiction to award compound pre-judgment
interest against a lawyer who misused and failed to return funds
in breach of his fiduciary duty. Significant reliance was placed
on the English case of Wallersteiner v. Moir (No. 2), [1975] 1
All E.R. 849, which was also a case of a fiduciary misusing trust
monies for his own benefit. It is in this context that I would
read the well-known words from Lord Denning in that judgment that
were quoted in Brock v. Cole at p. 103.
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; in equity interest is awarded whenever a wrongdoer
   deprives a company of money which it needs for use in
   its business. It is plain that the company should  be
   compensated for the loss thereby occasioned to it. Mere
   replacement of the money &#150; years later &#150; is by no means
   adequate compensation, especially in days of inflation.
   The company should be compensated by the award of interest.
   &#133;But the question arises: should it be simple interest or
   compound interest? On general principles I think it should
   be presumed that the company (had it not been deprived of
   the money) would have made the most beneficial use open to
   it &#133; Alternatively, it should be presumed that the wrongdoer
   made the most beneficial use of it. But, whichever it is, in
   order to give adequate compensation, the money should be
   replaced at interest with yearly rests, i.e. compound interest.</pre>
    <pre>[57] Since Brock v. Cole the jurisprudence in Ontario has focused
on whether the wrongdoer against whom compound interest is sought
is a fiduciary who has stolen funds or profited from the wrongful
retention    of   trust   monies.   See   Claiborne   Industries,
Confederation Life and Oceanic Exploration, supra. In England, it
has  been  much  the same. For example, in Westdeutsche  Bank  v.
Islington  L.B.C., [1996] 2 All E.R. 961 (H.L.) it was held  that
in  the  absence  of  fraud, equity had  never  awarded  compound
interest  except against a trustee or other person in a fiduciary
position in respect of profits improperly made.
[58] In Air Canada, supra, Iacobucci J., in obiter, found that
compound interest might have been appropriate, but declined to
interfere with the award of simple interest made at trial. The
court was moved by the knowingly improper collection and
retention of monies from the plaintiff by provincial authorities.
Hence I think the general equitable jurisdiction of the court to
award compound interest extends to a successful claim and
restitution for the return of monies from a party who has
retained them knowing that to be wrongful.
[59] These cases define the core of the court&#146;s equitable
jurisdiction to award interest on a compounded basis. Without
fixing the precise reach of this jurisdiction, I agree with the
trial judge in Oceanic Exploration, supra, now my colleague
Feldman J.A., who  concluded that this jurisdiction does not take
in the case that is no more than a debt wrongfully withheld. As
she said, where monies were to be advanced, but were not paid in
breach of contract, without a right in equity to compound
interest, the prohibition against it in s.128(4)(b) must prevail.
Apart from cases of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, knowingly
wrongful retention of another&#146;s monies and the like, where equity
can assist, the clear legislative policy is that interest not be
compounded unless, of course, it can be proven as a matter of
damages.
[60] Turning to this case, I do not think that the general
equitable jurisdiction of the court can be looked to to justify
the compounding of interest. This is not a case of fraud. Nor can
MT be said to owe a fiduciary duty to BAC. Nor is BAC seeking
restitution of its monies wrongfully retained by MT. Rather, this
case involves a breach of contract by a lending institution. In
such a case equity cannot help. The order of Farley J. awarding
compound interest must therefore be set aside. In its place there
will be an order for simple interest as provided for in ss.128
and 129 of the Courts of Justice Act. Neither party asked the
court to vary the rate of interest or to allow interest for a
period other than that provided in the statute, and I see no
basis for doing so in the circumstances of this case.
[61] In summary I would allow the appeal, but only to the extent
of substituting the order for interest that I have described for
the counterpart order made at trial. As the respondent has
succeeded in large measure, I would award it three quarters (3/4)
of its costs of the appeal.
