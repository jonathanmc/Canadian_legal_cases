    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice L.C. Kozak dated
August 28, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>DOHERTY J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent, Laura Bannon, slipped and fell on a snow-
covered sidewalk in Thunder Bay at about 1:30 a.m. on December
29, 1995.  She could not get up.  Eventually, help arrived and
Ms. Bannon was taken to the hospital.  Her right leg was badly
broken and she underwent surgery to repair the fracture on the
evening of December 29, 1995.  She remained in the hospital until
January 11, 1996, when she was moved to a convalescent home.
[2]  Ms. Bannon brought an action against the appellant, the
Corporation of the City of Thunder Bay (the &#147;City&#148;), claiming
that the City had failed to properly clear the ice and snow from
the sidewalk and that as a result of an accumulation of ice and
snow she had fallen and suffered serious injuries, including a
broken leg.  The issue of liability was tried before Kozak J.1
There were two main issues raised at trial:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Was Ms. Bannon&#146;s claim barred by her failure to give notice
  of her injury and claim to the City within seven days as required
  by s. 284(5) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45 (the
  &#147;Act&#148;)?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  If the action was not barred, had the plaintiff established
  that the conduct of the City amounted to gross negligence as
  required by s. 284(4) of the Act?
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[3]  In addition to these two issues, the City raised a further
argument in support of its position that the action was barred by
the failure to give notice.  The City argued that Ms. Bannon&#146;s
failure to respond to a request to admit served on her pursuant
to Rule 51.02 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
194, as amended, meant that she was deemed to admit the facts set
out in the request.  The City contended that the deemed
admissions foreclosed any argument that Ms. Bannon was incapable
on account of physical and mental disability of giving the notice
required by s. 284(5) of the Act.  The City submitted that the
deemed admissions combined with the failure to give the notice
within seven days necessitated the dismissal of the action.
[4]  Kozak J. decided all three issues against the City.  He held
that:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  In the circumstances, the failure to respond to the request
  to admit should not be taken as a deemed admission of the facts
  contained in the request.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  In the seven days following the accident, Ms. Bannon was
  physically and mentally incapable of complying with the notice
  requirements imposed by s. 284(5).  The failure to give the
  notice required by that section did not, therefore, bar the
  action.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The City had failed to properly sand or clear the sidewalk
  on which Ms. Bannon fell for about a month prior to Ms. Bannon&#146;s
  accident.  Given the amount of snowfall during that period (about
  50 cm), the City&#146;s conduct amounted to gross negligence.
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[5]  The City challenges all three findings on appeal.  I would
not disturb the trial judge&#146;s conclusion with respect to the
effect of the failure to respond to the request to admit or his
finding of gross negligence.  I would, however, allow the appeal
as it relates to his finding that Ms. Bannon&#146;s failure to give
notice to the City within seven days as required by s.284(5) of
the Act was not a bar to the action.  In my view, Ms. Bannon&#146;s
failure to give notice as required by s. 284(5) was a bar and the
action must be dismissed. I will address the two issues on which
I agree with Kozak J. before turning to the effect of Ms.
Bannon&#146;s failure to give notice as required by s. 284(5).</pre>
    <pre>The Finding of Gross Negligence
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Apart from the arguments arising out of Ms. Bannon&#146;s failure
to give notice, the City&#146;s liability turned on whether Ms. Bannon
had demonstrated that the City had not taken adequate steps to
clear the sidewalk, and that its failure to do so reached the
level of gross negligence.  I will not review the evidence.
Kozak J. did so in his reasons.  He accepted Ms. Bannon&#146;s
evidence that the sidewalk was snow-covered and icy.  He
concluded that the sidewalk had not been plowed or sanded for
about a month before the accident.  He held:
          </pre>
    <pre>           &#133; To ignore the sidewalk in this area for such an
	  extended period of time under the circumstances,
	  and given its usage, can only be considered to be
	  gross negligence on the part of the defendant.
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The City submits that Kozak J. failed to consider the
evidence that the City had a system in place to provide for
regular snow removal from sidewalks and that, according to that
system, the sidewalk on which Ms. Bannon fell would have been
adequately serviced.  In essence, the City argues that evidence
of its system was sufficient to rebut any suggestion of gross
negligence, even though it had no direct or documentary evidence
indicating that the sidewalk had actually been cleared.
[8]  I would reject this argument.  Kozak J. reviewed the
evidence of the City&#146;s system.  He also observed, accurately,
that there was no testimony or documentary evidence indicating
that the sidewalk on which Ms. Bannon fell was actually cleared
in the month prior to the accident.  In the absence of any such
evidence, Kozak J. was not prepared to accept that the system
must have functioned as the City intended it to function.
[9]  The findings of fact made by Kozak J. are not unreasonable.
His reasons reveal no misapprehension of the evidence.  On those
findings, the conclusion that the City was grossly negligent
cannot be gainsaid.</pre>
    <pre>The request to admit
</pre>
    <pre>[10] Prior to trial, the City served Ms. Bannon with a request to
admit pursuant to Rule 51.02.  The request asked that she admit
the truth of the following facts:
          </pre>
    <pre>              1.  The facts and conclusions as set out 
	  in the report of Dr. Shulman dated April 21,
	  1998.
          </pre>
    <pre>               2.    The Plaintiff, Laura Bannon, was
          not impaired as to her cognitive abilities
          within the entire period of the first seven
          days after her slip and fall which occurred
          during the early morning hours of December
          29, 1995.
</pre>
    <pre>[11] The request was served more than 20 days prior to trial and
no response to the request was made by counsel for Ms. Bannon.
At the outset of the trial, counsel for the City took the
position that as Ms. Bannon had not responded to the request, she
must be taken under Rule 51.03 to be deemed to have admitted the
truth of the facts for the purpose of the trial.
[12] Counsel for Ms. Bannon acknowledged that no response to the
request had been made, but argued that the failure to respond was
not an admission and that counsel for the City knew full well
that Ms. Bannon was not admitting the facts referred to in the
request. With the agreement of counsel, Kozak J. reserved his
ruling until the end of the trial.
[13] At the end of the trial, Kozak J. ruled that it had been
made clear during the discovery process that Ms. Bannon&#146;s
capacity to give the requisite notice within seven days was very
much in dispute.  He declined to hold that Ms. Bannon&#146;s failure
to respond to the request to admit constituted a deemed admission
of the facts set out in the request.
[14] Paragraph 1 of the request refers to &#147;the facts and
conclusions&#148; set out in an expert&#146;s report prepared for the City.
I have considerable doubt whether paragraph 1 of the request is
sufficiently precise to constitute a request to admit facts under
Rule 51.02.  I need not, however, come to any firm conclusion on
this issue.
[15] Rule 51.05 provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>An admission made in response to a request to admit, a
deemed admission under rule 51.03 or an admission in a 
pleading may be withdrawn on consent or with leave of 
the court.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[16] Although Kozak J. did not speak in terms of granting leave
to Ms. Bannon to withdraw a deemed admission, I am satisfied that
his ruling was to the same effect.  It was clear at the outset of
the trial that Ms. Bannon was not admitting the truth of the
facts in the request, particularly those relating to her mental
state in the seven days following the accident.  Indeed, her
mental state in the days following the accident was a central
issue at the trial.  Counsel for the City did not suggest that
the City was taken by surprise by her position at trial or that
he relied on the deemed admissions in his preparation for trial.
He did not suggest that the City was in any way prejudiced by not
holding Ms. Bannon to her deemed admissions.  In those
circumstances, it would have been entirely appropriate for Kozak
J. to grant leave to withdraw the deemed admission.
[17] While, technically speaking, Kozak J. may have erred in
holding that Ms. Bannon was not deemed to have admitted the truth
of the facts in the request, that error was of no significance as
I am satisfied that had he held that she was deemed to have
admitted the truth of the facts, he would also have exercised his
discretion under Rule 51.05 and allowed her to withdraw that
deemed admission.</pre>
    <pre>The failure to give notice under s. 284(5) of the Act
</pre>
    <pre>[18] A person who is injured in a fall on an icy municipal
sidewalk must move very quickly to preserve his or her rights
against the municipality.  The injured party must give written
notice of the claim and injury complained of to the municipality
within seven days of the accident.  The injured party must also
commence an action within three months from the time when the
damages were sustained.  The relevant provisions of the Act are
set out below:
          </pre>
    <pre>           284(1)   Every highway and every bridge shall
	  be kept in repair by the corporation the council
	  of which has jurisdiction over it or upon which
	  the duty of repairing it is imposed by this
          Act and, in case of default, the corporation,
	  subject to the Negligence Act, is liable for all
	  damages sustained by any person by reason of such
	  default.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  No action shall be brought against
          a corporation for the recovery of damages
          occasioned by such default, whether the want
          of repair was the result of nonfeasance or
          misfeasance, after the expiration of three
          months from the time when the damages were
          sustained.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (5)  No action shall be brought for the
          recovery of the damages mentioned in
          subsection (1) unless notice in writing of
          the claim and of the injury complained of has
          been served upon or sent by registered mail
          to the head or the clerk of the corporation,
          in the case of a county or township within
          ten days, and in the case of an urban
          municipality within seven days, after the
          happening of the injury, nor unless, where
          the claim is against two or more corporations
          jointly liable for the repair of the highway
          or bridge, the prescribed notice was given to
          each of them within the prescribed time.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (6)  In the case of the death of the
          person injured, failure to give notice is not
          a bar to the action and, except where the
          injury was caused by snow or ice upon a
          sidewalk, failure to give or insufficiency of
          the notice is not a bar to the action, if the
          court or judge before whom the action is
          tried is of the opinion that the corporation
          in its defence was not prejudiced by the want
          or insufficiency of the notice and that to
          bar the action would be an injustice, even if
          reasonable excuse for the want or
          insufficiency of the notice is not
          established.  [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[19] Ms. Bannon did not give notice to the City within seven
days.  Although no notice was filed at trial, it would appear
that notice was given on January 16, 1996 after Ms. Bannon&#146;s
brother consulted a lawyer.  The action was commenced on February
28, 1996, well within the three month limitation period set out
in s. 284(2) of the Act.
[20] Kozak J., relying on Filip v. Waterloo (City) (1992), 98
D.L.R. (4th) 534 (Ont. C.A.), held that failure to give notice
did not bar the action if the injured party was physically and
mentally incapable of giving the required notice.  He said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Upon reviewing all of the evidence concerning the 
treatment and condition during the plaintiff&#146;s first 
seven days at the hospital it is the finding of this 
court that the plaintiff was physically and mentally 
incapable of complying with the notice requirements 
imposed under section 284(5) and the herein action
is therefore not statute barred.  The defendant is hereby
estopped from relying on the said section.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21] On appeal, counsel for the City accepts that in extreme
cases (eg., a coma), incapacity will exempt a plaintiff from
complying with the notice requirement.  The City contends that
Ms. Bannon&#146;s condition did not approach the level of incapacity
required by this narrow exception to the notice requirement.  It
further argues that the trial judge&#146;s finding of incapacity was
based on a misappreciation of relevant evidence and a failure to
consider other relevant evidence.
[22] The notice requirement in s. 284(5) is not, strictly
speaking, a limitation period.  The limitation period (three
months) is found in s. 284(2) of the Act.  The notice requirement
is, however, akin to a limitation period in that failure to
comply with the section constitutes a bar to the action just as
failure to commence the action within the limitation period
constitutes a bar.  The notice requirement also promotes the same
interests served by limitation periods.  It prompts the plaintiff
to pursue the claim diligently, affords the defendant an
opportunity to make timely investigation of the incident giving
rise to the action and allows the defendant to proceed with its
affairs secure in the knowledge that it will not face claims for
which notice was not given as required by the statute:  see
Peixeiro v. Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549 at 562-64.  A statutory
provision requiring notice of a claim has been aptly described as
&#147;a limitation period within a limitation period.&#148;2
[23] Based on the statutory framework, I think that ss. 284(2)
and (5) should be read together as constituting the applicable
limitation period.  Read together, they establish the period
within which Ms. Bannon&#146;s action against the City had to be
commenced.  The first step, the giving of notice, had to be taken
within seven days, and the second step, the formal commencement
of the action, had to be taken within 3 months.  In effect, s.
284(5) of the Act imposed a seven-day limitation on the
commencement of Ms. Bannon&#146;s action.
[24] Limitation periods are creatures of statute.  Short
limitation periods evince a legislative intention to vigorously
promote those interests associated with the creation of
limitation periods, even at the expense of denying recovery to
plaintiffs who have valid claims and have moved with reasonable
dispatch to prosecute those claims.  The Supreme Court of Canada
has, however, made it clear in a number of recent decisions that
when interpreting statutory provisions which create limitation
periods, even short ones, the court cannot ignore the legitimate
interests of potential plaintiffs:  M.(K.) v. M.(H.), [1992] 3
S.C.R. 6;  Murphy v. Welsh, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 1069;  Peixeiro v.
Haberman, supra;  Novak v. Bond (1999), 172 D.L.R. (4th) 385
(S.C.C.).  Most recently, in Novak v. Bond, supra, at 409,
McLachlin J. said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Contemporary limitations statutes thus seek to balance
conventional rationales oriented towards the protection 
of the defendant &#150; certainty, evidentiary, and diligence 
&#150; with the need to treat plaintiffs fairly, having regard 
to their specific circumstances.  As Major J. put it in 
Murphy, supra, &#145;a limitations scheme must attempt to 
balance the interests of both sides&#146; &#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[25] The need to &#147;balance the interests of both sides&#148; has led
the court to impose a reasonable discoverability requirement on
the running of limitation periods, Novak v. Bond, supra, at 409,
and to hold that the plaintiff&#146;s legal incapacity, apart from any
statutory enactment, postpones the operation of a limitation
period:  Peixeiro v. Haberman, supra, at 565-66; Sparham-Souter
v. Town and Country Developments (Essex) Ltd., [1976] Q.B. 858 at
867 (C.A.).
[26] The Legislature has also recognized the unfairness of
running a limitation period against a plaintiff who is incapable
of commencing an action.  Section 47 of the Limitations Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Where a person entitled to bring an action mentioned in
section 45 or 46 is at the time the cause of action accrues 
a minor, mental defective, mental incompetent or of unsound 
mind, the period within which the action may be brought 
shall be reckoned from the date when such person became of 
full age or of sound mind.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27] Section 47 speaks to incapacity flowing from age or, broadly
speaking, mental infirmity.  The section is triggered if the
incapacity exists when the cause of action accrues3 and it delays
the operation of the period within which the action may be
brought until the plaintiff is no longer a minor and is of &#147;sound
mind.&#148;  The notice requirement in s. 284(5) is a prerequisite to
the commencement of an action like this one.  As indicated above,
its effect is to impose a limitation on the period within which
an action can be commenced.  In my view, if s. 47 applies, it
serves to delay the running of the seven-day period if the
plaintiff is a minor or is of unsound mind at the time the cause
of action accrued.
[28] The applicability of s. 47 to limitation periods not found
in the Limitations Act was at one time a matter of some debate.
In Papamonolopoulos v. Board of Education for the City of Toronto
(1986), 56 O.R. (2d) 1 at 9 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.
refused (1987), 58 O.R. (2d) 528, this Court settled that
controversy and held that s. 47 applied to limitation periods
found in other statutes unless clear wording in the other statute
precludes the application of s. 47:  see also, Murphy v. Welsh,
supra, at p. 1078-81.
[29] Section 47 has been held to apply to the three-month
limitation period in s. 284(2) of the Act:  Bisoukis v. Brampton
(City) (1999), 180 D.L.R. (4th) 577 (Ont. C.A.) at pp. 590-91,
application for leave to appeal filed February 4, 2000.  It would
be anomalous if s. 47 did not also apply to the notice
requirement in s. 284(5) of the Act.  If s. 47 did not apply to
the notice provision, persons who were excused on account of
incapacity from commencing their action within the three-month
limitation period could still find their action barred by failure
to give notice even if, as would usually be the case, it was the
same incapacity that rendered them incapable of giving notice.
[30] I find nothing in the language of ss. 284(5) or (6) which
precludes the application of s. 47 of the Limitations Act to the
notice requirement in s. 284(5).  Section 284(6) speaks to two
specific circumstances in which failure to give notice is not a
bar to an action under s. 284.  Only one of those exceptions
(death) applies to actions resulting from a slip and fall on an
icy sidewalk.  Neither exception in s. 284(6) addresses the
capacity of the injured party to give the appropriate notice.
There is nothing inconsistent between a statutory provision which
exempts a party from giving notice in specified circumstances
(death, absence of prejudice to the municipality) and the more
general language of s. 47 which delays the running of a
limitation period while a person is incapable on account of age
or mental infirmity of commencing the action.  I would hold that
s. 47 applies to the notice requirement in s. 284(5).
[31] It was Ms. Bannon&#146;s position that her pain and the high
doses of pain medication she was receiving combined to render her
incapable of turning her mind to the need to protect her legal
interests connected to the accident, and incapable of taking the
steps necessary to protect those interests.  Put in the rather
archaic language of s. 47 of the Limitations Act, Ms. Bannon
argued that she was of &#147;unsound mind&#148; from the time of the
accident until several days after the accident.  If she was of
unsound mind, s. 47 delayed the running of the seven-day notice
period until she became of sound mind.
[32] The meaning to be given to the phrase &#147;unsound mind&#148; in s.
47 of the Limitations Act was considered recently by this court
in Bisoukis v. Brampton (City), supra.  Borins J.A. said, at pp.
593-94:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; a person is of unsound mind within the meaning of s. 47
when he or she, by reason of mental illness, is incapable 
of managing his or her affairs as a reasonable person 
would do in relation to the incident, or event, which 
entitles the person to bring an action.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[33] Bisoukis was a case in which the plaintiff alleged that she
was severely depressed as a result of her accident and was,
therefore, incapable of commencing the action.  Borins J.A.,
understandably, spoke in terms of mental illness.  I think,
however, the same approach should be applied where the alleged
mental incapacity is attributable to some other cause such as
trauma or medication.  It is the fact of incapacity and not the
cause of that incapacity which triggers s. 47.
[34] The standard set by s. 47 for establishing that a person is
of &#147;unsound mind&#148; is a high one.  A plaintiff must demonstrate
incapacity.  A debilitating condition short of incapacity cannot
be relied on even though it makes compliance with a notice
requirement or a limitation period more difficult.  Nor can s. 47
be approached by asking whether the plaintiff, given his or her
condition, could reasonably have been expected to give notice
within the required time.  While it might be eminently reasonable
to conclude that an injured plaintiff was preoccupied with
matters other than serving notice to the City within seven days
of an accident, that preoccupation cannot be equated with
incapacity for the purposes of s. 47 of the Limitations Act.
Finally, one must also distinguish between incapacity and a
simple failure to address one&#146;s mind to the steps, if any, which
should be taken to protect one&#146;s legal interests after an
accident.  Again, it is understandable that an injured person
would be primarily concerned with his or her immediate well-being
in the days following an accident and not with commencing legal
action.  Although understandable, a failure to advert to the need
to take steps to preserve one&#146;s rights does not constitute
incapacity.
[35] In this case, the operation of the seven-day notice period
could be delayed only if Ms. Bannon showed that she was incapable
of taking the necessary steps required to give notice to the
City.  Applying the test set out in Bisoukis v. Brampton, supra,
I would hold that a person is capable of managing his or her
affairs as a reasonable person would if that person is:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  capable of considering whether steps should be taken to
  protect any claim he or she might have arising out of the
  accident;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  capable of making, or directing others to make, the
  appropriate inquiries to determine what steps, if any, should be
  taken to protect those interests;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  capable of understanding any advice that might be received
  as a result of those inquiries;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  capable of effectively directing that procedural steps
  required by the Act be taken following receipt of that advice.
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[36] In my view, unless a person can demonstrate that his or her
mental condition was such that he or she lacked one or more of
the capacities described above, it cannot be said that the person
was of unsound mind so as to delay the operation of the notice
requirement in s. 284(5) of the Act.
[37] Ms. Bannon gave notice on January 16, 1996.  If she was
mentally incapable of giving notice prior to January 10, 1996,
she complied with the notice requirement by giving notice on
January 16th.  However, if she had the requisite capacity at any
time on or before January 9th, her notice was not timely, her
action was barred, and the trial judge had no power to relieve
her of the obligation of giving notice.
[38] As indicated earlier in these reasons, Kozak J. found that
Ms. Bannon was &#147;physically and mentally incapable&#148; of complying
with the notice requirement.  He said that this incapacity
&#147;estopped&#148; the City from relying on the notice requirement.
Kozak J. did not refer to s. 47 of the Limitations Act.  He
appeared to have regarded mental incapacity as a judge-made
exception to the notice requirement.
[39] Kozak J. also addressed the question of Ms. Bannon&#146;s
capacity exclusively by reference to her condition in the seven
days immediately following the accident.  He failed to consider,
as the closing words of s. 47 required him to do, whether, even
if Ms. Bannon lacked the requisite capacity during the first
seven days following the accident, she had the necessary capacity
on January 6, 7, 8 or 9.  This distinction is potentially
significant.  Ms. Bannon&#146;s condition was improving throughout her
stay in the hospital.  She was switched to a less potent pain
medication on January 9th and she was transferred to a
convalescent hospital on January 11th.  On the evidence adduced
in this case, even if Ms. Bannon was incapable of giving notice
in the first seven days, it does not follow that she was also
incapable of giving notice in the next 4 days.  Consequently,
even if Kozak J.&#146;s finding of incapacity is sustained on appeal,
it leaves unanswered the question of whether Ms. Bannon gave
timely notice.  Were I to hold that this court should not
interfere with Kozak J.&#146;s finding that she was incapable of
giving notice during the first seven days, I would still allow
the appeal to the extent of directing a new trial on the issue of
whether, considering the operation of s. 47 of the Limitations
Act, Ms. Bannon gave timely notice to the City.
[40] Counsel for the City does, however, challenge the finding
that Ms. Bannon was incapable of giving notice during the seven
days following the accident.  In doing so, he acknowledges the
deference owed by this court to a finding of fact made at trial,
but contends that this is one of those relatively rare cases
where the trial judge&#146;s reasons reveal error which warrant
reversal of a finding of fact.
[41] Kozak J. did not have the benefit of this court&#146;s judgment
in Bisoukis v. Brampton (City), supra, and did not expressly set
out the standard he applied in determining whether Ms. Bannon was
capable of giving notice.  It is clear, however, from a reading
of the entirety of the reasons, that he applied a standard which
required actual incapacity on account of physical and mental
condition.  I think the approach taken by Kozak J. was consistent
with that adopted by this court in Bisoukis v. Brampton (City),
supra.
[42] Although I am satisfied that Kozak J. applied the proper
test, the evidence cannot support the finding that Ms. Bannon was
incapable of giving notice during the seven days following the
accident.  I will first review the pertinent evidence and then
return to the reasons of Kozak J.
[43] Ms. Bannon was in a great deal of pain when she arrived at
the hospital on December 29, 1995.  A broken femur is one of the
most painful injuries a person can suffer.  She received Morphine
intravenously while awaiting surgery.  Dr. Remus operated on Ms.
Bannon&#146;s leg at about 10:00 p.m. on December 29th.  He ordered
that she receive 15 to 20 mg. of Morphine by injection every 4
hours as needed postoperatively.   That order remained in effect
until the early evening of December 31, 1995 when Dr. Remus
changed Ms. Bannon&#146;s pain medication to a drug called Percocet.
She was to receive 1 tablet of Percocet every 3 to 4 hours as
needed.  She received 4 tablets a day between December 31st and
January 8th.  On January 9th, her medication was changed to a
drug called Leritine, a pain analgesic which was less potent than
Percocet, but more potent than Tylenol 3.
[44] The level of Morphine administered to Ms. Bannon up to
December 31st was at the high end of the acceptable range for a
patient in Ms. Bannon&#146;s position.  Typically, patients receiving
the level of Morphine administered to Ms. Bannon would be
extremely relaxed and drowsy.  Their activities would be limited
to sitting up in bed and eating their meals with some help.  They
would be inclined to dose off.
[45] While Morphine taken in the quantities administered to Ms.
Bannon would impair cognitive functions to some degree, the
extent of that impairment would vary from person to person.  In
extreme cases, a condition known as delirium may develop.
Delirium is described as an acute confused stage.  A patient in a
state of delirium becomes confused and lacks a clear awareness of
his or her environment.  The patient cannot follow a
conversation, is easily distracted and sometimes becomes
extremely agitated.
[46] Percocet is also an opiate and an analgesic.  While less
potent than Morphine, it is a strong drug and can impair a
person&#146;s cognitive functioning.  As with Morphine, the effect of
Percocet varies from individual to individual.
[47] Dr. Remus, who operated on Ms. Bannon, testified for her.
He had no independent recollection of her condition following
surgery and had to rely entirely on his notes.  He was asked
about the effect of the narcotics given to Ms. Bannon on her
ability to address issues such as any claim she might have
against the City.  He testified that patients&#146; responses to
Morphine and Percocet &#147;vary dramatically&#148; and that he would want
to look at the hospital record and, in particular, the nurse&#146;s
notes for indications of how Ms. Bannon reacted to those
narcotics.  Dr. Remus was specifically asked whether he could say
how Ms. Bannon reacted to the Percocet and whether it had any
effect on her cognitive functioning.  He responded:
          </pre>
    <pre>     No I can&#146;t tell you.  I would have to rely on the nurse&#146;s
     notes.
</pre>
    <pre>[48] As I read his evidence, Dr. Remus never did look at the
nurses&#146; notes.  The City introduced those records as part of its
case.
[49] Dr. Remus was also asked about Ms. Bannon&#146;s ability to
contemplate legal action.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I &#150; all I can sort of say, I wasn&#146;t aware
	  that there was anything &#150; she never spoke to me
	  about it so I really wasn&#146;t aware that there was
	  anything &#150; anything going on at that stage &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               In other words, she didn&#146;t mention to me
          that she was contemplating any action or
          asked my advice or anything like that so &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; I wouldn&#146;t have thought that for about
          &#150; for about a week that she would with that
          type of trauma.  A fractured &#150; a fractured
          femur is a significant trauma as compared to
          a broken wrist or a broken hand or a foot.
          Patients that I have seen depending on their
          age and their general health, I mean, some
          people are bedridden for a week and some are
          longer of course in more elderly patients so
          &#150; I would sort of think that after a week she
          may.  Certainly for the first three, four,
          five days I don&#146;t think so.  I think she was
          - - she wasn&#146;t doing very much of anything
          other than taking medication for pain relief.
          [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[50] This answer would not permit the finding that Ms. Bannon was
incapable on account of the medication and her pain of providing
the necessary notice throughout the seven days following the
accident.  Counsel for Ms. Bannon, without objection, then
referred the doctor to a letter he had provided to counsel prior
to trial in which he said that Ms. Bannon was not able to give
notice to the City within the first seven days of her accident.
The following exchange between Dr. Remus and counsel for Ms.
Bannon followed:
          </pre>
    <pre>           Q.   And it&#146;s also your evidence that due to the 
	  type of injury, meaning the femur is bust because
	  of the trauma associated with that and the amount
	  of medication, that it&#146;s simply not feasible that
	  she would have been in a position to instruct
 	  Counsel to commence an action?
          </pre>
    <pre>           A.   Within a certain period of time?
          </pre>
    <pre>           Q.   Within seven days.
          </pre>
    <pre>           A.   I would have thought that with the
          amount of medication and the type of trauma
          that she had that it would probably be
          improbable.
          </pre>
    <pre>           Q.   So as per your letter dated July,
          it&#146;s not possible that she should &#150; that she
          could have instructed Counsel.  Correct?
          </pre>
    <pre>           A.   I&#146;m sorry.  Within the seven days?
          </pre>
    <pre>           Q.   Right.
          </pre>
    <pre>           A.   I would have thought that it was
          unlikely.
          </pre>
    <pre>           [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[51] In cross-examination, counsel for the City chose to focus on
Ms. Bannon&#146;s mental state after she started to take Percocet (the
evening of December 31st).  He suggested to Dr. Remus that it was
entirely possible that Ms. Bannon would be perfectly capable of
functioning from a cognitive point of view while taking Percocet.
Dr. Remus replied that Ms. Bannon&#146;s level of cognitive
functioning would depend on how much relief she was getting for
her pain.  He said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>-- I don&#146;t know what her response is.  I would actually, 
you know, have to sort of take a look at the nurse&#146;s notes.  
Persons having Percocet every three or four hours I don&#146;t 
&#150; I don&#146;t think that they can carry on a &#150; they can maybe 
give some instructions but I mean it&#146;s how much, what 
degree of instructions they can give and I don&#146;t &#150; I 
can&#146;t &#150; I don&#146;t even want to comment on that.  [Emphasis 
added.]
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[52] After counsel had completed their questioning, Kozak J.
questioned Dr. Remus and focussed directly on the crucial issue:
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:    The issue that we are dealing 
	  with at this particular point in time is given
	  the nature of the injury that took place,
	  given the hospitalization that ensued, given
	  the medication that was prescribed, what this
	  Court has to ascertain is whether or not under
	  those circumstances she had the ability to
	  rationalize the type of situation where someone
	  who felt that she may or was wronged would have
	  the ability to weigh those circumstances and
	  make some contact from her hospital room
          whether it be to members of the family or to a
	  lawyer to say, hey look, I feel I have been
 	  wronged, I want somebody to tell me whether or
 	  not I have got a cause of action.  Within that
	  time frame of seven days, given these
	  circumstances, this type of rationalize in your
	  view is it there or was it not?
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE WITNESS:   It is a very painful
          condition, Your Honour, and I think it varies
          from &#150; depending on the patients general
          health and also the age of the patient.  I
          would have thought that for the first five
          days, six days, seven days it&#146;s a very
          painful condition.  When you give &#150; when you
          give analgesics like Morphine it deadens the
          pain but a lot of cases what it does is it
          sort of deadens the effect of the individual
          so I think we are looking at a number of
          conditions.  We&#146;re looking at conditions
          where also the patient is extremely concerned
          about herself.  So we have pain and concern
          about her future. I think &#150; so there&#146;s lots
          of questions that a patient brings up.  The
          first five days, I don&#146;t think so.  I mean
          I&#146;ve seen people that they won&#146;t even move
          from bed and all they do is they get pain
          medication up to a week.  I think after a
          week I don&#146;t think there&#146;s a problem, Your
          Honour, but I think the real thing is that up
          to five days you don&#146;t do anything.  It&#146;s
          just too painful.  I can&#146;t imagine a person
          getting up and running to a phone with that
          injury.  Now, if it was a fractured wrist or
          a fractured hand or a foot or something like
          that it&#146;s different but, I mean, this is &#150;
          this is one of the most painful bones that
          could be broken and one of the more serious
          surgical procedures that you perform, one of
          the more prolonged ones and one of the
          procedures that takes the longest to get
          better.  So as I sort of said, it&#146;s a
          difficult thing to respond to.  I would sort
          of say that for the first five or six days
          that a person doesn&#146;t do anything very much
          but that&#146;s why I find it hard to believe that
          within three or four days you would be
          picking up the phone and sort of phoning a
          lawyer.  I don&#146;t -- I don&#146;t think so.  It&#146;s
          just too &#150; it&#146;s too much pain and discomfort.
          [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[53] Dr. Remus&#146; evidence is of limited value.  He acknowledged
that patients&#146; reactions to strong analgesics vary widely.  He
had no independent recollection of Ms. Bannon and did not refer
to the very documents which he said would assist him in
determining how Ms. Bannon reacted to the drugs she received.
Even setting aside those limitations, I do not read Dr. Remus&#146;
evidence as supporting the conclusion that Ms. Bannon was
incapable of giving the requisite notice for the entire seven
days following the accident.
[54] Ms. Bannon also relied on the evidence of her brother,
Gordon McPherson.  He testified that he visited Ms. Bannon in the
hospital about a week to ten days after the accident.  She told
him that she had slipped on the sidewalk and broken her leg.  She
recalled the street on which the accident occurred.  Mr.
McPherson told his sister that she should talk to a lawyer to see
if the City was liable for her injuries.  According to Mr.
McPherson, his sister was in considerable pain and did not seem
to understand what he was saying to her.  Mr. McPherson said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; it took her a few minutes to sink in to actually what I
actually said.  I told her that I&#146;d contact my attorney which I
did and my attorney advised me to contact your firm which I
contacted Mr. Watkins and I explained the situation.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[55] Ms. Bannon testified that the conversation with her brother
was some time later than seven to 10 days after the accident.4
She recalled that her brother mentioned to her that she should
sue the City.  Ms. Bannon asked him how she should go about doing
that and her brother told her that he would get a lawyer for her.
[56] Ms. Bannon testified that she had little recollection of
what happened or what she did while she was in the hospital.  She
said that she was in a great deal of pain and was &#147;still in my
own little world.&#148;  She did recall several visits from members of
her family in the days following the accident.  She recalled
telling them what had happened to her, but did not discuss the
possibility of suing the City with any of her relatives.
According to her, she was not alert and she felt groggy.
[57] Ms. Bannon also testified that she could not recall what
effect the Percocet had on her.  In her examination-for-discovery
conducted shortly before the trial, she had told counsel that
Percocet had no effect on her.
[58] Ms. Bannon&#146;s cross-examination concluded with the following
questions and answers:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Isn&#146;t it true, Mrs. Bannon, that the
	  reason why you had not given notice to the City
	  of your slip and fall until January 16, 1996,
	  was that you simply hadn&#146;t put your mind to it?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I didn&#146;t put my mind to it because
          I was too busy trying to get myself better.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Had you known that you were
          required to give notice to the City within
          seven days of your slip and fall, isn&#146;t it
          true that you could have given that notice
          had you known?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   If I had known about it, yes.
         </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   You certainly could have told your
          brother-in-law, your son or your daughter to
          give notice to the City of your slip and fall
          had you thought about it?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   No. I wouldn&#146;t have thought about
          it because it never occurred to me to think
          about it.  My mind was not there.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   If you had known that you had to
          give notice to the City within seven days of
          your slip and fall you could have asked your
          son or your daughter or your brother-in-law
          to give that notice to the City, could you
          not have?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I didn&#146;t know nothing about it.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   But if you had known?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   If I had known I probably would have.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And you could have?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   Yah.
</pre>
    <pre>[59] These answers strongly suggest that Ms. Bannon simply did
not turn her mind to what steps, if any, she should take to
preserve her claim against the City.
[60] The City called Dr. Shulman, a psychiatrist with expertise
in the effects of narcotics. He had never seen Ms. Bannon and his
evidence was of limited assistance.  He did, however, testify
that he had reviewed the hospital records and that those records
gave no indication that Ms. Bannon ever suffered from delirium.
He also testified that a person like Ms. Bannon, who had taken
significant amounts of Tylenol for a long period of time,5 would
develop a limited tolerance to Morphine and Percocet.  The effect
of those drugs on a person who had developed that tolerance would
be somewhat diminished.
[61] The City also called Mr. Lepinsky, one of the nurses who had
attended to Ms. Bannon while she was in the hospital.  Mr.
Lepinsky could not recall Ms. Bannon.  Counsel took Mr. Lepinsky
through the hospital records which contained various references
to Ms. Bannon&#146;s neurological, psychological and emotional
condition while in the hospital.  None of the references
suggested that she was disoriented, confused or unresponsive.
Mr. Lepinsky indicated that there were several places in the
records where one would expect the nurses to make the appropriate
notation had they observed any confusion, unresponsiveness or
disorientation.
[62] Mr. Lepinsky also testified that if a patient who was
receiving Morphine or Percocet appeared to be constantly groggy,
difficult to arouse, or was having problems speaking properly,
the nursing staff would consult with the treating physician
before continuing the medication.  There was nothing in the
hospital records to suggest that Ms. Bannon manifested these
symptoms or that her treating physician was ever consulted about
the level of her pain medication.
[63] According to the hospital chart, Ms. Bannon remained in bed
until December 31st.  On December 31st she sat up in a chair with
assistance.  Between January 1st and 7th, she was up and moving
about with assistance.  A note from the physiotherapist indicated
that on January 3rd, she was out of bed and using a walker
without assistance.  By January 7th, Ms. Bannon was up and moving
about without assistance.
[64] The hospital records are not determinative of Ms. Bannon&#146;s
capacity to give the requisite notice.  Their value lies in what
they do not reveal.  There is nothing in those records to support
Ms. Bannon&#146;s claim that she was incapable of giving the requisite
notice.  Ms. Bannon, of course, had the onus on this issue.
[65] I return now to the trial judge&#146;s reasons.  In concluding
that Ms. Bannon was incapable of giving notice, the trial judge
relied on the following findings:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Ms. Bannon had a &#147;low tolerance&#148; for Morphine and Percocet;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Ms. Bannon was &#147;virtually unconscious&#148; for the first 3 to 5
  days following the accident;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Even after Ms. Bannon began taking Percocet, she was in &#147;a
  state of extreme drowsiness in which all she wanted to do is
  sleep&#148;;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Her brother, Mr. McPherson, found her to be &#147;in an improper
  mental state to seek legal counsel because of the effects of her
  trauma and medication&#148;.
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[66] The finding that Ms. Bannon had a low tolerance for Morphine
and Percocet is not only unsupported by the evidence, but is
contrary to the only evidence given on the issue.  As a regular
user of Tylenol, she may have developed some tolerance to the
drugs.
[67] The finding that Ms. Bannon was virtually unconscious for
the first 3 to 5 days is not supported by the evidence.  She was
receiving visitors, eating, getting up to go to the bathroom and
was also out of bed and moving around with some assistance by
January 1st.
[68] The finding that Ms. Bannon was extremely drowsy and only
wanted to sleep after her medication was changed to Percocet is
also an unreasonable finding.  The only evidence which offers any
support for that conclusion is the evidence of Ms. Bannon.  In my
view, however, it is unreasonable to rely on that evidence given
her testimony that she could not recall what effect, if any,
Percocet had on her and her evidence on her examination-for-
discovery that Percocet had no effect on her.
[69] Finally, the finding that Mr. McPherson concluded that the
plaintiff was in an improper mental state to seek legal advice
stretches his evidence beyond reasonable bounds.  Mr. McPherson
said only that it took his sister a few minutes to appreciate
what he had said to her.  On her own evidence, she appreciated
what her brother was saying as demonstrated by her inquiry as to
how she would go about suing the City.
[70] I am driven to the conclusion that the findings made by
Kozak J. on which his conclusion that Ms. Bannon was incapable of
giving notice is based, are contrary to or not supported by the
evidence.  My review of the evidence leads me to these
conclusions:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  Dr. Remus&#146; evidence could not support the finding that Ms.
  Bannon was incapable of giving the requisite notice.  At its
  highest, it could support that finding for the first five days
  following the accident.  Even then, it is speculative.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The hospital records provide no support for Ms. Bannon&#146;s
  position.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Ms. Bannon&#146;s evidence is not particularly helpful, and it is
  manifestly unreliable as it relates to the effect of Percocet on
  her.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Mr. McPherson&#146;s evidence demonstrates that Ms. Bannon had
  some difficulty in comprehending the need to seek legal advice,
  but does not establish incapacity.
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[71] I would hold that Ms. Bannon failed to discharge the onus of
demonstrating that she was incapable, on account of her mental
condition, of giving the requisite notice.  It follows that her
action was barred.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion:
</pre>
    <pre>[72] I must conclude that Ms. Bannon&#146;s action should be
dismissed.  This result is most unsatisfactory.  It would be
unreasonable to expect Ms. Bannon to have acted any sooner than
she did.  Nor is there any reason to believe that the City would
have been in a better position to defend against the action had
it received notice 10 days earlier than it did.  Unfortunately,
as the law now stands, Ms. Bannon had the misfortune of falling
on an icy  sidewalk and the City is therefore able to avoid the
consequence of its gross negligence by reliance on a notice
requirement which can only be described as draconian.  This court
has called for legislative action to prevent injustices caused by
notice provisions like that found in s. 284(5) of the Act:  eg.
see Filip v. Waterloo, supra, at p. 540.  At a bare minimum, a
person who finds him or herself in the position of Ms. Bannon
should have access to the limited exception to the notice
requirement available in s. 284(6) to those whose injury is not
caused by snow or ice on a sidewalk.
[73] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of Kozak
J., and order that the action be dismissed.  I would not reward
the City&#146;s gross negligence by ordering costs against Ms. Bannon.
I would direct that there be no costs either at trial or on
appeal.

3 For the purposes of s. 47, a cause of action does not accrue
the moment the plaintiff suffers the injury, but rather on the
day of that injury.  Incapacity within the meaning of s. 47 on
the day of the accident is sufficient:  Kaszyk v. Kloetstra and
Flug, [1976] 5 W.W.R. 205 at 207-209 (Alta. C.A.).  If Ms. Bannon
was incapacitated, her incapacity began on the day of the
accident.  I need not consider the effect of incapacity which
arises after the day of the accident but during the seven day
notice period.

McPherson with respect to the timing of the conversation.
