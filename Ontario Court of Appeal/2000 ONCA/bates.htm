    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of O&#146;Connell J. dated February 11, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LASKIN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  After the new Federal Child Support Guidelines1 (&#147;the
Guidelines&#148;) came into effect, the respondent Elizabeth Bates
applied to vary her existing child support order to the table
amount under the Guidelines.  O&#146;Connell J. granted the order.
The appellant Paul Bates, the respondent&#146;s former husband,
appeals.
[2]
His appeal raises two important issues about the applicability of
the Guidelines to previous child support orders.  The main issue
is whether the coming into force of the Guidelines entitles
either spouse to vary a previous child support order to come
under the Guidelines regime or whether the court has discretion
to refuse to apply the Guidelines unless the spouse seeking a
variation establishes a material change in circumstances.  The
motions judge held that the mere coming into force of the
Guidelines is a change in circumstances entitling Ms. Bates to a
variation order complying with the Guidelines.  Although I agree
with the motions judge, this court subsequently decided otherwise
in Sherman v. Sherman (1999), 45 R.F.L. (4th) 424.  For reasons I
will discuss, I believe that Sherman was incorrectly decided and
recommend that its reasoning be reconsidered.  However, the
correctness of Sherman was not raised before us.  For this reason
and because of institutional considerations, I would apply
Sherman to this case.
[3]  The second issue is when does the court have discretion to
order an amount of child support that differs from the table
amount under the Guidelines.  In my view, such discretion is
strictly limited and clearly specified.  The court may depart
from the table amounts only under ss. 17(6.2) to 17(6.5) of the
Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.) as amended S.C. 1997,
c. 1,2 or under ss. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 or 10 of the Guidelines.
Section 4 of the Guidelines applies to high income payors like
Mr. Bates.  If the court considers the table amount
&#147;inappropriate&#148; under s. 4(b) it has discretion to order a
different amount.  Because of Sherman and because the
jurisprudence on the court&#146;s discretion under s. 4(b) of the
Guidelines changed between the hearing of the application and the
hearing of the appeal, I think the fair result is to order a new
hearing.  At the new hearing, Ms. Bates will have the opportunity
to establish a material change in circumstances and if she does,
Mr. Bates will have the opportunity to persuade the court that
the table amount under the Guidelines is inappropriate.</pre>
    <pre><strong>BACKGROUND FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[4]  Mr. and Ms. Bates are both lawyers working in downtown
Toronto law firms.  They were married in 1982, separated in the
fall of 1990, and divorced in 1993.  They have two daughters,
Sarah, age 15, and Elizabeth, who turned 11 shortly after the
appeal was argued.
[5]  In September 1993, O&#146;Connell J. issued a consent judgment in
accordance with minutes of settlement that resolved custody,
access and the contentious financial issues.  Ms. Bates was
awarded custody of the two children.  Mr. Bates was ordered to
pay child support of $2,600 per child per month.  That amount was
to be adjusted by the lesser of the increase in the Consumer
Price Index and the percentage increase in Mr. Bates&#146; income.
When the order was made in 1993 Mr. Bates&#146; gross income was
$233,750.  When the order under appeal was made in October 1998,
his 1997 income tax return showed an income of $543,596, and the
child support order had increased from $2,600 to $2,830.40 per
child per month.  That amount was taxable in Ms. Bates&#146; hands and
tax deductible by Mr. Bates.
[6]  The order under appeal was triggered by Ms. Bates&#146;
application to vary the existing child support order to accord
with the table amount under the Guidelines.  O&#146;Connell J. made
the order, based on Mr. Bates&#146; 1997 income, in the amount of
$2,927.20 per child per month.  Under the Guidelines and the
corresponding tax regime, that amount is not taxable in Ms.
Bates&#146; hands and is not tax deductible by Mr. Bates.
[7]  On the variation application before O&#146;Connell J., Ms. Bates
made no financial disclosure, refusing even to provide a copy of
her income tax return.  She should not be criticized for refusing
to disclose her income and expenses.  She did not ask for special
or extraordinary expenses under s. 7 of the Guidelines.  And, at
the time of her application, the understanding of the family bar
in Ontario, and indeed of trial judges, was that the mere coming
into force of the Guidelines was a change in circumstances
entitling either party to vary a previous child support order to
come under the new regime.
[8]  Mr. Bates, on the other hand, did file an affidavit giving
details of his own financial situation and some information
concerning Ms. Bates&#146; income and the children&#146;s expenses.  He
resisted the application to vary or at least sought an order
lower than the table amount under the Guidelines.  At the time,
however, high income paying spouses seeking an order for child
support less than the table amount faced the impediment of this
court&#146;s decision in Francis v. Baker (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 481,
which held that under s. 4(b) of the Guidelines a court could
only vary the table amount upwards.
[9]  By the time the appeal was argued before us two changes in
the law had occurred.  First, a panel of this court in Sherman,
in an endorsement, held that the coming into force of the
Guidelines was not a change in circumstances entitling a party
automatically to come under the new regime, but merely a
&#147;triggering mechanism&#148; to permit a review of the circumstances to
determine whether a variation was warranted under the test in
Willick v. Willick, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670.  Second, the Supreme
Court of Canada in Francis v. Baker, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 250,
overturned this court&#146;s interpretation of the word
&#147;inappropriate&#148; under s. 4(b) of the Guidelines and held that it
meant a court could vary the table amount upwards or downwards.
[10] Against these changes in the law, Mr. Bates submitted that
his appeal be allowed and Ms. Bates&#146; application for a variation
be dismissed because Ms. Bates had put forward no evidence to
establish a change in circumstances.  In response, Ms. Bates
sought leave before us to introduce, as fresh evidence, her
affidavit setting out her current income and expenses.  We
considered the fresh evidence and Ms. Tellier, counsel for
Ms. Bates, urged us to accept it, untested by cross-examination,
and dismiss the appeal.  Mr. Doran, on behalf of Mr. Bates,
reasonably submitted that the court could not dismiss the appeal
before at least giving him the opportunity to cross-examine
Ms. Bates on her affidavit, and, if appropriate, file reply
affidavit material.
[11] With this background I turn to what I consider are the two
issues on the appeal:  first, has Ms. Bates established a change
in circumstances entitling her to an order under the Guidelines;
and second, is Mr. Bates, nonetheless, entitled to a new hearing
on whether the table amount under the Guidelines is
inappropriate?</pre>
    <pre><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>First Issue - Has Ms. Bates established a change in circumstances
entitling her to vary the existing child support order to come
under the Guidelines?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[12] Sherman holds that the court has broad discretion to refuse
to vary a previous child support order to come under the
Guidelines unless the spouse seeking the variation establishes a
material change in circumstances.  Although Ms. Bates contended
that the fresh evidence she filed and we reviewed on appeal
showed a material change in circumstances, I think it would be
unwise and unfair to so decide without giving Mr. Bates an
opportunity to reply to this evidence and test it by cross-
examination.  Moreover, this court is ill-equipped to undertake
what would amount to a new assessment of the application for a
variation.  That assessment should be undertaken by the trial
court.  See Francis v. Baker; and Tauber v. Tauber, a judgment of
this court released June 12, 2000.  The appropriate order, in my
view, is to remit Ms. Bates&#146; application for a variation to the
trial court for a new hearing on a proper evidentiary record.
Consistent with that order I would dismiss Ms. Bates&#146; motion to
file fresh evidence on the appeal.
[13] Although that order would dispose of this appeal, I wish to
explain why I believe that Sherman was incorrectly decided and
therefore its reasoning should be reconsidered.  The underlying
debate raised by Sherman is whether the mere coming into force of
the Guidelines amounts to a change in circumstances entitling a
spouse to vary a previous child support order to comply with the
Guidelines, or whether the court retains an overriding discretion
not to vary a previous child support order unless the spouse has
shown a change in circumstances warranting a variation.
Provincial appellate courts have divided on this issue.  The
British Columbia Court of Appeal, in a series of cases beginning
with Wang v. Wang (1998), 39 R.F.L. (4th) 426, has held that the
courts maintain a discretion not to vary despite the coming into
force of the Guidelines.3  The panel in Sherman came to the same
view, as did the Alberta Court of Appeal in Laird v. Laird
(2000), 76 Alta. L.R. (3d) 1.  But the Saskatchewan Court of
Appeal reached the opposite conclusion in Dergousoff v.
Dergousoff (1999), 48 R.F.L. (4th) 1, rejecting the reasoning in
Wang and holding that the court has no discretion, but must vary
the previous order to comply with the Guidelines.  The New
Brunswick Court of Appeal in Parent v. Pelletier (1999), 1 R.F.L.
(5th) 66, [1999] N.B.J. No. 391 partly rejected the reasoning in
Wang and Sherman, holding that, though the court had a narrow
discretion not to apply the Guidelines, it could do so only where
varying the existing order would cause significant harm to the
child.
[14] This debate turns on the proper interpretation of the
relevant statutory and Guidelines provisions.  Those provisions
are ss. 17(1), 17(4), 17(6.1), 17(6.2), 17(6.3), 17(6.4) and
17(6.5) of the Divorce Act and ss. 1, 3(1), 4 and 14(c) of the
Guidelines.
[15] Section 17(1)(a) of the Act authorizes a court to make an
order varying a support order:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>17. (1)  A court of competent jurisdiction may 
make an order varying, rescinding or suspending, 
prospectively or retroactively,</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(a)  a support order or any provision thereof 
on application by either or both former spouses;</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[16] Section 17(4) states that before varying an order for child
support the court must be satisfied that a change in
circumstances as provided for in the Guidelines has occurred
since the last order:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>17.(4)    Before the court makes a variation order 
in respect of a child support order, the court shall 
satisfy itself that a change in circumstances as 
provided for in the applicable guidelines has 
occurred since the making of the child support order 
or the last variation order made in respect of that 
order.
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[17] Under s. 17(6.1) a court varying a child support order must
do so in accordance with the Guidelines:
          </pre>
    <pre>        17.(6.1)  A court making a variation order in respect 
	of a child support order shall do so in accordance
	with the applicable guidelines.
</pre>
    <pre>[18] Sections 17(6.2) to s. 17(6.5) address when a court, in
varying a child support order, may award an amount different from
the Guidelines amount:
          </pre>
    <pre>        17.(6.2)   Notwithstanding subsection (6.1), in making 
	a variation order in respect of  a child support order, 
	a court may award an amount that is different from the 
	amount that would be determined in accordance with the 
	applicable guidelines if the court is satisfied</pre>
    <pre>		(a)  that special provisions in an order, a 
		judgment or a written agreement respecting 
		the financial obligations of the spouses, or 
		the division or transfer of their property, 
		directly or indirectly benefit a child, or 
		that special provisions have otherwise been 
		made for the benefit of a child; and</pre>
    <pre>		(b)  that the application of the applicable 
		guidelines would result in an amount of child 
		support that is inequitable given those special
                provisions.</pre>
    <pre>	17.(6.3)   Where the court awards, pursuant to 
	subsection (6.2), an amount that is different from 
	the amount that would be determined in accordance with 
   	the applicable guidelines, the court shall record its 
	reasons for having done so.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>17.(6.4)   Notwithstanding subsection (6.1), a court 
may award an amount that is different from the amount 
that would be determined in accordance with the 
applicable guidelines on the consent of both spouses 
if it is satisfied that reasonable arrangements have 
been made for the support of the child to whom the 
order relates.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>17.(6.5)  For the purposes of subsection (6.4), in 
determining whether reasonable arrangements have been 
made for the support of a child, the court shall have 
regard to the applicable guidelines.  However, the
court shall not consider the arrangements to be 
unreasonable solely because the amount of support 
agreed to is not the same as the amount that would 
otherwise have been determined in accordance with the 
applicable guidelines.
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] Turning to the Guidelines, s. 1 sets out their four
objectives:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>1.  The objectives of these Guidelines are:</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(a)  to establish a fair standard of support for 
children that ensures that they continue to 
benefit from the financial means of both spouses 
after separation;</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(b)  to reduce conflict and tension between 
spouses by making the calculation of child support 
orders more objective;</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(c)  to improve the efficiency of the legal process 
by giving courts and spouses guidance in setting 
the levels of child support orders and encouraging
settlement; and</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(d)  to ensure consistent treatment of spouses and 
children who are in similar circumstances.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] Section 3(1) of the Guidelines provides a presumptive rule
for awarding the table amount:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>3.(1) Unless otherwise provided under these Guidelines,
the amount of a child support order for children under 
the age of majority is</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(a)  the amount set out in the applicable table, 
according to the number of children under the age of 
majority to whom the order relates and the income of 
the spouse against whom the order is sought; and</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(b)  the amount, if any, determined under section 7.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21] Section 4 permits the court to order an amount different
from the table amount if the paying spouse has an annual income
of over $150,000, as Mr. Bates does, and the court considers the
table amount to be inappropriate:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>4.  Where the income of the spouse against whom a 
child support order is sought is over $150,000, the 
amount of a child support order is</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(a)  the amount determined under section 3; or</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(b)  if the court considers that amount to be 
inappropriate,</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>(i)   in respect of the first $150,000 of 
the spouse's income, the amount set out in 
the applicable table for the number of 
children under the age of majority to whom 
the order relates;</pre>
            <pre>(ii)  in respect of the balance of the 
spouse's income, the amount that the court 
considers appropriate, having regard to the
condition, means, needs and other circumstances 
of the children who are entitled to support and 
the financial ability of each spouse to 
contribute to the support of the children; and</pre>
          </blockquote>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>                (iii) the amount, if any, determined under 
		section 7.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Section 14(c) provides that for the purpose of varying a
child support order made before May 1, 1997 under s.17(4) of the
Divorce Act, the coming into force of the Guidelines constitutes
a change of circumstances:</pre>
    <pre>	14.  For the purposes of subsection 17(4) of the Act, 
	any one of the following constitutes a change of 
	circumstances:</pre>
    <pre>        &#133;</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(c)  in the case of an order made before May 1, 
1997, the coming into force of section 15.1 of 
the Act, enacted by section 2 of chapter 1 of 
the Statutes of Canada, (1997).4</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[23] As with any question of statutory interpretation the court
should determine the meaning of these provisions in their total
context.  As Iacobucci J. wrote in Re Rizzo and Rizzo Shoes Ltd.
(1998), 154 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 204 (S.C.C.):</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133; Elmer Driedger in Construction of Statutes, 2nd ed.
(Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), best encapsulates the 
approach upon which I prefer to rely.  He recognizes 
that statutory interpretation cannot be founded on 
the wording of the legislation alone.  At p. 87 he 
states:</pre>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>Today there is only one principle or approach, 
namely, the words of an Act are to be read in 
their entire context and in their grammatical 
and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme 
of the Act, the object of the Act, and the 
intention of Parliament.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>The court should consider all relevant and admissible indicators
of legislative meaning.  The court&#146;s interpretation should comply
with the legislative text, promote the legislative purpose, and
produce a reasonable and just meaning.  See Driedger on the
Construction of Statutes, 3rd ed. by Ruth Sullivan (Toronto:
Butterworths, 1994) at p. 131 and Bapoo v. Cooperators General
Insurance Co. (1998), 36 O.R. (3d) 616 at 620-21 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[24] Applying these principles, in my view, the proper
interpretation of the provisions in question is that the coming
into force of the Guidelines amounts to a change in circumstances
entitling a spouse to vary a previous child support order to
comply with the Guidelines regime.  A court has discretion to
refuse to so vary only if the requirements of s. 17(6.2) to
17(6.5) of the Divorce Act are met.  All the indicators of
legislative meaning support this interpretation.  I rely on the
following six indicators.</pre>
    <pre>1)   The wording of the relevant provisions supports this
interpretation.  Under s. 17(1) of the Divorce Act a court may
vary a child support order.  Under s. 17(4), to order a variation
a court must be satisfied that the change in circumstances as
provided in the Guidelines has occurred since the last order.
Under s. 14(c) of the Guidelines the coming into force of the
Guidelines constitutes a change in circumstances.  Under s.
17(6.1) of the Divorce Act the court making a variation order for
child support shall do so in accordance with the Guidelines.  The
combination of these provisions means that a spouse can apply to
vary a previous child support order to make it comply with the
Guidelines based on nothing more than the coming into force of
the Guidelines.</pre>
    <pre>2)   Those who argue in favour of giving the court an overriding
discretion to refuse to apply the Guidelines focus on the word
&#147;may&#148; in s. 17(1) of the Act: &#147;[a] court &#133; may make an order
varying &#133; a support order &#133;&#148;  But the word &#147;may&#148; has to be read
in its  context.  Thus, the Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985 c.
I.21 states that &#147;may&#148; is to be construed as permissive unless
the contrary intention appears in the legislation.5  In some
contexts the word &#147;may&#148; confers a discretionary power on the
court.  In other contexts &#147;may&#148; simply gives the court the power
or authority to do something; and if the exercise of that power
depends on a condition being satisfied, &#147;may&#148; has been
interpreted to mean &#147;must&#148; once the condition is met. An example
is the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in New
Brunswick (Minister of Health) v. L. (M.), [1998] 2 S.C.R. 534 at
550, in which the court concluded that in the context of child
protection legislation &#147;may&#148; means &#147;must&#148; where that is in the
best interests of the child.</pre>
    <pre>     In the context of the new child support regime under s. 17
of the Divorce Act and the Guidelines it seems to me &#147;may&#148; in s.
17(1) is not permissive but authorizing or empowering, in the
sense that if the condition of the section is met &#150; if there has
been a change in circumstances &#150; the court must vary the child
support order to comply with the Guidelines.  Because the mere
coming into force of the Guidelines is a change in circumstances,
on application, a court must vary a previous child support order
to comply with the Guidelines.  Apart from ss. 17(6.2) to 17(6.5)
of the Act it has no discretion to refuse to do so.</pre>
    <pre>     In Dergousoff, supra, Cameron J.A. adopted this
interpretation of &#147;may&#148; in s. 17(1) of the Act, and I agree with
his analysis.  At pp. 16-18, he stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>  Subsections 15.1(1) and 17(1) are empowering sections.
In providing, as they do, that a court &#147;may make an 
order,&#148; either requiring a spouse to pay child support, 
as in the case of subsection 15.1(1), or varying a 
child support order, as in the case of subsection 17(1), 
they empower a court to do that which it could not 
otherwise do.  In the case of subsection 17(1), judges 
of the court are empowered to order the variation or
operation of an order made previously by another judge 
of coordinate jurisdiction, something that simply could 
not be done in the absence of the subsection.</pre>
        <pre>  The essential thrust of this construction of these 
subsections was well made by Thorson J.A. in 
Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of 
Revenue) (1981), 121 D.L.R. (3d) 403 (Ont. C.A.) at p.
408:         </pre>

    <pre>               
                    In some contexts, of course, the word
               &#147;may&#148; is neither necessarily permissive nor
               necessarily imperative, but rather merely
               empowering.  Its function is to empower some
               person or authority to do something which,
               otherwise, that person or authority would be
               without any power to do.  In such a case, the
               word &#147;may&#148; merely removes an impediment to
               the doing of that thing. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Unlike section 15.1, section 17 contains a pre-condition 
	to the exercise of the power to make an order thereunder.  
	Subsection 17(4) prescribes an event upon which the 
	ability of the court to exercise the power of variation
        is made to depend, namely a change in circumstances as 
	provided for in the Guidelines since the making of the
        previous order.  Until such change is established, but 
	not before, a judge of the court is unable to exercise 
	this power.  Hence, the fulfilment of this pre-condition 
	is enabling, and in that sense the satisfaction of the
        requirements of subsection 17(4) opens the door to the 
	making of an order varying the terms of a previously made
        order.</pre>
    <pre>        &#133;</pre>
    <pre>
          Lest it be thought the term &#147;may&#148; appearing in each of 
	subsections 15.1(1) and 17(1) leaves the exercise of these 
	powers to the discretion of the court, it should be noted 
	that in itself the word &#147;may,&#148; employed in contexts such 
	as this, is customarily taken to confer neither 
	discretionary nor non-discretionary power.  As Thorson 
	J.A. observed in Falconbridge Nickel Mines Ltd. v. Ontario 
	(Minister of Revenue):</pre>
    <pre>               
                    In such a case, the word &#147;may&#148; merely
               removes an impediment to the doing of that
               thing, leaving it open to be determined, in
               the context of the legislation in question,
               whether or not the Legislature intended that,
               where the conditions if any prescribed for
               the exercise of the power are met, the power
               will in fact be exercised. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>  Viewed in this light, each of subsections 15(1) and 17(1) 
may be seen not only to empower the court to act but also 
to impose a duty upon it to do so once the conditions of 
fact and law requisite to the exercise of that power are 
met.  The duty may be seen to arise from the nature, object,
and conditions of the powers conferred by these subsections,
together with the makeup of the class of persons for whose 
benefit they were conferred.  The powers to make and vary 
child support orders were granted to further the object of 
ensuring that, upon divorce, the financial obligation of 
the spouses to maintain the children of the marriage is
fulfilled in accordance with the law.  The law lays down 
the measure of the obligation, found in the Guidelines, 
and directs the court, when exercising these powers, to do 
so  &#147;in accordance with the applicable guidelines.&#148;  And 
since the obligation is not a static one, its measure is 
to be taken from time to time as circumstances bearing upon
the obligation change.</pre>
        <pre>  Having regard for this, it is surely not within the 
discretion of the court to refuse to exercise the power to 
make a child support order under subsection 15.1(1) once 
the conditions necessary to the exercise of this power are 
satisfied.  Nor can it be within the discretion of the court 
to decline to exercise the power to vary a child support
under subsection 17(1) when the conditions requisite to the 
exercise of this power are met.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>          
     This interpretation of the word &#147;may&#148; best reflects the
purpose of the Guidelines.  Their purpose is to promote
uniformity, fairness, objectivity and efficiency in child support
orders by curtailing, not expanding, judicial discretion.  The
Guidelines themselves set out the limited circumstances when
judicial discretion is to be exercised.  In these limited
circumstances judges in their discretion may deviate from the
table amounts.  The exercise of this discretion permits judges to
accommodate individual family circumstances and thus avoid any
unfairness arising from the general uniformity of the Guidelines
regime.  But for the limited discretion under the Guidelines and
the limited discretion in s. 17(6.2) to 17(6.5) of the Divorce
Act, courts must award the table amounts under the Guidelines.</pre>
    <pre>3)   Interpreting the Divorce Act to allow a spouse to vary a
previous child support order to comply with the Guidelines regime
promotes the four stated objectives of the Guidelines; the
contrary interpretation achieves none of these objectives.  For
convenience I repeat the four objectives in s. 1 of the
Guidelines.
          </pre>
    <pre>               1.  The objectives of these Guidelines are:
          </pre>
    <pre>               
                    (a)  to establish a fair standard of
               support for children that ensures that they
               continue to benefit from the financial means
               of both spouses after separation;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (b)  to reduce conflict and tension
               between spouses by making the
               calculation of child support orders more
               objective;
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (c)  to improve the efficiency of
               the legal process by giving courts and
               spouses guidance in setting the levels
               of child support orders and encouraging
               settlement; and
               </pre>
    <pre>                    (d)  to ensure consistent treatment
               of spouses and children who are in
               similar circumstances.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          </pre>
    <pre>     Assuming the Guidelines reflect what Parliament considers
&#147;fair&#148; support, adopting an interpretation of s. 17 of the
Divorce Act that gives judges an open-ended discretion to refuse
to apply the Guidelines does not promote fair support.  Expanding
the scope of judicial discretion to permit judges to refuse to
apply the only objective standard of child support available, the
Guidelines, will increase, not reduce, conflict and tension
between spouses.  Permitting judges to ignore the Guidelines will
make the resolution of family disputes less efficient, not more
efficient.  And giving judges broad discretion to refuse to vary
previous child support orders to comply with the Guidelines
regime will not ensure that spouses and children in similar
circumstances are treated consistently, because their treatment
will differ depending on the wholly arbitrary factor of when
separation or divorce took place.</pre>
    <pre>     Indeed, interpreting the Divorce Act to give judges this
broad discretion runs counter to the views expressed by Abella
J.A. in Francis v. Baker (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 481 at 491.  In
that case, Abella J.A. emphasized that the main purpose of the
new Guidelines regime was to minimize judicial discretion, which,
in her view, too often had resulted in arbitrary and inadequate
child support awards.  The Guidelines were intended &#147;to replace
the haphazard with the predictable,&#148; and thus, through the
application of an objective standard, &#147;to help parents resolve
child support issues as expeditiously as possible.&#148;  Although the
Supreme Court of Canada disagreed with Abella J.A.&#146;s
interpretation of the word &#147;inappropriate&#148; in s. 4(b) of the
Guidelines, it did not suggest that her views on the purpose of
the Guidelines were in error.</pre>
    <pre>4)   Parliament, in s. 17(6.2) to 17(6.5) of the Divorce Act,
expressly provided when a court may maintain a previous agreement
or court order instead of awarding Guidelines support.  If
special provisions in the agreement or order benefit the child
and the Guidelines amount would be inequitable, or if the parties
have otherwise made reasonable arrangements for the support of
the child, the court may depart from the Guidelines.  Parliament
did not stipulate any other circumstances when a court may refuse
to apply the Guidelines to previous child support orders.  The
principle of implied exclusion applies here:  expressio unius est
exclusio alterius, to express one thing is to exclude another.
One can reasonably infer that Parliament did not intend the court
to have discretion to decline to apply the Guidelines unless the
provisions of s. 17(6.2) to 17(6.5) are met. See Driedger on the
Construction of Statutes 3rd ed., supra, at p. 168.</pre>
    <pre>5)   Section 14(c) of the Guidelines &#150; providing that the coming
into force of the Guidelines is a change in circumstances &#150; is
rendered meaningless if the courts retain an overriding
discretion to refuse to vary a previous child support order
unless there has been a change in circumstances apart from the
Guidelines.  Yet s. 14(c) reflects Parliament&#146;s obvious intent to
treat all children fairly and equitably by permitting them and
their parents to come under the Guidelines regime regardless of
when their family&#146;s break-up occurred.  As James G. McLeod, a
professor of family law, wrote in an annotation to Sherman at
(1999), 45 R.F.L. (4th) 424 at 427:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133; Parliament changed the way judges should decide child
support.  The Guidelines were intended to reduce judicial
discretion, not just change its form.  The issue in the 
case should be whether the Guidelines dictate a different 
amount of support based on the father&#146;s income under the 
Guidelines, not whether there is any reason to change 
support aside from the Guidelines &#133; Why include s. 14(c) 
if a court won&#146;t do anything unless there has been a 
material change in circumstances excluding the 
Guidelines?
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Indeed, giving courts discretion, apart from s. 17(6.2) to
s. 17(6.5) of the Act, to refuse to apply the Guidelines to
previous orders on a variation application would penalize
children whose parents separated or divorced before the
Guidelines were introduced.</pre>
    <pre>6)   The legislative history of the Guidelines also shows
Parliament&#146;s intention to permit spouses to bring  previous
orders under the new regime. The government was acutely aware of
the issues surrounding the question whether it should permit
previous child support orders to be varied to comply with the new
regime. These issues were discussed in the reports of the
Federal Provincial Territorial Family Law Committee, which made
recommendations for the new Guidelines. Moreover, the
government&#146;s intention to remove the court&#146;s broad discretion in
making child support orders is reflected in the statement of the
parliamentary secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney
General of Canada, during the debate over amendments to the
legislation made by the Senate after the legislation had received
third reading in the House of Commons.  The parliamentary
secretary said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133;Bill C-41 through the introduction of child support
guidelines reaffirms the objective that both parents 
have a joint financial obligation to support their 
children.  However, the minister understood the 
concerns raised by some members of the committee that 
this objective was no longer apparent since it was
removed from the Act along with other provisions which 
were part of the concept of broad discretion which is 
currently used in the determination of child support.  
This broad discretion concept defeated the objectives 
of the guidelines and as such we needed to remove it 
from the Act.6
          </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Giving judges a broad discretion to refuse to vary existing child
support orders to comply with the new regime is inconsistent with
the parliamentary secretary&#146;s statement.</pre>
    <pre>     Also, the workbook distributed by the Department of Justice
to help parents understand the new regime and calculate their
child support payments states that either parent has a &#147;right&#148; to
vary an existing order:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The new law on child support says that anyone who 
has a child support order or written agreement made 
before May 1, 1997 has the right to change it to 
reflect the Guidelines and the new tax rules (&#133;), 
even if nothing else has changed.  Either parent
can ask a judge to change the child support order 
or written agreement to reflect the amounts in the 
Guidelines.7</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>          
     Finally, Parliament made its intent even clearer in an
amendment to s. 14 of the Guidelines in December 1997,8 replacing
the introductory words &#147;for the purposes of subsection 17(4) of
the Act a change of circumstances is &#133;&#148; with &#147;for the purposes of
subsection 17(4) of the Act any one of the following constitutes
a change in circumstances&#133;&#148;  This amendment reflects Parliament&#146;s
intent that s. 14(c) alone &#150; the mere coming into force of the
Guidelines &#150; is a change in circumstances entitling a spouse to
vary an existing child support order to comply with the new
regime.9</pre>
    <pre>[25] Respectfully, these indicators of legislative meaning were
not adequately considered in Wang and Sherman.  Moreover, in
addition to these indicators of legislative meaning, I find
support for my interpretation in the views of several family law
experts.  For example, Philip Epstein, a highly respected and
leading family law practitioner in Ontario, wrote in a paper for
the Law Society of Upper Canada:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The effect of these legislative changes in the Act and 
the Guidelines make it clear that the passage of the 
Guidelines legislation and the Income Tax legislation 
will be deemed to be a material change of circumstance, 
entitling any party to move to have the child support 
order amended to reflect the new regime.  Accordingly, 
for those that wish to apply to have the support for
children either increased or decreased, there will be 
no necessity to meet the variation threshold test set 
down by the Supreme Court of Canada in Willick [(1994), 
6 R.F.L. (4th)] and B.(G.) v. G.(L.) [[1995] 3 S.C.R. 
367].  These cases made it clear that there was a 
threshold required to justify a variation application 
and that threshold required that the change in
circumstances not have been subjectively foreseeable by 
the applicant. [See &#147;Separation Agreements and Material 
Change of Circumstances Clauses&#148; by Phillip Epstein in 
&#147;The Six Minute Family Lawyer&#148;, Law Society of Upper 
Canada, April 19, 1996].</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The legislative amendments make that test unnecessary 
since an application is based upon an agreement or order 
made before the Guidelines is available to either party
simply as a result of passage of the Guidelines 
legislation.10
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[26] Heather L. McKay expressed the same opinion in an article
commissioned by the Child Support Team, Department of Justice
Canada.  She said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>For pre-May 1, 1997, orders, Section 14 of the 
Regulations stipulates that, on an application to 
vary under Section 17(4) of the Divorce Act, the 
coming into force of the Guidelines is deemed to 
be a change in circumstances.  It seems clear that
Parliament intended that any person who brings an 
application will, as of right, come under the new 
regime.  In Williams v. Williams (unreported), 
August 14, 1997, N.W.T. S.C., the court stated &#147;The 
enactment of the Guidelines itself provides the 
basis for a variation of a previously-made support 
order.  There is no need for either party to satisfy 
a threshold test of a change in circumstance.&#148;</pre>
        <pre>In other cases it was suggested that the wording of 
Section 14(b) and (c) was conjunctive and that a 
substantial change in circumstance was required in 
addition to the coming into force of the Guidelines 
to establish grounds for variation.  (Wang v. Wang 
(unreported), July 11, 1997, B.C. S.C.).  That was 
not the intention of Parliament and the section has 
been amended.11
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27] Nicholas Bala, a professor of family law at Queen&#146;s
University also took the same view in an article commissioned by
the Department of Justice, writing:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The Guidelines, Section 14(c), specify that the 
recipient of child support under an order made 
prior to the new regime coming into effect has 
the right to vary that order and come under the
new tax regime and the Guidelines.12</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>And, Professor McLeod has also commented that, taken together,
s. 17(1), (4) and (6) of the Divorce Act and s. 14 of the
Guidelines &#147;seem to provide that a person can apply to vary a pre-
Guidelines order to make it comply with the Guidelines based on
nothing more than the coming into force of the Guidelines.&#148;13
Indeed, in his view, by giving judges &#147;a broad unstructured
discretion&#148; to determine child support, Wang and Sherman,
&#147;undermine the integrity of the Guidelines and force parties back
into an adversary mode.&#148;14</pre>
    <pre>[28] Finally, two Ontario trial judges, both experienced in
family law, have recently expressed their disagreement with the
reasoning in Wang and Sherman.  In Gervais v. Tongue,15 Aitken J.
expressly preferred the reasoning of Cameron J.A. in Dergousoff,
although she was bound to follow Sherman.  In Osmar v. Osmar,16 a
Family Law Act case, Aston J. commented, as had Aitken J., that
in both Wang and Sherman, a payor sought to invoke the Guidelines
to reduce the level of child support even though his financial
circumstances had improved or remained the same and those of the
recipient spouse and children had not improved.  On their facts,
Aston J. thought it &#147;possible to accept the outcome&#148; in both Wang
and Sherman, but &#147;dangerous to interpret them as an invitation to
wide open discretion to achieve a &#145;fair&#146; result or to simply
maximize the benefit to the custodial parent.&#148;  In his view, to
which I subscribe:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Judicial Interpretation of the Child Support 
Guidelines cannot depend upon what the court regards 
as appropriate policy, or what is &#147;fair&#148;.  Parliament 
chose to severely circumscribe judicial discretion in 
determining child support, based upon goals of 
consistency, certainty and overall increase in child
support awards generally.  No one can deny that child 
support is generally higher under the Guidelines, 
while recognizing that, in some individual cases, the 
Guideline amount may be lower, either for the payor 
or the recipient or both.
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Thus, unless ss. 37(2.3) or 37(2.5) of the Family Law Act applied
&#150; the companion provisions of ss. 17(6.2) and 17(6.4) of the
Divorce Act &#150; Aston J. concluded &#147;there is no discretion not to
make an order in accordance with the Guidelines.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[29] I therefore believe that the coming into force of the
Guidelines is a change in circumstances under s. 14(c) entitling
a spouse to vary an existing child support order to come under
the Guidelines,  and that Sherman &#150; which held otherwise &#150; was
incorrectly decided.  Sherman was incorrectly decided because it
reintroduces a broad discretion into the variation of existing
child support orders when one of the main purposes of the new
Guidelines regime is to introduce uniformity and thus curtail
judicial discretion.  I observe, however, in fairness to the
panel in Sherman, that in that case the respondent conceded the
court had an overriding discretion not to vary a previous order
to comply with the Guidelines.  Moreover, the panel did not have
the benefit of full argument or of all the relevant authorities
on the issue.  The British Columbia Court of Appeal decision in
Wang was not cited during oral argument but was brought to the
panel&#146;s attention the day that it released its original
endorsement (which was subsequently amended), and the
Saskatchewan Court of Appeal decision in Dergousoff, which
supports the contrary interpretation, and was decided before
Sherman  was argued, was not given to the panel at all.  Nor did
the panel have the benefit of any of the commentaries on the
issue by family law experts.
[30] Although I recommend that Sherman be reconsidered, fairness
and institutional considerations dictate that it be applied in
this case.  I deal first with fairness.  This appeal was argued
on the footing that the principles in Sherman applied to Ms.
Bates&#146; application to vary the amount of child support and
therefore she had to show a material change in circumstance to
obtain a variation.  The argument focussed on whether the court
should receive her fresh evidence, and if so, whether it could
decide on that evidence alone whether a material change in
circumstances had been made out. Counsel did not raise the
correctness of Sherman either in their factums or in oral
argument.  I therefore think it would be unfair to the parties to
decide the case on a different footing.  Moreover, as Ms. Bates&#146;
application for a variation must at least be re-heard on the
question whether the table amount under the Guidelines is
inappropriate, no injustice would be caused by having the entire
application re-heard.
[31] The institutional reasons for applying Sherman are rooted in
the policy of this court on stare decisis.  This court does not
lightly depart from its previous decisions, even those given by
endorsement.17
[32] When good reason exists to doubt the correctness of an
earlier decision, the usual practice is for the Chief Justice to
convene a five-judge panel of the court to reconsider the earlier
decision.18
[33] These fairness and institutional considerations make
reconsideration of Sherman in a subsequent case the more
desirable path.  I would, therefore, give effect to Mr. Bates&#146;
first ground of appeal, in part, by setting aside the order of
the motions judge.  But I would order a new hearing on whether
Ms. Bates is entitled to an order varying the amount of child
support to come under the Guidelines.  See Tauber v. Tauber.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Second Issue -- Is Mr. Bates entitled to a new hearing on whether
the table amount under the Guidelines is inappropriate?</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[34] Mr. Bates&#146; main submission was that his appeal be allowed
and that Ms. Bates&#146; application for a variation in child support
be dismissed.  Alternatively, he submitted that if Ms. Bates was
entitled to an order varying the amount of child support to come
under the Guidelines, he should be entitled to show that the
table amount is too high.  Mr. Bates does not rely on s. 17(6.2)
to 17(6.5) of the Divorce Act to justify departing from the
Guidelines amount.  He does, however, submit that he should pay
less child support than the table amount because the table amount
is &#147;inappropriate&#148; under s. 4(b) of the Guidelines.  He contends
that at the very least he is entitled to a new hearing on this
question, and I agree with him.
[35] The motions judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme
Court of Canada&#146;s decision in Francis v. Baker. At the time he
heard the application he was bound by this court&#146;s decision in
Francis v. Baker, which prevented him from reducing the amount of
child support prescribed by the table.  The Supreme Court of
Canada has given trial judges a discretion under s. 4(b) of the
Guidelines to lower the amount of child support if the table
amount is inappropriate.  Thus, if Ms. Bates establishes a change
in circumstances entitling her to come under the Guidelines
regime, Mr. Bates should have the opportunity to persuade the
trial court that the table amount is inappropriate.</pre>
    <pre><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[36] I would dismiss the motion to introduce fresh evidence.  I
would allow the appeal, set aside the order of O&#146;Connell J. and
remit Ms. Bates&#146; application for a new hearing.  I would not make
any order for costs.</pre>
    <pre>                                               &#147;John Laskin J.A.&#148;
                                       &#147;I agree:  S. Borins J.A.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre><strong>Released: June 19, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>AUSTIN J.A. (concurring):</strong></pre>
    <pre>[37] I agree with Laskin and Borins JJ.A. that the motion by Ms.
Bates for the admission of fresh evidence should be dismissed and
the appeal of Mr. Bates from the decision of O&#146;Connell J. of
February 11, 1999, should be allowed, both without costs.
[38] My reasons for these dispositions are the decision of this
court in Sherman, supra, the fact that the decision of O&#146;Connell
J. effected a substantial increase in child support, the decision
of Francis v. Baker, supra, in the Supreme Court of Canada which
makes it clear that such changes should be made at the trial
level and the right of Mr. Bates to have a full opportunity to
test and meet any evidence presented by Ms. Bates at a new
hearing.</pre>

to  following  its  own  decisions as has the  English  Court  of
Appeal.   The strict English rule is set out in Young v.  British

court  that have declined to follow earlier decisions include  R.
