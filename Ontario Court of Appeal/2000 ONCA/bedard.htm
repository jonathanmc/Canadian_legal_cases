<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Mr. Justice Bourke
Smith dated June 19, 1997.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>E N D O R S E M E N T</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span style='font-size:15.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant raised many issues in the extensive material he
filed on the appeal.  We are concerned
only with those issues that could have some bearing on the propriety of his
convictions on charges of break and enter and possession of stolen property
entered after a trial before Mr. Justice Bourke Smith at which the appellant
acted for himself.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant argues that he was denied the right to make full
answer and defence because he was not allowed to adduce evidence of his medical
condition at the time he gave an inculpatory statement to the police.  The appellant contends that he is
hypoglycaemic and that his condition rendered him incapable of making a
voluntary statement.  This argument was
not one of the several arguments made by the appellant at trial in support of
his contention that the statement was inadmissible.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The officer taking the statement from the appellant testified
that the appellant did not appear to be impaired in any way.  Ms. Kyle, counsel for the Crown, also
referred us to a portion of the cross-examination of that officer by the
appellant in which the appellant took issue with any suggestion that he may
have been incoherent during any part of his conversations with the police.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Although the appellant did seek to adduce certain medical
evidence of his hypoglycaemic condition at trial, it does not appear to us that
this evidence was tendered to support a contention that the statements were not
voluntary.  In any event, nothing
produced at trial, or by way of fresh evidence in this court sheds any light on
the appellant’s medical condition at the time he gave the inculpatory
statement.  While the evidence offers
some support for the appellant’s contention that he was hypoglycaemic it goes
no further and does not suggest that this condition affected his ability to
provide a voluntary statement.  There is
no suggestion, even in the affidavit filed by the appellant on this appeal,
that he did not have an operating mind when he made the statement.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant also claims that he was denied the opportunity
to present medical evidence of his condition at the time of trial and that such
evidence could have demonstrated that at the time of his trial he was unable to
properly defend himself because his cognitive functions were significantly
impaired by his hypoglycaemic condition. 
Nothing in the transcript of the trial proceedings or the fresh evidence
filed by the appellant supports this claim. 
Perusal of the transcript shows that the appellant was a full
participant in the trial.  It is also
noteworthy that the very experienced trial judge congratulated the appellant on
the conduct of his own defence at the end of the trial.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>At the trial, the appellant challenged the voluntariness of
his statements to the police, one of which was videotaped.  He renewed those objections on appeal.  At trial, the Crown led evidence from the
two officers who took the statements. 
The appellant did not testify and did not call any evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> to determine the admissibility
of the statement.  He advanced three
arguments in support of his claim that the Crown had not shown that the
statements were voluntary.  The trial
judge rejected each submission.  In
doing so, he made clear findings of fact all of which were fully supported by
the evidence.  We cannot interfere with
those findings.  In the light of those
findings the admissibility of the statements cannot be successfully challenged.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant also submitted that the trial judge was
biased.  This submission rested on a
single remark made by the trial judge during the appellant’s cross-examination
of one of the witnesses.  There is no
merit to this submission.  We see
nothing improper in the comment made by the trial judge.  Nor have we been referred to anything else
in his conduct of the trial which would cast any doubt on the trial judge’s
impartiality or the fairness with which he conducted the trial.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appeal is dismissed.</p>
