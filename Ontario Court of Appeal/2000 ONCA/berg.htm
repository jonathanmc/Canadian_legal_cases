without a jury, dated August 4, 1999.</b></pre>
      <pre><b>WEILER J.A.:</b></pre>
      <pre>[1]  The issue on this appeal is a narrow one.  The issue is
whether the voluntary reciprocal scheme for the enforcement of
motor vehicle liability insurance policies across Canada requires
a participating American insurer to appear and defend the action
in the province in which it is sued.
[2]  The appellant, Ms. Berg, is a resident of Minnesota and was
a passenger in an automobile licensed in Minnesota that was
involved in an accident in Ontario with an automobile owned and
driven by an Ontario resident.  The appellant was covered by an
insurance policy issued by the respondent, Farm Bureau Mutual
Insurance Company, a Minnesota corporation.  It is not disputed
that the benefits to which the appellant is entitled pursuant to
the contract of insurance have been paid.
[3]  By way of an action instituted in Ontario, the appellant
claimed entitlement to the statutory accident benefits (“SABs”)
from the respondent at the minimum limits required in the
Province of Ontario pursuant to the Ontario Auto Insurance Rate
Stability Act, 1996.  The respondent moved to stay the
proceedings.
[4]  On August 4, 1999, Jennings J. granted the motion for a
stay.  He held that the appropriate forum for the adjudication of
the appellant’s claim was Minnesota on the basis that that
jurisdiction had the closest and most real connection with the
contract.  He added that no juridical advantage necessarily
followed the choice of Minnesota as the convenient forum.
[5]  The appellant appeals on the basis that Jennings J. erred in
failing to give effect to the Power of Attorney and Undertaking
that had been signed by the respondent and filed in British
Columbia in 1964.  In the alternative, the appellant asserts that
Jennings J. erred in holding that Minnesota was the appropriate
forum for the adjudication of the claim for Ontario SABs.
[6]  For the reasons that follow, I am of the opinion that the
appeal should succeed.
[7]  The relevant portion of the Power of Attorney and
Undertaking (“PAU”) signed by the respondent reads as follows:</pre>

      <pre>[8]  A plain reading of the PAU indicates that the respondent
insurer agreed to accept service and to appear in any action
against it in any province or territory in which the action had
been instituted, in this case, Ontario.  The respondent submits
that this undertaking applies to the situation where its insured
is sued and that it does not apply to the situation where the
insurance company is being sued by its own insured.  That is not
what the PAU says.  Paragraph A of the PAU states that the
respondent undertakes “To appear in any action or proceeding
against it or its insured …”  “It” refers to the Farm Bureau
Mutual Insurance Company, the respondent.  The respondent’s
submission must accordingly fail.  The effect of the PAU is that
the respondent has agreed to the assumption of jurisdiction over
it when sued in a province of Canada.  In designating the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles as its agent to accept service on its
behalf, the respondent has also excluded the necessity for
service outside the jurisdiction.
[9]  In this case, the appellant served the respondent outside of
Ontario, giving rise to the motion for a stay pursuant to rule
17.06 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.  Pursuant to rule 17.06
(2)(c) and the jurisprudence relating to forum non conveniens, a
court may set aside service process outside Ontario where Ontario
is not the appropriate forum for the hearing of the proceeding.
Although an Ontario court maintains a discretion with respect to
jurisdiction, an agreement respecting jurisdiction will generally
be observed in the absence of a good reason for not doing so: See
Interprovincial Product Liability Litigation, Robert J. Sharpe,
Butterworths, Toronto, 1982 pp. 25-28 and cases cited therein.
[10] Here, the parties are both resident in Minnesota and the
evidence on any issues of fact is situated or more readily
available there.  This could be a reason for not enforcing the
PAU.  The factors connecting the parties to Minnesota are
important ones to consider in deciding the most appropriate forum
for the resolution of a claim: Amchem v. Workers’ Compensation
Board (1993), 102 D.L.R. (4th) 96 (S.C.C.) at 104; Eastern Power
Ltd. v. Azienda Communale Energian and Ambiente (2000), 178
D.L.R. (4th) 409 (Ont. C.A.) at 414-15.  The rationale underlying
consideration of connecting factors and, in particular, the
factor of juridical advantage is, however, to give effect to the
reasonable expectation of the parties respecting the outcome in
the event of litigation: Amchem, supra, at 110-11.  Here, the
undertaking signed by the respondent is indicative of its
reasonable expectation.
[11] This court had occasion to consider the effect of the PAU in
Healy v. Interboro (1999), O.J. No. 1667 (C.A.).  Although that
decision did not deal with the question of jurisdiction, the
purpose of the PAU was discussed and is of assistance here.  At
para. 14 of the decision, Goudge J.A., on behalf of the court,
stated:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>To paraphrase the description of Blair J.A. in Potts, 
supra, ((1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 556 (C.A.) at 557-8) a 
participating insurer agrees to be bound by the law 
concerning the compulsory automobile insurance 
coverage of the state or province where the action 
against it is brought rather than the automobile 
insurance coverage of the state or province where 
its policy is issued.  In return a participating 
insurer can assure those persons whom it insures that 
they will be recognized as being validly insured when 
driving in other participating jurisdictions.  It 
assures the same statutory guarantees to someone 
njured in an automobile accident in Ontario whether 
the relevant automobile insurance contract was made 
in Ontario or another participating jurisdiction.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[12] If the appellant’s action is allowed to proceed in Ontario,
the PAU makes Ontario law applicable and the appellant will be
entitled to SABs.  The PAU precludes the respondent from
asserting the defence that its policy does not include SABs
coverage: Healy, supra, at paras. 18 and 19.  If, on the other
hand, a stay is granted and the appellant is forced to sue in
Minnesota, the issue of whether the respondent is obliged to pay
SABs is very much a live issue.    The PAU provides that the law
to be applied is that of the province where the “action or
proceeding may be initiated.”  It could be argued that, because
of the stay, the action may not be initiated in Ontario.  There
could, accordingly, be a significant loss of juridical advantage
to the appellant.
[13] For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the learned
motions judge erred in the exercise of his discretion to grant a
stay because he did not consider the wording and effect of the
PAU signed by the respondent.  Accordingly, I would allow the
appeal and set aside the stay of proceedings with costs to the
appellant here and at first instance.
