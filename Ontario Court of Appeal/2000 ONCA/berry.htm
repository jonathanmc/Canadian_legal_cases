    <pre><strong>On  appeal from the summary judgment of Winkler J. dated June  4,
1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>SHARPE J.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal raises an important issue relating to membership
in  a  union:  Does a union member who fails to comply  with  the
union  constitution  incur personal liability  to  another  union
member who suffers damage as a result?</pre>
    <pre>I.   Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]   This  is an intended class proceeding brought on behalf  of
all  Air Ontario pilots (the appellants) who were members of  the
Canadian Air Line Pilots Association (&#147;CALPA&#148;), an unincorporated
association  on  March  28, 1995, the day a  crucial  arbitration
award  was  handed  down.  The defendants  (respondents  on  this
appeal)  are all Air Canada pilots who were members of  CALPA  on
that same date.
[3]  CALPA is a trade union and was the certified bargaining
agent for over 4,000 pilots across Canada, including pilots
employed by Air Canada and Air Ontario.  Under the CALPA
Constitution and Administrative Policy (&#147;Constitution&#148;) the
President had the power to declare that employer airlines are
merged, even though they have not yet merged in the corporate
sense. The purpose of the merger policy is to prevent pilot
employee groups from bidding against one another for work.
[4]  Invocation of the merger policy required the employees of
the merged employers to establish an integrated seniority list.
The policy imposed an obligation to negotiate the merged
seniority list in good faith.  If the two employee groups failed
to negotiate an agreement, they were required to submit the
matter to arbitration. The merger policy provided that the
decision of the arbitrator &#147;shall be final and binding on all
parties to this arbitration.&#148;
[5]  On March 1, 1991 the CALPA President issued a merger
declaration with respect to Air Canada and six feeder airlines,
including Air Ontario.  This triggered the merger policy and the
steps outlined above.
[6]  The Air Canada and Air Ontario pilots failed to negotiate a
merged seniority list, mediation failed, and the issue was
referred to arbitration. The Air Canada pilots requested an
&#147;endtail merger&#148; that would result in all Air Ontario pilots
being ranked after the Air Canada pilots in seniority. On March
28, 1995, Arbitrator Picher released his decision (&#147;Picher
Award&#148;). He rejected the Air Canada pilots&#146; position and directed
that the bottom 15 percent of the Air Canada pilots should be
&#147;dovetailed&#148; with the most senior regional pilots.
[7]  The CALPA President officially accepted the Picher Award on
April 5, 1995.  Captain Pulley, Chairman of the Air Canada
pilots&#146; Master Executive Council (&#147;MEC&#148;), advised the CALPA
President that the Air Canada MEC had reviewed the decision and
found the award unacceptable.  Captain Pulley attended, but
refused to participate in a meeting to fashion the seniority list
in accordance with the award.
[8]  The Air Canada pilots were in negotiations with Air Canada
for a new collective agreement at the time that the Picher Award
was released.  They refused to present a merged seniority list to
Air Canada.  The Picher Award is of no practical force or effect
without the agreement of the employer.
[9]  The Air Canada pilots voted to reject the Picher Award.
They left CALPA and formed their own union, the Air Canada Pilots
Association (ACPA) on May 19, 1995.  ACPA was certified as the
bargaining agent for Air Canada pilots on November 14, 1995. The
membership of all Air Canada pilots in CALPA was automatically
terminated when ACPA was certified as their bargaining agent.
[10] Two years after CALPA lost its bargaining rights for the Air
Canada pilots, the appellants brought this action suing the
respondents personally for $300,000,000 in damages. The
appellants allege that the respondents are liable for breach of
the CALPA Constitution by virtue of their refusal to accept the
Picher award and by the actions they took in that regard. The
appellants also assert that an agreement was reached in August,
1988 between the President of CALPA and the Air Canada MEC to the
effect that both parties would proceed with a merger of the Air
Canada and Air Ontario pilot groups.  The appellant&#146;s claim was
originally pleaded as breach of contract. The respondents moved
for summary judgment to dismiss the action.  The appellants
amended the statement of claim to allege conspiracy and unlawful
interference with economic interests on essentially the same
facts as pleaded in support of the contractual claim.
[11] The motions court judge granted the respondents&#146; motion for
summary judgment under Rule 20.04(4) with respect to the claim
for damages arising from breach of contract.  He dismissed the
motion with respect to the tort claims and found that those
claims raised an issue for trial.
[12] The appellants appeal the dismissal of the contractual claim
and  the respondents cross-appeal the dismissal of the motion  to
dismiss the tort claims.</pre>
    <pre>II.  Issues</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Does breach of the CALDA Constitution give an individual
          union member a right of action for damages for breach of 
	  contract against other individual union members?</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Do the torts claims advanced by the appellants give rise 
	  to a genuine issue for trial?</pre>
    <pre>III. Analysis</pre>
    <pre>1) Does breach of the CALPA Constitution give an individual union
   member a  right of action for damages for breach  of  contract
   against other individual union members?</pre>
    <pre>[13]  It is the position of the appellants that all CALPA members
were parties to a contract, the terms of which were specified  by
the  Constitution. They contend that by refusing to  respect  and
abide  by  the  Picher Award, the respondents were in  breach  of
their  contractual obligations as laid down in the  Constitution,
that  the appellants suffered damages as a result of the  breach,
and  that an action for breach of contract follows. It is  common
ground that the contractual claims of the appellants rest on  the
proposition  that each individual union member has a  contractual
right  to  sue  another individual union member for  damages  for
breach of the CALPA Constitution where that breach causes damage.
[14] We were invited by Mr. Nelligan to find that there was no
breach of the Constitution by the respondents. In my view, that
issue is plainly one that could not to be decided in the
respondents&#146; favour at this stage of the proceedings. The record
before the motions court judge contains letters from certain of
the respondents that make it clear that they did not accept the
Picher Award and that they would not be bound by it. There is
evidence that they acted accordingly. The respondents voted to
reject the award and eventually left CALPA to form their own
union.  In my view, there is clearly a triable issue on the
question of whether this conduct amounted to a breach of the
Constitution.
[15] The real issue on this appeal is whether a breach of the
Constitution gives an individual member a cause of action in
damages against other individual members for breach of contract.
I agree with the motions court judge that on that issue, there
are no material facts in dispute and that the only genuine issue
is a question of law that can be dealt with pursuant to Rule
20.04(4).
[16] The precise legal character of unions and other
unincorporated associations is a matter of some conjecture: see
Adams, Canadian Labour Law, 2nd ed. (updated 1999), at §14.710 et
seq.  Trade unions were seen as unlawful conspiracies at common
law, and while legislation long ago removed the unwarranted
stigma of criminality, the precise nature of the legal
personality of unions is not defined by legislation. Unions form
an important part of the contemporary legal and economic
landscape, but for various reasons, some historical and some
policy-driven, they do not enjoy the legal personality of a
natural person or a corporation. Absent specific legislation,
they are not suable entities. In Canada, the juridical character
of unions has been left to the common law.
[17] In view of the economic importance of trade union membership
to individual members, the nature of the rights pertaining to
membership have been a frequent source of litigation. It is in
that context that the jurisprudence defining the legal character
of union constitutions has evolved. The leading Canadian
authority is Orchard v. Tunney, [1957] S.C.R. 436, a case
involving a tort claim by a union member for unlawful expulsion.
Rand J. dismissed the contention that the claim could properly be
analyzed in terms of status, and preferred an analysis of the
union constitution as a complex of contracts between each member
and every other member of the union. Rand J. explained this in
the following terms, at p. 445:</pre>
    <pre>     Apart,  then,  from  statute,  that  a  union  is  held
     together  by  contractual  bonds  seems  obvious;  each
     member  commits himself to a group on a  foundation  of
     specific  terms  governing  individual  and  collective
     action, a commitment today almost obligatory, and  made
     on both sides with the intent that the rules shall bind
     them in their relations to each other.  That means that
     each  is  bound to all the others jointly.   The  terms
     allow  for the change of those within that relation  by
     withdrawal   from  or  new  entrance  into  membership.
     Underlying this is the assumption that the members  are
     creating a body of which they are members and  that  it
     is as members only that they have accepted obligations:
     that   the   body  as  such  is  that  to   which   the
     responsibilities for action taken as of the  group  are
     to be related.
     </pre>
    <pre>     By  the  contract, therefore, liabilities  incurred  in
     group  action  are group liabilities  and  it  is  this
     unexpressed assumption that warrants the conclusion  of
     several  of  the Lords in Taff Vale and  in  Bonsor  in
     limiting  execution  of the judgments  in  those  cases
     recovered  to the property of the union.  That  such  a
     limitation can be effected contractually as between the
     parties  is  undoubted  and  its  attribution  to   the
     agreement is simply making explicit what is implicit in
     their act or organization.  The contractual rights of a
     member  are,  then,  with all members  except  himself,
     otherwise  it would be the group as one that contracts;
     and what ordinarily is complained of as a breach toward
     a  member must, in light of the rules and the agreement
     to  be bound by a majority, be such as at the same time
     is  a violation in respect of all the other members and
     not of one or more only.</pre>
    <pre>[18] The contractual model was adopted by this court in Astgen v.
Smith,  [1970]  1 O.R. 129 at 135 where Evans J.A.  endorsed  the
proposition that a union constitution is a complex of  individual
contracts:</pre>
    <pre>     The  contract of association is not between the  member  and
     some  undefined entity which lacks the capacity to contract;
     it  is  a complex of contracts between each member and every
     other  member of the union.  These are individual  contracts
     impressed  with  rights  and  obligations  which  cannot  be
     destroyed  in  the absence of the specific consent  of  each
     person whose rights would be affected thereby.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  While  the contractual analysis has been used to facilitate
and  elucidate an understanding of the rights and obligations  at
issue, it is apparent that these constitutions are not typical or
conventional  contracts. Rather, these special  contracts  create
rights and obligations of a particular nature and they have their
own  particular juridical character, the precise nature of  which
has  perhaps  never  been fully elaborated. Ordinary  contractual
analysis serves well for certain purposes, but care must be taken
in  its  application lest it distort the sui generis legal nature
of the relationship among union members.
[20] In my view, one cannot make an automatic leap from the
contractual characterization of the CALPA Constitution to the
conclusion that a right of action in damages arises on behalf of
one union member against another union member who breaches the
terms of that Constitution.
[21] I agree with the motions judge that the proposition asserted
by the appellants cannot be sustained upon close analysis of the
contractual construct of the CALPA Constitution. As described in
the above quoted passage from the judgment of Rand J. in Orchard
v. Tunney, the complex of contracts confers on individual members
certain rights. However, Rand J. describes the obligations as
being owed to the individual member jointly by the group
consisting of the membership as a whole: &#147;each is bound to all
others jointly&#148;; &#147;the contractual rights of a member are, then,
with all members except himself.&#148; This theme of the rights of the
individual member as being with all other members is a consistent
one in the cases that have followed. In Astgen v. Smith, supra,
at p. 134 Evans J.A. states that the individual union member
&#147;entered into a contractual relationship with every other member&#148;
of the union and describes the essence of the union as &#147;the
totality of members related to one another by contract.&#148;
Similarly, in Bimson v. Johnston, [1957] O.R. 519 at 530,
Thompson J. states that &#147;the contractual rights of a member are
with all other members&#148; of the union.  This does not, of course,
exclude the existence of certain obligations imposed on
individual members as, for example, the obligation to pay dues or
to respect other provisions of the constitution. However, the
rights and obligations of the individual member are not held or
owed vis-à-vis other individual members.
[22] Since the rights and obligations of individual members exist
in relation to all the other members as a whole, a direct, one-on-
one individual contractual relationship of the kind asserted by
the appellants would be contrary to the essential nature of the
union as a group of members, all bound together by a common
contractual bond. In my opinion, it would be a distortion of the
very nature of the complex of contracts between each and every
member to suggest that members are individually contractually
liable to each other. Thus,  it follows that the contractual
right of an individual member to damages lies against the
membership as a whole and not against other individual union
members.  As was correctly stated in a leading text: &#147;A suit by
one member against all the others sounds in contract and an
implied condition of that contract &#133; [is] that the satisfaction
of legal judgments is limited to the joint property of the
union.&#148; See Adams, supra, at §14.710.
[23] I note that union membership is often the product of &#147;closed
shop&#148; agreements that effectively compel an individual to join a
union in order to earn a living. The individual union member has
no capacity to negotiate the terms of membership, or even the
opportunity to decline membership where a collective agreement is
in place. The motions court judge correctly observed that
exposing individual members to a damages claim at the insistence
of another member could have &#147;the effect of rendering any given
defendant bereft of their personal assets&#148;, a result that simply
would not be in the reasonable expectation of the member upon
joining the union. He noted that depriving the appellants of the
right to sue other individual union members in damages did not
leave them without recourse, and observed that the appellants had
brought an unfair labour practice complaint before the Canada
Labour Relations Board.
[24] In my view, the authorities relied on by the appellants do
not establish their right of action in contract against
individual union members. Astgen v. Smith, supra, was a
representative action to challenge the legality of the merger of
two unions. As I have noted, the judgment of Evans J.A. follows
Orchard v. Tunney and describes the rights of the individual
union member in terms inconsistent with the claim advanced by the
appellants. While the case stands for the proposition that an
individual union member has certain contractual rights with
respect to the collectivity, I see nothing in the case to support
the proposition that the individual member may assert contractual
rights against other individual members.  The appellants also
rely on Horvak v. Paterson (1966), 58 D.L.R. (2d) 175 (B.C.C.A.)
where a union member sued for damages for breach of the union&#146;s
obligation to distribute job opportunities in an equitable
fashion. A union official was sued in a representative capacity.
The court concluded, at p. 181, that it was not necessary to
bring the suit in a representative capacity and that an action
would lie against the official &#147;since he was the person who
actively caused the breach of contract by his own deliberate
act.&#148; In my view, this is unpersuasive authority for the
proposition that an action lies against the individual member in
contract as the language used by the court to describe the wrong
is plainly tortious in flavour. Likewise, Bonsor v. Musicians&#146;
Union, [1955] 3 All E.R. 518 (H.L.) is readily distinguishable.
It involved an action for damages for wrongful expulsion and was
brought against the union itself, not individual members,
pursuant to English legislation making unions suable entities.
[25] I would also observe that denying such a right of action in
contract would not produce a situation where there is a wrong
without a remedy. First, as the motions court judge noted, the
appellants can always pursue their remedies before the Canada
Labour Relations Board. Second, the CALPA Constitution contains a
detailed code to deal with members who breach the obligations it
imposes. For example, Article II, Section 7 sets out the
procedure for dealing with members who fail to live up to their
duties under the Constitution and lists a broad range of offences
for which a member can be charged. Section 7 also specifies that
the remedy that flows from a breach is &#147;expulsion or such other
disciplinary action as the Association may fix&#148;. Moreover, a
detailed procedure for hearings and appeals is specified by
Article II, Section 8 which provides that decisions resulting
from this process are &#147;final and binding&#148;. Thus, in most cases,
the Constitution does provide a remedy where an individual member
fails to live up to its terms. The individual member is subject
to discipline and ultimately expulsion.
[26] Accordingly, it cannot be said that the denial of the right
of action in contract asserted here could produce a situation
where there is a wrong without a remedy
[27] The Constitution also provides for sanctions against a
member found guilty of &#147;initiating legal action against the
Association or a member thereof before exhausting all remedies
provided in this Constitution&#148;.  This provision may be read as
implicitly allowing for civil actions where the remedies provided
in the Constitution have been exhausted or where they have become
redundant (as is the case here once the respondents left CALPA
and formed their own union).  While this provision does not
preclude an action in contract for damages by one union member
against another of the kind at issue here, neither should it be
read as allowing for such an action.  There are other forms of
civil action available to individual members which, in all
likelihood, the drafters of the Constitution had in mind. There
is, for instance, a well-established jurisdiction to grant
injunctive or declaratory relief with respect to the enforcement
of union constitutions: see eg. Bimson v. Johnston, supra.  A
claim for declaratory or injunctive relief is distinguishable
from a claim for compensatory damages against the individual
union member for the consequences of a breach. The former fosters
the purposes of the Constitution. It requires the group as a
whole to respect the rights of the members.  There is also a well-
established body of jurisprudence relating to tort claims: see
discussion infra.  Again, a tort claim against an individual
member does not rest solely on an alleged contractual breach of
the union constitution.
[28] In sum, it is my view that affording one member the
individual right to sue another member for damages for breach of
contract does not comport with the fundamental nature of the
union constitutions generally, or the CALPA Constitution
specifically, as a bond between all its members.
[29] Nor do I accept that the position of the appellants is
improved by virtue of the alleged agreement of August 1988
between the President of CALPA and the Air Canada MEC to proceed
with a merger.  Even assuming, for the sake of this argument,
that the discussions of August, 1988 were not superceded by
subsequent events, it is difficult to see how these discussions
add any qualitatively different source of legal obligation.  Any
commitments made by the Air Canada MEC were, as stated in the
appellant&#146;s factum, in substance, derivative of the rights
asserted under the Constitution.  The 1988 discussions and
commitments correspond with the Picher Award years later.  As
with the Picher Award, they do not create a source of obligation
independent of the Constitution but rather purport to implement
the rights accorded by the Constitution. As the Constitution
affords no individual right of action for damages, I find it
impossible to see how these earlier discussions about the impact
and implementation of the Constitution assist the appellant.
[30] Therefore, I conclude that the motions judge was correct in
granting the respondent&#146;s motion for summary judgment.</pre>
    <pre>2)  Do the  torts claims advanced by the plaintiffs/appellants
    give rise to a genuine   issue for trial?</pre>
    <pre>[31] The tort claims were clearly an afterthought on the part  of
the  appellants,  added  after the motion  for  summary  judgment
attacking the contract claim was launched.  The portions  of  the
statement  of claim alleging conspiracy and unlawful interference
with  economic interests lack detail.  No new facts  are  pleaded
and  the  tort claims are at least partially dependent  upon  the
contractual   theory  of  union  membership.  In   essence,   the
appellants  argue  that even if the CALPA Constitution  does  not
amount to a contract that affords a contractual right to damages,
it  remains  a contract that afforded them specified  rights  and
benefits.   The appellants assert that actions of the respondents
in  refusing  to accept the Picher Award were unlawful  and  that
they  knew or ought to have known that their actions would  cause
injury  to  the  appellants. The motions court judge  found  that
these allegations gave rise to a genuine issue for trial, but  he
gave no reasons for arriving at that conclusion.
[32] It is by no means clear to me that, in the final analysis,
the tort claims asserted are tenable.  The tort claims are
significantly dependent upon the same contract that has been
found not to give rise to a right of action. Union activities are
inherently collective in nature. The collective action alleged to
give rise to a conspiracy claim is the same collective action
that does not give rise to the right of action in contract put
forward here.
[33] However, it is well recognized that the acts of individual
union members may attract tort liability for conspiracy and
interference with economic relations: see Adams, supra, at
§14.990 et seq.  A claim for tortious conspiracy to deprive a
party of contractual rights is plainly distinct from a claim for
breach of those contractual rights. Similarly, there is a
distinctive nature to a claim for intentional interference with
economic interests. On the record, I cannot say with the
necessary degree of certainty that the appellants will be unable
to make out the added element of wrongful conduct necessary to
support their tort claims and, accordingly, I would dismiss the
cross-appeal with costs.</pre>
    <pre>IV.  Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[34] For these reasons, both the appeal and the cross-appeal  are
dismissed with costs.</pre>
