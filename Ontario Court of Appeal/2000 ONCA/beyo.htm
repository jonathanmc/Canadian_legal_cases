    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction by The Honourable Judge V. A. R.
Lampkin on May 27, 1996
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   On  March 22, 1992, the appellant attended at the  home  of
relatives  of his estranged wife.  He was attempting to  see  his
son,  because  a month earlier his wife had left the  matrimonial
home  with their son without telling the appellant where she  was
going.   The  appellant suspected that his wife&#146;s relatives,  the
Pilarskis, knew where she was.  As it turned out, the appellant&#146;s
wife  and  son were at the Pilarskis&#146; home for a birthday  party.
The  prosecution  alleged that the appellant attempted  to  break
into  the  home  and that in the course of doing so  he  broke  a
window,  attempted  to  use a Mace-like  weapon,  threatened  the
Pilarskis,  and  assaulted  Mrs.  Pilarski.   The  appellant  was
charged  with  eight criminal offences.  He was found  guilty  of
four  offences.   On  his appeal from conviction,  the  appellant
raises  grounds of appeal in relation to each of the  convictions
and  also  applies to introduce fresh evidence.  For the  reasons
that follow I would allow the appeal in part.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]   At  the time of the trial, the appellant was 48 years  old.
He  has a Master&#146;s degree in polymer science and technology.   He
married   his   wife,  Ruth,  in  1991.   They  have   one   son.
Unfortunately,  the infant had certain health problems,  possibly
epilepsy.  The appellant had earlier worked in the United  States
while his wife and son remained in Canada.  The relations between
the  appellant and his wife were strained. On February  2,  1992,
the  appellant returned to the United States after a brief  visit
with  his family.  He had been dismissed from his employment  and
was  going  back to the United States to find work. February  2nd
was  the  last  time  the appellant saw his son.   The  appellant
returned to Canada on February 6, 1992.  At that time, he learned
that his wife and son had left the home.  He spent the next month
and  a  half  attempting to make contact with them.  He  obtained
some  information indicating that Mr. Pilarski&#146;s brother  Richard
had  helped his wife move out of the house.  Mr. Pilarski is  the
appellant&#146;s wife&#146;s cousin.  The appellant called the Pilarskis in
an  attempt  to speak to his wife and see his son.  They  claimed
that  they  did not know where she was.  They were,  however,  in
contact  with  her  and  on at least one occasion  the  appellant
delivered a bag of clothing to Mrs. Pilarski for delivery to  the
appellant&#146;s wife.
[3]  In the early morning hours of March 22, 1992, the appellant
called Richard Pilarski.  The appellant was angry and accusatory.
The appellant was charged with threatening Richard.  Richard
testified that he did not take any of the threats seriously and
this charge was dismissed.
[4]  In the afternoon of March 22nd, the Pilarskis threw a
birthday party for one of their daughters.  The party was at
their residence at 14 Doncrest Drive, in the Town of Markham.
The appellant&#146;s wife and son attended the party.  By 5:00 p.m.,
all of the guests had left except for the appellant&#146;s wife and
son and the Pilarskis were preparing to drive them home.  There
was then a knock at the door and Mrs. Pilarski went to answer the
door.  She testified that she saw the appellant through the
window in the door and so she only opened the door a crack and
asked him what he wanted.  The appellant asked her if his son was
there.  Mrs. Pilarski hesitated and looked back to the kitchen.
The appellant said, &#147;My wife is here. He&#146;s here, my son is here.&#148;
According to Mrs. Pilarski, the appellant began to push on the
door and the door hit her.  She pushed back and told the
appellant that he could not come in.
[5]  According to Mrs. Pilarski, there was then a lot of yelling
and screaming with the appellant accusing the Pilarskis of
kidnapping his son and saying that, &#147;We know how to deal with
people like you.  We&#146;ll get you, you fucking Pilarskis.&#148;  The
appellant began banging on the window in the door and the window
broke.  The appellant also wedged his foot in the door and
reached his hand around and grabbed her breast.  Mrs. Pilarski
called out for her husband.  At some point, the appellant reached
around with a small black bottle and attempted to spray them.
Nothing came out.  The appellant was charged with assault with a
weapon and possession of a prohibited weapon, &#147;to wit, tear gas&#148;,
as a result of this aspect of the incident.  These two charges
were dismissed on a directed verdict because the prosecution was
unable to prove that a bottle seized from the appellant contained
tear gas.  The appellant was, however, found guilty of mischief
for breaking the window, assault on Mrs. Pilarski, and
threatening to cause serious bodily harm to Mrs. Pilarski.
[6]  After Mr. Pilarski came to the door, Mrs. Pilarski backed
off and went to call the police.  At some point, prior to the
attendance of the police, the appellant gained entry to the
house.  However, when Mr. Pilarski, who is much bigger than the
appellant, confronted him, the appellant backed off and left the
home.  He continued to scream at the Pilarskis until the police
arrived.
[7]  The appellant was charged with entering the Pilarski home
without lawful excuse with intent to commit an indictable
offence.  The trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant
intended to commit an indictable offence.  He therefore acquitted
the appellant of this charge but found him guilty of mischief.
As one of his grounds of appeal, the appellant argues that
mischief is not an included offence.  The appellant was charged
with threatening to cause serious bodily harm to Mr. Pilarski.
This charge was dismissed because Mr. Pilarski testified that he
did not take the threat seriously.
[8]  The appellant testified.  He admitted to using vulgar
language and accusing the Pilarskis of kidnapping his son.  He
admitted banging on the glass but denied he intended to break it
and testified that he immediately offered to pay for it.  He
denied threatening the Pilarskis or using force against them.  He
claimed that Mrs. Pilarski actually opened the door at one point
to let him in and that it was the Pilarskis who pushed him
outside.
[9]  The police attended at the Pilarski home and arrested the
appellant.  To summarize, the appellant was acquitted of unlawful
entry with intent to commit an indictable offence but found
guilty of mischief as an included offence.  He was found guilty
of assaulting and threatening Mrs. Pilarski and he was found
guilty of mischief for breaking the window.
[10] There were two prior proceedings in relation to these
charges.  The appellant originally elected trial by judge and
a preliminary inquiry was held before Bogusky Prov. Ct.
J.  The appellant subsequently re-elected trial before a
provincial court judge and jury.  The trial commenced before
Osbourne Prov. Ct. J. but was not completed due to the judge&#146;s
illness.  The second trial, giving rise to this appeal, commenced
before Lampkin J. in August 1995.</pre>
    <pre>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[11]  On  behalf of the appellant, Mr. Gold raises the  following
grounds of appeal:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(1)  Mischief is not an included offence of 
unlawful entry as charged in the information;</pre>
      <pre>(2)  The trial judge misdirected himself
as to the mens rea of mischief;</pre>
      <pre>(3)  The trial judge misdirected himself
as to the elements of the offence of
threatening;</pre>
      <pre>(4)  The verdicts are unreasonable.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12]  In  addition, the appellant applies to have fresh  evidence
admitted.   The  fresh evidence consists of a  lengthy  affidavit
from  the  appellant.   In  the  affidavit,  the  appellant   has
meticulously  reviewed the transcripts of the  three  proceedings
and pointed out what he claims are serious inconsistencies in the
versions of events given by the Pilarskis.  Trial counsel for the
appellant  did  not confront the Pilarskis with  the  version  of
events  as given on the prior occasions.  However, Mr. Gold  does
not allege that trial counsel was incompetent.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>     The fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[13]  The Supreme Court of Canada has set out the test for  fresh
evidence  in  a number of cases, most recently in R. v.  Warsing,
[1998] 3 S.C.R. 579 at 592:</pre>
    <pre>               (1)  The evidence should generally not be 
	  admitted if, by due diligence, it could have
	  been adduced at trial provided that this general
	  principle will not be applied as strictly in a
          criminal case as in civil cases &#133;

               (2)   The evidence must be relevant  in
          the  sense  that it bears upon a decisive  or
          potentially decisive issue in the trial.

               (3)   The evidence must be credible  in
          the  sense  that it is reasonably capable  of
          belief, and

               (4)  It must be such that if believed it
          could  reasonably, when taken with the  other
          evidence  adduced at trial,  be  expected  to
          have affected the result.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  Lack  of due diligence looms large in this case  since  the
transcripts of the preliminary inquiry and the first  trial  were
not  only  available  but were used by trial  counsel  in  cross-
examining  the Crown witnesses.  Nevertheless, the  lack  of  due
diligence  is not determinative.  In Warsing, the accused  failed
to  raise the defence of not criminally responsible on account of
mental  disorder and failed to lead certain psychiatric  evidence
that  could  have  been obtained prior to trial.   There  was  no
explanation  from  trial counsel for his  failure  to  lead  this
evidence  because  the accused had refused  to  waive  privilege.
Nevertheless,  as  Major J. said in Warsing at  p.  607,  &#147;It  is
desirable  that  due  diligence remain only one  factor  and  its
absence,  particularly in criminal cases, should be  assessed  in
light  of other circumstances. If the evidence is compelling  and
the  interests  of justice require that it be admitted  then  the
failure to meet the test should yield to permit its admission.&#148;
[15] In my view, the fresh evidence should not be admitted.  It
is not compelling and its admission is not required in the
interests of justice.  As I have indicated, the appellant does
not allege that his very experienced trial counsel was
incompetent in failing to cross-examine the witnesses on the
earlier transcripts.  He has also offered no explanation for
counsel&#146;s failure to use the transcripts in the manner about
which he now complains.  Finally, he has produced no affidavit
from trial counsel to explain his conduct of the trial.  While
Mr. Gold argues that there could have been no tactical advantage
for counsel to have failed to confront the witnesses with their
prior testimony, the absence of any explanation is troubling and
is a factor to be considered, although, in light of Warsing, it
is not determinative.
[16] In his submissions, Mr. Gold referred to two examples that
he argued demonstrated the compelling nature of the fresh
evidence.  I have reviewed the entire affidavit as well as the
testimony of the witnesses referred to in the affidavit.  Almost
without exception, the appellant&#146;s complaints are picayune and by
no stretch of the imagination could the suggested cross-
examination have changed the result.  The appellant has attempted
to elevate what are no more than minor and inconsequential
inconsistencies.  The lack of an affidavit from trial counsel is
particularly telling with respect to these many examples, not
merely on the question of due diligence but in assessing the
weight of this fresh evidence.  At trial, counsel made extensive
use of the prior transcripts and also the statements the
witnesses had given to the police.  He highlighted major
inconsistencies in the versions of events.  My impression from
having read the materials and the trial transcript is that
counsel did not raise these other points because in the context
of the trial they were trivial.
[17] As to the two examples upon which Mr. Gold particularly
relied, in my view they are not compelling.  The first is an
excerpt from the preliminary inquiry where Mrs. Pilarski
testified as follows in response to a question as to how long her
injuries hurt:

          A.   The breast didn&#146;t hurt very long, but the
	  ribs were sore for about two weeks after that.
	  And I assume, that I got hit by the door and
	  wasn&#146;t aware of it, and my doctor has a full
          report, and there were X-rays that had to be taken.

          Q.   You can&#146;t tell us what your doctors told you.

          A.   That&#146;s fine.  I was in  pain  for
          quite  a while after that.  But I don&#146;t  &#133;  I
          want  to  be  honest and open, I don&#146;t  think
          that it had to do with his hit.  I believe it
          was the door that hit me as he was trying  to
          push it in.</pre>
    <pre>[18]   As  I  understand  it,  the  appellant  argues  that  this
contradicts Mrs. Pilarski&#146;s evidence that the door hit  her  when
the  appellant pushed the door into her because in  this  excerpt
the  witness merely said that she assumed or believed she was hit
with  the  door.   This  submission makes far  too  much  of  the
witness&#146;s  use of language.  These answers are also open  to  the
interpretation that the witness was being frank with the court in
stating  that  she could not be sure which act by  the  appellant
caused  the  injury  to  her ribs and was prepared  to  give  the
appellant the benefit of the doubt that this more serious  injury
was not caused by the appellant&#146;s act of grabbing at her breasts.
[19] At trial, defence counsel cross-examined Mrs. Pilarski at
length about what happened at the door with a view to
demonstrating that in fact Mrs. Pilarski had let the appellant
into the home.  He made use of her statement to the police, other
parts of the preliminary inquiry transcript and the transcript
from the first trial.  He was in an ideal position to determine
whether the evidence now said to be crucial demonstrated a
serious inconsistency.  It is worth noting as well that another
very experienced counsel, who represented the appellant at the
first trial, likewise did not cross-examine the witness on this
piece of evidence.
[20] All this simply demonstrates that the contest at trial was
whether Mrs. Pilarski let the appellant into the house or whether
she tried to stop him from entering as he pushed the door against
her.  If the appellant pushed the door against Mrs. Pilarski when
she was trying to keep him out, as was her right, this was an
assault, whether or not it caused any injury to the witness.
[21] The second item of evidence comes from Mrs. Pilarski&#146;s
testimony at the first trial that the appellant never made
threats to her personally.  The appellant claims that this
testimony demonstrates that the appellant did not threaten her.
The excerpt from the first trial is as follows:

          Q.   &#133; did Mr. Beyo, make any threats to you personally?

          A.   No, not that I can remember.

          Q.   Did he make any threats upon you?

          A.   Well, he was at the door.  Everything  together,
	  I  don&#146;t  know  it  you  could  call that a threat&#151;
	  &#147;I&#146;m going  to  get you  Pilarskis&#148;.  I don&#146;t know
	  if that&#146;s a threat or just words spoken in anger. I
          don&#146;t know.</pre>
    <pre>[22]  This  passage  must be seen in context.   The  witness  had
earlier  given the same evidence about the threatening  words  as
she  gave  at the second trial.  It becomes clear when  she  gave
further  evidence that the witness understood the question  about
threats  to  her  &#147;personally&#148; that she was being  asked  if  the
appellant  had actually used her name.  She never retreated  from
the  evidence that the appellant said he was going to  &#147;get&#148;  the
Pilarskis  and  that  &#147;we  know how  to  deal  with  you  fucking
Pilarskis&#148;.  A threat to get the &#147;Pilarskis&#148; was capable of being
a threat to her as well as her husband.
[23] In my view, the proposed fresh evidence would not have
affected the verdict.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the
application to admit the fresh evidence.
               The included offence</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The  first count in the information charged  the  appellant
with  the  offence  contrary to s. 349 of the Criminal  Code  and
reads in part as follows:

     	without lawful excuse did enter the dwelling house 
	of Alex Pilarski situated at 14 Doncrest Dr. with 
	intent to commit an indictable offence therein.</pre>
    <pre>[25] As indicated, the trial judge held that the Crown had failed
to  prove  that  the appellant entered the house with  intent  to
commit  an  indictable offence and he convicted the appellant  of
mischief  as an included offence.  The two offences in  question,
as they read at the time, are as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          349. (1) Every person who, without lawful
	  excuse, the proof of which lies on him, enters
	  or is in a dwelling-house with intent to commit
	  an indictable offence therein is guilty of an
          indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
	  for a term not exceeding ten years.

          430. (1) Every one commits mischief who
          wilfully

          &#133;

          (c) obstructs, interrupts or interferes
          with  the  lawful use, enjoyment or operation
          of property; or

          (d) obstructs, interrupts or interferes
          with  any person in the lawful use, enjoyment
          or operation of property.</pre>
    <pre>[26]  In  concluding that mischief was an included  offence,  the
trial judge relied upon the decision of the Northwest Territories
Court of Appeal in R. v. E. (S.) (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 502.   In
that  case,  the  court held that mischief  as  described  in  s.
430(1)(d)  is  included in the offence of  unlawful  entry.   The
court appears to have accepted the argument of Crown counsel that
the essential element of mischief under s. 430(1)(d) is violation
of  privacy  and that entry into a dwelling-house and interfering
with the lawful use, enjoyment or operation of property share the
common  element of interference with privacy.  The  more  serious
offence  of  unlawful  entry includes the additional  element  of
intent  to  commit  an indictable offence in the  dwelling-house.
The core of the reasoning of the Court of Appeal can be found  in
this passage from p. 506:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It seems to me that any entry into a dwelling-house 
without lawful excuse is at least an interference 
with the resident's use of the property. A person 
occupying or keeping space in a structure as a 
residence has the right to control that space subject 
only to any legal restrictions on that right. He has 
the right to exclude those who have no legal entitlement 
to enter. This is an important aspect of his use of the 
property. It is this aspect which results in his feeling 
of security and privacy in his residence. Any entry into 
it without lawful excuse, even if the resident is not 
aware of it, detracts from the right to control and 
therefore interferes with his use of the property.

I  therefore agree with counsel for the Crown  that 
interference with a person's  use of  property is 
necessarily involved  in  any  entry  into  a 
dwelling-house without  lawful excuse  as  described 
in s. 349.  The entry constitutes interference. If the
entry is intentional, it follows that the interference
is intentional. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27] In reaching this conclusion, the court refused to follow the
earlier  case  of  R.  v.  Drake  (1974),  16  C.C.C.  (2d)   505
(N.S.S.C.A.D.).  I agree that Drake is of limited  assistance  in
resolving  the  issue  in  this case, as  it  turned  on  whether
mischief  as  defined in s. 430(1)(a) was an  included  offence.1
That  paragraph  defines  mischief  as  wilfully  destroying   or
damaging  property.   Only in passing did the Appellate  Division
also  hold that mischief as defined in paragraphs (1)(c)  or  (d)
were  not  included offences.  At page 508, MacDonald J.A.  wrote
the following:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It was urged upon this Court in the argument that the
offence of mischief as defined in s. 387(1)(c) and (d) 
of the Criminal Code was included in the offence of 
break and enter with intent. I am of the opinion that 
these offences are not necessarily included in the 
offence charged in the present bill of indictment or 
in s. 306(1)(a) of the Criminal Code. In other words, 
the whole offence charged in the present case does not
necessarily include the commission of the offence of 
mischief under s. 387(1)(c) or (d). However, even if 
these latter offences were included in the charge set 
forth in the present bill of indictment I feel there 
was no evidence indicating their commission. I say this 
primarily because the evidence clearly indicated that 
the premises were unoccupied at all material times.  
[Note: s. 387 is now s. 430.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[28]  In R. v. Harmer and Miller (1977), 33 C.C.C. (2d) 17  (Ont.
C.A.)  at  19,  Evans J.A. referred to the three ways  in  which,
although  an accused cannot be convicted of the offence  charged,
he  or  she may be convicted of another offence.  They  are:  (1)
offences  included in the enactment creating the offence charged;
(2) offences included by statute, as in s. 662(2) to (6); and (3)
offences that become included by apt word of description  in  the
count as charged in the information.  This case only involves the
first method by which one offence can be included in another.
[29] In R. v. Simpson (No. 2) (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 122 (Ont.
C.A.) at 133, Martin J.A. described the two principles that
underlie the included offence analysis.  First, an included
offence is part of the main offence.  The main offence &#147;must
contain the essential elements of the offence said to be
included&#148;.  Second, the description of the offence as set out in
the enactment creating it must be sufficient &#147;to inform the
accused of the included offences which he must meet&#148;.  This
latter requirement implies a test of &#147;necessarily included&#148;.
After referring to the leading decision on included offences from
the Supreme Court of Canada, Luckett v. The Queen (1980), 50
C.C.C. (2d) 489, which dealt with robbery under former s. 302,
Martin J.A. described that test in these terms at p. 139 of
Simpson:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In the case of an offence such as robbery, which 
may be committed in the different ways described 
in a number of subsections, where the indictment 
charges the offence without reference to a specific 
subsection, all the ways in which the offence as 
described in the enactment may be committed are placed
in issue, and the accused is put on notice that he 
must meet the offence as defined in any and all the 
subsections. In those circumstances, the accused may 
be convicted of any offence necessarily included in 
any of the ways in which the offence, as described 
in the enactment, may be committed. To put the matter
in another way, each subsection carries with it the 
offences necessarily included in that subsection, and 
where the indictment charging robbery under s. 302

    <pre>[30]  A  way  to  determine whether one offence  is  included  in
another as it is described in the Criminal Code is to ask whether
the   main  offence  may  be  committed  without  committing  the
&#147;included&#148; offence.  Put another way, does the commission of  the
main  offence  as described in the enactment necessarily  include
the  other  offence?   In accordance with  Simpson  and  Luckett,
mischief  as described in s. 430 would be an included offence  of
unlawful  entry into a dwelling house if that offence necessarily
included any of the offences described in s. 430.
[31] In my view, the offence of unlawful entry into a dwelling
house does not necessarily include the offence of mischief as set
out in s. 430(1)(c) or (d).  It does not contain the essential
elements of the mischief offence in any of the ways the offence
is described in those paragraphs.  In my view, the error by the
Northwest Territories Court of Appeal is in generalizing the
elements of the unlawful entry offence and the mischief offence
as involving violations of privacy.  That may or may not be an
accurate description of the purpose of the two offences, but
application of the included offence rule, for these purposes,
depends upon comparing the elements of the offences as described
in the enactment.
[32] The decision in E. (S.) depends upon accepting the
proposition that any entry into a dwelling house without lawful
excuse, even if the resident is not aware of it, detracts from
the right to control the property and therefore interferes with
the use of the property (para. (1)(c)) or the person&#146;s use of the
property (para. (1)(d)).  I cannot agree with this proposition.
It would mean that an accused could be convicted of the mischief
offence by application of a wholly abstract concept.  To take an
example, assume an accused comes upon a cottage that is
temporarily vacant (which meets the definition of &#147;dwelling-
house&#148; in s. 2 of the Code2).  He notices that a window has been
left open.  He puts his head through the window (which meets the
definition of &#147;enters&#148; in s. 3503) and leaves.  Assume that he
had no lawful excuse for putting his head into the cottage.  No
person was home at the time and, in fact, no resident of the
cottage ever becomes aware of the accused&#146;s action.  Although the
accused has entered a dwelling house without lawful excuse within
the meaning of s. 349, in my view, this is not criminal conduct
that could attract liability for mischief.  The effect of the
decision in E. (S.) is to transform every trespass into a
dwelling house, no matter how trivial the conduct, into a
criminal offence.  Section 430 was not intended to capture mere
trespass:  R. v. Dooling (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 525 (Nfld.
S.C.T.D.).
[33] To return to the wording of s. 430(1), such conduct clearly
does not obstruct or interrupt the lawful use, enjoyment or
operation of the property or of any person's use, enjoyment or
operation.  And, in my view, it is not an &#147;interference&#148; with
such use, enjoyment or operation. The broadest basis for
liability under s. 430(1) in these circumstances would still
require proof that the acts of the accused interfered with the
enjoyment of the property or interfered with the person&#146;s
enjoyment of the property.  If the person never becomes aware of
the entry, I fail to see how there could be any interference with
enjoyment of the property.  In R. v. Drapeau (1995), 96 C.C.C.
(3d) 554 (Que. C.A.) at 567, Chamberlain J.A., dissenting,
adopted the widest possible definition of enjoyment of property
for the purposes of s. 430(1)(d) as including &#147;the action of
obtaining from property, which a person lawfully holds, the
satisfaction that this property can provide to that person&#148;.  In
my view, not even this definition would be wide enough to capture
this conduct.  Wholly abstract notions or feelings of privacy and
security and interference with theoretical rights to control
access to property, even a dwelling house, cannot be transformed
into criminal conduct.
[34] One final observation.  The offence created by s. 349 can be
committed in two ways.  It is an offence to &#147;enter&#148; or be &#147;in&#148; a
dwelling house without lawful excuse with intent to commit an
indictable offence.  My comments have been directed solely to the
&#147;enter&#148; mode of committing the offence, as the appellant was
charged with that offence.  This is not a case like Luckett where
the accused was charged with &#147;robbery&#148; and therefore the court
was required to consider all of the ways that robbery may be
committed to determine the various included offences.  There was
no application to amend the information at trial to charge the
other mode of committing the s. 349 offence and Mr. Alvaro did
not seek such an amendment here.  It is therefore not necessary
to consider whether mischief is an included offence of the &#147;in&#148;
mode of the s. 349 offence and whether this court would have
acceded to a request to amend.  See R. v. Symes (1989), 49 C.C.C.
(3d) 81 (Ont. C.A.).
[35] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal from the conviction
for mischief in relation to count #1 on the information and enter
an acquittal on that count.

               The mens rea of mischief</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Count  #3  in  the information charged the  appellant  with
mischief as described in s. 430(1)(a), for wilfully destroying or
damaging  property  by  breaking the window  in  the  door.   The
appellant  admittedly broke the window and  the  only  issue  was
whether he had the requisite mens rea.  The appellant argues that
the trial judge erred in applying an objective test for mens rea.
This  submission  is based on the following  part  of  the  trial
judge&#146;s reasons:

               The mischief offence, this is with regard 
	  to the breaking of the window now, [defence
	  counsel] submits that it must be wilful.
          Well, I think the old common law had laid down
	  that every man&#146;s intention must be presumed
	  from the manner in which he behaves.

               There is a glass door and Mr. Beyo is an
          educated  man.  He has got a B.Sc., which  he
          earned  in Israel, and a Master&#146;s in  polymer
          chemistry, which he earned in England.  He is
          employed as a polymer chemist.  He must  know
          that  continued  hitting  of  that  glass  is
          likely  to  break it.  Any reasonable  person
          must  know  that  and he would  therefore  be
          found  guilty of the mischief with regard  to
          the   offence   of   breaking   the   window.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[37]  It  is  well-settled that there is no  presumption  that  a
person intends the natural consequences of his acts.  Thus, in R.
v.  Giannotti, [1956] O.R. 349 (C.A.) at 364, Roach J.A. wrote as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>That a person intends the natural consequences of 
his acts is not a presumption of law. Lord Justice 
Denning dealt with that matter in Hosegood v. 
Hosegood, (1950), 66 T.L.R. Part 1, 735 at 738, which 
incidentally, was a civil case, thus: &quot;When people say
that a man must be taken to intend the natural 
consequences of his acts, they fall into error; there 
is no 'must' about it: it is only 'may.' The 
presumption of intention is not a proposition of law 
but a proposition of ordinary good sense. It means this:
that, as a man is usually able to foresee what are the 
natural consequences of his acts, so it is, as a rule, 
reasonable to infer that he did foresee them and intend 
them. But, while that is an inference which may be 
drawn, it is not one which must be drawn. If on all 
the facts of the case it is not the correct inference, 
then it should not be drawn.&quot;  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[38]  While  Giannotti was a murder case and  therefore  required
proof  of  specific  intent, mischief requires  proof  either  of
intention  or  recklessness as defined in s. 429 of the  Criminal
Code.  Both are subjective states of mind and the trial judge was
therefore  in error if he held that a person&#146;s intent  &#147;must&#148;  be
presumed from his acts.  He was also in error if he applied  that
presumption to the appellant because &#147;any reasonable person&#148; must
know that his actions were likely to break the glass.
[39] There was a conflict in the evidence as to how the glass
broke.  Mr. Pilarski testified that the appellant repeatedly
pounded on the glass with a closed fist in what seemed to be an
attempt to break the glass to gain entry into the house.  The
appellant testified that he was banging on the glass to make
noise to attract attention.  By this time, he knew his son was in
the house and he wanted the police to come because the Pilarskis
had kidnapped his son.  The appellant testified that he did not
intend to break the glass and as soon as it broke he immediately
offered to pay for the damage.  If Mr.Pilarski&#146;s version of
events were accepted, a finding of guilt was inevitable and no
substantial wrong was occasioned by the trial judge&#146;s self-
misdirection.  However, if the appellant&#146;s version of events were
accepted, a finding of guilt, while possible, was not inevitable.
His state of mind had to be determined by a consideration of the
evidence including the appellant&#146;s testimony, the evidence of
others that he was obviously in an agitated state and concerned
for the welfare of his son.  It could not be determined by
application of any legal presumption nor solely from a comparison
with what a reasonable person would know.
[40] This was a very experienced trial judge and it may well be
that his reference to the legal presumption was nothing more than
a reference to the law as it used to be, &quot;the old common law&quot;.
Further, as Mr. Alvaro pointed out, even after referring to the
presumption, the trial judge went on to consider some of the
appellant&#146;s personal characteristics.  Unfortunately, at this
point the trial judge made no reference to the appellant&#146;s
evidence nor to the other evidence that could bear on the
question of his state of mind.  In the result, I cannot be
satisfied that the verdict would necessarily have been the same
had the trial judge properly directed himself.  Accordingly, I
would set aside the finding of guilt of mischief.  I will
consider the proper disposition of this count after I deal with
the other grounds of appeal.

               The elements of the offence of threatening</pre>
    <pre>[41]  The trial judge gave the following reasons for finding  the
appellant guilty of threatening Mrs. Pilarski:

               And it is for that reason with regard to 
	  the threat, however, to Hanna Ostrowiecki, a 
	  woman who was trying to keep him out of the
	  premises before the arrival of her husband, I'm
	  going to find him guilty of the offence of
	  threatening Hanna, though the offence of
	  threatening Alex, her husband, would be dismissed.

                But Hanna is a woman.  She is trying to
          keep  him  out, and he did indeed  say,  &quot;I'm
          going to get you.&quot;  And although that is  not
          specific  as  to what is said,  the  form  in
          which  it  is said, the words that are  used,
          the  circumstances surrounding it,  the  fact
          that  it  is said to a woman, she was clearly
          disturbed  and upset and thought  that  there
          was  a threat to be taken seriously and there
          will  be  a finding of guilt with respect  to
          that.</pre>
    <pre>[42]  The  appellant  argues that the trial  judge  placed  undue
reliance on the complainant&#146;s gender, failed to consider  whether
the  appellant  had the requisite intent, and  did  not  properly
consider  whether the words were a threat.  He also submits  that
the  trial judge failed to take into account that the complainant
never  testified that she was disturbed or upset or thought  that
there was a threat to be taken seriously.
[43] The Supreme Court of Canada set out the elements of the
offence of threatening under s. 264.1 of the Criminal Code in R.
v. Clemente, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 758 at 763 as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Under the present section, the actus reus of the offence 
is the uttering of threats of death or serious bodily 
harm. The mens rea is that the words be spoken or written 
as a threat to cause death or serious bodily harm; that 
is, they were meant to intimidate or to be taken seriously.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[44]  As to whether the words spoken constituted &#147;threats&#148;,  this
is  to  be determined by an objective test as described in R.  v.
McGraw, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 72 at 82-83:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Looked at objectively, in the context of all the words
written or spoken and having regard to the person to 
whom they were directed, would the questioned words 
convey a threat of serious bodily harm to a reasonable 
person?  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[45]  In  Clemente at p. 763, Cory J. expanded on the element  of
threat:

               To determine if a reasonable person would
	  consider that the words were uttered as a threat
	  the court must regard them objectively, and
	  review them in light of the circumstances in
          which they were uttered, the manner in which
	  they were spoken, and the person to whom they
	  were addressed.

                Obviously, words spoken in jest  or  in
          such  a  manner that they could not be  taken
          seriously could not lead a reasonable  person
          to conclude that the words conveyed a threat.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[46]  In  his  reasons, the trial judge referred to Clemente  and
accurately  set  out the elements of the offence,  including  the
requirement  that  the  words  were  meant  by  the  accused   to
intimidate or to be taken seriously.  He referred specifically to
the  need  to have regard to the context in which the words  were
uttered  and  the  person to whom they were  uttered.   For  that
reason,  while he found that the threatening charges in  relation
to  Mr.  Pilarski  and  his brother were not  made  out,  he  was
satisfied   that  the  charge  relating  to  Mrs.  Pilarski   was
established.
[47] In my view, the trial judge did not misdirect himself nor
place undue emphasis on the complainant&#146;s gender.  He had the
opportunity to observe the witnesses and was satisfied that the
words used in the context would convey a threat of serious bodily
harm to her.

               The reasonableness of the verdicts</pre>
    <pre>[48] This ground of appeal relates to the threatening and assault
convictions.  The trial judge was very aware of the frailties  in
the  evidence  of  the two principal Crown witnesses,  especially
Mrs. Pilarski.  I am satisfied that there was sufficient evidence
upon  which  the  trial judge could convict  of  the  threatening
charge.
[49] As to the assault charge, the trial judge&#146;s reasons are
somewhat sparse.  After reviewing the evidence, and noting the
various inconsistencies in the testimony of the Pilarskis, the
trial judge said the following:

               Now, having said that, however, I am
	  satisfied that there was clearly an attempt to
	  enter the premises.  Ms. Ostrowiecki did open
	  the door to Mr. Beyo, and he did ask about his
	  son.  I don't agree that the door was opened a
	  crack, as she submits.  It was open and there
	  may have been an invitation or in his mind an
          invitation to enter.

                 I   accept,  however,  that  when  she
          hesitated  and looked back as  she  said,  he
          then  realized fully that his son was in  the
          premises and attempted to enter further.  And
          at  that  time, she did attempt to close  the
          door  on  him.   I accept that there  was  an
          assault upon her, that he did indeed hit her.</pre>
    <pre>[50]  The trial judge did not need to determine the exact  nature
of  the assault, whether it was only with the door or whether the
appellant  actually reached around and pushed Mrs. Pilarski  with
his  hand  and grabbed her breast, in order to find the appellant
guilty.   There was evidence to support a finding of  assault  on
any  of those bases.  The trial judge was not bound to accept the
appellant&#146;s evidence that, in effect, he was the victim and  that
the  complainant and her husband were pushing him.  I  would  not
interfere with the findings of guilt for assault and threatening.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[51] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal as it relates to the
charges  of  threatening and assault.  I would allow  the  appeal
with respect to the charge of mischief as an included offence  on
count  one and enter an acquittal.  I would also allow the appeal
from  the  conviction on count #3.  It remains to  determine  the
proper  disposition of that charge.  The appellant  was  given  a
conditional discharge on that count.  It is now over eight  years
since  these  events  and  the  appellant  has  been  through   a
preliminary  inquiry and two trials.  Accordingly, I would  allow
the  appeal from the finding of guilt on count #3, set aside  the
verdict,  order  a new trial and enter a stay of  proceedings  on
that count only.  See R. v. Henderson (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 131
(Ont. C.A.) at 151-52.
