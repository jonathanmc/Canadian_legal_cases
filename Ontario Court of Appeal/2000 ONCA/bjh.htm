    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice L.T.G. Collins on
April 29, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant was convicted of the offence of robbery  and
sentenced  to eighteen months in closed custody. He  appeals  his
conviction on several grounds.</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Failure to permit cross-examination of a non-accused
          witness on the underlying facts of his criminal record
     
</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The trial judge erred in ruling that the defence could  not
cross-examine  Mr.  Johnson, the Crown&#146;s  main  witness,  on  the
underlying  facts  of  his criminal record:  see   R.  v.  Miller
(1998),  131 C.C.C. (3d) 141 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Davison,  DeRosie
and MacArthur (1974), 20 C.C.C. (2d) 424 (Ont. C.A.). However, we
agree  with  Crown counsel&#146;s position, as set out in her  factum,
that  no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has resulted
from this error. Of particular significance is the fact that this
was  a  trial  by judge alone and the record confirms  the  trial
judge&#146;s  appreciation for the relevance of Mr. Johnson&#146;s criminal
record  in the assessment of his credibility. Further,  it  would
appear  from the record that the ruling had a minimal  effect  on
the overall conduct of the cross-examination.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Vetrovec warning</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  appellant  submits  that,  although  the  trial  judge
expressly  and correctly instructed himself that a Vetrovec  type
warning was appropriate in the circumstances of this case, he did
not  properly apply the substance of the warning. Counsel for the
appellant  noted  a number of difficulties with  respect  to  Mr.
Johnson&#146;s evidence and argues that these matters should have been
adverted  to  by the trial judge. We are not persuaded  that  the
trial  judge  fell  into error as alleged. Although  his  reasons
could have been more complete, we see no reason to conclude  that
the  trial judge did not advert to the obvious weaknesses in  the
case. His repeated reference to the need for caution  could  only
be in reference to those difficulties.</pre>
    <pre>     3.   Alibi
</pre>
    <pre>[4]   In  our  view,  the trial judge&#146;s finding  that  the  alibi
evidence  did not negate the opportunity to commit this crime  is
entirely  supported  by the evidence. We see  no  merit  to  this
ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     4.   Unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[5]   It  was  open  to the trial judge to accept  Mr.  Johnson&#146;s
evidence and to convict the appellant on this basis. It cannot be
said that the verdict is unreasonable.
[6]  The appeal is dismissed.
