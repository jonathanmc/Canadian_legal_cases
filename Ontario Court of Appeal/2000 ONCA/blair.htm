<p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the conviction by The Honourable Madam Justice 
  Gloria J. Epstein, dated December 16, 1997.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>

  </span> The appellant, Cleveland Blair, appeals from his convictions for trafficking 
  in a narcotic and possession of the proceeds of crime.  The only ground of appeal 
  concerns a ruling by Epstein J. on a pre-trial defence application to compel 
  the Crown to disclose the precise location from which a police officer made 
  observations of purported drug transactions.  The trial judge dismissed the 
  application and did not order disclosure of the police observation post.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On February 27, 1996, a team of police officers was detailed to investigate 
  reports of drug trafficking at a restaurant called the Queen’s House Bar located 
  at 1336 Queen Street West.  P.C. Preston maintained surveillance on the premises 
  and purported to observe the appellant sell cocaine on two occasions outside 
  the main entrance doorway of the restaurant.  The two purchasers were arrested 
  and found in possession of cocaine.  P.C. Preston radioed a description of the 
  seller to the other officers.  The police entered the restaurant and arrested 
  the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The central issue at trial was the reliability of Preston’s identification 
  of the appellant as the seller.  Preston  made his observations from a location 
  in a three-storey building across Queen Street from the restaurant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the outset of the trial, before any evidence had been heard, counsel 
  for the appellant requested disclosure of the specific location from where Preston 
  made his observations.  Crown counsel resisted disclosure, relying on the public 
  interest privilege recognized in s. 37 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  His 
  reason for resisting disclosure was, as summarized by the trial judge in her 
  ruling:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>In this case the Crown has advised me that disclosure may 
  jeopardize ongoing or future investigations and may endanger the safety of the 
  owners or occupants of the particular space as a result of their willingness 
  to assist the authorities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge heard submissions on the pre-trial application.  She 
  recognized, correctly, that the protection of persons who co-operate in police 
  investigations is an important public interest. However, she also recognized 
  that it needed to be reconciled with the right of an accused to obtain full 
  disclosure from the Crown of relevant information in order to be able to make 
  a full answer and defence.  Ultimately, after weighing the competing rights 
  and interests, the trial judge dismissed the defence application.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, there is no basis on which to interfere with the trial 
  judge’s ruling.  We reach this conclusion for several reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, as mentioned above, the trial judge was aware of, and applied, 
  the correct legal principles.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, this was not a case where the accused had no information, or 
  even very little information, about the police observation post.  The accused 
  knew the building where Preston was located; it was a modest three-storey building.  
  The accused also knew how far it was from the restaurant and knew the conditions 
  between that building and the restaurant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, as the trial judge noted in her ruling, defence counsel was not 
  able to point to anything specific about either the observation post or its 
  general surroundings to indicate why the information she had already received 
  was inadequate in terms of providing a full answer and defence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Fourth, and importantly, the trial judge’s ruling was made before the 
  trial commenced.  Defence counsel sought, and the trial judge granted, permission 
  to renew the application during the trial:</p>
<p>Counsel: Am I still in a position where I would be allowed, based on information 
  I receive from Officer Preston during cross-examination, to raise my motion 
  for disclosure again at some point if I feel it necessary?</p>
<p>The Court:        Yes.</p>
<p>During the trial, the defence did not renew its application. In our view, this 
  is fatal to the contention that the specifics of the location of the observation 
  post were necessary to permit the appellant to challenge the reliability of 
  the identification evidence</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
