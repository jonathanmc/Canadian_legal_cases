      <pre><b>On appeal from conviction by Kent J., with a jury, dated November
13, 1997
</b></pre>
      <pre><b>BY THE COURT:</b></pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of sexual assault following a
trial before Kent J. and a jury.  He was sentenced to two years
imprisonment.  He appeals only his conviction and advances two
grounds of appeal: (1) the trial judge committed what has become
known as the “Coutts error”, that is he erred in instructing the
jury that if they disbelieved the appellant’s explanation and
concluded it was deliberately false, they could use the false
explanation as evidence of the appellant’s guilt; and (2) the
trial judge improperly exhorted the jury.
[2]  We did not call on the Crown on the appellant’s second
ground of appeal.  In our view, the trial judge’s exhortation did
not contain any of the inappropriate instructions found to amount
to reversible error in R. v. Farrell, [2000] O.J. No. 1376
(C.A.).
[3]  We turn then to the main ground of appeal.  To put this
ground of appeal in context, we briefly summarize the factual
background.
[4]  The complainant and the appellant had known each other
casually for a number of years.  Shortly before the incident in
question, the complainant began working for the same company as
the appellant.  One evening, the appellant, the complainant and
another employee went out for a night of drinking and partying.
At the end of the evening, the complainant accompanied the
appellant to a motel room where he had planned to stay for the
night.  The two had intercourse and the issue in the case was
whether this intercourse was non-consensual.  The complainant
alleged that, while they were alone in the motel room, the
appellant forced himself on her and had intercourse without her
consent.  The appellant gave evidence and denied the offence.  He
testified that he and the complainant engaged in consensual
touching, which progressed to intercourse, and that when the
complainant said “stop”, he did so.  Thus, the issue of consent
turned principally on the credibility of the complainant and the
appellant.
[5]  The appellant’s submission focuses on a single sentence in
the trial judge’s charge to the jury.  The sentence follows
immediately after what is otherwise a correct W.D. instruction.1
That portion of the trial judge’s charge, with the objected to
sentence underlined, is as follows:</pre>
      <pre>          … If you believe the accused’s explanation,
          you will acquit him.  Even if you do not
          believe his explanation it may still, either
          standing alone, or considered in light of
          other evidence, give rise to a reasonable
          doubt.  If there is a reasonable doubt, then
          you must acquit him.  Even if his explanation
          does not give rise to a reasonable doubt,
          because you reject it as untrue, then on the
          basis of all the evidence, you must determine
          whether you are convinced beyond a reasonable
          doubt of the guilt of the accused.  You must
          remember, therefore, that because you reject
          the accused’s explanation does not
          automatically mean that he is guilty.
          However, if his explanation is found by you
          to be deliberately false, you may take that
          false explanation as an item of evidence
          tending to prove his guilt. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[6]  In R. v. Coutts (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 at 551 (Ont.
C.A.), leave to appeal dismissed [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 450, Doherty
J.A. emphasized the importance of distinguishing between
rejecting an accused’s explanation and finding an accused’s
explanation to be concocted.  This distinction seeks to avoid
convictions founded merely on disbelief of an accused’s version
of what occurred:</pre>
      <pre>          If triers of fact were routinely told that
          they could infer concoction from disbelief
          and use that finding of concoction as
          evidence of guilt, it would be far too easy
          to equate disbelief of an accused’s version
          of events with guilt and to proceed
          automatically from disbelief of an accused to
          a guilty verdict.  That line of reasoning
          ignores the Crown’s obligation to prove an
          accused’s guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  By
          limiting resort to concoction as a separate
          piece of circumstantial evidence to
          situations where there is evidence of
          concoction apart from evidence which
          contradicts or discredits the version of
          events advanced by the accused, the law seeks
          to avoid convictions founded ultimately on
          the disbelief of the accused’s version of
          events. [References omitted.]</pre>
      <pre>[7]  In the light of the rationale underpinning Coutts, the trial
judge’s “deliberately false” instruction amounted to reversible
error.  A false explanation, even a deliberately false
explanation, cannot, without extrinsic evidence of concoction or
fabrication, provide circumstantial evidence of an accused’s
guilt.  The jury was never told that to rely on  a deliberately
false explanation as a piece of circumstantial evidence proving
guilt, there had to be extrinsic or independent evidence that the
explanation was concocted.  Nor was the jury directed to any
piece of extrinsic evidence from which they could conclude that
the accused’s testimony was concocted.
[8]  There was no evidence that the appellant’s version of what
occurred in the motel room was concocted.  Indeed, the only
possible extrinsic evidence of concoction was the testimony of
Tracy Cromwell, the appellant’s former girlfriend.  Ms. Cromwell
testified that the appellant told her to tell the police he had
been with her all night while the appellant gave a more benign
explanation of their conversation.  The appellant admitted that
he asked Ms. Cromwell to lie to the police but said that he did
so because he thought the police were investigating an
altercation he had had in a bar earlier that evening.  However,
the trial judge did not point to Ms. Cromwell’s evidence as being
capable of supporting a finding of concoction.
[9]  For these reasons, in our view, the trial judge should not
have instructed the jury that if they found the accused’s
explanation to be deliberately false they could use the false
explanation as evidence of his guilt. The danger in this
instruction is that the jury might have concluded that the
accused deliberately lied about what took place in the motel room
and then improperly used what they perceived to be a deliberate
lie as circumstantial evidence of the appellant’s guilt.
[10] The trial judge could have given an after-the-fact conduct
instruction in connection with Ms. Cromwell’s evidence that the
accused asked her to lie for him.  Such an instruction might have
been helpful to the jury.  His “deliberately false” instruction
was not only unhelpful, it may have misled the jury on the burden
of proof.
[11] This case troubled the jury.  The issue was simple and the
trial was short.  Yet the jury was out for six hours and had
several questions, including one on reasonable doubt.  We cannot
say that the trial judge’s erroneous instruction occasioned no
substantial wrong.  Therefore, in our view, the conviction cannot
stand.  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction is set
aside and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
