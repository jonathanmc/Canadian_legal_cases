      <pre><b>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Coo, Cusinato
and Ferguson JJ.) dated July 5, 1999.</b></pre>
      <pre><b>MACPHERSON J.A.</b>:</pre>
      <pre><b><u>INTRODUCTION</u></b></pre>
      <pre>[1]  This appeal arises from the failure of the appellant, Bloor
Italian Gifts Limited (“Bloor Italian”), to remit over $1 million
in provincial retail sales tax during the period December 1985 to
December 1991.  Bloor Italian was issued notices of assessment by
the provincial Ministry of Revenue (“Ministry”) demanding payment
of the unremitted tax plus interest and a 25 percent penalty.  At
issue is whether Bloor Italian can recover damages from its
accountant, the respondent Douglas Dixon (“Dixon”), and his
accounting firm, Arkay and Dixon.  Dixon failed to notice his
client’s liability for unremitted retail sales tax in the course
of preparing Bloor Italian’s yearly financial statements.
[2]  A majority of the Divisional Court upheld the trial judge’s
decision that the accountant was not liable for any damages
suffered by Bloor Italian in connection with the inadequate
retail sales tax remittances.  For the reasons that follow, I
would allow the appeal and find the respondents liable for 50
percent of the appellant’s recoverable losses.</pre>
      <pre><b>A.   <u>FACTS</u></b></pre>
      <pre>[3]  Bloor Italian is a retail business owned by Matteo and
Claudia Lauriola1 which specializes in the sale of bomboniere to
the Italian community.   Bomboniere are small gifts of
appreciation that are given to guests at weddings and other
festive occasions.
[4]  Dixon is a chartered accountant who provided bookkeeping and
accounting services for Bloor Italian from 1974 until 1991
pursuant to a letter of engagement between the parties that was
signed on a yearly basis.  Dixon prepared Bloor Italian’s annual
financial statements and corporate tax returns.
[5]  In terms of bookkeeping services provided to Bloor Italian,
Dixon’s staff prepared monthly summaries of financial data
contained in daily cash reports drawn up by Matteo Lauriola
(“Matteo”). Dixon’s staff then posted this information to Bloor
Italian’s sales journal and general ledger.
[6]  Dixon prepared Bloor Italian’s financial statements pursuant
to what is known as a review engagement.  A review engagement is
an intermediate form of financial reporting that requires the
accountant to make inquiries of management and perform certain
analytical procedures to determine if the financial information
contained in the client’s records is plausible.  A review
engagement is less onerous than an audit, which requires the
accountant to make inquiries of third parties and to test
internal control systems so as to ensure the accuracy of the
financial information provided by management.  A review
engagement is more onerous than a compilation engagement, which
requires the accountant to assemble information provided by
management without making any assessment of the plausibility of
that information.
[7]  A brief discussion of Bloor Italian’s practices in relation
to sales of bomboniere is necessary to understand the origins of
the retail sales tax problem that is behind this appeal.  When a
customer placed an order for bomboniere, Bloor Italian normally
accepted a deposit towards the purchase price.  The balance was
paid when the customer returned to pick up the order.  Before
1981, Bloor Italian collected sales tax on the entire purchase
price.  However, it only recorded and remitted sales tax on the
balance and not on the deposit.  In 1981, the Ministry conducted
an audit of the company which revealed that it had not been
recording and remitting the proper levels of retail sales tax.
Matteo referred the auditor to Dixon.  Several meetings were held
between Dixon and the auditor to discuss the problem.  Bloor
Italian was assessed $49,300.73 by the Ministry as a result of
the inadequate remittances.  Following the audit, Bloor Italian
purchased a new electronic cash register and developed new daily
cash reports.  In the fall of 1983, an auditor from the Ministry
conducted a spot follow-up audit and concluded that Bloor Italian
was collecting and remitting sales tax correctly.
[8]   At some time after the purchase of the new cash register,
the staff at Bloor Italian began to use the machine in such a way
that sales tax was not consistently recorded, despite the fact
that it was being collected on the entire purchase price from
customers at the time that the balance was paid.  The printout
tapes from the cash register, which did not disclose the proper
amounts of collected retail sales tax, were used by Matteo to
create the daily cash reports.  These reports, as well as the
register printout tapes, were provided to Dixon’s office for
entry into Bloor Italian’s sales journal.  Matteo also provided
to Dixon’s office copies of Bloor Italian’s monthly sales tax
remittance forms, which showed the remittance levels submitted to
the Ministry.  These forms were filed as required by regulations
under the Retail Sales Tax Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. R. 31, as
amended, and were signed every month by Matteo.  Dixon’s
bookkeeper entered this information on Bloor Italian’s sales
journal and general ledger and also summarized it on a monthly
basis.
[9]  These monthly summary statements revealed grossly inadequate
levels of retail sales tax.   For example, the monthly cash sheet
for March 1988 disclosed sales of $99,951 at one of Bloor
Italian’s stores while the total sales tax collected was
indicated as $51.33.  In December 1988, the total sales at the
same store were $19,651.41, while only $1.68 in retail sales tax
was recorded as having been collected.
[10]  In preparing Bloor Italian’s financial statements, Dixon
determined whether the sales tax shown on the company’s financial
records was the same amount that was remitted to the Ministry.
After the follow-up audit in 1983, Dixon did not check the
accuracy of the sales tax remittance levels.  A simple analytical
procedure of multiplying the total amount of sales by seven
percent to determine if the correct amount of tax was being
remitted was performed by Dixon in 1981 and 1982, but, on the
findings of the trial judge, not thereafter.
[11] In 1991, the Ministry assessed Bloor Italian for unremitted
retail sales tax during the period December 1985 to December 1991
in the amount of $1,126,830 plus interest and a 25 percent
penalty. The unremitted sales tax had been treated by Dixon as
revenue of Bloor Italian, which resulted in an overpayment of
income tax to Revenue Canada in the amount of approximately
$220,000 during the years between 1985 and 1991. Eighty percent
of this amount was eventually recovered.
[12]  Bloor Italian as well as Matteo and Claudia Lauriola
commenced an action against Dixon and his partnership for
negligence and breach of contract.  They alleged that Dixon was
negligent in not detecting Bloor Italian’s failure to remit
appropriate amounts of retail sales tax and in overstating the
company’s income by including the collected tax in income.  The
plaintiffs also claimed against the defendants for damages
arising from Dixon’s failure to submit Bloor Italian’s federal
sales tax inventory rebate application on a timely basis.</pre>
      <pre><b>B.   <u>JUDGMENTS BELOW</u></b></pre>
      <pre>(1)  <u>The Trial Decision</u>:  [1997] O.J. No. 3088.</pre>
      <pre>[13] The trial judge, the Honourable Justice Pitt, found that the
underpayment of retail sales tax was obvious:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>On the view that I take of the evidence, an accountant, 
even with a minimum of curiosity, could have realized, 
at least at the time of the preparation of each annual 
financial statement, that RST was being underpaid.  I 
say this, for among other reasons, because for the 
entire period under review, the tax remitted bore no
relationship whatever to sales as revealed in the 
financial statements.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[14] The trial judge held, however, that the plaintiffs’ claim
grounded in negligence could not succeed because the relationship
between the parties did not create a duty of care on Dixon’s part
to detect the underpayment of sales tax:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>The plaintiffs are not in the category of persons who 
could reasonably be said to be relying on Dixon for 
the reliability of their RST remittances.  Dixon was 
not negligent, as he owed no duty to the plaintiffs 
in the circumstances.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[15] The trial judge found another basis for rejecting the
plaintiffs’ claim.  He held that the scope of Dixon’s duty to the
plaintiffs ought to be determined on the basis of the contract
between the parties:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>In any event, the better view is that Dixon’s
liability has to be determined not on the basis of
a tortious breach of duty, but rather on the basis
of the contractual duty arising from his Letter of
Engagement, as qualified by the rules of the
governing body.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[16] After citing the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in
Central Trust Co. v. Rafuse, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147, and Haig v.
Bamford, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 466, the trial judge concluded that the
plaintiffs had not met the onus of demonstrating that the
defendant had breached a duty owed to them either in tort or in
contract.  He thus dismissed the plaintiffs’ claim arising out of
the provincial retail sales tax remittances.
[17] The trial judge granted the plaintiffs’ claim for damages
arising from Dixon’s late filing for a federal sales tax rebate,
which he assessed in the amount of $8,123.</pre>
      <pre>(2)   <u>The Divisional Court Decision</u>:  (1999), 125 O.A.C. 384.</pre>
      <pre>[18] The Divisional Court dismissed both the plaintiffs’ appeal
from the trial judge’s holding on the provincial retail sales tax
issue and the defendants’ cross-appeal from the determination of
liability for the late filing of the federal sales tax rebate
application.  The majority of the court (Coo and Cusinato JJ.)
held as follows:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>After careful review of the reasons and the points 
raised on behalf of both the appellant and the cross-
appellant, we find no error in principle or disregard 
or misinterpretation of evidence by the trial judge.  
We are not prepared to decide he was clearly wrong in 
his disposition of the case.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[19] The majority considered Bloor Italian’s argument that the
trial judge ought to have considered the issue of liability for
the negligence of Dixon’s bookkeeper.  This argument was rejected
on the basis that, “[t]he trial judge obviously concluded that
the bookkeeper’s obligation did not extend to analyzing the
adequacy of the sales tax remitted on the basis of information
received from the client; certainly not in the context of the
overriding limit placed on responsibility by the hiring agreement
between the parties.”
[20] The majority also dismissed the defendants’ cross-appeal,
noting that there was some evidence to support the trial judge’s
conclusions on the issue.
[21] Finally, the majority stated in obiter that:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>Had our view on liability been different, we would 
have been driven to return this matter for another 
trial.  There was not sufficient clarity and 
certainty of evidence on the issue of damages to 
enable us to revisit that issue afresh on appeal.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[22] Ferguson J. dissented.  He was of the view that a new trial
was warranted to determine the issue whether Dixon’s negligence
caused the plaintiffs’ damages in the form of the penalty imposed
by the Ministry.  He pointed out that the trial judge failed to
make a determination as to whether any conduct of the plaintiffs
was a cause of the imposition of the penalty and thus failed to
provide a basis for apportioning fault.  This failure was
significant, according to Ferguson J., in light of two omissions
from the trial judge’s reasons on the issue of the defendants’
liability:  first, the trial judge erred in not considering
whether there was negligence on the part of the bookkeeper, for
which Dixon would be vicariously liable; and second, the trial
judge failed to make a finding on whether the limitation of
liability in the engagement letter applied to the bookkeeping
services, in addition to the accounting services.  Ferguson J.
would have allowed the appeal and cross-appeal and ordered a new
trial.
[23] Bloor Italian appeals the Divisional Court’s decision
upholding the trial judge’s determination that the respondents
were not liable to the plaintiffs for failing to detect the
retail sales tax problem.  The respondents do not cross-appeal on
the issue of liability for damages arising from the failure to
submit Bloor Italian’s federal sales tax inventory rebate
application on a timely basis.  However, the respondents do make
a contingent cross-appeal on the question of damages.  They
submit that if Bloor Italian’s appeal is allowed, the damages it
receives should be reduced substantially because of its own
contributory negligence in failing to detect the retail sales tax
problem.  The respondents further submit that if the appeal is
allowed, the absence of findings by the trial judge with respect
to damages and contributory negligence necessitates that a new
trial be ordered.</pre>
      <pre><b>C.   <u>ISSUES</u></b></pre>
      <pre>[24] This appeal raises the following issues:</pre>
      <pre>     (1) Were the respondents negligent in their provision of
     accounting and bookkeeping services to the appellant?</pre>
      <pre>     (2)  If the answer to (1) is ‘yes’, can the respondents rely
     on an exclusion clause in their contract with the appellant
     to overcome their prima facie liability in negligence?</pre>
      <pre>     (3) If the answer to (2) is ‘no’, what damages should the
     appellant recover from the respondents?</pre>
      <pre><b>D.   <u>ANALYSIS</u></b></pre>
      <pre>(1) <u>The liability issue</u></pre>
      <pre>[25] It is undisputed that the relationship between Dixon and
Bloor Italian was such that the accountant Dixon owed the
appellant a duty of care to exercise reasonable skill and care in
the performance of his professional duties:  see Haig v. Bamford,
supra, and Hercules Management Ltd. v. Ernst and Young, [1997] 2
S.C.R. 165.  This duty arises quite apart from any contractual
obligations between the parties:  see Central Trust Co. v.
Rafuse, supra, and Jackson and Powell, Professional Negligence
(London:  Sweet and Maxwell, 1997) at 827.
[26] The real question is whether Dixon breached the duty he owed
by not meeting the standard of care of the reasonable
professional person in the circumstances of his relationship with
Bloor Italian.  This question needs to be addressed in the
context of both the accounting and the bookkeeping services
provided by Dixon to Bloor Italian.</pre>
      <pre>     (a)   <u>Accounting services</u></pre>
      <pre>[27] To establish whether Dixon’s conduct fell below the standard
of care required of a public accountant on a review engagement,
it is necessary to assess whether the applicable standard of care
would have resulted in the discovery of the retail sales tax
problem at issue.  In determining the standard of care required
of Dixon in these circumstances, the Canadian Institute of
Chartered Accountants Handbook (“CICA Handbook”) is of great
assistance.
[28] The CICA Handbook sets out the professional standards that
apply to accountants in conducting a review engagement. The CICA
Handbook explains that a review engagement consists “primarily of
enquiry, analytical procedures and discussion related to
information supplied to the public accountant by the enterprise
with the limited objective of assessing whether the information
being reported on is plausible within the framework of
appropriate criteria”. ‘Plausible’ is defined as “appearing to be
worthy of belief based on the information obtained by the public
accountant in connection with the review”.   The CICA Handbook
also stipulates that an accountant must apply “analytical
procedures such as comparing the current and prior period
information and considering the reasonableness of financial and
other inter-relationships… Explanations for relationships and
individual items that appear to be unusual would be obtained by
directing inquiries to appropriate personnel of the enterprise,
the responses to which the public accountant is entitled to
accept without examination of supporting evidence as long as such
responses appear plausible.”
[29] In addition, the CICA Handbook requires that the accountant
has sufficient knowledge of the business to make intelligent
inquiries and further that the accountant possess an appreciation
of matters that could have a significant effect on the
information being reported on.  The accountant must also ensure
proper supervision over any assistants he employs.
[30] A checklist prepared by the CICA includes the possible
existence of any sales tax liability, assessed or not, as an item
into which the accountant ought to inquire.  Another checklist
item requires the accountant and his staff to inquire about how
sales tax and other taxes are determined and recorded.
[31] Professional standards of conduct such as those prescribed
in the CICA Handbook provide a persuasive guide as to what
constitutes the standard of reasonable care for a professional:
see ter Neuzen v. Korn, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 674 at 696-698.   The
standards of conduct prescribed by the CICA Handbook throw
considerable doubt on the respondents’ assertion that retail
sales tax is too trivial an item in the financial statements to
prompt inquiries of management by an accountant.  This assertion
is not sensitive to the nature of the business for which the
accountant is conducting the review engagement.  In the case of a
retail business with a high volume of sales, unremitted retail
sales tax could  become a significant liability for the client.
[32] The CICA Handbook supports the conclusion that, at the
least, the applicable standard of care required Dixon to make
inquiries of management regarding the plausibility of Bloor
Italian’s stated retail sales tax liability.  The findings of the
trial judge also support this conclusion.  Paraphrasing the trial
judge, an accountant with even a minimum of curiosity could have
discovered the retail sales tax problem in issue. Furthermore,
the trial judge noted that “it would not have required much
effort on the part of the accountant at year-end to multiply the
sales shown on the financial statement by seven or eight percent,
depending upon the year, and compare it with the sum of the
twelve RST payments made during the year and thereby test the
‘plausibility’ or ‘reasonableness’ of the amount of taxes
actually paid.”
[33] Unfortunately, the trial judge fell into error in treating
the tort at issue as one that included a reliance component.  He
concluded that the plaintiffs’ claim could not be made out
because it had not been established that the plaintiffs were “in
the category of persons who could reasonably be said to be
relying on Dixon for the reliability of their RST remittances.”
However, reliance is not an element of a cause of action for
negligence:  see Allen M. Linden, Canadian Tort Law, 6th ed.
(Toronto and Vancouver:  Butterworths, 1997) at 99.
[34] In summary, Dixon was negligent insofar as he did not make
intelligent inquiries of management about the implausibility of
the indicated retail sales tax figures despite the glaring
discrepancies between sales and remittance levels and also
despite the fact that the amounts of collected retail sales tax
decreased from year-to-year at the same time that sales were
increasing.  Moreover, Dixon ought to have been sensitive to the
retail sales tax issue in light of the 1981 and 1983 audits
conducted by the Ministry.  Indeed, the auditor conducting the
1981 audit brought the problem of incorrect recording of sales to
Dixon’s personal attention.
[35] I am thus of the view that in failing to conduct an inquiry
into the plausibility of the indicated retail sales tax
liability, where the levels shown on the financial statements
were grossly incorrect and where the accountant knew that his
client had had significant remittance problems in the past, Dixon
fell below the standard of care required of an accountant
performing a review engagement.</pre>
      <pre>     (b) <u>Bookkeeping services</u></pre>
      <pre>[36] The appellant’s proposed alternative basis for liability,
namely, that Dixon breached the standard of care in respect of
the bookkeeping services his staff provided, cannot succeed.
None of the parties called any evidence to establish the standard
of care for the provision of bookkeeping services.   Without such
evidence having been led at trial, I would not give effect to
this ground of appeal.</pre>
      <pre>(2) <u>The exclusion clause issue</u></pre>
      <pre>[37] The respondents assert that the terms of the contract
between the parties as spelled out in the yearly engagement
letters between them exclude tort liability.  The engagement
letters included the following limitation on liability:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>Although   we   will   prepare  or  assist  in
preparing   your   financial  statements,  the
statements will  be  your representations  and
you   must  accept  responsibility   for   the
fairness of such representations.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>                           . . . . .          </pre>
      <pre>          We   wish  to  emphasize  that  control  over
          and  responsibility  for the  prevention  and
          detection    of   defalcations   and    other
          irregularities,  errors  and  omissions  must
          rest with you.</pre>
      <pre>[38] Insofar as this limitation applied to the accounting
services conducted by Dixon, it is consistent with the CICA
Handbook, which stipulates that a review engagement cannot be
relied upon by the client to prevent or detect error and fraud.
[39] Counsel for Dixon submitted, relying on Central Trust,
supra, that the effect of this contractual exclusion clause is to
negate any tort law duty of care otherwise owed by Dixon to his
client.  I do not accept this submission.  In my view, the
limitation clause comes into effect only if the accountant has
conformed to the standards that are required in conducting a
review engagement. The clause, on its face, does not excuse the
accountant’s negligence. It is instructive in this regard to read
the exclusion clause together with the following passage from the
accountants’ comments, which also  appear in the engagement
letter between Dixon and Bloor Italian:</pre>
      <pre>                     ACCOUNTANTS’ COMMENTS          </pre>
      <pre>          We     have    prepared   the    accompanying
          balance  sheet as at (date) and the statement
          of  income  for the (period) then ended  from
          the  records  of Bloor Italian Gifts  Limited
          and from other information supplied to us  by
          the  company.   In  order  to  prepare  these
          financial   statements  we  made   a   review
          consisting  primarily of enquiry,  comparison
          and  discussion of such information. However,
          in   accordance  with  the   terms   of   our
          engagement we have not performed an audit and
          consequently  do not express  an  opinion  on
          these financial statements. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      <pre>[40] An accountant cannot escape his responsibility to make
reasonable inquiries and comparisons and engage in a discussion
of information provided by management by relying on the
limitation that he is not responsible to prevent or detect error
or fraud.  The limitation clause is to the effect that it is not
the accountant’s responsibility to uncover errors or fraud.   The
clause does not negate the duty to see and report errors that
would be evident to an accountant acting reasonably in the
circumstances, and having detected them, to make the necessary
inquiries of management. Accordingly, the Supreme Court of
Canada’s holding in Central Trust, that an alternative liability
in tort will not be admitted if its effect would be to permit the
plaintiff to escape a limitation of liability, is not dispositive
of the instant case:  see also BG Checo International Ltd. v.
British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12 at
26-30. As Dixon failed to conform to the standards required in
performing a review engagement, he cannot avail himself of the
exclusion clause.</pre>
      <pre>(3) <u>The damages issue</u></pre>
      <pre>     (a) <u>Causation</u></pre>
      <pre>[41] It is next necessary to consider whether Dixon’s negligence
caused any or all of the damages complained of by Bloor Italian.
The Divisional Court upheld the trial judge’s findings on
liability but did not review his findings on damages on the basis
that there was not sufficient clarity and certainty of evidence
on the issue to do so.
[42] The trial judge determined that the plaintiffs had not met
the onus of proving the required causal nexus between Dixon’s
alleged negligence and the imposition of the penalty by the
Ministry.  He also concluded that the interest payments and
professional fees incurred by Bloor Italian were not recoverable
because of the plaintiffs’ failure to show that impecuniosity on
their part was what caused them to incur ongoing interest and
professional fees.  Accordingly, he held that the plaintiffs had
failed to discharge their duty to mitigate.
[43] The plaintiffs led evidence at trial to establish the losses
that Bloor Italian experienced as a result of the failure to
remit adequate retail sales tax to the provincial government.
These losses, which relate to the period between December 1, 1985
and December 31, 1991, included:  the penalty imposed by the
Ministry,  the interest on the  penalty assessed by the Ministry,
the cost of interest on the amount of retail sales tax assessed,
the non-recoverable income tax paid on the unremitted sales tax,
the interest costs related to the overpayment of income tax, the
interest income lost due to federal corporate income tax years
deemed to be statute barred, and professional fees, both legal
and accounting, which were incurred to rectify the various
problems caused by the sales tax assessment.  The plaintiffs’
expert, John M. Rosenthal, C.A., calculated these damages in the
total amount of $791,925, including prejudgment interest.
[44] Did Dixon’s negligence cause these losses?  The trial judge
did not make a finding on whether the retail sales tax
assessments covering the period December 1985 to December 1991
would have been avoided had Dixon noticed the inadequate
remittance levels.  Nor did the defendants’ expert address the
probable consequences of bringing the implausibility of the
retail sales tax figures to management’s attention.  The
plaintiffs’ expert was of the view that had Dixon done so, it
could have been the triggering event for a wholesale review.
Dixon himself testified that if he had noticed the discrepancies
between sales and remittance levels, he would have made inquiries
to determine the source of the problem.
[45] The evidence supports a finding of a causal nexus between
Dixon’s failure to detect the remittance problem and the
imposition of the penalty imposed by the Ministry.  The penalty
was foreseeable in light of Dixon’s past experience with the
consequences of an assessment against his client and in light of
the fact that s. 20(4) of the Retail Sales Tax Act provides that
the Ministry may levy a penalty where a vendor’s failure to
collect tax is attributable to neglect, carelessness, wilful
default or fraud.  Indeed, the Ministry specifically relied on
the language of this provision in making its decision to impose a
penalty.
[46] I reach the same conclusion with respect to the interest
that was levied by the Ministry in the notices of assessment.  It
was foreseeable by Dixon that interest would be charged on
inadequate remittance levels;  his negligence in failing to
detect the retail sales tax problem was a cause of the imposition
of this interest.
[47] It was also foreseeable that overstating Bloor Italian’s
income by treating unremitted retail sales tax as income would
lead to an overpayment in income tax that might not be
recoverable.   The heads of damages in the plaintiffs’ evidence
referred to as non-recoverable corporate income taxes, interest
costs relating to non-recoverable corporate income taxes and
interest income lost are thus recoverable by the appellant.
[48] However, I would agree with the decision of the majority of
the Divisional Court not to interfere with the trial judge’s
finding that Dixon was not the cause of the interest charges
incurred by Bloor Italian following the due date for complying
with the notices of assessment.   Nor is he liable for the
professional fees claimed by Bloor Italian.   Over the course of
December 1985 to December 1991, Bloor Italian had the use of over
$1 million for its own investment purposes, which funds ought to
have been remitted to the province.  It was not foreseeable by
Dixon that Bloor Italian would be unable to repay these funds
without incurring debt and associated interest charges.
Considering that most of the professional services claimed by the
plaintiffs arose from refinancing efforts to pay the unremitted
sales tax, these costs similarly were not a foreseeable
consequence of Dixon’s negligence.</pre>
      <pre>     (b)  <u>Contributory negligence</u></pre>
      <pre>[49] In their contingent cross-appeal, the respondents raise the
issue of contributory negligence. The Negligence Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. N.1, provides in s. 3 that “if fault or negligence is
found on the part of the plaintiff that contributed to the
damages, the court shall apportion the damages in proportion to
the degree of fault or negligence found against the parties
respectively.” In my view, it is essential to consider
contributory negligence in calculating damages in this case.
[50] The personal plaintiffs, in particular Matteo, were
unobservant in failing to notice the underpayment of retail sales
tax.  Each month Matteo submitted forms to the Ministry, many of
which revealed grossly inadequate levels of retail sales tax
remittances.  The plaintiffs’ failure to notice this recurring
shortfall is particularly glaring in light of the owners’ past
experience with the 1981 and 1983 audits. One would have thought
this experience would have heightened awareness of the need to
accurately calculate and remit retail sales tax.
[51] The respondents assert that the record is insufficient to
permit this court to deal with the issue of contributory
negligence.  I disagree.  In my view, the record amply
demonstrates that both Dixon and Bloor Italian were very remiss
in not detecting the problem relating to the remission of retail
sales tax.  I would attribute equal responsibility to each party
for this omission.  Accordingly, I would hold the respondents
liable for only 50 percent of the recoverable damages specified
in these reasons.</pre>
      <pre><b>DISPOSITION</b></pre>
      <pre>[52] In the result, I would allow the appellant’s appeal from the
decision of the Divisional Court and order judgment in favour of
the appellant in the amount of 50 percent of the damages claimed
by the appellant, not including the claim for interest incurred
to repay the unremitted retail sales tax and the claim for
professional fees. Counsel may arrange a further appearance
before the panel if they cannot agree on the quantum of any of
the components of the damages.
[53] I would award the appellants its costs of the appeal in this
court and in the Divisional Court.  In light of the finding of
equal responsibility on the liability issue, I would order that
each party bear its own trial costs.
