    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Justice L.A. Beaulieu dated
November 10, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MACPHERSON J.A.
</strong>
<strong>Introduction</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]     On a typical winter morning almost anywhere in Canada the
silence of the pre-dawn hours is often broken by the sound of
municipal snowploughs.  Canadian taxpayers expect that their
municipal governments will move quickly and efficiently to keep
the streets and sidewalks clear and safe.
[2]     In many Canadian towns and cities, the municipal
governments enlist their own residents in the snow-clearing
enterprise.  Municipalities do this by enacting by-laws requiring
residents to clear the municipally owned sidewalks abutting their
properties of snow and ice within a prescribed period of time,
failing which they are liable to pay a fine.
[3]     Regularly, accidents take place.  A person walking on the
sidewalk falls and is injured.  Sometimes the injured person will
sue the municipality.  Occasionally, the municipality, relying on
its by-law, will look to the resident of the abutting property to
assume liability for the accident.
[4]     This appeal presents such a scenario.  The appeal invites
a consideration of the relationship between a municipality and
its own residents in the context of snow-clearing operations.
Specifically, the appeal presents the issue whether a municipal
by-law requiring residents to clear snow from the municipally
owned sidewalks abutting their residences can be relied on by the
municipality to shift civil liability to the resident when it is
sued by a pedestrian who falls and is injured on the sidewalk.</pre>
    <pre><strong>A.   Facts</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]     On January 23, 1997, Concetta Bongiardina fell on the
sidewalk in front of 168 Chancellor Drive in the City of Vaughan.
She was injured.  She brought an action against the City of
Vaughan.  She alleged that the accumulation of snow and ice on
the sidewalk constituted a hazard and a nuisance.  She framed her
Statement of Claim in the common law of negligence and in an
alleged breach of the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.
O. 2.
[6]     The City of Vaughan defended the action.  It also brought
a third party claim against the owners and occupants of the
residential property at 168 Chancellor Drive, Carlo and Carmela
Mangiapane.  The principal basis for the third party claim was
the city&#146;s own by-law which required owners and occupants to
clear the sidewalks abutting their properties of snow.  By-law
300-93 provided:</pre>
    <pre>          2.  The</pre>
    <pre>          (i)  Owners of &#133; occupied &#133; residential buildings
           &#133;, and

          (ii) Occupants of dwellings

          shall  clear  away  snow  and  ice  from  the
          sidewalks  on  the  highways  in  front   of,
          alongside  or  at  the rear  of  &#133;  the  land
          occupied   by  such  buildings  or  dwellings
          within  twenty-four hours  after  a  fall  of
          snow,  rain  or hail has ceased; and  if  the
          condition  of such sidewalk remains  slippery
          after  the removal of the snow and ice,  such
          owner  or  occupant shall cover the  slippery
          area with sand or salt forthwith.
          </pre>
    <pre>The  by-law also provided a penalty for breach of this  statutory
duty:</pre>
    <pre>          5.   Any person convicted of a breach of
          any provision of this By-law shall forfeit
          and pay a penalty at the discretion of the
          convicting justice.</pre>
    <pre>[7]     The Mangiapanes defended the third party claim.  In their
Statement of Defence they said:</pre>
    <pre>          5.    The Third Parties state that any breach
          of the City of Vaughan By-law number 300-93,
          which is not admitted but denied, in no way
          imposes civil liability upon the Third Parties
          as occupants of a dwelling.  Further, the Third
          Parties plead that the Corporation of the City
          of Vaughan cannot be relieved from any liability
          imposed on it by the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990,
          c. M. 45.</pre>
    <pre>The  reference  in  this paragraph to the Municipal  Act,  R.S.O.
1990,  c. M. 45, as amended by S.O. 1996, c. 32, s. 54(1), is  to
s.  284(1)  and  (4)  which imposes a duty on  municipalities  to
remove  snow  and  ice  from sidewalks  and  also  imposes  civil
liability on the municipality for breach of the duty.  Relying on
this legal position, the Mangiapanes brought a motion for summary
judgment in which they sought an order dismissing the third party
claim made against them by the City of Vaughan.
[8]     Beaulieu J. granted the motion for summary judgment. He
found that there were no facts in dispute and that  &#147;the legal
issue in this motion is a question of law as to whether the third
parties owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs and the defendant&#148;.
The essence of his reasoning on this legal issue is found in this
passage in his reasons for judgment:</pre>
    <pre>          [T]he Ontario courts have made it quite clear
          that owners and occupiers of a dwelling adjacent
          to a municipal sidewalk who          </pre>
    <pre>          are subject to a city by-law, such as By-
          law No. 300-93, do not owe a duty of care to
          users of the sidewalk since the remedies for
          falls on public sidewalks are found in the
          Municipal Act &#133; Furthermore, it has been
          decided by the Ontario courts that the
          Occupier&#146;s Liability Act &#133; does not apply.  A
          by-law requiring owners and occupiers of
          dwellings to remove snow and ice from public
          sidewalks adjacent to their properties cannot
          relieve the municipality from liability
          imposed by the Municipal Act. &#133; [Citations
          omitted.]</pre>
    <pre>[9]     The City of Vaughan appeals from Beaulieu J.&#146;s decision.

<strong>B.   Issues</strong></pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant raises three issues on the appeal:

(1)  Did  the motions judge err by not dismissing the motion for
     summary judgment as premature?
(2)  Did  the  motions  judge err in finding that  there was no
     genuine issue for trial because the respondents owed no duty
     of care to the plaintiffs or to the appellant?
(3)  Did  the  motions  judge err in dismissing the  third  party
     claim without adjudicating upon whether there was a genuine
     issue for trial with respect to the allegation that the
     respondents had caused a nuisance upon the sidewalk?</pre>
    <pre><strong>C.   Analysis</strong></pre>
    <pre>(1)  Motion for summary judgment - premature?</pre>
    <pre>[11] Rule 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
194, allows the parties to an action to bring a motion for
summary judgment.  Rule 20.01 grants this procedure to plaintiffs
and defendants.  Rule 20.09 extends the procedure to third party
claims.  There are no time limits in Rule 20; a party appears to
be able to bring its motion for summary judgment at any stage of
the proceedings.
[12] Rule 29.02(1) and (1.1) requires that a third party claim be
issued within ten days after the defendant delivers a statement
of defence, or within ten days after the plaintiff delivers a
reply to the statement of defence.
[13] The appellant submits that, reading Rules 20 and 29
together, a time limitation should be read into Rule 20 in third
party claim situations.  The appellant states its position
succinctly in its factum:</pre>
    <pre>        19.  It is submitted that Rule 20, as literally
        worded, should only apply to motions in a main
        action, as it assumes that the parties to a
        summary judgment motion have access to the facts
        underlying the alleged genuine issue for trial.
        In contrast, in a third party proceeding the
        parties may not have access to the facts forming
        the basis of the allegations in the statement of
        claim, if a summary judgment motion is brought
        prior to the discovery taking place in the main
        action.</pre>
    <pre>[14] I do not agree with the appellant&#146;s submission on this
issue.  There is nothing in Rule 20 to suggest that third party
claims are to be considered on a different footing from the main
action.  Indeed, the structure and contents of the rule suggest
that the rule is to be available to all parties (plaintiffs,
defendants and third parties) and all claims (main actions,
counterclaims, cross-claims and third party claims).
[15] There might well be cases in which it would be inappropriate
to bring a motion for summary judgment in respect of a third
party claim.  For example, if the third party claim could not be
resolved without detailed knowledge of the factual circumstances
that gave rise to the main action, a motion for summary judgment
would be premature.
[16] However, that is not this case.  The third parties in this
case, the Mangiapanes, have examined the City of Vaughan&#146;s
pleadings and concluded that, as a matter of law, they disclose
no cause of action against them.  In my view, they are entitled
to have this matter resolved at the outset of the proceedings.
If they are right, they deserve to be let out of the action now,
before they devote energies and money to defending it.

(2)  The duty of care issue</pre>
    <pre>[17] The appellant does not contend that the Mangiapanes&#146; alleged
breach of the snow-clearing by-law, in and of itself, gives rise
to tortious liability.  Such an argument is foreclosed by the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Canada v. Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool, [1983] 1 S.C.R. 205, where Dickson J. stated, at p.
227:          </pre>
    <pre>          The notion of a nominate tort of
          statutory breach giving a right to recovery
          merely on proof of breach and damages should
          be rejected, as should the view that
          unexcused breach constitutes negligence per
          se giving rise to absolute liability.

[18] The appellant&#146;s position is that breach of the by-law may
result in civil liability on the basis that non-compliance with
the by-law may serve as evidence of the breach of a common law
duty of care by the adjacent property owner.  As a general
proposition, there is merit in this submission.  In Saskatchewan
Wheat Pool, having rejected an independent tort of breach of
statute, the court proceeded to link breach of statute and the
common law of negligence.  Dickson J. said, at  225:</pre>
    <pre>          Breach of statute, where it has an
          effect upon civil liability, should be
          considered in the context of the general law
          of negligence.  Negligence and its common law
          duty of care have become pervasive enough to
          serve the purpose invoked for the existence
          of the action for statutory breach.

[19] The question then becomes: is there a common law duty on the
owner of the property to clear snow and ice from public sidewalks
adjacent to the property?  In my view, the answer to this
question must be &#145;No&#146;.  Although the &#145;neighbour&#146; principle from
Donoghue v. Stevenson, [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.), has been expanded
in recent years to cover a myriad of new relationships, it would
stretch it too far if it was applied in the circumstances of this
case.  A homeowner has a duty to ensure that his or her own
property is maintained in a reasonable condition so that persons
entering the property are not injured.  If the homeowner complies
with this duty, he or she should be free from liability for
injuries arising from failure to maintain municipally owned
streets and sidewalks. The snow and ice accumulating on public
sidewalks and the potholes on the street in front of the house
are the legal responsibility of the municipality, not the
adjacent property owner.
[20] There are two exceptions to this general principle.  First,
a property owner may be deemed in law to be an occupier of
adjacent public property if the owner assumes control of that
property.  Thus, in Bogoroch v. Toronto (City), [1991] O.J. No.
1032 (Gen. Div.), the court held that a store owner who used the
adjacent sidewalk to display its wares on a continuing basis was
an occupier of the sidewalk and subject to the duties imposed by
the Occupiers&#146; Liability Act.  Similarly, in Moody v. Toronto
(City) (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 53 (Gen. Div.), the court held, on a
motion for summary judgment, that the owners of the Skydome in
Toronto might be an occupier of the public walkways adjacent to
the stadium because of the &#145;special circumstances&#146; relating to
those walkways, including the almost exclusive use of the walkway
by Skydome patrons and the lack of alternatives to the walkways.
[21] The second exception to the general principle that a
property owner is responsible only for his or her property is
that the duty of care on the owner extends to ensuring that
conditions or activities on his or her property do not flow off
the property and cause injury to persons nearby.  An example of a
case in this category would be Brazzoni v. Timmins (City), [1992]
O.J. No. 254 (C.A.), where the court held both the City of
Timmins and the Toronto-Dominion Bank liable for injuries
suffered by a person who fell on snow and ice on a public
sidewalk near the bank.  Referring to the bank&#146;s liability, the
court said, at p.2:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>[T]he trial judge found that water flowed from 
the respondent&#146;s property across the sidewalk at 
the time the plaintiff fell.  By allowing the 
water from melting snow, on the roof of its 
building and from its parking lot, to accumulate 
on its property and to run across the sidewalk 
which was covered with snow and ice, the 
respondent, in our opinion, created a dangerous 
condition that it knew or ought to have known 
could cause injury to pedestrians using the 
sidewalk.  Regardless of whether liability is 
based on nuisance or negligence, the respondent, 
in our opinion, is liable.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>See also Taylor v. Robinson, [1933] 3 D.L.R. 73 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[22] Neither of these exceptions applies in the present case.
[23] The appellant does not claim that the third parties took any
steps, as in Bogoroch or Moody, to become occupiers of the
sidewalk in front of their home.
[24] The appellant does claim against the third parties in
negligence and in nuisance.  However, the pleadings make no
allegation, as in Brazzoni and Taylor, that the third parties did
or failed to do anything on their property which created a hazard
on the adjacent public sidewalk.  The only relevant pleading in
the third party claim is paragraph 5:          </pre>
    <pre>          5.  This defendant pleads that the third
          parties knew or ought to have known that this
          defendant was relying upon them to keep the
          sidewalk adjacent to their premises clear in
          accordance with the said by-law, and that
          they accordingly had a duty to take
          appropriate care under all the circumstances.</pre>
    <pre>It is clear from this paragraph that the complaint of the City of
Vaughan  is  that the Mangiapanes did not clear the  sidewalk  in
front  of their home, not that they did or failed to do something
on  their  property  that created a hazardous  condition  on  the
sidewalk.
[25] Since neither of the exceptions apply, it follows that there
is no evidence on which to found a common law duty on the
Mangiapanes to keep the adjacent public sidewalk clear of ice and
snow.
[26] The remaining question is whether the City of Vaughan&#146;s by-
law alters the common law picture.  In my view, it does not.  In
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool, Dickson J. stated, at p. 223:          </pre>
    <pre>          Glanville Williams is of the opinion,
          with which I am in agreement, that where
          there is no duty of care at common law,
          breach of non-industrial penal legislation
          should not affect civil liability unless the
          statute provides for it.

[27] Neither the Municipal Act nor the City of Vaughan by-law
purports to impose civil liability on the owner of property
adjacent to public sidewalks.  Indeed, s.284 of the Municipal Act
imposes a duty on municipalities to keep highways (which include
sidewalks) in a reasonable state of repair.  It is doubtful that
a municipality could circumvent this duty by trying to impose a
replacement duty on its own residents:  see Slumski v. Mutual
Life Assurance Co. of Canada, [1994] O.J. No. 301 (Div. Ct.),
Lutz v. City of Toronto (1975), 8 O.R. (2d) 16 (H.C.), and
Gandara v. Toronto (City) (1994), 22 M.P.L.R. (2d) 220 (Ont. Gen.
Div.).
[28] Finally, I note that there does not seem to be any good
reason in policy to extend liability to the owners of adjacent
properties for accidents on public sidewalks.  In an excellent
discussion of the relationship between tort law and snow-clearing
by-laws in his leading text, Canadian Tort Law, 6th ed. (Toronto:
Butterworths, 1997), A.M. Linden states, at p. 319:          </pre>
    <pre>          [T]he courts probably do not sympathize
          with the policy of these ordinances &#133; As long
          as the city is enlisting property owners as
          deputy street commissioners to assist in its
          primary responsibility, the court will not
          object, but when the municipality attempts to
          relieve itself completely of its obligation,
          the court refrains from encouraging this.
          There is also the feeling of unfairness
          toward the abutter, who is not only made to
          tend the public sidewalk on behalf of the
          municipality, but to bear a civil obligation
          to anyone injured by the omission to do so.

[29] For these reasons, I do not think that the motions judge
erred when he concluded that the third parties did not owe a duty
of care to pedestrians using the sidewalk adjacent to their home.
Nor did he err when he decided that the City of Vaughan&#146;s by-law
did not alter the common law duty. It follows that the motions
judge was correct in granting summary judgment to the respondents
on the ground that the appellant&#146;s third party claim failed to
disclose a genuine issue for trial.

(3)  The nuisance issue</pre>
    <pre>[30] The appellant asserts that the motions judge erred in
dismissing the third party claim without adjudicating upon
whether there was a genuine issue for trial concerning whether
the third parties had caused a nuisance on the sidewalk.
[31] I disagree.  As discussed in the previous section of these
reasons, in its pleadings the appellant makes no claim that the
third parties did or failed to do anything on their property that
created or contributed to a hazard on the adjacent sidewalk.
Accordingly, the line of nuisance cases represented by Brazzoni
v. Timmins (City), supra, and Taylor v. Robinson, supra, is not
in play in this litigation.</pre>
    <pre><strong>DISPOSITION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[32] I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
