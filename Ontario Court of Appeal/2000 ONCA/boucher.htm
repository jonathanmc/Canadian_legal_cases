    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order by Mr. Justice O'Neill dismissing the
application to quash the order to stand trial dated July 23, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Sometime on February 22, 1999, two persons wearing
balaclavas robbed a branch of the Bank of Montreal in the City of
Timmins of $20,000.  Sometime later (the date is uncertain), the
appellants and a fourth person, Jeffrey Sabourin, were charged
with offences relating to that robbery.
[2]  Following a preliminary inquiry, the three appellants and
Sabourin were ordered to stand trial by Carr J. on the following
charges:</pre>
    <pre>  Harju:        masked with intent to commit an indictable
 	        offence, robbery and breach of probation</pre>
    <pre>  Vaillancourt: masked with intent to commit an indictable 
	 	offence and robbery</pre>
    <pre>  Boucher:	robbery and three counts of breach of probation

  Sabourin: 	possession on February 22, 1999 of stolen $10 
		bills
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellants and Sabourin applied to quash the order to
stand trial.  O&#146;Neill J. dismissed the application, except for
one count of breach of probation for Boucher and the charge
against Sabourin.  He found that the cumulative effect of the
circumstantial evidence provided, at least, a scintilla of
evidence on each element of the other offences.  The appellants
now appeal from that judgment.
[4]  All of the charges, including the remaining charges of
breach of probation, arise out of the bank robbery.  The theory
of the Crown appears to be that Harju and Vaillancourt were the
two masked men who entered the bank and stole the $20,000 and
that Boucher was a party to the offence by providing
transportation from the bank.
[5]  Having regard to the manner in which the preliminary inquiry
was conducted, including the appellants&#146; failure to object to the
admission of evidence relating to certain business records, it
would be open to a trier of fact to find the following:</pre>
    <pre>
          (a)  At 9:30 a.m. on February 22, 1999, Harju 
	  and two men purchased two balaclavas and a 
	  pair of sunglasses from the Timmins Wal-Mart;</pre>
    <pre>          (b)  The three men left the Wal-Mart store
          parking lot in a vehicle similar in description 
	  to the vehicle owned by Boucher;</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  The bank robbery occurred at about 2:00
          p.m. on February 22nd and was carried out by
          two men wearing balaclavas;</pre>
    <pre>          (d)  One of the men was wearing heavy white
          running shoes and black &#147;tear-away pants&#148;;</pre>
    <pre>          (e)  The second man was wearing jogging pants;</pre>
    <pre>          (f)  Ten to fifteen minutes after the robbery
          was reported to the police, Vaillancourt and
	  another man ran into the G.V. Hotel, located
 	  one to two miles from the bank;</pre>
    <pre>          (g)  Vaillancourt was wearing black tear-away
	  pants with a white stripe and carrying a black
	  bag;</pre>
    <pre>          (h)  Seconds later, a car similar to Boucher&#146;s
	  car drove towards the hotel in the same
	  direction as the men were running, the driver
	  did not stop at a stop sign;</pre>
    <pre>          (i)  Five to ten minutes later, a man (not one
	  of the appellants) wearing something black
 	  entered the hotel;</pre>
    <pre>          (j)  About twenty minutes after he entered the
	  hotel, Vaillancourt, together with Boucher and
	  Harju, left the hotel and entered a taxi;</pre>
    <pre>          (k)  Vaillancourt had changed his clothing and
	  was now wearing jeans.  He was still carrying
	  the black bag;</pre>
    <pre>          (l)  Boucher was wearing black clothing;</pre>
    <pre>          (m)  In the hotel, the police found clothing
	  similar to that worn by Vaillancourt as he
	  entered the hotel;</pre>
    <pre>          (n)  A few days later, Vaillancourt and Sabourin
	  were arrested while on a bus going from Barrie
 	  to Timmins;</pre>
    <pre>          (o)  One of the bills stolen from the bank was
	  in a bag near where Sabourin was seated and
	  where Sabourin&#146;s jacket was found;1 and</pre>
    <pre>          (p)  When Boucher&#146;s car was searched a few days
	  after the robbery, the police found a gas receipt
 	  showing Boucher bought gas in Timmins on the
	  morning of the robbery and a rent receipt for
	  Harju&#146;s apartment.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  It will be seen that there are a number of gaps in this
evidence.  As to Boucher, there is no direct evidence that
Boucher was in the Wal-Mart with the other men or that his car
was the one seen in the parking lot.  There is no direct evidence
that Boucher was driving the car seen in the vicinity of the
hotel after the robbery.  While it might be inferred that bank
robbers should have a getaway vehicle, there is no direct
evidence that Boucher&#146;s car was involved in the robbery.
[7]  As to Vaillancourt, the tear-away pants, as described by one
of the customers in the bank, differed in a material way (no
white stripe) from the tear-away pants Vaillancourt was wearing
as he ran into the hotel.  The witness who saw Vaillancourt run
into the hotel testified that he was shown some clothing taken
from the hotel and that it &#147;looked similar&#148; to that worn by
Vaillancourt.  As the officer who seized the clothing from the
hotel was never called at the preliminary inquiry, there is no
evidence as to how, and in what circumstances, that clothing was
found or indeed in what way it was &#147;similar&#148;.  While Vaillancourt
was seen to be carrying a bag as he entered the hotel, none of
the witnesses to the robbery described either perpetrator
carrying a bag.
[8]  As to Harju, there is no direct evidence that he was the man
with Vaillancourt who ran into the hotel after the robbery.
[9]  As to all the appellants, there is no physical evidence to
link them to the robbery.  The bill linked to the robbery was
found near Sabourin, but he was discharged.  The fact that he is
said to be an associate of Vaillancourt's and was on the same bus
going from Barrie to Timmins at some unknown time after the
robbery is not, in my view, evidence against Vaillancourt or the
other appellants.
[10] The Crown led no evidence as to the distance of the hotel
from the bank.  It is possible that a court in Timmins could take
judicial notice of the distance from the bank to the hotel, but
even the counsel who appeared before us who are from Timmins
could not agree on the distance.  It may be that a getaway car
was needed, but on this record, it is hard to tell.
[11] The appellants submit that there is no evidence from which
it can be inferred that they were parties to the robbery.  They
argue that at most there is speculation and suspicion.  The test
for quashing an order to stand trial is a strict one.  The
Superior Court can intervene only if there is an entire absence
of proper material as a basis for the formation of a judicial
opinion that the evidence was sufficient to put the accused on
trial: R. v. Martin, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 511 at 514.  This has also
been expressed as to whether there is a &#147;scintilla&#148; of evidence
on every element of the offence.  In this case, the only element
at issue is identity.
[12] In my view, there was evidence from which the following non-
speculative inferences could be drawn.  The car seen in the Wal-
Mart parking lot in which Harju and the other men left was
Boucher&#146;s.  It defies coincidence that Harju would be associated
with two different cars having the same somewhat distinctive
appearance as Boucher&#146;s.  It might also be inferred that Boucher
was driving his own car. In this respect, it defies coincidence
that Boucher and his car would be seen at the hotel around the
same time and Boucher would not be in possession of it.  It could
therefore also be inferred that Boucher was one of the two men at
the Wal-Mart with Harju.
[13] The question then is whether there is a scintilla of
evidence that the balaclavas purchased at the Wal-Mart by
Boucher, Harju and a third man were the balaclavas used in the
robbery a few hours later.  It they were, all three appellants
can be implicated in the robbery inasmuch as Vaillancourt was
seen with the other two within minutes of the robbery.
[14] It seems to me that the Crown&#146;s case depends upon the nexus
provided by the tear-away pants worn by one of the robbers and
the clothing worn by Vaillancourt as he ran into the hotel.
While tear-away pants are hardly distinctive clothing in this day
and age, I would, with considerable reluctance, be prepared to
find that they provided the requisite link to the robbery if the
descriptions matched.  Unfortunately for the Crown, the
descriptions do not match.  The bank customer who saw the robber
with the tear-away pants was closely questioned at the
preliminary inquiry.  She testified as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Q.  You said that you were looking at this first 
fellow's feet and you saw black tear-away pants 
with black snaps and you remember that clearly.</pre>
        <pre>A.  Absolutely.</pre>
        <pre>Q.  Because you were looking right at his feet.</pre>
        <pre>A.  I was . . . That was about the only thing I 
could see . . .</pre>
        <pre>Q.  Right.</pre>
        <pre>A.  . . .  from my vantage point.</pre>
        <pre>Q.  And if, in fact, there was any white striping 
at about the ankle, you would have clearly seen 
that but you didn't see that.</pre>
        <pre>A.  That's correct.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[15] The witness who saw Vaillancourt enter the hotel was equally
clear:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Q.  &#133;And what about Mr. Vaillancourt, what was he 
wearing when you saw him run by your establishment?</pre>
        <pre>A.  Those tear-away pants with the stripe going down.</pre>
        <pre>Q.  Okay.  If you can slow down on that one, please, 
Mr. Simard.  Tear-away pants?  Okay.  And can you 
describe a little more about what you mean by tear-aways?</pre>
        <pre>A.  They got buttons all the way down the sides.</pre>
        <pre>Q.  Snap buttons down the side and they're designed to 
be torn away, like warm-ups, basketball warm-ups?</pre>
        <pre>A.  Yeah.</pre>
        <pre>Q.  And was there anything else that was distinctive 
about these tear-away pants?</pre>
        <pre>A.  A white stripe.</pre>
        <pre>Q.  A white stripe.  And where did the stripe run in 
the pants?          </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>        A.  Hip to ankle.</pre>
    <pre>[16] As I said, the pants themselves were not produced in
evidence at the preliminary inquiry.  It may be that, if there
were other evidence linking Mr. Vaillancourt to the robbery, it
would be open to a trier of fact to find that the customer was
mistaken about the white stripe.  However, there is no other
evidence and so what remains is no evidence that the perpetrator
at the bank was Mr. Vaillancourt.
[17] The reasons for judgment of Pigeon J. speaking for the
majority of the Supreme Court of Canada in Chartier v. Quebec
(Attorney General), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 474 are of assistance.  This
was a civil action brought by the plaintiff against the police
and others because of the plaintiff&#146;s wrongful arrest and
detention.  The plaintiff was detained, arrested and ultimately
charged with manslaughter following a coroner&#146;s inquest.  (A few
days later, the real perpetrator was arrested.)  Prior to the
inquest, the police held a line-up and one of the witnesses to
the killing told the police, &#147;... I recognize him by his posture,
build, facial features, stomach, etc., but the only thing that is
different is that his hair was grey at the time of the incident.&#148;
Pigeon J. dealt with this statement at p. 494 as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In order for this statement to be an identification 
it would have been necessary to establish that 
appellant had grey hair at the time of the incident, 
otherwise the witness Holland was not identifying 
appellant but rather exonerating him. Regardless of
the number of similar characteristics, if there is 
one dissimilar feature there is no identification. 
According to the witness Holland, appellant did not 
have the assailant's grey hair. This witness 
therefore did not identify him; he merely noted a
resemblance.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18] Later, Pigeon J. dealt with the legal effect of this finding
at p. 499:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>For a peace officer to have reasonable and probable 
grounds for believing in someone's guilt, his belief 
must take into account all the information available 
to him. He is entitled to disregard only what he has 
good reason for believing not reliable.  [Emphasis 
added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] We are not here dealing with a police officer&#146;s civil
liability or the question of reasonable and probable grounds.
Nevertheless, it seems to me that the principles set out in these
passages apply in this case.  In view of the dissimilar feature
of the pants, there was no identification, merely a resemblance.
In the absence of some other inculpatory evidence, a resemblance
is no evidence.  If there were other inculpatory evidence it may
be that a trier of fact would have good reason for finding that
the customer&#146;s testimony was unreliable.  Since there was no
other evidence, the dissimilarity at worst renders the
resemblance of no probative value and possibly stands as an
exculpatory feature.
[20] On this record, I cannot find that there is a scintilla of
evidence to link these appellants to the bank robbery.
[21] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and quash the orders
to stand trial on all charges in relation to all the appellants.</pre>
