</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the reasons of Greer J. dated January 16, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>CARTHY J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an  appeal  from  a trial  judgment  finding  the
appellant,  Benaiah,  negligent in  the  conduct  of  a  criminal
proceeding  and  awarding  the  respondent  client,  general  and
special  damages. Greer J.&#146;s reasons are reported  at  (1998)  37
O.R. (3d) 686 (Gen. Div.). The appellants conceded negligence  on
the  part of Benaiah, attributable to the appellant law firm, and
the focus of the argument was upon damages.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]   Mr.  Boudreau&#146;s  criminal charges were  in  relation  to  a
custody  dispute with his former spouse arising from the  removal
of his son from the jurisdiction contrary to a custody order. Mr.
Boudreau abducted his son, Luke, and took him to Hawaii. He  used
a  complex scheme to accomplish this abduction and flew to Hawaii
using  an  assumed name. His mother and his half-brother assisted
him in carrying out his plan and in completing the abduction. Mr.
Boudreau had an &#147;extortion note&#148; delivered to his spouse and made
threats to her in that note, which indicated that if she did  not
go along with his wishes, she would never see her son again.
[3]  On November 13, 1990, Mr. Boudreau was arrested and returned
to Canada where he was charged with abduction, taken into custody
and denied bail. Shortly after Mr. Boudreau&#146;s arrest, his mother
and half-brother were charged as accomplices. The following
factual recitation is taken from the findings of the trial judge
who accepted Boudreau&#146;s evidence where it conflicted with that of
Benaiah.
[4]  Mr. Boudreau first retained lawyer Richard LeDressay to help
him negotiate a plea bargain with the Crown that would include
the withdrawal of charges against the co-accused. In December
1990, Mr. Boudreau discharged Mr. LeDressay and retained the law
firm of Rosen, Fleming. Mr. Benaiah was assigned to his file.
Despite a number of planned meetings, Mr. Benaiah did not meet
with Mr. Boudreau until January 6, 1991. At this meeting, Mr.
Boudreau signed legal aid documents. His defence was not
discussed. In fact, Greer J. found that Mr. Benaiah never
discussed the merits of the case with Mr. Boudreau.
[5]  On January 7, Mr. Benaiah scheduled a bail review hearing
for January 21. On January 22 after a two-day hearing, LeSage J.
denied bail because he considered Mr. Boudreau a flight risk and
likely to engage in further criminal activity. Following the
denial of bail, a preliminary hearing was fixed for February 19.
On January 27, 1991, Mr. Benaiah met with Mr. Boudreau to discuss
his case. The discussion turned to negotiating a plea bargain.
Mr. Boudreau&#146;s evidence was that he insisted that any plea
bargain include the withdrawal of charges against his mother and
half-brother. Mr. Benaiah told him he would have information to
him regarding a possible plea bargain by January 31, 1991. Mr.
Benaiah did not contact the Crown until February 7, 1991, at
which point he wrote to the Crown. Mr. Benaiah also failed to
meet with or speak to the respondent at two previously scheduled
meetings on February 17 and 18 and did not meet with him again
until minutes before the preliminary hearing on February 19,
1991.
[6]  On February 19, 1991, Mr. Benaiah met with Mr. Boudreau and
advised him that a plea bargain had been struck. Mr. Benaiah said
that he would be asking the judge for a sentence of time served
and that there was a strong chance that Mr. Boudreau could return
home that day. Mr. Boudreau initially rejected the plea bargain
because he did not understand it to include the withdrawal of
charges against his mother and half-brother. Mr. Benaiah&#146;s
reaction was to threaten to withdraw his services, claiming that
rejecting the deal could mean an additional one-year in jail. The
preliminary hearing could not proceed on that day as the
witnesses had been excused with Mr. Benaiah&#146;s permission.
Believing that he had no choice, Mr. Boudreau pled guilty to the
charges of abduction and breach of probation in accordance with
the plea bargain. Mr. Boudreau was sentenced to six months in
respect of abduction and three months in respect of breach of
probation to run consecutively. Mr. Benaiah said that he would
appeal the sentence and spoke of applying for bail pending
appeal. He did not file a sentence appeal immediately, and by the
time he did so, Mr. Boudreau was due to be released on parole
and, therefore, Legal Aid considered the appeal to be
unwarranted.
[7]  Mr. Boudreau&#146;s evidence at trial was that he only learned
during discoveries in his action against the appellants that the
Crown had given Mr. Benaiah an undertaking to drop the charges
against his mother and half-brother for a guilty plea by him.
Greer J. found that information regarding this undertaking was
never conveyed to Mr. Boudreau (or anyone else) by Mr. Benaiah
either at the time of the plea or later, nor did Mr. Benaiah
follow-up on the undertaking, document it, or take any steps to
ensure it was followed. Both Mr. Boudreau&#146;s mother and half-
brother were convicted of the charges against them.
[8]  Greer J. concluded that Mr. Benaiah failed to properly
communicate with his client and that he failed to meet the
standard of the ordinary competent criminal counsel in a number
of aspects. In her view, Mr. Benaiah&#146;s negligence was related to
an accumulation of incidents and failures on his part. The trial
judge also found that Mr. Boudreau was not attempting to
relitigate his criminal case and that Mr. Boudreau accepted that,
given the facts of his case, he would likely have been found
guilty in any event.
</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The appellants accepted the trial judge&#146;s findings of  fact
regarding  Mr. Benaiah&#146;s breach of duty of care and  accordingly,
this  issue  was  not pursued before this court. The  appellants&#146;
submissions  focussed  upon the damage awards.  The  trial  judge
awarded  damages  under  three heads:   (1)  $30,000  for  mental
distress  for  Mr.  Benaiah&#146;s negligence;  (2) $5000  in  special
damages for legal fees paid by Legal Aid to the appellant and  to
be paid over to Legal Aid upon recovery; and (3) $2000 in special
damages for a payment by the respondent toward his mother&#146;s legal
fees.
[10] Dealing with these damage awards in reverse order, I see no
basis in the evidence for attributing any payment to the mother
to the appellants&#146; conduct. The respondent&#146;s $2000 payment to his
mother was an assignment of a debt, made prior to these events.
His mother&#146;s use of that money could, at best, lead to a claim by
the mother against the lawyer to whom it was paid. This event is
entirely disassociated from the appellants&#146; conduct of the
respondent&#146;s defence.
[11] Secondly, the Legal Aid account is a matter of concern to
Legal Aid and the law firm &#150; not to the respondent who had no
contributory obligation under his certificate. The respondent
cannot assert a claim on behalf of Legal Aid and, even if he
could, there is real question as to whether there was a total
failure of consideration. There is no suggestion that the result
obtained for the respondent was not the best that could be
accomplished. The respondent&#146;s loss, if any, was not in the
result of the proceedings &#150; it was in the psychiatric
consequences of the appellants&#146; misconduct of the proceedings.
[12] The award of damages of $30,000 was based upon evidence of
mental distress arising from Benaiah&#146;s conduct. In my view there
was evidence from the respondent&#146;s expert psychiatrist, Dr.
Posner, to support a finding that the misconduct of the
appellants leading to, and including, the conviction was a cause
of the respondent&#146;s depression. In oral argument, the appellants
conceded that damages for mental distress are recoverable. The
appeal proceeded on this basis. Dr. Posner assessed the emotional
impact the actions of Mr. Benaiah had upon Mr. Boudreau. When
asked in cross-examination which actions of Mr. Benaiah had an
emotional impact on Mr. Boudreau, Dr. Posner gave the following
answer:
          </pre>
    <pre>  Well, initially even prior to the guilty plea there are a
  series of actions which promote ongoing frustration. It could
  possibly be summarized with them, with a sentence not being
  heard, not being listened to, not being taken seriously. I say I
  want a defence. You say I am going for a deal. I say I want to
  get out. You say two more weeks. Two more weeks come, I say I
  want to get out. You say two more weeks and that goes on.
     </pre>
    <pre>          
  There is the feeling of betrayal that is growing as
  that time goes on as well that Mr. Boudreau discussed with
  me. Then the forced guilty plea I think is, and I say
  forced. I should probably qualify that. Mr. Benaiah did not
  grab Mr. Boudreau&#146;s arm behind his back and twist until he
  yelled guilty. I am making the assumption that an average
  person who is not that familiar with the court system who is
  brought before the court and whose only attachment to the
  mechanism of the court, that is his lawyer, suddenly pulls
  out, leaving this man to face the court or threatens to pull
  out leaving this man, pardon me, to face the sharks. I think
  the average person would have plead guilty in that situation
  regardless of what they felt. You may debate that. I think I
  would have pled guilty.
     </pre>
    <pre>  So what I was saying, this forced guilty plea and I
  will call it forced guilty plea, has put him in a position
  where Mr. Boudreau could not do something that is very
  important for Mr. Boudreau and that is to validate himself
  in the eyes of those that matter, and when I say those that
  matter, I mean Luke [Boudreau&#146;s son] eventually, Michael
  [Boudreau&#146;s son from an earlier marriage] eventually, and
  God. And to him God was very important, is very important.
  He couldn&#146;t validate himself to them and being an individual
  who looks for external validation that would have taken from
  him his own sense of being a valid person, a worthwhile
  person, and that, I believe, is the root or was at the root
  of the depressive and later anxiety symptoms that I
  discussed.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[13] Despite Dr. Posner&#146;s evidence, in speaking to damages in her
reasons,  Greer J. put the entire emphasis of the impact  of  the
appellants&#146;  conduct  upon  the  severance  of  the  relationship
between the respondent and his mother and half-brother. At p.  72
Greer J. concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>  In the case at bar, I have concluded that Boudreau has
  suffered from serious depression which is lessening but has not
  completely subsided. I am satisfied, on the evidence before me,
  that the majority of such depression and low self esteem has been
  caused by Benaiah&#146;s negligence in the handling of Boudreau&#146;s
  case. I am confident that such depression will subside, however,
  given the length of Boudreau&#146;s depression so far, I award
  Boudreau the sum of $30,000 for mental distress. Whether or not
  Boudreau&#146;s relationship with his Mother and his half-brother will
  ever be repaired is something one can only speculate on. I am,
  however, satisfied that the estrangement would not have occurred
  but for Benaiah&#146;s negligence in failing to communicate to anyone
  or in any way document the Undertaking given by the Crown to
  withdraw the Charges against Boudreau&#146;s Mother and half-brother.
  To lose one&#146;s familial ties because of the negligence of one&#146;s
  counsel, is a loss of great magnitude, and in my view, Boudreau
  must be properly and reasonably compensated for that loss which
  is tied into his mental distress. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[14]  In  my  view, there is no evidence to support a  connection
between   the  conduct  of  the  appellants  and  the  italicized
reference except the respondent&#146;s own evidence. His evidence  was
that his mother and his half-brother would no longer speak to him
and he surmised that this was because of the appellants&#146; conduct,
particularly the failure to assure that the undertaking  to  drop
the   prosecution   against  the  mother  and  half-brother   was
fulfilled. This surmise is not evidence upon which damages can be
founded. Without any evidence, the natural inference would be  to
assume   that   the  disenchantment  flowed  from  the   original
invitation  by  the  respondent to involve his  relations  in  an
elaborate  scheme to remove his child from the jurisdiction  and,
thus, bring the forces of justice upon their heads.
[15] It is thus my view that the trial judge erred in principle
in misconceiving the evidence and relying upon the break-up of
the family relationship in assessing damages.
[16] In summary, I have found that there was a basis for damage
based upon the psychiatrist&#146;s evidence that the respondent
suffered from the misconduct of the appellants. However, I must
discount the damages to remove any portion related to the
dislocation of family relations and conclude that an award of
$15,000 is appropriate.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  judgment will be set aside and in its place a judgment
will  issue for $15,000 damages and pre-judgment interest on  the
basis  established in the judgment appealed from,  together  with
costs at trial as stipulated in the court below. The Court may be
spoken  to  if  there are offers to settle prior  to  trial  that
affect costs below. The appellants shall have their costs of  the
appeal.</pre>

			          &#147;J.J. Carthy J.A.&#148;
			          &#147;I agree R.R. McMurtry C.J.O.&#148;


</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A. (dissenting in part):</pre>
    <pre>[18] Brian Boudreau was charged with abducting his 4-1/2 year old
son  Luke in contravention of a custody order and with breach  of
probation.  He was represented by Elyahu Benaiah, a young  lawyer
in  the  law firm of Rosen, Fleming.  Boudreau pleaded guilty  to
the  two  charges and was sentenced to nine months in  jail.   He
then  sued  Benaiah and the law firm for negligence in  defending
him.
[19] The trial judge, Greer J., found that Benaiah did not meet
the standard of a reasonably competent criminal defence counsel.1
She awarded Boudreau damages under three heads: $6,398.70 to be
paid to the Ontario Legal Aid Plan (&#147;OLAP&#148;); $2,000 representing
the amount he contributed to his mother&#146;s defence; and $30,000
for mental distress.  Benaiah and the law firm do not appeal the
finding of negligence. They appeal only the damage awards.
[20] I agree with my colleague Carthy J.A. that the awards on
account of Legal Aid and Boudreau&#146;s mother&#146;s defence cannot be
supported and should be set aside.  We disagree only on the award
for mental distress.  Carthy J.A. would reduce the award to
$15,000.  I would award Boudreau nothing.  Carthy J.A. finds that
although Benaiah&#146;s negligence did not cause Boudreau&#146;s
estrangement from his family, it did contribute to his depression
because the &#147;forced guilty plea&#148; prevented him from validating
his conduct.  I find no justification for compensating Boudreau.
He committed a horrendous crime for which he had no defence and
for which he alone must accept responsibility.</pre>
    <pre>Background Facts</pre>
    <pre>[21]  Carthy  J.A.  has set out the factual background.   I  will
summarize only those facts relevant to my decision.
[22] Boudreau was 36 years old when these events occurred.  He
had married Janet Ciprik, his third marriage, in 1984.  Their son
Luke was born in November 1985.  Boudreau and his wife separated
in 1989.  They waged a bitter custody fight, which included five
court orders in a period of ten months.  During this custody
fight, Boudreau was charged with assaulting his stepson, Ms.
Ciprik&#146;s son from a previous marriage.  He pleaded guilty and was
given a suspended sentence and probation.  He was on probation
when he abducted Luke.
[23] In March 1989, the court awarded Ms. Ciprik custody of Luke.
Boudreau was given access.  Boudreau abducted Luke on April 20,
1990.  He took him to Hawaii under an assumed name.  The
abduction was carefully planned and designed to deceive his wife
and the police about where he had gone.  Boudreau&#146;s mother and
half-brother assisted him in this devious scheme.  Boudreau then
had an &#147;extortion note&#148; delivered to Ms. Ciprik threatening her
that if she did not go along with his wishes she would never see
her son again.
[24] Boudreau kept Luke in Hawaii for over six months.  Ms.
Ciprik made frantic efforts to find her son at a cost of $20,000.
Never once did Boudreau contact her to tell her that Luke was all
right.  Finally Boudreau&#146;s girlfriend, who had corresponded with
him when he was in Hawaii, told the police his whereabouts.  On
November 13, 1990, Boudreau was arrested in Hawaii and taken back
to Canada.  Luke was returned to his mother.
[25] Boudreau was charged with abduction in contravention of a
custody order under s. 282 of the Criminal Code,2 with four
related criminal charges, and with breach of probation.  His
mother and half-brother were charged as conspirators and
accessories after the fact in the abduction scheme.
[26] Boudreau remained in custody until his trial.  He was denied
bail by a justice of the peace on both the primary and secondary
grounds.  At a bail review hearing in January 1991, LeSage J.
refused him bail as well, also concluding that Boudreau was a
flight risk and was likely to commit further crimes.
[27] Boudreau discharged his first lawyer in December 1990 and
retained Rosen, Fleming, which assigned Benaiah to the case.  On
February 19, 1991 Boudreau pleaded guilty to the charges of
abduction and breach of probation.  The other charges against him
were withdrawn.  On March 6, 1991, he was sentenced, in addition
to his pre-trial custody, to six months on the abduction charge
and three months consecutive on the breach of probation charge.
The sentencing judge concluded that Boudreau&#146;s conduct in taking
Luke to Hawaii was &#147;selfish and self-motivated.&#148;  He  &#147;gave
little thought or consideration&#148; for his wife or son.  Instead,
&#147;the only consideration&#148; he had was for himself.  Boudreau
appealed his sentence but later abandoned his appeal.  David
Humphrey, an experienced and highly regarded defence counsel,
whose expert evidence was accepted by the trial judge, testified
that Boudreau had no defence to the abduction charge and that the
sentence of nine months was reasonable.
[28] Still, Greer J. found that Benaiah acted negligently in his
defence of Boudreau.  His negligence consisted of &#147;an
accumulation of incidents and failures.&#148;  He failed to keep
appointments with Boudreau or answer his telephone calls, failed
to explore an &#147;imminent harm&#148; defence although that defence would
not have succeeded, discharged witnesses for the preliminary
inquiry without telling Boudreau, failed to write a timely letter
to Legal Aid for Boudreau&#146;s sentence appeal, and most serious,
failed to document or follow-up on the undertaking he said was
given by the Crown to drop the charges against Boudreau&#146;s mother
and half-brother, resulting in their being convicted on some of
these charges.  The finding of negligence is not attacked on this
appeal.  The issue on the appeal is whether Benaiah should be
held accountable for the damages claimed by Boudreau and awarded
by the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>The Damage Awards</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  The Legal Aid Account</pre>
    <pre>[29]   The   trial  judge  awarded  $5,817  for  the   fees   and
disbursements paid by OLAP to Boudreau&#146;s lawyer, plus OLAP&#146;s  ten
per cent administrative fee of $581.70, for a total of $6,398.70.
This amount was to be repaid to OLAP.
[30] This award is not supportable.  As Carthy J.A. points out,
the money paid by OLAP is a matter between it and the law firm.
Boudreau had no obligation to contribute under his certificate
and OLAP has not claimed reimbursement.</pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Boudreau&#146;s  payment to his mother</pre>
    <pre>[31]  The trial judge awarded Boudreau $2,000 representing  money
paid  to  his  mother for her legal fees.  This  award,  too,  is
unsupportable.   As  Carthy J.A. points out,  Boudreau  paid  the
$2,000  to his mother &#150; by assigning a debt that he was  owed  to
her &#150; well before he retained Benaiah.</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  Mental distress</pre>
    <pre>[32]  The  main  award  made by the trial judge  was  $30,000  in
damages  for  mental  distress.  The trial judge  concluded  that
Boudreau  &#147;suffered  from  serious  depression&#148;  and  that   &#147;the
majority  of such depression and low self-esteem has been  caused
by Benaiah&#146;s negligence in the handling of Boudreau&#146;s case.&#148;  Mr.
Anand,  counsel  for  the  appellants, acknowledged  that  mental
distress &#150; for example a serious depression &#150; caused by a  breach
of  contract or by tortious conduct is compensable by an award of
damages.3  Moreover, a reasonable lawyer should contemplate  that
a  failure  to  conduct litigation properly may  cause  a  client
unnecessary and thus compensable mental distress.  The  issue  in
this  appeal,  however,  is  whether Benaiah,  though  admittedly
negligent, should be held responsible for Boudreau&#146;s depression.
[33] The trial judge gave two reasons why Benaiah should be held
responsible.  The main reason, in her view was that &#147;Benaiah&#146;s
negligence in failing to communicate to any one or in any way
document the undertaking given by the Crown to withdraw the
charges against Boudreau&#146;s mother and half-brother&#148; caused
Boudreau&#146;s estrangement from his family.  What I take the trial
judge to be saying is that Benaiah&#146;s failure to ensure that the
undertaking was fulfilled resulted in Boudreau&#146;s mother and half-
brother being convicted, and that these convictions alienated
Boudreau from his family, thus causing his depression.
[34] Why the undertaking was not carried out is unclear on the
record.  Nonetheless I will accept for the sake of argument that
Benaiah&#146;s negligence in not documenting the undertaking led to
its not being carried out and therefore to the convictions of
Boudreau&#146;s mother and half-brother.  I agree with Carthy J.A.,
however, that the evidentiary record does not reasonably support
a causal connection between the convictions of Boudreau&#146;s mother
and half-brother and Boudreau&#146;s estrangement from them.  Neither
Boudreau&#146;s mother nor his half-brother testified, nor indeed did
any other member of Boudreau&#146;s family.  It is mere speculation
that his mother and half-brother would not speak to him because
of their convictions.  More likely, as Carthy J.A. has said, they
would not speak to him because he had enticed them into an ill-
conceived criminal conspiracy for which they faced serious
charges.
[35] Moreover, Boudreau&#146;s mother, who he acknowledged was his
main concern, was convicted in June 1992.  But Boudreau testified
that he was still speaking to her in 1994, two years after her
conviction.  Boudreau also acknowledged that he had little
concern about the undertaking to drop the charges against his
half-brother because &#147;he&#146;s a big boy and he could take care of
himself.&#148;  Thus, in my view, the evidence does not reasonably
support the finding that Benaiah&#146;s negligence caused Boudreau&#146;s
estrangement from his family.
[36] The secondary reason given by the trial judge for her award
of damages for mental distress and the basis for Carthy J.A.&#146;s
award of $15,000 was the evidence of Dr. Posner.  Dr. Posner, a
psychiatrist, testified that what he termed the &#147;forced guilty
plea&#148; was at the root of Boudreau&#146;s depression and later anxiety
symptoms because Boudreau could not &#147;validate himself in the eyes
of those that matter.&#148;
[37] In my view, Dr. Posner&#146;s evidence provides no justification
for an award of damages for mental distress.  Dr. Posner was not
Boudreau&#146;s treating psychiatrist.  Indeed, Boudreau sought no
psychiatric or psychological counselling during the entire period
between his marriage break-up, his abduction of Luke, and his
lawsuit against his lawyer.  He saw Dr. Posner only once for two
and one half hours, in May 1997 &#150; seven years after he abducted
Luke and shortly before this trial &#150; to obtain an opinion to
support his damages claim.  Even accepting this limitation on Dr.
Posner&#146;s ability to give an informed opinion, what his opinion
comes down to is that by pleading guilty instead of going to
trial Boudreau could no longer blame others for what happened to
him.  Dr. Posner acknowledged as much both in his examination-in-
chief and in his cross-examination.
[38] In chief, Dr. Posner testified that Boudreau&#146;s &#147;feeling
guilty, pleading guilty, hearing himself say I am guilty tore
away the defences that he was using&#148;.  Instead, Boudreau &#147;could
have if he lost, said the system messed me up or the judge messed
me up or my lawyer messed me up, but I am good.&#148;  Dr. Posner
elaborated on this opinion when he was cross-examined:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  And will you agree with me that the
	  coping mechanism that Mr. Boudreau used to
	  defend himself in these circumstances was 
	  first and foremost to blame everything else
	  for his problems?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  There are technical words for that.
          There is a component of what we call
          externalizing blame, yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  Let me break it down.  What you
          describe at the end of your examination in-
          chief that process related to actually
          proceeding to trial rather than pleading
          guilty, right, you remember that?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  That&#146;s right, yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.  And your suggestion was that even if
          he went to trial and he lost that because he
          could blame the system, the courts, the
          lawyers, someone else for his problems and
          thereby sustain his self-esteem and that was
          the type of person that Mr. Boudreau was and
          is in your analysis?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.  I believe that that is a prominent
          coping mechanism used by him to avoid feeling
          decimated, yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
In other words, Boudreau was denied the &#147;external validation&#148;
that he sought.</pre>
    <pre>[39]  I  confess I find extraordinary the notion that  the  court
should  compensate a person for being deprived of the  chance  to
blame  everyone  but himself for the crime that he  committed,  a
crime  that  victimized his 4-1/2 year son  and  his  wife.   Why
should Boudreau not &#147;feel guilty&#148; for this crime?  He was guilty.
If  all that Benaiah&#146;s negligence caused was Boudreau&#146;s inability
to blame others, then I do not see how an award of damages can be
supported.
[40] Moreover, what Dr. Posner&#146;s evidence ignores is that
Boudreau had the opportunity to &#147;validate&#148; himself at his
sentencing hearing two weeks after his guilty plea.  Boudreau
testified at this hearing and sought to justify his actions.  His
justification was implicitly rejected by the sentencing judge,
who considered Boudreau&#146;s actions entirely selfish.
[41] The so-called forced guilty plea cannot support the award of
mental distress damages for another reason.  To allow the guilty
plea to support the damages award would amount to an
impermissible collateral attack on the criminal proceedings.
Boudreau argues that his claim for damages is not a collateral
attack on the criminal proceedings because he attacks not the
substantive outcome of those proceedings but the process.  He
complains not about his convictions and his sentence, implicitly
conceding that he could not have obtained a better result, but
about the way he was convicted, being &#147;forced&#148; to plead guilty by
his lawyer.  This is no less a collateral attack on the guilty
plea.4  Boudreau did not appeal his conviction on the ground that
his plea was not voluntary.  When he gave evidence at the
sentencing hearing, represented by another lawyer, he did not
testify that he was forced to plead guilty.  He did not claim
ineffective assistance of counsel.  Instead he benefited from his
guilty plea because the sentencing judge took his plea into
account in sentencing him to only nine months.  And, although he
filed a notice of leave to appeal his sentence, he later
abandoned his sentence appeal.  Boudreau cannot have it both
ways.  Having taken no steps to set aside the plea, and instead
having taken the benefit of the plea by a reduction in his
sentence, he cannot now use the plea to support his claim for
damages for mental distress.  Therefore, in my view, permitting a
claim for damages because of the &#147;forced guilty plea&#148; amounts to
an abuse of process.
[42] I can well understand that Boudreau suffered a serious
depression in the 1990&#146;s.  But the causes likely lay elsewhere
than Benaiah&#146;s negligence. Boudreau was unemployed; his third
marriage had broken up; he lost an acrimonious custody dispute;
his elaborate abduction scheme floundered when his girlfriend
turned him in to the police; his son was taken from him; he was
charged with serious criminal offences for which he had no
defence; and he was denied bail.  Therefore, in my opinion,
Boudreau&#146;s claim for damages for mental distress must fail.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[43]  Boudreau sued the appellants both in tort and in  contract,
as he was entitled to do.  As neither cause of action gives him a
practical advantage over the other, for the purpose of the formal
judgment, I will deal with his negligence claim.  Damages are  an
essential element of a cause of action in negligence.  Because  I
have  concluded  that  the damages claimed by  Boudreau  did  not
result  from Benaiah&#146;s negligence, I would set aside the judgment
of  the  trial  judge and dismiss the action.   However,  because
Benaiah  breached his duty of care to Boudreau I would  order  no
costs of the trial.  I would award the appellants their costs  of
the appeal if they demand them.</pre>
