    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Juriansz J. dated June 12, 1998
made at Toronto.

    <pre>[1]  The trial judge found as a fact that the appellant retained
Goodman &amp; Goodman to prepare and file a prospectus in this
matter.
[2]  In our view, there was ample evidence to support this
finding. The trial judge went on to find that the general
authority given to the law firm extended to taking the usual
steps involved in such a proceeding including retaining a
printer.
[3]    Again, in light of the evidence, this is a reasonable
finding. There is therefore no basis for us to interfere with the
conclusion of the trial judge that the law firm had the authority
to commit the appellant to pay for the printing.
[4]  In the result the appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre>
