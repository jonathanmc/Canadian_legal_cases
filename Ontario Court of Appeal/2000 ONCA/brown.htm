    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction of Whealy J. dated May 5, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MORDEN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Shelton Brown appeals from his convictions imposed by Whealy
J., sitting without a jury, of trafficking in cocaine contrary to
s.4(1) of the Narcotic Control Act and of possession of the
proceeds of property obtained by the commission of an offence
under s.4(1) contrary to s.19.1(1)(a) of that Act. .  He also
commenced an appeal from the fifteen month sentence of
imprisonment imposed by Whealy J. but, because the sentence had
expired before the hearing on appeal, the appellant did not
proceed with this appeal.1
[2]  The only ground of appeal from convictions which was argued
before us was that the appellant was wrongly denied his right to
a jury trial.
[3]  The appellant did not argue before us an additional ground
relating to the trial judge&#146;s treatment of certain defence
evidence.  With respect to this ground I can say, briefly, that
there was ample evidence which reasonably supported the trial
judge&#146;s finding of guilt and that the trial judge&#146;s consideration
of the defence evidence discloses no material error.
[4]  With respect to the denial of the appellant&#146;s right to a
jury trial two issues are raised.  First, the appellant submits
that Paisley J., who considered the matter of the appellant&#146;s
right to a jury under s.598(1) of the Criminal Code, as a pre-
trial judge, erred in concluding that the appellant had no
&#147;legitimate excuse&#148; within the meaning of this term in s.598(1)
for his failure to attend for his trial by jury.  Second, the
appellant submits that Whealy J. erred in failing to reconsider
the issue under s.598(1) when it was raised before him on the new
trial date.  Before considering these issues I shall briefly
outline what took place in this proceeding before the matter came
before Paisley J.
     </pre>
    <pre>     <strong>The Proceedings which Took Place before the Section
     598(1) Hearing on February 13, 1998</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant was charged with the trafficking in cocaine
and possession of the proceeds of crime offences on April 2,
1996.  On February 28, 1997 he appeared at assignment court in
the General Division.  On May 27, 1997 the trial date for
September 29, 1997 was set.  At the appellant&#146;s request this date
was changed to November 5, 1997.
[6]  The appellant did not appear on November 5, 1997.  Madam
Justice Dunnet issued a bench warrant and the surety bail of
$2,000.00 was noted for estreat.  Eight days later, on November
13, 1997, the appellant appeared before the court in custody.  He
was remanded in custody to November 14, 1997.  On this date, he
was released by Madam Justice Dunnet on the same terms as his
previous bail.  On January 27, 1998, February 13, 1998 was set
for the hearing of the appellant&#146;s s.598(1) application and a new
trial date was set.
     </pre>
    <pre>     <strong>The Hearing before Paisley J.</strong></pre>
    <pre>[7]  Section 598 (1) of the Code reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(1)   Notwithstanding anything in this Act, where 
a person to whom subsection 597(1) applies has 
elected or is deemed to have elected to be tried 
by a court composed of a judge and jury and, at 
the time he failed to appear or to remain in 
attendance for his trial, he had not re-elected 
to be tried by a court composed of a judge without 
a jury or provincial court judge without a jury, 
he shall not be tried by a court composed of a
judge and jury unless</pre>
        <pre>(a)  he establishes to the satisfaction of a judge 
of the court in which he is indicted that there 
was a legitimate excuse for his failure to appear 
or remain in attendance for his trial; or
(b)  the Attorney General requires pursuant to 
section 568 or 569 that the accused be tried by a 
court composed of a judge and jury.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[8]  On the hearing before Paisley J. the only evidence called
was that of the appellant.  I will not relate it in detail.  Much
of what the appellant said in chief was changed during cross-
examination.  The result was a position somewhat lacking in
coherence.
[9]  The appellant testified that he felt ill the day before the
trial and worse on the day of the trial.  At 10:00 a.m. on that
day, November 5, 1997, he took a taxi from his home to his
doctor&#146;s office.  He estimated that the doctor&#146;s office was about
a ten minute taxi ride away from his home.  He estimated the taxi
ride to the court house to be about thirty to forty minutes.  The
doctor &#147;give [him] some pill and Gravol and whatever&#148; and he
returned home around noon.
[10] When the appellant was asked whether he got in touch with
his lawyer on November 4, he indicated that he had contacted Mr.
Adams (his counsel at trial, on November 5, 1997) in the
afternoon to say that he was ill.  In reply to the question of
what Mr. Adams had told him he testified: &#147;Well, he said you are
supposed to be in court today and I said I know, but I wasn&#146;t
feeling well at all so I wouldn&#146;t make it.&#148;
[11] He said that he spoke to Mr. Adams on Mr. Adams&#146; cell phone
November 5 at about 2:30 &#150; 3:00 p.m.  He had not called him from
the doctor&#146;s office or when he got home because he was waiting
for Mr. Adams to leave court.  He agreed that the bench warrant
was issued against him at 3:00 p.m. because that&#146;s what Mr. Adams
had told him.  Notwithstanding his conversation with Mr. Adams
and knowing that a bench warrant was outstanding, the appellant
only turned himself in eight days later, on November 13.
[12] In his reasons Paisley J. paraphrased s.598(1) of the Code
and then, after quoting from a portion of R. v. Harris (1991) 66
C.C.C. (3d) 536 (Ont. C.A.), to which I shall refer shortly, he
said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>This accused says that on the date of his trial he 
was ill.  He took a cab to his doctor&#146;s office 
which was about ten minutes away from his home.  
He cites a doctor&#146;s note, but no doctor has been 
called.  He says that he called his counsel sometime 
later that day and did not surrender until several 
days later.  He has a number of convictions for 
failing to appear.  1977 and 1992 is conceded that 
he had been convicted for failing to appear.  I do
not believe the accused.  I think he must have had 
the ability to present himself to the court.  If he 
is well enough to go to a doctor&#146;s office by cab, 
he would have been well enough to come to court by 
cab, if only for the purpose of presenting himself 
so that the trial judge could have had an opportunity 
to determine whether the case could proceeded later 
that week.  I think this accused is simply using his 
alleged medical condition as a pretense to avoid the 
consequences of his trial.  That was his intention 
at the time.  He has lied to me today on this point.  I
do not believe him.  His election of trial by jury 
is therefore vacated and he will be tried by judge 
alone.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[13] The appellant submits that the evidence before Paisley J.
was not sufficient to meet the test in Harris and that the trial
judge&#146;s rejection of the appellant&#146;s evidence was unreasonable.
In R. v. Harris, supra, this court said at p. 539:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In our view, nothing less than an intentional 
avoidance of appearing at trial for the purpose of 
impeding or frustrating the trial or with the 
intention of avoiding its consequences, or failure 
to appear because of a mistake resulting from willful
blindness, should deprive an accused of his 
constitutional right to trial by jury guaranteed by 
s. 11(f) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and 
Freedoms.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[14] I do not read Harris as laying down a general proposition
respecting what the Crown must show for an accused to be deprived
of his or her right to a jury trial under s.598(1).  It is clear
from the terms of s.598(1) that it is the accused&#146;s failure to
appear at trial that will deprive him or her of the right to a
jury trial &#147;unless&#133;he establishes to the satisfaction of a judge
of the court in which he is indicted that there was a legitimate
excuse for his failure to appear&#133;for his trial.&#148;  The onus is on
the accused to satisfy the judge that there was &#147;a legitimate
excuse&#148; for his or her failure to appear.
[15] The proposition in Harris was directed to the meaning of
&#147;legitimate excuse&#148; and the court held, quite simply, that the
judge of first instance in that case erred in holding that an
honest mistake as to the trial date was not a legal excuse.  On
the evidence before him, the essence of which is set forth in his
reasons, it was open to Paisley J. to reject the appellant&#146;s
evidence that illness was the reason he did not attend for his
trial and, hence, to conclude that the s.598(1) onus on the
appellant had not been satisfied.  I would not give effect to
this ground of appeal.
[16] Before dealing with the next ground of appeal, I should
mention that no objection was made to our jurisdiction to
consider the correctness of Paisley J.&#146;s decision on the
appellant&#146;s appeal from conviction.  In fact, the respondent
submitted that we could consider it under s.686(1)(a)(iii) of the
Code &#150; &#147;on any ground that there was a miscarriage of justice&#148;.
We received no real argument on our jurisdiction and I prefer not
to express a final opinion on the question.  I would observe,
however, that statements in the following decisions appear to
support our jurisdiction:  R. v. Mills (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 481
(S.C.C.) at 498; R. v. Meltzer (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 453
(S.C.C.) at 461; R. v. Primeau (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)
at 6; and R. v. Noel (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 168 (Que. C.A.) per
Nuss J.A. at 178.  In R.v. Charest (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 312
(Que. C.A.) at 349-350, on an appeal from conviction, the court
treated a challenge to a pre-trial order dismissing an
application to change the venue of the trial as a proper ground
of appeal.     </pre>
    <pre>    <strong> The Failure of the Trial Judge to Reconsider the
     s.598(1) Issue.</strong></pre>
    <pre>[17] Following the decision of Paisley J. the matter came on for
trial before Whealy J. on April 27, 1998.  At the opening of the
trial proceeding and before the appellant had been arraigned, the
appellant made a motion to have Whealy J. review Paisley J.&#146;s
decision.  Whealy J. refused to do this.  He said that he had no
jurisdiction to &#147;sit in appeal of the order of Paisley J.&#148;
[18] In his submission that Whealy J. erred in refusing to
reconsider the s.598(1) issue, the appellant relies upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Litchfield
(1994), 86 C.C.C. (3d) 97 and the judgment of this court in R. v.
Allen (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 331, aff&#146;d (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d)
1 (S.C.C.).  The appellant said that Litchfield held that all
motions in a criminal case should be heard by the trial judge and
that, accordingly, on the facts of the present case Paisley J.
did not have jurisdiction but that Whealy J. did.
[19] I do not think that Litchfield supports the appellant&#146;s
submission.  In Litchfield, the issue was whether a pre-trial
order, which severed and divided the counts alleged against the
accused, could be reviewed by the trial judge and, on appeal, by
an appellate court.  Iacobucci J. for the court, in addressing
this question, began his consideration with whether &#147;the rule
against collateral attack&#148; stood in the way of this review.  He
said at p. 109:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>This rule holds that &#147;a court order, made by a court 
having jurisdiction to make it&#148;, may not be attacked 
&#147;in proceedings other than those whose specific object 
is the reversal, variation, or nullification of the 
order of judgment&#148;:  R. v. Wilson (1983), 9 C.C.C. 
(3d) 97 at p. 117, 4 D.L.R. (4th) 577, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 
594, per McIntyre J.  The lack of jurisdiction which 
would oust the rule against collateral attack would be 
a lack of capacity in the court to make the type of 
order in question, such as a Provincial Court without 
the power to issue injunctions.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] He held at p. 110 that &#147;this is not the case for strict
application of a rule against collateral attack &#133;&#148; and that &#147;the
principles [to which he had referred] behind the rule against
collateral attack are not applicable in a case of a pre-trial
division and severance order.&#148;
[21] Iacobucci J. then said at pp. 110-111:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>    A pre-trial division and severance order does not
govern the conduct of the parties but rather regulates 
the judicial process itself.  Such an order is purely 
related to the procedure of an accused&#146;s trial.  Another 
way of stating the matter is that a pre-trial division 
and severance order is only concerned with a court&#146;s 
controlling its own process within the confines of the 
same litigation.  Therefore, to allow a collateral attack 
at trial before a superior court on a pre-trial division 
and severance order made by a superior court would not
jeopardize the rule of law or damage the repute of the
administration of justice.  Further, if the order had 
been made by a trial judge, it would have been subject 
to review by appellate courts along with the verdict.   
To permit an order to stand which is so erroneous that it 
results in a trial process that is fundamentally flawed 
would result in procedure governing substance, a result 
that cannot be accepted.          </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>            Accordingly, in the narrow circumstances of this 
	case, I would recognize some flexibility in the rule 
	against collateral attack and hold that the pre-trial 
	division and severance order was liable to be reviewed 
	and, if made erroneously, set aside by the trial judge.  
	The failure of the trial judge to refuse to follow the 
	pre-trial division and severance order, if erroneous,
        would constitute an error of law reviewable on appeal to 
	this court.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>   As the next portion of my reasons will show, there 
should be little occasion for this exception to the rule 
against collateral attack to be applied in the future
since I am of the opinion that only the trial judge ever 
has jurisdiction to issue a division and severance order.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[22] Following this, at pp. 111-115 Iacobucci J. gave reasons for
his conclusion that &#147;no one but the trial judge has jurisdiction
to issue a severance order&#148;.
[23] Having regard to the terms of s.598(1) of the Code set forth
above, which confers jurisdiction on &#147;a judge of the court in
which he [the accused] is indicted&#148;, I do not think it can be
said that the trial judge has exclusive jurisdiction under that
provision.  Indeed, there would appear to be practical reasons
relating to the requirements of efficient court administration
why it would make sense that an accused&#146;s right to a jury trial
be decided sometime in advance of the trial.
[24] Accordingly, I do not think that the reasoning in
Litchfield, which turned essentially, on a pre-trial judge&#146;s lack
of jurisdiction to make the severance order, is applicable.
[25] I should mention that the appellant places substantial
emphasis on a part of the reasons in Litchfield at pp. 110-111
which I have quoted, that reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>A pre-trial division and severance order does not
govern the conduct of the parties but rather regulates 
the judicial process itself.  Such an order is purely 
related to the procedure of an accused&#146;s trial.  Another 
way of stating the matter is that a pre-trial division 
and severance order is only concerned with the courts 
controlling its own process within the confines of the 
same litigation.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[26] The appellant submits that this reasoning is applicable to
the order in this case. With respect I do not think that it is.
In my view, an order which holds that the accused is not entitled
to a jury trial is, in the sense that the words were used in
Litchfield, not one that is &#147;purely related to the procedure of
an accused&#146;s trial&#148;.  The facts which bear upon  the denial of an
accused&#146;s right to a jury trial are all completely in the past
and the function of the judge under s.598(1) is to assess them in
light of the terms of that provision.  The trial judge is in no
better position than a pre-trial judge to perform this function.
On the other hand, because a division and severance order will
clearly have an impact on the nature and course of the trial to
be held, it is understandable why this should be thought to be
solely a trial judge function.
[27] Before turning to R. v. Allen, supra, I would not wish to
exclude the possibility of a second application under s. 598(1)
if it were not a simple challenge to the correctness of the first
decision but were based on new circumstances.  Cf. R. v. Daniels
(1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 413 (Ont. C.A.).  This was not the basis
for the application before Whealy J.  As I read the record of the
proceedings before him, the basis was, simply, that under
Litchfield, Paisley J. did not have jurisdiction but that Whealy
J. did.  As I have indicated, I do not think that Litchfield is
applicable to the present case.
[28] In R. v. Allen, part way through the trial the accused
brought a motion before the trial judge seeking a stay of
proceedings on the basis that his right to a trial within a
reasonable time under s.11(b) of the Charter had been infringed.
The trial judge held that he should not hear the motion.  It was
heard by another judge who decided that the accused&#146;s right under
s.11(b) had been infringed and he stayed the proceeding.  The
Crown appealed from this order to the Court of Appeal.
[29] Doherty J.A. at pp. 343-44 dealt with the jurisdictional
issues as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Preliminary Issues</pre>
    <pre>                  Before turning to the substantive
          submissions made by the Crown, I will address
          two preliminary matters, one raised by the
          court, and the other by the respondent.  At
          the outset of the oral argument, the court
          questioned its jurisdiction to hear the
          appeal.  Ferguson J. was not the trial judge.
          In ordering a stay he acted under s.24(1) of
          the Charter and not under the authority of
          the Criminal Code.  Ferguson J. was, however,
          a judge of the court in which the respondent
          was being tried, and was, therefore, &#147;a trial
          court&#148; for the purposes of s. 676(1)(c) of
          the Criminal Code.  Since his order directed
          a stay of proceedings, the Crown had a
          statutory right of appeal under s. 676(1)(c).</pre>
    <pre>                  Mr. Butt, for the Crown, also noted
          that Sheppard J., the trial judge, in effect
          adopted the ruling of Ferguson J. on October
          5th when he acknowledged the order and said
          &#147;So this case is stayed.  Mr. Registrar,
          secure all exhibits.&#148;  Mr. Butt submits on
          the authority of R. v. Litchfield (1993), 86
          C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 110-111, that
          Sheppard J., as the trial judge, could have
          set aside the order of Ferguson J.  Mr. Butt
          further contends that the failure of Sheppard
          J. to do so is reviewable on appeal by the
          Crown under s.676(1)(c).   That review of
          necessity turns on the correctness of the
          order made by Ferguson J.  I accept this
          submission and it provides an alternative
          basis for this court&#146;s jurisdiction to hear
          this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[30] The appellant relies on the reasons in the second paragraph
in this passage.  I do not think that they are applicable to the
present case.  In Allen the jurisdiction to order the stay was
conferred by s.24(1) of the Charter and not by a provision of the
Criminal Code.  Even though a pre-trial judge may have had the
power to make the order sought, it is clear that the trial judge
also had this power. (Later in these reasons, at p. 351, Doherty
J.A. said that a &#147;trial judge is in the best position to assess
that kind of prejudice [resulting from a delayed trial]
claimed&#148;.)  Further, in Allen the trial judge &#147;in effect adopted
the ruling&#148; of the other judge.
[31] Even if Allen were applicable, I do not think that it would
affect the result in this appeal.  Doherty J.A. said that the
failure of the trial judge to review the order of the other judge
was reviewable on appeal by the Crown under s.676(1)(c) and that
&#147;[t]he review of necessity turns on the correctness of the order
made by Ferguson J.&#148;  Applying this reasoning to the present
case, because I have found no error in the decision of Paisley
J., I could not conclude that Whealy J.&#146;s refusal to reconsider
it resulted in any error that would justify interference by this
court.
[32] For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>

_______________________________
1 The appellant addressed no argument with respect to the
s.19.1(1)(a) offence, submitting in his factum that the trial
judge, in his reasons for judgment, made no finding with respect
to this count.  The respondent did not take issue with this.  The
endorsements on the indictment, however, show that the trial
judge convicted the appellant on both counts and sentenced the
appellant to 3 months imprisonment on the s.19.1(1)(a) count, to
be served concurrently with the 15 month sentence.</pre>
    <pre>While the trial judge did not refer specificially to s.19.1(1)(a)
in his reasons, he clearly found that the appellant was in
possession of a $20.00 marked bill which was the proceeds of the
alleged trafficking.  This was a crucial underlying fact for both
offences.  The appellant appeals against both convictions in his
notice of appeal and, accordingly, I shall deal with the appeal
as being against both convictions.</pre></td>
