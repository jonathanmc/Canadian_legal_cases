    <pre><strong>HEARD:         April 5, 2000
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the verdict of acquittal rendered by Mr. Justice
Hill, sitting with a jury, on December 8, 1995</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT

                                
</strong>[1]  At the opening of the appeal, Ms. Klukach abandoned all of
the proposed grounds of appeal but one, Hill J.&#146;s decision that
the statement was not admissible by virtue of s. 24(2) of the
Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  She further narrowed that
argument to the single question of whether Hill J.&#146;s finding of
fact that the respondent would inevitably have spoken to the
police notwithstanding the admitted breach of his right to
counsel was unreasonable.  She did not argue that the trial judge
misapprehended the evidence or the applicable legal principles.
[2]  Assuming that this involves a question of law alone within
the meaning of s. 676(1)(a) of the Criminal Code, we have not
been persuaded that the trial judge&#146;s finding was unreasonable.
The trial judge found, and the Crown does not contest, that the
respondent&#146;s rights under s. 10(b) of the Charter of Rights were
infringed in two respects.  The police failed to inform the
respondent of his right to retain and instruct counsel &#147;without
delay&#148; and, when he was finally informed of his rights in his own
language, he was not told of the availability of immediate access
to legal advice through the &#147;1-800&#148; number.
[3]  The Crown attempts to bring this case within the holding of
the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Harper (1994), 92 C.C.C.
(3d) 423 at 430, where Lamer C.J.C. said the following:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>What I am prepared to say, however, is that in all the
circumstances of this case, I am satisfied on the 
balance of probabilities that the police's failure to 
comply fully with the informational requirements under 
s. 10(b) did not affect the appellant's behaviour. 
That is, the appellant appears to have had an almost 
irresistible desire to confess -- both when he first
opened the door and subsequently, after he received 
his s. 10(b) caution (albeit a defective one) and was 
advised of his right to silence. After both warnings 
he stated clearly that he understood.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[4]  The burden was on the Crown to establish that admission of
the statement would not affect the fairness of the trial because
the police officers&#146; failure to comply with s. 10(b) did not
affect the respondent&#146;s behaviour.  The trial judge expressly
adverted to the Harper case but found that he was not satisfied
that the Crown had met this onus.  Before reaching this
conclusion, he referred to the evidence upon which the Crown
relied.  He was also well aware that the defence had adduced no
contradictory evidence.  He nevertheless concluded as follows:
          
        The Crown analogizes the facts here to the accused 
	in the Harper case where the court characterized the 
	accused as acting under &#147;an almost irresistible 
	desire to confess&#148;.  The posture of Mr. Brunczlik 
	with the police, and his failure to testify, makes 
	this a close case.  However, despite the able 
	submissions of Crown counsel, I am not satisfied, on
        balance, that had there been timely and full compliance 
	with s. 10(b) of the Charter that Mr. Brunczlik would 
	not have acted differently.  Accordingly, admission of 
	the evidence would affect the fairness of the trial.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  We cannot say that this finding of fact is unreasonable.  By
the time the respondent was finally informed of his right to
counsel in a meaningful way, he had already been held in custody
for upwards of five hours.  For close to three of those hours, a
police officer who spoke Hungarian was available and could have
complied with s. 10(b).  While by the time the respondent was
finally informed of his rights he clearly wanted to tell his
story to the police, it was open to the trial judge to find that
he was not satisfied that had the respondent been fully informed
of his right to counsel in a timely manner the respondent would
not have availed himself of that opportunity.
[6]  The respondent had been held in custody and, because of the
language barrier, held essentially incommunicado for an extended
period of time.  Had he been informed of his right to counsel in
a timely way, he would have had a long period of time to consider
whether to exercise his rights since the investigators did not
intend to interview him for several hours.  In our view, it is
speculation that during this period the respondent would not have
attempted to exercise his right to counsel and it was open to the
trial judge to resolve this uncertainty in the respondent&#146;s
favour. As Lamer C.J.C. said in R. v. Bartle (1994), 92 C.C.C.
(3d) 289 (S.C.C.) at 316:</pre>
    <pre>	Secondly, in light of the many warnings by this court 
	about the dangers of speculating about what advice 
	might have been given to a detainee by a lawyer had 
	the right to counsel not been infringed (infra, pp. 
	38-9) [post, p. 319] it is only consistent that 
	uncertainty about what an accused would have done had 
	his or her s. 10(b) rights not been violated be 
	resolved in the accused's favour and that, for the 
	purposes of considering the effect of admission of 
	evidence on trial fairness, courts assume that the 
	incriminating evidence would not have been obtained but
        for the violation. The state bears the responsibility 
	for the breach of the accused's constitutional rights. 
	If the state subsequently claims that there was no causal 
	link between this breach and the obtaining of the evidence 
	at issue, it is the state that should bear the burden of 
	proving this assertion.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The evidence strongly suggests that if the respondent had
spoken to a lawyer he would not have given a statement to the
police.  It is apparent from the interview with the police that
the respondent was concerned about prejudicing his legal position
and may not have understood the full legal implications of making
a statement.  When, having given a complete oral statement, the
respondent was invited to give a videotaped statement, he
demurred because he wanted to first speak to a lawyer.  As he
said,  &#147;I would rather speak to a lawyer before I do that.  I
don&#146;t know how it will affect my future.&#148;
[8]  Since we have not been persuaded that the trial judge&#146;s
finding was unreasonable and since this was the sole basis for
the Crown appeal, that appeal must be dismissed.
[9]  The respondent had brought a motion to quash the appeal on
the basis that s. 676(1)(a), as it stood at the time the appeal
was launched, did not permit a Crown appeal against a finding of
not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder.  In
view of our conclusion on the merit of the appeal, it is
unnecessary to consider the respondent&#146;s motion to quash this
appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</pre>
