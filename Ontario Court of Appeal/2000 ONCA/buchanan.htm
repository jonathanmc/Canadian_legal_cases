    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Cavarzan J. dated January 25, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MACPHERSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>Introduction</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Two schoolboys, Mark Buchanan and Gerald Walsh, both 19
years of age, engaged in a fight at Sir Winston Churchill
Secondary School in Hamilton.  Walsh lost the fight and was
seriously injured.  He sued Buchanan and the Board of Education
for the City of Hamilton.
[2]  The action proceeded to trial.  Stayshyn J. held that Walsh
and Buchanan were equally liable for the fight.  He set damages
at $492,871.69.  Accordingly, judgment was entered against
Buchanan for $246,435.85.  The action against the Board of
Education for the City of Hamilton was dismissed.
[3]  After Stayshyn J. rendered judgment, Buchanan initiated a
separate action against the respondent insurance companies.
There was, and is, no issue that Buchanan was an insured person
pursuant to the terms of a policy of homeowner&#146;s insurance issued
by the respondents.
[4]  In his action against the insurance companies, Buchanan
sought indemnification for the amount of the judgment against him
and for the costs of defending the Walsh action.  The parties
agreed to proceed, pursuant to Rule 22 of the Rules of Civil
Procedure, in the form of a special case.  They filed an agreed
statement of facts and posed a series of questions.  Cavarzan J.
heard the matter and determined that the respondent insurance
companies could rely on an exclusion clause in the insurance
policy.  Accordingly, they did not have to indemnify Buchanan for
the damages he was required to pay Walsh; nor did they have to
reimburse Buchanan for the costs of defending the Walsh action.
[5]  Buchanan appealed Cavarzan J.&#146;s judgment to this court.  The
appeal was heard on September 10, 1999.  Shortly after the
argument, the court became aware that the Supreme Court of Canada
would be hearing two appeals in October that potentially raised
the same or similar issues.  With the consent of counsel, the
court decided to reserve its decision until the Supreme Court of
Canada had rendered its decisions.
[6]  On May 3, 2000, the Supreme Court of Canada released its
decisions in Non- Marine Underwriters, Lloyd&#146;s of London v.
Scalera (2000), 185 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.), and Sansalone v.
Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Co. (2000), 185 D.L.R. (4th) 57
(S.C.C.).  At the invitation of the court, counsel filed
additional written submissions on May 31, 2000.</pre>
    <pre><strong>A.   Factual Background</strong></pre>
    <pre>[7]  At the trial of the initial action, Stayshyn J. found that
Walsh had initiated the fight, but that Buchanan had willingly
accepted the challenge. During the fight, Buchanan gained the
upper hand.  He immobilized Walsh and punched him several times
in the head and face.  A teacher called on him to stop but
Buchanan delivered several more punishing blows.  Stayshyn J.
said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Even if the fight was consensual in the first instance, 
the severe retaliation was excessive and unwarranted.  
Buchanan&#146;s continuation of the assault after Mr. 
Massey&#146;s  shouts caught his attention and his continued 
punching of Walsh, whom he was able to physically 
control with his superior weight and strength, was
inexcusable.  It is clear from Buchanan&#146;s evidence that 
he was able to physically hold and control Walsh at 
some point and had no reason, except his own anger and 
aggression, to continue punching Walsh.          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[8]  Stayshyn J. found that Walsh suffered six injuries from the
beating administered by Buchanan: a broken nose, a chipped tooth,
facial cuts, a closed head injury, post-traumatic stress disorder
and reactive depression.
[9]  The policy of homeowner&#146;s insurance held by Buchanan&#146;s
mother contained an exclusion clause.  Apparently, the actual
policy documents were lost or destroyed.  Fortunately, the
parties agreed that one of two exclusion clauses was in effect
and that the slight difference in wording between the two clauses
had no legal significance.  The clauses provided:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>This policy does not apply:</pre>
      <pre>  (5)  to bodily injury or property damage caused 
  intentionally by or at the direction of any Insured
  person.</pre>
      <pre>                            or</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>This policy does not apply:</pre>
      <pre>  (6)  to bodily injury or property damage caused
  intentionally by or at the direction of an Insured.           </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10] When the special case came before Cavarzan J., he held that
the exclusion clause applied.  The essence of his reasoning was
that Buchanan (and Walsh) consented to fight each other.  During
the fight, Buchanan intended to hit Walsh.  Thus the bodily
injuries suffered by Walsh were, in the words of the exclusion
clause, &#147;caused intentionally&#148; by Buchanan.  It followed that the
respondent insurance companies did not have to indemnify Buchanan
for the damages award made against him in the original action or
his costs of defending the action.
[11] Buchanan appeals from Cavarazan J.&#146;s judgment.

<strong>B.   Issue</strong></pre>
    <pre>[12] The issue on this appeal is whether Cavarazan J. erred in
concluding that the exclusion clause in the Buchanan homeowner&#146;s
insurance policy supported the respondent insurance companies&#146;
decision not to indemnify Buchanan for the damages award made
against him and for his costs of defending the action.

<strong>C.   Analysis</strong></pre>
    <pre>[13] In his reasons, Cavarazan J. correctly identified the
&#147;governing authority&#148; as Co-operative Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v.
Saindon, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 735, because the exclusion clause in
that case was virtually identical to the one in the Buchanan
homeowner&#146;s insurance policy.  In Saindon the insured held a
running power lawnmower up to his neighbour's face to &#147;scare&#148;
him.  When the neighbour, Armand Sirois, raised his arms to
protect himself, the lawnmower severed the fingers on his left
hand.  The insurance company refused coverage.  The insured
argued that the exclusion clause did not apply because he did not
intend to injure the neighbour.  The Supreme Court of Canada
rejected this argument.  Ritchie J. said, at pp. 746-47:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The respondent&#146;s action did indeed have the result of
&#147;scaring&#148; Sirois to such extent that he raised his 
hands in an automatic gesture to shield his face. The 
fact that the lawn mower tipped when put to such an 
unnatural use was an eminently foreseeable development 
and one which the respondent ought to have known to be 
a part of the danger to which he was exposing his 
neighbour. The immediate cause of Sirois&#146; injury was a
combination of his gesture of self protection and the 
tipping of the lawnmower but, in my opinion, these two 
circumstances flowed directly from the respondent&#146;s
deliberate act in raising the lawnmower as he did, 
which was the dominant cause of the occurrence.  I 
agree with the learned trial judge that this          
constituted criminal conduct which caused damage and 
the fact that the &#147;scare&#148; intended by the respondent 
had more serious consequences than he may have 
anticipated does not alter the fact that it was his 
threatening gesture which caused the damage. [Emphasis 
added.]          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[14] In my view, Saindon stands for two propositions.  First, the
exclusion clause applies where the insured committed a deliberate
act which was the dominant cause of the plaintiff&#146;s injuries
where injury was foreseeable.  Second, the fact that the
deliberate act had more serious consequences than the insured may
have anticipated is immaterial.
[15] This second proposition is important because it responds to
the central argument made by the appellant during the appeal
hearing.  The appellant conceded that he was liable for three of
Walsh&#146;s injuries &#150; the broken nose, chipped tooth and facial cuts
&#150; because they were reasonably foreseeable consequences of
Buchanan&#146;s assault.  However, the appellant contended that the
other three injuries &#150; closed head injury, post-traumatic stress
disorder and reactive depression &#150; were outside the ambit of the
exclusion clause because they were not the natural and probable
consequences of the assault.  In my view, it is clear from the
second emphasized passage in the above excerpt from Ritchie J.&#146;s
reasons in Saindon that this distinction is untenable.
[16] In Saindon, Laskin C.J. dissented on the basis of the very
distinction for which the appellant contends in this court.  In
his view, the fact that the insured did not intend to sever the
fingers of his neighbour, but only to scare him, meant that, in
the words of the exclusion clause, he did not intend to cause the
injury that occurred.  However, in Saindon, that view was
expressly rejected by the majority of the court.
[17] The remaining question is whether the two recent decisions
of the Supreme Court of Canada in Scalera, supra, and Sansalone,
supra, change the law as enunciated in Saindon, and in
particular, whether they adopt the dissenting analysis of Laskin
C.J.  In my view, it is clear that Scalera and Sansalone affirm
Saindon.
[18] In Scalera and Sansalone, the plaintiff, a minor, sued two
bus drivers, Vincent Scalera and Nicodema Sansalone, for damages
for repeated sexual assaults which allegedly took place on their
buses. The defendant bus drivers brought third party claims
against their insurers pursuant to their home insurance policies.
They sought declarations that the insurers were required to
defend them.  The insurance companies argued that the claims were
excluded because of exclusion clauses in the policies.  The
exclusion clause in Sansalone, known as an &#147;intentional injury&#148;
exclusion, was identical to the one in the present appeal, and
excluded &#147;bodily injury&#133;caused intentionally by you.&#148;  The clause
in Scalera was an &#147;intentional act&#148; as opposed to an &#147;intentional
injury&#148; exclusion.  It excluded claims for bodily injury &#147;caused
by any intentional act&#133;of an insured.&#148;
[19] The Supreme Court of Canada applied the exclusion clause in
both cases.  Although most of the judgments of McLachlin J. and
Iacobucci J. dealt with the question of consent in the context of
sexual assault (on which they differed in important respects),
the court also dealt explicitly and unanimously with the issue
raised in this appeal.
[20] In Scalera, Iacobucci J. dealt first with whether there is
any effective distinction between an exclusion clause which
covers &#147;intentional acts&#148; and one which covers &#147;intentional
injuries&#148;, and concluded that there was not.  He held that the
relevant distinction to be made is between injuries caused by an
intentional tort and those which arise from negligence.  He
discussed the relationship between an intentional tort and the
injuries flowing from it and stated, at p. 41:</pre>
    <pre>          Moreover, if a tort is intended, it will not
	  matter that the result was more harmful than
	  the actor should, or even could have foreseen.
	  Linden, [Canadian Tort Law, 6th ed. (Toronto:
          Butterworths, 1997)], at p. 45, quotes Borins
	  Co. Ct. J. (as he then was) in Bettel v. Yim
	  (1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 617, at p. 628:          </pre>
    <pre>             If physical contact was intended, the
             fact that its magnitude exceeded all
             reasonable or intended expectations
             should make no difference. To hold
             otherwise &#133; would unduly narrow
             recovery where one deliberately
             invades the bodily interests of
             another with the result that the
             totally innocent plaintiff would be
             deprived of full recovery for the
             totality of the injuries suffered as a
             result of the deliberate invasion of
             his bodily interests. [Emphasis in
             original.]             </pre>
    <pre>[21] Applying this passage to the present appeal, Buchanan
intended to make physical contact with Walsh during the fight.
Indeed, the appellant concedes that Walsh&#146;s broken nose, chipped
tooth and facial cuts were all natural consequences of his
actions.  It may well be that the magnitude of Walsh&#146;s injuries
exceeded Buchanan&#146;s expectations, subjective or objective.
However, that makes &#147;no difference.&#148;
[22] The appellant attempts to distinguish this passage from
Scalera by relying on a different passage from Iacobucci J.&#146;s
judgment where he discussed a series of cases that &#147;involved
unforeseen physical consequences of the insureds&#146; actions, and
asked whether the result was &#145;substantially certain&#146; given the
defendant&#146;s actions&#148; (at p. 51) [emphasis in original].  The
appellant contends that although some of Walsh&#146;s injuries were a
substantially certain result of Buchanan&#146;s blows, others were
not.
[23] I disagree with this submission.  The distinction is
relevant in cases where there was no intention to cause any
physical injuries.  In the present appeal, Buchanan intended to
strike Walsh.  In that circumstance, the relevant legal principle
is, as Iacobucci J. stated in the passage set out above, that &#147;if
a tort is intended, it will not matter that the result was more
harmful than the actor should, or even could have foreseen.&#148;
[24] Finally, I note this court has also recently dealt with the
exclusion clause in issue in this appeal, and in the context of a
schoolyard fight.  In Godonoaga (Litigation guardian of)  v.
Khatambakhsh, [2000] O.J. No. 2172 (C.A.), a 9-year old boy and
his parents sued two brothers and their parents for injuries
sustained by the boy in a schoolyard beating.  The defendants
made a third party claim against their insurer under a home
insurance policy.  The insurer refused to defend, relying on the
same exclusion clause as the one in issue in this appeal.
[25] This court held that the insurer had a duty to defend the
claim, framed in negligence, brought against the parents of the
perpetrators.  However, the minor defendants, the actual
perpetrators of the beating, conceded that the exclusion clause
applied to their conduct.  As explained by Finlayson J.A., at
paragraphs 14 and 20:</pre>
    <pre>          The appellants concede that the policy of
	  insurance &#133; does not cover the plaintiffs&#146;
	  claims against their two sons, Houman and
	  Maher, for bodily injury caused to Igor.
	  They also concede that, if the claim against
	  Fatima was limited to her participation in
	  the assault by directing or inciting Houman
	  to take part in it, she is a party to the
	  assault and is excluded from coverage as well. &#133;          </pre>
    <pre>          In my view, a proper interpretation of the
          policy is that the parents and the two
          children are each separately insured to the
          face value of the policy.  The insurer does
          not have to respond to the claims against the
          two sons because their separate policies
          exclude claims arising from bodily injury
          caused intentionally by them. [Emphasis
          added.]          </pre>
    <pre>[26] In my view, the appellant is in the same position as the two
boys in Godonoaga v. Khatambakhsh.  He committed an intentional
assault on Walsh.  The respondent insurance companies can,
therefore, rely on the exclusion clause.  They do not have to
indemnify the appellant for the damages awarded to Walsh.  Nor do
they have a duty to defend the appellant.
