<h3><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Justice Douglas J. Cunningham
dated January 11, 2000</span></h3>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></p>

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January 1997, Cunningham J. issued
six search warrants pursuant to the <i>Mutual
Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 30 (4<sup>th</sup>
Supp.).  The warrants had been sought by
Corporal Foley, a member of the R.C.M.P., at the request of the governments of
the United States and the United Kingdom as part of an investigation into money
laundering in those countries.  Shortly
after the warrants were executed, Poulin J. granted an application to impound
the seized materials pending disposition of an application to quash the
warrants.  The hearing of that
application began in June of 1997 before Cunningham J. but was adjourned to
allow for further cross-examination of Corporal Foley.  For reasons that are not material to this
appeal, the application was only brought back on for hearing in April
1999.  In January 2000, Cunningham J.
released his reasons for quashing one of the warrants and upholding the other
five.  The appellants, whose property
was seized pursuant to those five warrants, appeal from that ruling.  The central issue on the appeal is whether
Cunningham J. applied too narrow a test for reviewing the sufficiency of the
warrants.  The appellants argue that in
the circumstances he should have considered <i>de
novo</i> whether he would have issued the warrants having regard to evidence
disclosed following execution of the warrants.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would
dismiss the appeal.  In my view, any
error by Cunningham J. concerning the proper test was not material.  It is also my view that many of the
arguments made by the appellants are more properly considered at the hearing
mandated by s. 15 of the Act when the court must decide whether to send the
seized materials to the requesting state. 
In view of this conclusion, it is only necessary to give a brief outline
of the facts.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h3>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In January 1995, the United States
Internal Revenue Service made a formal request to Revenue Canada Taxation to
conduct a simultaneous criminal investigation under the terms of the United
States  Canada Simultaneous Criminal Investigation Programme.  Revenue Canada agreed and used its power
under s. 231.2(1)(b) of the <i>Income Tax
Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5<sup>th</sup> Supp.) to require the appellant
Wayne Budd to provide certain information. 
Budd complied with the request and Revenue Canada seized the hard disk
drive from his computer.  It then shared
information retrieved from that hard disk drive with the Internal Revenue
Service.  The United States authorities
in turn shared that information with Corporal Foley of the R.C.M.P.  Subsequently, Canadian, British and United
States criminal investigators traded this information with each other.  At the hearing before Cunningham J., counsel
for the Attorney General of Canada, acting for the requesting states, conceded
that Revenue Canada violated the appellants rights under the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> by using
the audit powers to conduct a criminal investigation for the United States
authorities.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a similar fashion, the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission had asked the Ontario Securities
Commission for assistance.  The O.S.C.
used its subpoena powers under s. 11(1)(b) of the <i>Ontario Securities Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 c. S-5 to compel Budd to
provide information, which it then shared with the S.E.C.  Counsel for the Attorney General of Canada
also conceded that this was a breach of Budds <i>Charter </i>rights because the O.S.C. had used its powers in aid of a
criminal investigation in the United States.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In light of these concessions, counsel
for the Attorney General also conceded that certain paragraphs of the
informations sworn by Corporal Foley and used to obtain the search warrants
should be deleted.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>After the warrants were executed,
United States and British investigators, who had assisted in the searches,
began to inspect the documents and the United States investigators made notes
of the materials they reviewed.  After
Poulin J. made the impounding order, Corporal Foley became concerned that the
United States investigators would make use of the information before a Canadian
judge had made the determination under s. 15 of the Act as to whether the
material should be turned over to the United States.  Corporal Foley spoke to a United States prosecutor.  He testified that he had the impression the
prosecutor believed that she did not need to respect Canadian laws and that it
did not matter how the evidence was obtained. 
Finally, I would note that there was a suggestion that the authorities
had seized material not covered by the warrant or that could be seized under s.
13 of the Act<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> and had not
executed the warrant in accordance with its terms.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>It appears that counsel for the
appellants made the following arguments at the hearing before Cunningham J.:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       After the material that was obtained as a
result of the breach of the <i>Charter</i>
is excised, the informations were not sufficient to support the warrants;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       The informations failed to establish that
an evidence-gathering order under s. 18 of the Act would not have been
appropriate;</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       The warrants should be quashed because of
an abuse of process by the United States authorities.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>REASONS OF CUNNINGHAM J.</span></h3>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>As indicated, except for one of the
warrants, Cunningham J. dismissed the application to quash the warrants.  He held that even after the improperly
obtained material was excised, the informations were sufficient to establish
the requisite grounds for the search. 
He was also satisfied that an evidence-gathering order would not have
been appropriate.  Finally, he held that
taken cumulatively, the admitted breaches of the <i>Charter</i> and the impugned conduct of the United States authorities
did not require that the warrants be quashed as an abuse of process.</span></p>

<h3><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h3>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the appeal, the appellants raise
essentially the same issues that were dealt with by Cunningham J.  However, they have slightly recast the abuse
of process argument.  Central to all of
the arguments is the nature of the role of a judge who is required to review
his or her own decision to issue warrants under the <i>Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act</i>.  </span></p>

may approve a request from a foreign state to have a search or seizure carried
out, in which case an application may be made to a judge for a search warrant
under s. 12.  Alternatively, the
Minister may approve a request of a foreign state to obtain evidence by a
judges order.  In that case, an
application may be made for an evidence-gathering order under s. 18.  Under s. 12, before granting the search
warrant, the judge must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to
believe that an offence has been committed with respect to which the foreign
state has jurisdiction, that <i>inter alia</i>
evidence will be found and that, in the circumstances, it would not be
appropriate to make an evidence-gathering order under s. 18.  A submission made before Cunningham J. and
repeated on appeal is that this last requirement had not been met.  In my view, there is no merit to that submission.  On any test, the material in the

test is easily stated, its application where there have been significant

suggest a more robust review in such cases:</span></p>

the issuing judge could have ordered that they issue</b>.  When the evidentiary record is less substantive,
the reviewing judge cannot logically justify his or her decision on the basis
of deference for the discretion of the issuing judge.  <b>The reviewing judge must

search under warrant had to be excluded under s. 24(2) of the Charter where the
warrant was procured through an information which contained facts solely within
the knowledge of police as a result of a Charter violation. However, in
circumstances such as the case at bar where the information contains other
facts in addition to those obtained in contravention of the Charter, it is
necessary for reviewing courts to consider whether the warrant <b>would</b> have been issued had the
improperly obtained facts been excised from the information sworn to obtain the
warrant: <i>Garofoli, supra</i>. In this
way, the state is prevented from benefiting from the illegal acts of police
officers, without being forced to sacrifice search warrants which would have
been issued in any event.  Accordingly,
the warrant and search conducted thereunder in the case at bar will be
considered constitutionally sound if the warrant <b>would</b> have issued had the observations gleaned through the unconstitutional
perimeter searches been excised from the information.  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

depart from the <i>Garofoli</i> test where
there have been deletions from the information because some of the material
used to support the information was obtained by unconstitutional means.  In particular, I have some difficulty
attaching significance to the use of the word would in some places in the <i>Grant</i> decision where in the same passage
the court expressly refers to the <i>Garofoli

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge
found that the affidavit material presented to the authorizing judge contained
an error of non-disclosure relating to the retraction of Eric Lortie, a failure
to state his age, and an error in including him as a target and accomplice.

authorization, finding that the police officer deliberately misled the
authorizing judge. In so doing, the trial judge fell into error.</span></p>

deciding to set aside the authorization and do not by themselves lead to automatic

Cunningham J. erred in applying a test of abuse of process that focused on the
conduct of the United States officials in considering whether the warrants
should be quashed.  They argue that the
real concern is with the conduct of the Canadian authorities.  It is not entirely clear that the argument
made on appeal was made to Cunningham J. 
In any event, as I read his reasons, Cunningham J. dealt with both the <i>Charter</i> violations by the Canadian
authorities and the alleged abuse of process by the United States
authorities.  He found that the
cumulative effect of the conduct was not sufficient to lead to a quashing of
the warrants.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>As indicated, on appeal, however, the
focus of the argument was on the conduct of the Canadian authorities and their
admitted improper use of the procedures under the <i>Income Tax Act</i> and the <i>Ontario
Securities Act</i>.  Put simply, the
appellants submit that even if the warrants are valid applying the <i>Garofoli</i> test, Cunningham J. had the
power to quash the warrants because of the violations of Budds <i>Charter</i> rights.  Cromwell J.A. suggests that a reviewing
court has such a power in <i>R. v. Morris</i>
(1998), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 539 (N.S.C.A.) at 553:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>This does not
mean that errors, particularly deliberate ones, are irrelevant in the review
process. While not leading to automatic vitiation of the warrant, there remains
the need to protect the prior authorization process. <b>The cases just referred to do not foreclose a reviewing judge, in
appropriate circumstances, from concluding on the totality of the circumstances
that the conduct of the police in seeking prior authorization was so subversive
of that process that the resulting warrant must be set aside to protect the

these reasons, the integrity of the prior authorization process is also
protected by the approach on review to fraudulent or intentionally misleading
material placed before the Justice.

under s. 15 of the Act.  Finlayson J.A.
recognized that the judge is required to consider all that has transpired and
has a discretion to consider all relevant factors:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>In my opinion,
despite the awkward language of this section, couched as it is in negatives and
coupled with the disjunctive &quot;or&quot; instead of the conjunctive
&quot;and&quot;, this section imposes a double burden upon the judge called
upon to make an order under s. 15(1)(b) of the Act sending the material seized
to the foreign state. <b>He or she is
obliged under s. 15(1)(a) to review what has transpired to the date of the
return of the application. Before he can order that the record or thing seized
be sent to the foreign state, the reviewing judge must be satisfied, first,
that the warrant was executed according to its terms and conditions and,
second, that he is satisfied that there is no reason why the order should not
be made. The respondent submits, and I agree, that the inherent nature of this
second condition necessarily bestows discretion on the reviewing judge to
consider all relevant factors bearing on the application.</b> </span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><b><span lang=EN-US>In both of these instances, the reviewing judge is
exercising a jurisdiction akin to that of a trial judge considering the

lang=EN-US> In the case in appeal, the reviewing judge had to consider the
conduct of the police in the execution of the warrant and whether the search
warrant was facially valid. The validity has been questioned because the
