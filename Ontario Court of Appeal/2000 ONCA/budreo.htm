    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Then J. dated January 4, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>INTRODUCTION</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Section 810.1 of the Criminal Code, enacted by Parliament in
1993,  permits the court to impose a recognizance on  any  person
likely  to  commit any one of a number of listed sexual  offences
against a child under 14 years of age and to prohibit that person
for  up  to  one  year from engaging in activities  or  attending
places  &#150;  a  public park, public swimming area, daycare  centre,
schoolground or playground &#150; where children under 14  are  likely
to  be present.1  A recognizance may be imposed though the person
has not committed an offence and has no previous criminal record.
If  an informant fears on reasonable grounds that the person will
commit  one of the listed offences and a provincial court  judge,
after  a  hearing, is satisfied that the informant has reasonable
grounds  for  the fear, then the person may be ordered  to  enter
into   a   recognizance.   The  issue  on  this  appeal  is   the
constitutionality of s.810.1.
[2]  The appellant Wray Budreo is a paedophile.  He has a long
record of sexual offences against young boys.  In November 1994,
he was released from prison after serving a sentence for three
convictions for sexual assault.  The Crown immediately sought a
recognizance under s.810.1.  The appellant brought an application
to prohibit the provincial court judge, His Honour Judge Kelly,
from holding the s.810.1 hearing and for a declaration that
s.810.1 was unconstitutional because it violated ss.7, 9, 11 and
15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
[3]  In a lengthy and well reasoned decision,2 Then J. concluded
that s.810.1 was constitutional except in two respects.  First,
he declared &#147;community centre,&#148; one of the places a person could
be prohibited from attending under s.810.1(3), to be inoperative
because it was overly broad contrary to s.7 of the Charter and
could not be justified under s.1.  Second, he found that
s.810.1(2), which required the provincial court judge to cause
the parties to appear before the court, infringed ss.7 and 9 of
the Charter and could not be justified under s.1.  To remedy this
violation, however, Then J. read down the word &#147;shall&#148; in
s.810.1(2) to read &#147;may.&#148;
[4]  The appellant Budreo appealed and was supported in his
appeal by the intervener, The Canadian Civil Liberties
Association.  In oral argument the appellant narrowed the focus
of his appeal to three main issues.  First, he submitted that
s.810.1 violated s.7 of the Charter.  In his submission, s.810.1
deprived him of his liberty contrary to the principles of
fundamental justice in three ways:  s.810.1 creates a status
offence; it is impermissibly broad; and it is impermissibly
vague.  Second, he submitted that Then J. erred in reading down
&#147;shall&#148; to &#147;may&#148; in s.810.1(2) and that he should instead have
declared the subsection inoperative.  Third, he submitted that
Then J. erred in holding that a person subject to a s.810.1
proceeding can be compelled to court by an arrest warrant under
s.507(4) of the Code and can be detained pending the hearing
under s.515.  As part of this third submission the appellant
asked us to reconsider this court&#146;s decision in R. v. Allen3 in
the light of the Charter.
[5]  I would dismiss the appellant&#146;s appeal.  Because I agree
substantially with the reasons of Then J. I will limit my own
reasons to summarizing the main points on which I rely, focussing
on the specific arguments that were made before us.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The appellant is 55 years old.  He has been diagnosed as  a
paedophile.  He has an extensive criminal record dating  back  to
1961,  which  includes many convictions for indecent assault  and
sexual  assault committed against young boys.  These convictions,
in  the main, have resulted from the &#147;physical touching&#148; of  boys
between   5  and  17  years  of  age.   Of  the  appellant&#146;s   36
convictions,  26  have been for the physical  touching  of  young
males.
[7]  On November 18, 1994, the appellant was released from the
Kingston Penitentiary, after having served a six-year sentence
for three counts of sexual assault.  These sexual assault
convictions concerned three incidents in which the appellant
convinced the victims &#150; young boys &#150; to lay down in a park and
then fondled their bare stomachs, and in two cases their
genitals.  In sentencing the appellant, Webber D.C.J. wrote:
&#147;Clearly, Mr. Budreo is a person who has a paedophiliac problem
which has existed for many, many years and it appears that there
is very little that has been done for him and there is very
little that he has done for himself, except on a spasmodic and
irregular basis.&#148;
[8]  On his release, at the request of the Correctional Service
of Canada, the appellant submitted to a psychiatric assessment
under the Mental Health Act to determine whether he was
certifiable.  The psychiatrist with the Correctional Service who
did the assessment declined to certify the appellant.  The
psychiatrist concluded that the appellant did not pose a
sufficient risk of serious harm to himself or to members of the
public, that he had made considerable gains toward rehabilitating
himself, and that he was &#147;well motivated&#148;.  Doctors at the Clarke
Institute of Psychiatry also concluded that the appellant did not
pose a danger to himself or others and, thus, should not be
admitted under the Mental Health Act.
[9]  Since his release, the appellant has followed a treatment
plan devised for him.  The treatment plan consists of continued
psychiatric counselling directed by a doctor at the Clarke
Institute and monthly injections of the anti-androgen drug
Luperon.
[10] Nonetheless, the appellant&#146;s release from prison sparked
considerable publicity, most of it negative.  The appellant had
gone first to Peterborough and then to Toronto.  He was under
continuous police surveillance in both cities and press releases
were issued to tell the public of his whereabouts.
[11] Within three days of his release, the Crown began
proceedings under s.810.1 of the Criminal Code.  The Crown
acknowledges that it sought a recognizance under s.810.1, not
because the appellant had done anything improper or illegal since
his release from prison but because of his criminal record and
his diagnosis as a paedophile.
[12] On November 20, 1994, Detective Wendy Leaver of the
Metropolitan Toronto Police Service asked the appellant to agree
to enter into recognizance under s.810.1.  The appellant was
apparently unwilling to do so.  The s.810.1 application was then
scheduled for November 22, 1994 and the appellant was told to
obtain counsel.
[13] Detective Leaver swore an information under s.810.1 in which
she said she feared, on reasonable grounds, that the appellant
would commit any one of a number of specified sexual offences
against children under the age of 14.  She said that her fear was
based on the appellant&#146;s psychiatric reports between 1963 and
1993, his criminal record, numerous hospital and parole board
reports and a conversation with the appellant&#146;s treating
psychiatrist at the Clarke Institute, who considered the
appellant a high-risk paedophile if he did not take Luperon.
[14] Detective Leaver attended before Judge Kelly on November 22,
1994.  The appellant came to court voluntarily.  Nonetheless,
Detective Leaver asked the appellant to leave the courtroom, and
once he had done so, arrested him under s.507(4) of the Criminal
Code.
[15] The appellant was then in custody.  The Crown therefore
proceeded with a show cause hearing before Judge Kelly to
determine whether the appellant would be released on bail pending
the s.810.1 application.  The appellant had met with a lawyer the
evening before, but that lawyer had not been retained to conduct
the show cause hearing.  The lawyer did ask that the hearing be
adjourned 48 hours and that, in the interim, the appellant be
released from custody.  The Crown opposed the adjournment.  Judge
Kelly refused the adjournment request, saying that he would grant
it only if the appellant remained in custody.  The lawyer then
withdrew.  The appellant, unrepresented, agreed to the conditions
of his release on bail sought by the Crown.
[16] These conditions included that he not engage in any activity
involving contact with persons under the age of 14 unless in the
presence of and under the supervision of Reverend Hugh Kirkegaard
and another adult; that he not be at or be within 50 metres of a
public park, swimming area, daycare, school ground, playground,
community centre or any other place where persons under 14 can
reasonably be expected to be found, except in the presence of and
under the supervision of Reverend Kirkegaard and another adult;
that he continue to take Luperon (or Provera) at least once a
month; and that he continue counselling or treatment at the
Clarke Institute.  The s.810.1 hearing was adjourned to November
28, 1994.
[17] On November 28, 1994, Judge Kelly varied the appellant&#146;s
bail conditions.  At the same time, the appellant brought an
application for prerogative relief to prevent Judge Kelly from
proceeding with the s.810.1 hearing and for a declaration that
ss.810.1 and 507(4) of the Code violated ss.7, 9, 11 and 15 of
the Charter.  Pending the resolution of the constitutional
issues, the s.810.1 hearing has been adjourned.
[18] However, on December 13, 1994, the appellant&#146;s bail
conditions were further varied by Hoilett J.  Under the amended
conditions, the appellant continues to be prohibited from
activities involving contact with persons under 14 years of age
unless in the presence of an adult who does not have a criminal
record, he continues to be restricted in his movement in parks
and community centres, and he continues to be required to take
counselling.  The material in the record shows that the appellant
was continuing his counselling at the Clarke Institute and was
continuing to take Luperon.
[19] Fresh evidence filed on appeal showed that the appellant
brought a further application to vary the conditions of his bail,
which was opposed by the Crown.  In a decision dated October 1,
1998, Keenan J. refused the application.  In his reasons, he
noted that the appellant&#146;s bail conditions were virtually
identical to the recognizance conditions under s.810.1; that but
for a single breach of the condition not to consume alcohol, the
appellant had complied with all the conditions of his bail for
four years; that he had co-operated with a Circle of Support and
Accountability organized by volunteers of the Mennonite faith;
and that, indeed, Detective Leaver had participated in the Circle
to supervise the appellant and assist in his treatment.
Nonetheless, Keenan J. could find &#147;no basis for varying the
recognizance of bail&#148;.  I turn now to the constitutional issues
in this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>          First Issue &#150; Does s.810.1 violate s.7 of the Charter?</pre>
    <pre>[20] Subsections 810.1(1), (2) and (3) provide:

          810.1 (1) Any person who fears on  reasonable
	  grounds that another person  will  commit  an
	  offence under section 151, 152, 155  or  159,
	  subsection 160(2) or (3), section 170 or 171,
	  subsection 173(2) or section 271, 272 or 273,
	  in respect of one or  more  persons  who  are
	  under  the  age of fourteen years, may lay an
          information  before a provincial court judge,
	  whether  or  not  the  person  or  persons in
	  respect of whom it is feared that the offence
	  will be committed are named.
          
	  (2)   A    provincial    court   judge    who
          receives an information under subsection  (1)
          shall cause the parties to appear before  the
          provincial court judge.

          (3)   The  provincial  court   judge   before
          whom the parties appear may, if satisfied  by
          the  evidence adduced that the informant  has
          reasonable  grounds for the fear,  order  the
          defendant  to  enter into a recognizance  and
          comply  with  the  conditions  fixed  by  the
          provincial court judge, including a condition
          prohibiting  the defendant from  engaging  in
          any   activity  that  involves  contact  with
          persons  under the age of fourteen years  and
          prohibiting  the defendant from  attending  a
          public  park  or public swimming  area  where
          persons  under the age of fourteen years  are
          present or can reasonably be expected  to  be
          present,  or  a daycare centre, schoolground,
          playground  or  community  centre,  for   any
          period  fixed by the provincial  court  judge
          that does not exceed twelve months.</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  appellant&#146;s main constitutional attack on  s.810.1  is
that it violates s.7 of the Charter.  Section 7 provides:

  7.  Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of
  the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in
  accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</pre>
    <pre>[22] To make out a violation of s.7 the appellant must show first
that  s.810.1  deprives  him of his right  to  life,  liberty  or
security  of  the  person; and second, that this  deprivation  is
contrary to the principles of fundamental justice.
[23] The Crown acknowledges that the appellant meets the first
branch of the s.7 test.  Section 810.1 deprives the appellant of
his liberty.  The conditions in s.810.1 prevent the appellant
from going to many places that other Canadians can freely go to
and thus prevent the appellant from participating fully in a
community&#146;s activities.  Although not as serious an intrusion on
his freedom as detention or imprisonment, these conditions in
s.810.1 still restrict the appellant&#146;s &#147;liberty&#148; under s.7 of the
Charter.4  Whether these restrictions on the appellant&#146;s liberty
are in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice is
at the heart of this appeal.  The appellant argues that s.810.1
contravenes the principles of fundamental justice for three
reasons:  it creates an offence based on status; it is overbroad;
and it is void for vagueness.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (i)  Does 810.1 create a status offence?</pre>
    <pre>[24]  The appellant submits that s.810.1 creates an offence based
on  a  person&#146;s status alone, that is based on a person&#146;s medical
diagnosis or even on a person&#146;s past criminal record but  without
any current offending conduct.  The appellant argues that s.810.1
is  punitive,  that it punishes a person though that  person  may
have  done  nothing  wrong.  An offence based  on  status  alone,
according  to  the  appellant, is contrary to the  principles  of
fundamental justice.
[25] Accepting that a status offence contravenes fundamental
justice, there are two answers to the appellant&#146;s submission.
The main answer is that s.810.1 does not create an offence.  It
is a preventive provision not a punitive provision.  It aims not
to punish past wrongdoing but to prevent future harm to young
children, to prevent them from being victimized by sexual
abusers.  The second answer is that s.810.1 is not about a
person&#146;s status.  It is about assessing the present risk of a
person committing a sexual offence against young children.
[26] Whether s.810.1 is punitive or preventive permeated the
argument of this appeal.  Indeed, characterizing s.810.1 as
punitive is central to the appellant&#146;s position.  If s.810.1 is
punitive, if it creates an offence, then the appellant fairly
argues that it contains inadequate constitutional safeguards.
Then J., however, held that s.810.1 was a preventive measure
aimed at the protection of children, and I agree with him.
[27] The criminal justice system has two broad objectives:
punish wrongdoers and prevent future harm.  A law aimed at the
prevention of crime is just as valid an exercise of the federal
criminal law power under s.91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867,
as a law aimed at punishing crime.5  Thus, the appellant has not
argued, nor could he, that Parliament cannot validly pass a law
to prevent future harm to children.
[28] What the appellant does argue is that the law Parliament did
pass, s.810.1, is more punitive than preventive, and thus creates
an offence, based solely on a person&#146;s status.  Some aspects of
s.810.1 are punitive or coercive:  the availability of an arrest
warrant; detention pending a hearing unless the defendant is
released on bail; and jail on the defendant&#146;s refusal to enter
into a recognizance.  These coercive aspects, however, are
necessary to preserve the integrity of the s.810.1 proceedings.
By themselves, they do not turn s.810.1 into a punitive
provision.  Nor does the stigma that undoubtedly accompanies a
s.810.1 proceeding make the proceeding punitive.  That stigma
will attach whether the section is preventive or punitive.
[29] To characterize s.810.1 as punitive, as creating an offence,
the appellant would have to show that its purpose is &#147;to mete out
criminal punishment&#148;6 or that it has a &#147;true penal consequence.&#148;
A true penal consequence, according to the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Wigglesworth7 is &#147;imprisonment or a fine which by
its magnitude would appear to be imposed for the purpose of
redressing the wrong done to society at large.&#133;&#148;
[30] By these standards, s.810.1 does not create an offence.  Its
purpose is not to punish crime but to prevent crime from
happening.  Its sanctions are not punitive, nor are they intended
to redress a wrong; they are activity and geographic restrictions
on a person&#146;s liberty intended to protect a vulnerable group in
our society from future harm.
[31] As Then J. observed, s.810.1 is analogous to s.810, the
peace bond provision of the Criminal Code.  Typically, s.810 is
used to protect an identified victim, a person already harmed,
from further harm where evidence points to the likelihood of
danger to the victim from continuing contact with another person.
Courts have consistently held that s.810 is a preventive measure,
that it does not create an offence or mete out a criminal
punishment.8  The appellant did not suggest otherwise.  Nor
indeed did the appellant suggest that s.810 was unconstitutional.
Instead, he sought to distinguish s.810 by arguing that it is
meant to address breaches of the peace between citizens, and thus
it amounts to a private remedy to ensure that named individuals
remain law abiding.
[32] I see nothing &#147;private&#148; in s.810.  It authorizes a
recognizance order in the same way as does s.810.1.  Both are
concerned with preventing victimization.  The main differences
between s.810 and s.810.1 are the group of likely victims and the
breadth of restrictions that may be imposed.  A recognizance
order under s.810 aims to prevent harm to named individuals and
the restrictions are tailored to prevent contact between those
persons and the likely perpetrator.  A recognizance order under
s.810.1 aims to prevent harm to a large group of children,
identified only by their age, and the restrictions must
necessarily be more extensive to prevent contact between this
large group of children and the likely perpetrator.  Section
810.1 is therefore broader than s.810.  But the two sections are
similar enough that if s.810 does not create an offence, it is
hard to see how s.810.1 does either.
[33] Moreover, I do not regard s.810.1 as authorizing court-
ordered restrictions on a person&#146;s liberty because of that
person&#146;s status.  Section 810.1 looks not to a person&#146;s status
but to a person&#146;s present risk of future dangerousness.  That
risk will have to be assessed by looking at all relevant factors
in a person&#146;s life, factors that are not immutable but will
change over time.
[34] Thus, I conclude that s.810.1 does not create a status
offence.  It is a preventive measure.  Indeed, if the preventive
aspect of the federal criminal law power is going to be used
anywhere, I cannot think of a more important use than the
protection of young children from likely sexual predators.
However, although s.810.1 is properly characterized as a
preventive measure, to be constitutionally valid, it must be
neither overbroad nor vague.</pre>
    <pre>          (ii) Is s.810.1 overbroad?</pre>
    <pre>[35] The appellant submits that s.810.1 is overbroad contrary  to
ss.7  and 9 of the Charter.  Because I do not think that s.9 adds
anything to the appellant&#146;s position, I will focus only on s.7.
[36] That a law not be overbroad is now accepted as a principle
of fundamental justice.9  &#147;Overbreadth&#148; looks at the means a
legislature has chosen to achieve a legitimate objective.  The
means chosen must be sufficiently tailored or narrowly targeted
to meet their objective.  If the means chosen are too broad or
too wide, if the law goes further than necessary to accomplish
its purpose, the law becomes arbitrary or disproportionate.  A
person&#146;s rights will be limited without good reason.  The
principles of fundamental justice will be violated.
[37] I accept the legitimacy, and indeed the importance, of
Parliament&#146;s objective in passing s.810.1 of the Criminal Code.
Children are among the most vulnerable groups in our society.
The sexual abuse of young children is a serious societal problem,
a statement that needs no elaboration.  A sizeable percentage of
the sexual offences against children &#150; according to the record,
approximately 30 percent &#150; occurs in public places, the very
places specified in s.810.1.  The expert evidence shows that
recidivism rates for sexual abusers of children are high and that
keeping high-risk offenders away from children is a sound
preventive strategy.  Parliament thus cannot be faulted for its
objective in enacting s.810.1.  The state should not be obliged
to wait until children are victimized before it acts.  The
societal interest in protecting children from sexual abuse
supports Parliament&#146;s use of the preventive part of its criminal
law power.
[38] Even accepting the legitimacy of Parliament&#146;s purpose, the
appellant submits that the means it has chosen in s.810.1 to
achieve that purpose are too broad.  The appellant focuses on
four aspects of s.810.1:  the extent of the restrictions on his
liberty, the imposition of these restrictions without a
requirement of any previous offending conduct, the pre-hearing
arrest and detention provisions to which he was subjected, and
the extent of the procedural protections he was afforded.  I will
deal with each of these.  Overall, however, I am not persuaded
that s.810.1 is overbroad.  Parliament might have chosen other
means to achieve its objective but the means that it did choose
are reasonable and in accordance with the principles of
fundamental justice.
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Extent of restrictions does not make s.810.1 overbroad</pre>
    <pre>[39]  If a recognizance is ordered, a defendant may be restricted
from  participating in any activities or from attending a  public
park  or  public  swimming  area  where  children  under  14  may
reasonably   be   expected  to  gather  or  a   daycare   centre,
schoolground  or  playground.  In my  view,  these  restrictions,
although  limiting a defendant&#146;s liberty, are not  overbroad.   I
say  that for three reasons.  First, the restrictions stop  short
of  detention or imprisonment.  I think it fair to conclude  that
detention or imprisonment under a provision that does not  charge
an  offence would be an unacceptable restriction on a defendant&#146;s
liberty  and  would be contrary to the principles of  fundamental
justice.   But as Then J. observed, the restrictions contemplated
by s.810.1 permit a defendant to lead a reasonably normal life.
[40] Second, these restrictions on a defendant&#146;s liberty are
proportional to the important societal interest in s.810.1, the
protection of young children.  As McLachlin J. observed in R. v.
Seaboyer,10 &#147;the principles of fundamental justice reflect a
spectrum of interests, from the rights of the accused to broader
societal concerns.  Section 7 must be construed having regard to
those interests&#133;.&#148;  The defendant&#146;s right to liberty is not the
only s.7 interest at stake in s.810.1.  The societal interest in
protecting young children from harm must also be taken into
account.  Section 810.1 attempts to balance these two interests:
the interest of likely child sexual abusers in going where they
please, including places where young children gather, and the
interest of the state in ensuring that young children can go
safely and securely to places typically associated with
children&#146;s activities.  In my view, s.810.1 strikes a reasonable
compromise between these two interests.  It provides a measured
intrusion into a defendant&#146;s liberty consistent with protecting
young children from harm.
[41] Third, accepting Then J.&#146;s deletion of community centres,
the restrictions contemplated by s.810.1 are narrowly targeted to
meet Parliament&#146;s objective.  The only places a defendant may be
prohibited from going are where children under age 14 are or can
reasonably be expected to be present; and the only activities a
defendant may be prohibited from engaging in are those involving
contact with children under 14.  By limiting the scope of s.810.1
in this way, I do not accept the submission of the provincial
Crown that s.810.1(3) authorizes the court to impose broader
restrictions on a defendant&#146;s liberty than activities, areas or
places where children are likely to be found.  Subsection
810.1(3) provides that a judge may &#147;order the defendant to enter
into a recognizance and comply with the conditions fixed by the
provincial court judge, including&#148; the specified conditions
(emphasis added).  The specified conditions following the word
&#147;including&#148; are examples of the kinds of conditions that can be
imposed.  The context of s.810.1 and its overall purpose suggest
that the word &#147;including&#148; is used to limit the scope of the
general term &#147;conditions&#148; to those conditions similar to the
specified examples.11  On this interpretation, a judge could
prohibit a defendant from going to a recreation hall where young
children were likely to be present but could not, for example,
require a defendant to take the drug Luperon, however desirable
that may be.  This interpretation, in my view, not only
appropriately reflects the context and purpose of s.810.1, it
also accords with Charter values.  A broader interpretation,
permitting the judge to order a defendant to take a course of
treatment or to take a particular drug, under a provision that
does not create an offence would raise serious Charter concerns.
Under the narrower interpretation I have adopted, the
restrictions contemplated by s.810.1 are not overbroad.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Lack of a requirement of a previous criminal record
	  does not make s.810.1 overbroad</pre>
    <pre>[42]  A recognizance order may be imposed on a defendant who  has
no  previous  criminal record, who has committed no overt  sexual
act,  who has seemingly done nothing wrong.  All that is required
is  for  the  presiding judge to be satisfied the  informant  has
reasonable grounds for the fear that the defendant will commit  a
sexual  offence against a child under 14.  The appellant  submits
that  without a triggering requirement of some previous offending
conduct,  s.810.1  is overbroad because it applies  to  too  many
people.  I do not accept this submission.
[43] What s.810.1 is trying to measure is a defendant&#146;s present
likelihood of future dangerousness or present risk of committing
a sexual offence against children in the future.  Predicting
future dangerousness is not an exact science.  However, the
impossibility of making exact predictions does not render s.810.1
overbroad and contrary to our principles of fundamental justice.
LaForest J. addressed this point in dealing with the dangerous
offender legislation in R. v. Lyons:12

          However, as Holmes has reminded us, the life
	  of the law has not been logic: it has been
	  experience.  The criminal law must operate
	  in a world governed by practical considerations
	  rather than abstract logic and, as a matter of
	  practicality, the most that can be established
	  in a future context is a likelihood of certain
	  events occurring.
                          .   .   .   .   .
          It seems to me that a &#147;likelihood&#148; of
          specified future conduct occurring is the
          finding of fact required to be established;
          it is not, at one and the same time, the
          means of proving that fact.  Logically, it
          seems clear to me that an individual can be
          found to constitute a threat to society
          without insisting that this require the court
          to assert an ability to predict the future.</pre>
    <pre>So too did Lamer C.J.C. in dealing with the bail system in R. v.
Morales:13

          The bail system has always made an effort
	  to assess the likelihood of future dangerousness
	  while recognizing that exact predictions of
	  future dangerousness are impossible.  The Report
          of the Canadian Committee on Corrections (Ouimet
	  Report (1969)), one of the studies which led to
	  the current bail system, recognized the
	  impossibility of precise predictions at p. 110:

               It has been argued that there is no
               accurate way of predicting the
               accused&#146;s behaviour pending trial.
               Even if a measure of predictability
               could be achieved, any fact-finding
               process for determining this issue
               would be so time-consuming as to
               nullify the purpose of bail.
               We think the issued [sic] involved
               are no more difficult than others
               which courts are constantly called
               upon to resolve in other areas of
               the law.  Some reasonable
               assessment of the probability of
               the accused&#146;s behaviour pending
               trial is not impossible.  If the
               prosecution does not make out a
               reasonable cause for denial of
               bail, it follows that it should be
               granted.
          The bail system does not aim to make exact
          predictions about future dangerousness
          because such predictions are impossible to
          make.  However, Lyons demonstrates that it is
          sufficient to establish a likelihood of
          dangerousness, and that the impossibility of
          making exact predictions does not preclude a
          bail system which aims to deny bail to those
          who likely will be dangerous.</pre>
    <pre>[44]  A  previous  criminal  record for  sexual  assault  against
children   will  no  doubt  be  relevant  to  predicting   future
dangerousness in many cases.  But insisting on a previous  record
before  a  recognizance  can  be  ordered  would  undermine   the
preventive  purpose of s.810.1.  It would require a child  to  be
victimized  before the Crown could act, even  if  the  Crown  had
highly  reliable  evidence of dangerousness.   If  some  previous
offending  conduct were required before a recognizance  could  be
ordered,  then  the Crown could not protect children  from  child
sexual  abusers known to medical authorities but not yet  charged
or  from  sexual  abusers who could not be  charged  because  the
victim was too traumatized to testify or because the victim could
not  be  found.  Instead  of requiring  some  previous  offending
conduct, s.810.1 invites the presiding judge to consider all  the
relevant  evidence on whether a defendant will  commit  a  sexual
offence against children.  I agree with Then J.&#146;s summary of  the
kinds of evidence likely to be led before the presiding judge:14

   For instance, evidence may be led that the defendant has
   made a threat or sexual proposition to a specific child or a
   group of children.  More common, no doubt, will be cases where
   evidence will be led at the hearing concerning the individual&#146;s
   general proclivity to abuse children sexually.  This could be
   based on a relevant criminal record and past behaviour around
   children.  Evidence of a diagnosed medical mental disorder that
   predisposes the defendant to be sexually attracted to children
   might weigh in favour of ordering a recognizance, just as
   evidence of continuing successful treatment will be in the
   defendant&#146;s favour.  On the very wording of the section, no one
   factor can be determinative.</pre>
    <pre>[45]  This  passage reflects a sensible approach to a  proceeding
under   s.810.1.  Requiring  a  criminal  record  or  some  other
offending  conduct as a condition of a recognizance  order  under
s.810.1 is at odds with the preventive purpose of the section.  I
conclude  that  s.810.1  is not overbroad  because  it  fails  to
require  any  offending  conduct before  a  recognizance  can  be
ordered.
</pre>
    <pre>     3.   The pre-hearing provisions for arrest and bail do not
          make s.810.1 overbroad</pre>
    <pre>[46]  The provisions for pre-trial arrest and bail &#150; which, as  I
will  discuss later in these reasons, apply to a proceeding under
s.810.1  &#150;  carry  with them the possibility of a  sanction  more
severe  &#150;  custody or detention &#150; than any sanction that  may  be
imposed   as   a  result  of  a  hearing  under  s.810.1.    That
possibility, however, does not make the section overbroad.   Pre-
trial  arrest  or even pre-hearing detention may be necessary  to
secure  the  defendant&#146;s attendance at the hearing or to  prevent
harm  to  children  pending a hearing because  of  a  defendant&#146;s
unwillingness  to comply with reasonable terms  of  release.   In
short, as I have already said, pre-trial arrest and detention may
be  needed in some cases to ensure the integrity and viability of
the s.810.1 proceedings themselves.
</pre>
    <pre>     4.   Procedural safeguards are sufficient to not make
          s.810.1 overbroad</pre>
    <pre>[47]  The procedural safeguards in s.810.1 are adequate.   Anyone
subjected  to  a  s.810.1  application  receives  notice  of  the
hearing.    The   hearing  must  meet  the  procedural   fairness
requirements of a summary conviction trial.  No order can be made
until  after the hearing is completed.  The presiding  provincial
court  judge  has  discretion to limit the restrictions  imposed.
Any  order  made  is not a lifelong injunction; it  can  last  no
longer than a year and may be renewed only after an entirely  new
hearing.   A  person subjected to a s.810.1 order may appeal  the
order and may, at any time, seek to vary the conditions.
[48] I therefore conclude that s.810.1 is not overbroad.
Instead, it strikes a reasonable balance between the liberty
interest of the defendant and the state&#146;s interest in protecting
young children from harm.  A defendant&#146;s liberty interest may be
restricted only after a hearing complying with the requirements
of natural justice and only to the extent needed to avoid
unreasonably jeopardizing the safety and security of young
children.</pre>
    <pre>          (iii)     Is s.810.1 void for vagueness?</pre>
    <pre>[49]  Like  the  overbreadth principle, the  void  for  vagueness
principle is also concerned with whether the legislature has used
precise  enough  means  to achieve its  objective.   But  whereas
overbreadth is concerned with whether the legislation is targeted
sufficiently  narrowly, vagueness is concerned with  whether  the
legislation  is defined with sufficient clarity.   The  rationale
for  the  void  for  vagueness principle is that,  unless  a  law
sufficiently  delineates the area of risk  of  unlawful  conduct,
citizens  will not have the fair notice of the law to which  they
are  entitled, and police officers and others will have too  much
discretion in deciding how and when to enforce the law.  Thus,  a
law must provide &#147;an intelligible standard according to which the
judiciary  must  do its work&#148; and &#147;an adequate  basis  for  legal
debate,  that is for reaching a conclusion as to its  meaning  by
reasoned analysis applying legal criteria.&#148;15  Otherwise, the law
will  be  impermissibly  vague  contrary  to  the  principles  of
fundamental justice.
[50] The appellant submits that s.810.1 does not sufficiently
delineate an area of risk of unlawful conduct, and thus does not
provide fair substantive notice to a citizen, because it allows
for restrictions on liberty on an informant&#146;s fear on reasonable
grounds.  The appellant argues that the word &#147;fear&#148; should be
contrasted with the word &#147;belief&#148;, which is used in Criminal Code
provisions authorizing an arrest or a search.16  &#147;Fear&#148;, according
to the appellant, can be irrational or emotional and is
invariably subjective, while &#147;belief&#148; can be assessed
objectively.
[51] I do not accept the appellant&#146;s argument.  The word &#147;fear&#148;
or &#147;fears&#148; should not be considered in isolation but together
with the modifying words in s.810.1(1) &#147;on reasonable grounds.&#148;
Fear alone connotes a state of belief or an apprehension that a
future event, thought to be undesirable, may or will occur.  But
&#147;on reasonable grounds&#148; lends objectivity to the apprehension.
In other words, the phrase &#147;fears on reasonable grounds&#148; in
s.810.1(1) connotes a reasonably based sense of apprehension
about a future event, or as Then J. put it, it &#147;equates to a
belief, objectively established, that the individual will commit
an offence.&#148;17
[52] Moreover, although an informant&#146;s fear triggers an
application under s.810.1, under subsection (3) a recognizance
order can only be made if the presiding judge is satisfied by
&#147;evidence&#148; that the fear is reasonably based.  Section 810.1(3)
therefore requires the judge to come to his or her own conclusion
about the likelihood that the defendant will commit one of the
offences listed in subsection (1).  Although the &#147;evidence&#148; the
judge relies on might include hearsay, a recognizance could only
be ordered on evidence that is credible and trustworthy.
[53] Despite the need for the informant&#146;s state of belief to be
objectively assessed and for the presiding judge to come to an
independent conclusion, I acknowledge some imprecision in the
phrase &#147;fears on reasonable grounds.&#148;  But some imprecision is to
be expected because s.810.1 requires a prediction about future
dangerousness.  So too does s.810, which uses the same phrase.
The phrase is not so imprecise that it fails to delineate an area
of risk or fails to provide an adequate basis for legal debate.
Moreover, it is surrounded by requirements in s.810.1 &#150; the
information, the summons, the hearing itself &#150; that give the
defendant fair notice of the conduct sought to be prevented; and
if a recognizance is ordered, the defendant will have fair notice
of the conditions imposed and, thus, will know how to comply.
The threshold for declaring a law void for vagueness is
appropriately high.  Section 810.1 does not pass this threshold.
I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>          Second Issue &#150; Did Then J. err in reading down &#147;shall&#148;
          to &#147;may&#148; in s.810.1(2) of the Code?</pre>
    <pre>[54]  Subsection 810.1(2) provided that &#147;a provincial court judge
who  receives an information under subsection (1) shall cause the
parties  to  appear before the provincial court judge&#148;  (emphasis
added).   Then  J.  held  that, in the context  of  a  preventive
provision  like  s.810.1, making the issuance  of  process  on  a
defendant mandatory violated ss.7 and 9 of the Charter and  could
not  be justified under s.1.  In his view, &#147;an automatic issuance
of  process,  with  the  potential arrest of  the  defendant,  is
excessive and unwarranted.&#148;  It provides &#147;no control on obviously
unfounded  informations under which a person may be summonsed  or
arrested.&#148;18 Thus, it subjects the ordinary citizen to capricious
or  unjustifiable detention.  In Then J.&#146;s view, and  relying  on
the  Supreme  Court&#146;s decision in Baron v. Canada,19 &#147;a  residual
discretion is a constitutional requirement.&#148;  The Crown does  not
take  issue with Then J.&#146;s holding that &#147;shall&#148; in s.810.1(2)  is
unconstitutional.
[55] The appellant, however, takes issue with Then J.&#146;s remedy.
Having found that a discretion was a constitutional requirement,
Then J. applied s.52 of the Constitution Act, 1982, and read down
&#147;shall&#148; to &#147;may&#148;.  The appellant submits that he should simply
have declared the subsection inoperative.
[56] The Supreme Court refused to read down &#147;shall&#148; to &#147;may&#148; in
Baron itself, and in R. v. Swain.20  Then J. distinguished Baron
on the grounds that the Attorney General in that case had not
asked for the remedy of reading down and that, unlike the
provision challenged in Baron, s.810.1(2) was not central to the
legislative regime in s.810.1.  I think it fair to say, however,
that when legislation expressly excludes a judicial discretion,
courts have been reluctant to read one in as a constitutional
remedy.  Nonetheless, in my view, Then J. was correct to read
down &#147;shall&#148; to &#147;may&#148; in this case.
[57] In deciding on the appropriate remedy under s.52 for a
Charter breach, &#147;the court must apply the measures which will
best vindicate the values expressed in the Charter while
refraining from intrusion into the legislative sphere beyond what
is necessary.&#148;  Before reading down or reading in, the court must
ask &#147;whether it is safe to assume that the legislature would have
enacted the legislation in its altered form.&#148;21  Here, &#147;may&#148; in
s.810.1(2) appropriately vindicates Charter values.  Giving the
presiding judge a discretion whether to summons or arrest a
defendant once an information is sworn is an important
constitutional safeguard. Thus, the remedy of reading in &#147;may&#148;,
although explicitly altering the legislation, will &#147;preserve
statutory objectives within clear constitutional contours.&#148;22
[58] Recent legislation shows that we can safely assume
Parliament would have enacted s.810.1(2) with the word &#147;may&#148;.  In
1997 Parliament added two new provisions to the Criminal Code
similar to s.810.1, and in each new provision used the word &#147;may&#148;
instead of &#147;shall&#148;.  Section 810.01 authorizes a recognizance
order against a person likely to commit &#147;a criminal organization
offence,&#148; and s.810.2 authorizes a recognizance order against a
person likely to commit &#147;a serious personal injury offence.&#148;
Sections 810.01 and 810.2 are worded similarly to s.810.1 with
necessary modifications for their context.  Sections 810.01(2)
and s.810.2(2) are identical to s.810.1(2) except that in place
of &#147;&#133; shall cause the parties to appear before the provincial
court judge,&#148; in the two new provisions Parliament has used &#147;&#133;
may cause the parties to appear before the provincial court
judge.&#148;  Because Parliament itself has enacted s.810.01 and
s.810.2 to conform to Then J.&#146;s decision, we can safely assume
that reading down &#147;shall&#148; to &#147;may&#148; does not unnecessarily intrude
into the legislative domain.  I would not give effect to this
ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>          Third Issue &#150; Do ss.507(4) and 514 of the Criminal Code
          apply to a proceeding under s.810.1?</pre>
    <pre>[59] In R. v. Allen, this court held that what is now s.507(4) of
the  Code, allowing for the issuance of a warrant for the  arrest
of  the accused, applies to s.810 of the Code.  Subsection 507(4)
provides:

   Where a justice considers that a case is made out for
   compelling an accused to attend before him to answer to a charge
   of an offence, he shall issue a summons to the accused unless the
   allegations of the informant or the evidence of any witness or
   witnesses taken in accordance with subsection (3) discloses
   reasonable grounds to believe that it is necessary in the public
   interest to issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.</pre>
    <pre>[60]  In  Allen, the accused argued that s.507(4) applied  to  &#147;a
charge  of  an offence&#148; and thus could not apply to a  proceeding
under  s.810,  which  did not create an offence.   Goodman  J.A.,
writing for the court, rejected this argument.  Section 507(4) is
in  Part  XVI  of the Code; s.810 is in Part XXVII  dealing  with
summary  convictions.  Section 795 of the Code, which is also  in
Part  XXVII, states that the provisions of Part XVI &#147;with respect
to  compelling the appearance of an accused before a justice &#133; in
so  far  as they are not inconsistent with the Part, apply,  with
such  modifications as the circumstances require  to  proceedings
under  this  Part.&#148;  In Goodman J.A.&#146;s view, s.795 made  s.507(4)
applicable  to a proceeding under s.810 even though  s.810  &#147;does
not create an offence.&#148;23
[61] Section 515, the provision permitting bail pending trial,
also is in Part XVI of the Code; and s.810.1 is in Part XXVII of
the Code.  Therefore, applying Allen, both ss.507(4) and 515
apply to proceedings under s.810.1.
[62] The appellant asked us to reconsider Allen on its own terms
or in the light of the Charter.  In my view, Allen was correctly
decided.  Applying provisions relating to a charge against an
accused (ss.507(4) and 515) to a proceeding commenced by the
laying of an information (s.810.1) is a modification contemplated
by s.795 of the Code.  I am supported in this conclusion by the
decision of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in R. v. Wakelin,24
which reached a similar result.
[63] Allen, however, was decided without reference to the
Charter.  The appellant submits that applying ss.507(4) and 515
to a s.810.1 proceeding violates s.7 of the Charter.  The
argument has two branches: both permitting pre-hearing arrest and
detention because of a fear of future misconduct and permitting a
more severe sanction pending the hearing than could be ordered at
the conclusion of the s.810.1 hearing violate the principles of
fundamental justice.  I disagree.
[64] First, the presiding judge has a discretion whether to issue
a warrant for the arrest of a defendant or to detain a defendant
pending a hearing.  If a defendant is released pending a hearing,
the judge has discretion concerning the bail conditions to be
imposed.  The existence of this judicial discretion is, as I have
already said, an important constitutional safeguard and
procedural protection for the defendant.  The presiding judge has
ample authority to balance the interests of the defendant and the
interests of the public pending a s.810.1 hearing and to ensure
that the hearing is held promptly.  Second, and repeating what I
said earlier, provision for pre-hearing arrest and detention is
needed to preserve the integrity of the s.810.1 proceedings.  The
court may need the power of arrest and detention to ensure the
attendance of a defendant at the hearing or to protect children
from the possibility of serious harm pending the hearing.
[65] Moreover, s.810.1 is not rendered unconstitutional because,
in a particular case, an arrest warrant may have been
improvidently issued or inappropriate bail conditions may have
been imposed pending the hearing.  Support for this view may be
found in the decision of this court in R. v. Finlay,25 where it
was argued that the provisions of former s.178.13 of the Criminal
Code, which gave a judge the power to issue a wiretap
authorization, were unconstitutional because the broadly-worded
provision did not comply with minimum constitutional standards
for search and seizure.26 Martin J.A. held that, properly
interpreted, the provision complied with the Charter.27  The
requirement that the authorization be granted only where to do so
was in &#147;the best interests of the administration of justice&#148;
imported the requirement that the judge be satisfied the granting
of the authorization would further or advance the objectives of
justice, and, therefore, imported a requirement to balance the
state&#146;s interest in law enforcement and the individual&#146;s interest
in privacy.  These requirements, in turn, called on the judge to
apply minimum constitutional standards under s.8 of the Charter.
[66] The same analysis applies to the arrest and release
procedure imported into s.810.1.  Under s.507(4), the justice is
to compel the defendant&#146;s attendance by means of a summons only,
unless the allegations of the informant or the evidence
&#147;discloses reasonable grounds to believe that it is necessary in
the public interest to issue a warrant for the arrest of the
accused.&#148;  Because a hearing under s.810.1 can only result in the
defendant being required to enter into a recognizance, the
circumstances in which it would be &#147;necessary in the public
interest&#148; to issue an arrest warrant will be limited to cases
where that process is necessary to preserve the integrity of the
s.810.1 proceedings.  The justice will require the informant to
make out a case that the defendant will not otherwise attend
court or that the defendant poses an imminent risk to the safety
of children, which s.810.1 is designed to protect.
[67] If the justice does issue an arrest warrant, s.515 of the
Criminal Code directs the justice to release the defendant on a
simple undertaking without conditions, unless the prosecutor
shows cause why some more intrusive order &#150; such as a
recognizance with conditions &#150; is required.  The discretion under
s.515 must be exercised judicially and bearing in mind the
limited conditions that can be imposed following a successful
s.810.1 application.
[68] Finally, although s.515 provides that the justice may order
the detention of the defendant pending the s.810.1 hearing, that
discretion is circumscribed by the provisions of s.515(10), which
authorize detention only where necessary to ensure the
defendant&#146;s attendance at court, for the protection or safety of
the public or &#147;any other just cause&#148;, including the maintenance
of confidence in the administration of justice.  Again, in the
light of the limited consequences of a successful s.810.1
application, only in unusual circumstances will the justice be
entitled to order the detention of the defendant pending the
hearing.  Indeed, it will be a rare case where it would enhance
confidence in the administration of justice to detain a defendant
who is not alleged to have committed any crime and who can only
be required to enter into a recognizance at the conclusion of the
proceedings.
[69] So interpreted, these various provisions of the Code strike
the appropriate balance between the public interest in the
protection of children and the liberty interest of the defendant.
[70] For these reasons, I view ss.507(4) and 515 in their
application to s.810.1 as being in accordance with the principles
of fundamental justice.  Therefore, I would not give effect to
this ground of appeal.
