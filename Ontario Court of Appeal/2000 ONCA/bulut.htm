    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of MacKenzie J. dated June 3, 1998</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A. (dissenting):</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the order of MacKenzie J. in which he
determined the priorities among certain secured creditors of  two
bankrupt  companies.  MacKenzie J. declared that the  respondent,
the  mortgagee  in possession of certain premises,  had  priority
over  two  creditors  with perfected security  interests  on  the
assets  of the companies.  For the reasons that follow,  I  would
dismiss the appeal of the appellant Nicholas Bulut and allow  the
appeal of the appellant 1238157 Ontario Inc.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
               The parties</pre>
    <pre>[2]   This  appeal arises out of the bankruptcy of two companies,
Everingham  Brothers Limited and 764388 Ontario Limited.   764388
Ontario Limited operated as Royal Spas and I will refer to it  as
Royal   Spas  in  these  reasons.   Everingham  owned  commercial
premises  at  5  Tilbury  Court in Brampton.   Everingham  was  a
manufacturer  of  stainless steel cookware and therefore  it  had
various  presses and dies as well as inventory on  the  premises.
Royal  Spas leased space in the Tilbury property where it carried
on  the  manufacture and distribution of hot tubs  and  whirlpool
spas.   It  too  had  equipment and inventory  on  the  premises.
Everingham and Royal Spas were controlled by Nicholas  Bulut  and
his family.  Nicholas Bulut was the president of both companies.
[3]  The respondent Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada holds
the first mortgage granted by Everingham on the Tilbury property.
The original loan secured by the mortgage was $2,250,000 and the
mortgage was registered against the Tilbury property in January
1992.
[4]  Nicholas Bulut became a secured creditor of Everingham under
the following circumstances.  In 1991, Everingham granted a
security interest to the Royal Bank to secure a loan for
$568,000.  The financing statement was registered in accordance
with the Personal Property Security Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 10 in
November 1991.  Bulut purchased the Royal Bank interest in the
security on November 25, 1996 and the Bank assigned the security
to Bulut.  On November 26, 1996, a financing change statement was
registered under the PPSA.  On June 30, 1995, Everingham granted
a security interest to Bulut to secure a revolving line of credit
to be advanced by Bulut.  This security was registered on April
2, 1997.  At that time the line of credit stood at approximately
$100,000.  There is no suggestion that Bulut did not advance the
funds for which the security interests were granted in either
case.  Thus, by April 1997 Bulut was a secured creditor of
Everingham in the amount of approximately $650,000.
[5]  The other appellant in this case is 1238157 Ontario Inc.
(&quot;123. Inc.&quot;).  It became a secured creditor of Royal Spas under
the following circumstances.  In April 1995, Royal Spas granted a
security interest to Nicholas Bulut to secure a $2,000,000
revolving line of credit.  In April 1997, that line of credit
stood at just under $1,300,000.  On May 14, 1997, Bulut
registered his security interest in accordance with the PPSA.  On
May 23, 1997, Bulut assigned his security interest to 123 Inc.
and a financing change statement was registered a year later on
March 24, 1998.  123 Inc. is controlled by the Bulut family and
Nicholas Bulut&#146;s son is a director of that company.  On June 26,
1995, Royal Spas granted a general security agreement to National
Bank of Canada to secure a $250,000 loan.  A financing statement
was registered in accordance with the PPSA.  On May 16, 1997, 123
Inc. purchased the National Bank&#146;s interest and the general
security agreement was assigned to it.  A financing change
statement was registered on May 20, 1997.  Thus, by May 1997, 123
Inc. was a secured creditor of Royal Spas for approximately
$1,500,000.
               The court proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[6]   In  January  1996, Everingham went into default  under  the
mortgage  to  Sun  Life.   On April 2,  1997,  Dyson  J.  granted
possession of the Tilbury property and leave to issue a  writ  of
possession  to Sun Life.  Sun Life took possession on  April  25,
1997 and changed the locks.  At this point, Sun Life did not have
any  security interest in the personal property of the bankrupts.
The core of the dispute in this appeal centres on the attempts by
Everingham and Royal Spas to recover possession of their chattels
in  the Tilbury property.  To further complicate matters, on  May
2,  1997,  a  bailiff acting on behalf of the  City  of  Brampton
levied  distraint upon Everingham&#146;s personal property for arrears
in the payment of business taxes of approximately $80,000.
[7]  Shortly after Sun Life took possession, Everingham and Royal
Spas brought a motion for an order for recovery of their personal
property.  On May 9, 1997, Thomas J. made an order that on or
before May 15, 1997, Everingham and Royal Spas pay $35,000 into
court on account of occupation costs, costs of security guards
and utilities.  In the meantime, they were to have access to the
premises from 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. Monday to Friday of each
week.  They were also entitled to use the packaging machines.
Everingham and Royal Spas were to be responsible for the cost of
security guards, utilities and occupation costs in an amount to
be determined by Thomas J.  The $35,000 was paid in accordance
with this order.
[8]  From this time on, there was a continuing dispute between
Sun Life and Everingham and Royal Spas about access to the
property.  One difficulty was that the City of Brampton claimed
to have a secured interest in the personal property of Everingham
and it and another creditor, Aristech Chemical International
Limited, obtained court orders enjoining Everingham and Royal
Spas from in any way dealing with Everingham&#146;s personal property.
Further, it appears relatively clear that Everingham and Royal
Spas were not particularly interested in vacating the premises.
Rather, Everingham hoped to reach a settlement with Sun Life.
Several agreements were reached but never carried out by
Everingham.
[9]  A critical order in the appeal is the order made by
MacKenzie J. on June 4, 1997, in response to a further motion by
Everingham and Royal Spas for an order to permit recovery of
their personal property.  Nicholas Bulut swore an affidavit in
support of this motion.  In effect, Everingham and Royal Spas
sought an extension of time to realize on their inventory and
remove their personal property.  The order of June 4, 1997
included the following provisions:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   The occupancy costs (consisting of rent and security
     services) was fixed at $1,305 per day from and including 
     April 25, 1997.</pre>
      <pre>2.   The $35,000 paid into court was to be  paid out to 
     Sun Life on account of the occupancy costs.</pre>
      <pre>3.   The shortfall of $17,200 as of June 4, 1997 was to
     be paid by June  16,  1997.  Thereafter, the
     occupancy costs were to be paid on a weekly basis.</pre>
      <pre>4.   Everingham and Royal Spas were to have to August  1,
     1997 to remove their equipment, inventory and trade
     chattels subject to the following:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a)  any sale that may take place by Aristech pursuant
     to MacKenzie J.&#146;s order of the same date;</pre>
        <pre>(b)   provided that Everingham an Royal Spas make the
      payments referred to in para. (3.).</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10] The fifth paragraph of the order is the most important.   It
purported  to  create a charging order and was in  the  following
terms:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>5.  THIS COURT ORDERS that if the Plaintiffs [Everingham
and Royal Spas] fail to make the payment referred to in 
paragraph 3 of the Order the Defendant [Sun Life] shall be 
at liberty to exercise its right under the writ of possession 
herein and that any arrears in payment of occupancy costs 
shall be a charge on the said equipment, inventory and trade 
chattels in the same manner and to the same extent as a 
landlord&#146;s distress subject to any rulings as to the 
entitlement and priorities of the parties on the motion 
contemplated under paragraph 9 of my Order of even date 
in Court File No. 87-CV-428-CM, with liability for the 
occupancy costs on the proceeds of sale by Aristech only from
June 4, 1997 to the date of vacant possession.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[11]  While  Everingham  and Royal Spas  paid  the  shortfall  of
$17,200  they did not pay any of the occupancy costs  thereafter.
They  were  also not able to remove their equipment and inventory
from the premises.
[12] On September 17, 1997, Everingham filed a Notice of
Intention to file a proposal with the official receiver pursuant
to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B.-3.  On
October 3, 1997, on motion by Sun Life, MacKenzie J. lifted the
stay of proceedings under the BIA to allow Sun Life to sell
Everingham&#146;s assets if the occupancy costs were not paid by
Everingham by October 17, 1997.  MacKenzie J.&#146;s order contains
the following:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>THIS COURT ORDERS AND DECLARES that Sun Life has a charge 
on the assets of Everingham in the possession of Sun Life 
on the Premises (the &#147;Assets&#148;) and that Sun Life shall be 
entitled to distrain against the Assets in accordance with 
the terms of the Occupation Order for the amounts payable 
to it as occupancy costs accruing at the rate of $1,305.00 
per day from June 4, 1997 to the date when Sun Life receives 
vacant possession of the Property and to, subject to the 
provisions of this Order, proceed to sell such portion of 
the Assets as described hereinafter.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[13]  Everingham  failed to file a proposal and therefore  became
bankrupt on October 17, 1997 (effective September 17, 1997).
[14] On October 23, 1997, Bulut, as security holder of
Everingham, and 123 Inc., as security holder of Royal Spas,
served notice on Sun Life that they intended to exercise their
security interest over the collateral and chattels of Everingham
and Royal Spas in accordance with the PPSA.  Sun Life served its
own notice refusing to recognize these security interests and
objected to Bulut and 123 Inc. (the appellants) realizing on
their security.  Ultimately, the assets of Everingham and Royal
Spas were sold by an interim receiver and the proceeds now stand
in court to the credit of these proceedings.
[15] Royal Spas made a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy on
March 31, 1998.
[16] On April 8, 1998, Bulut and 123 Inc. brought a motion for a
declaration that their security interests had priority over the
occupancy costs payable to Sun Life in accordance with the
charging order of June 4, 1997. MacKenzie J. heard the motion and
issued orders on May 14, 1998 in respect of Everingham and June
3, 1998 in respect of Royal Spas.  It is these orders that are
subject to this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>               The orders under appeal</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  orders  made  by MacKenzie J.  may  be  summarized  as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
i.   Sun Life is a &#147;secured creditor&#148; within the meaning of
     the BIA.</pre>
      <pre>ii.  The charge on the assets of Everingham  and  Royal Spas
     respecting the occupancy costs created by the order of June
     4, 1997 constitutes a &#147;lien&#148; within the meaning of the PPSA,
     which lien is enforceable &#147;in the same manner and to the
     same extent as a landlord&#146;s distress&#148;.</pre>
      <pre>iii. Sun Life, as a secured creditor and lien holder, is outside
     the priorities regimes stipulated under the BIA and the
     PPSA.</pre>
      <pre>iv.  Sun Life has the right to enforce its lien rights for its
     occupancy costs in priority to the security interests of
     Bulut and 123 Co. in the assets of Everingham and Royal 
     Spas respectively.</pre>
      <pre>v.   The sale of the assets of Everingham and Royal Spas was
     to proceed forthwith.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18]  MacKenzie J. gave the following reasons for  these  orders.
In  his reasons in relation to Everingham he held that the charge
created  by  the  June  4, 1997 order made  Sun  Life  a  secured
creditor,  applying Re Sara (1985), 56 C.B.R. 283 (Ont.  H.C.J.).
He  held  that the charging order also gave Sun Life a  lien  &#147;by
operation  of  law&#148;.   (Since the parties  are  agreed  that  the
Personal  Property Security Act does not apply to  determine  the
priorities,  I  need  not  decide  whether  this  is  a   correct
characterization of the charging order.)  Further, by  reason  of
the  order of October 3, 1997, Sun Life &#147;in enforcing its  rights
has  the  status  of a landlord distraining, either  actually  or
constructively&#148;.   As  to the question of  priorities  among  the
secured creditors, MacKenzie J. held as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Since Sun Life is outside the ambit of both the BIA and the
PPSA regimes in terms of priorities, Sun Life has priority 
over Bulut in satisfying the charge or lien in its favour 
with respect to occupancy costs.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19]  MacKenzie J. held, however, that there were no grounds  for
piercing  the  corporate veil &#147;to impose  personal  liability  on
Bulut&#148;.
[20] In supplementary reasons on May 28, 1998, MacKenzie J. held
that,</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>[t]he charge and lien created under the June 4th, 1997 
order for occupancy costs refers to a landlord&#146;s distress 
right only for purposes of describing the means of 
enforcement; it does not state nor could it reasonably 
imply that the charge or lien created could only apply 
to the costs of the means of enforcement&#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21]  In  his reasons on June 3, 1998 in relation to Royal  Spas,
MacKenzie  J.  dealt  with other arguments  from  the  appellants
concerning the question of priorities.  He rejected the  argument
that   the  first-in-time  rule  should  apply  to  the   secured
creditors, relying upon the decision of this court in Leavere  v.
Port  Colborne (City) (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 44.  He reasoned  that
Sun  Life  was &quot;in possession&quot; of the chattels of Royal Spas  and
the  order  of  June 4, 1997 authorized Sun Life to &#147;enforce  its
lien  by  means analogous to a landlord&#146;s right of distress  upon
chattels&#148;.
[22] MacKenzie J. also held in the June 3, 1998 reasons that,
even if Sun Life did not have priority, he would have granted it
an order that the appellants could only realize on their security
interests upon paying all of the occupancy costs outstanding
under the June 4, 1997 order.  He reasoned as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The basis for such alternative relief is that it would be
just and equitable for 123 Co. and N. Bulut to pay such 
costs since the evidence establishes a continuing and 
concerted course of action between and among Mr. N. Bulut, 
Mr. S. Bulut and their respective corporations, including 
123 Co. herein, in delaying the payment of occupancy costs 
relating to personal property of Royal Spas and Everingham 
in respect of which Messrs. Bulut and their respective 
corporations now claim an interest as secured parties, and 
which personal property Sun Life has effectively warehoused 
for one year at a cost of $1,305.00 per day.  In my view, 
it would be a just, in the sense of fair or equitable, term
that the said Messrs. Bulut and their respective corporations 
in their capacities as secured parties of Everingham and Royal 
Spas should pay to Sun Life the occupancy costs for this 
collateral prior to their having any rights in and to the same 
vis-à-vis any security interest holders or claimants other 
than Sun Life.
          
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</pre>
    <pre>[23] For the purposes of this appeal, the appellants concede that
Sun   Life  is  a  secured  creditor  and  that  accordingly  the
priorities are to be determined outside the scheme of  the  BIA.1
Similarly, as indicated, the parties conceded that the PPSA  does
not apply.  They also concede that it is possible for a judge  to
make  a  charging order giving the person a priority  over  other
secured creditors.2  However, they submit that the charging order
of  June  4, 1997 did not give Sun Life such a priority and  that
accordingly  the  normal rule of priorities of secured  creditors
applies.   That rule is simply that priorities are based  on  the
&#147;first in time&#148; and the security interests of Bulut and 123  Inc.
were  prior in time to the June 4, 1997 charging order.  Finally,
in  the  absence  of a finding of fraud or some other  reason  to
pierce the corporate veil, the appellants submit that there  were
no  grounds in equity for giving the respondent priority over the
appellants.
[24] The respondent supports the motion judge&#146;s order principally
on the basis of equity.  It submits that the motions judge had an
inherent equitable jurisdiction to do justice between the
parties.  Sun Life had been thrust into the position of unwilling
creditor, required to warehouse and protect the goods of the
bankrupts for the benefit of the creditors.  It suggests that
there is an analogy to a solicitor&#146;s lien, which can take
priority in some circumstances over the claims of secured
creditors.  In support of its position, counsel for the
respondent carefully reviewed the facts to demonstrate that
Mr.  Bulut, as the directing mind of the bankrupts, had no real
intention of causing the bankrupts to remove their property from
the premises.  Rather, he was attempting to force Sun Life into
an improvident settlement of its claim on the mortgage.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The reasons of the motions judge raise two issues.   First,
did  the  charging order of June 4, 1997 give Sun Life a priority
at  law  over secured creditors?  Second, if not, did the motions
judge have an equitable jurisdiction to, in effect, give Sun Life
a  priority  over the claims of the secured creditors  that  were
related  to the bankrupts?  The phrase &#147;related to&#148; is mine,  but
as I understand his reasons the motions judge would have denied a
priority  to the appellants because of the conduct of  Mr.  Bulut
and  his  son  in causing the bankrupts not to pay the  occupancy
costs.</pre>
    <pre>               Issue One:     The position at law</pre>
    <pre>[26] In his reasons of May 14, 1998, the motions judge held that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Since Sun Life is outside the ambit of both the BIA and the
PPSA regimes in terms of priorities, Sun Life has priority 
over Bulut in satisfying the charge or lien in its favour 
with respect to occupancy costs.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27]  The  motions  judge  did  not  otherwise  explain  why  the
respondent&#146;s charge should take priority over the claims of other
secured  creditors.  In his reasons of June 3, 1998, the  motions
judge   expanded  on  his  initial  reasons.   He  rejected   the
applicability  of  the first-in-time rule and  relied  upon  this
court&#146;s reasons in Leavere v. Port Colborne (City).  In my  view,
Leavere does not support the motions judge&#146;s holding.  The  issue
in  that  case  was  whether  a  municipality  distraining  on  a
taxpayer&#146;s chattels for arrears of business taxes is entitled  to
those  chattels  as  against a creditor of the  taxpayer  with  a
registered   perfected  security  interest  in  those   chattels.
Galligan J.A., writing for the court, held that the PPSA did  not
apply  because of s. 4 of that Act, which provides that  the  Act
does  not  apply to a lien given by statute or rule of  law.   He
then  noted  at  pp.  48-9  that at  common  law  priorities  are
determined  in  accordance with the chronological  order  of  the
encumbrances.   The creditors in Leavere relied  upon  this  rule
since  their  security  interests  were  registered  before   the
exercise of the right of distress by the municipality created the
lien  upon  the taxpayer&#146;s chattels.  Galligan J.A.  adopted  the
following  statement  of  the  common-law  rule  from  Spence  on
Equitable Jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery (1850),  vol.  2,
at p. 727:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It has already been stated that the general rule, though 
not without exceptions as will presently appear, is, that 
statutes, judgments and recognizances, at law and in 
equity, and equitable charges of every kind, in equity, 
all rank according to their dates:  therefore, in the 
absence of particular circumstances, the successive periods 
of their execution or attainment constitute the order in 
which they will be directed to be satisfied.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[28] However, Galligan J.A. held at p. 52 that it has always been
recognized  that this common-law rule could be displaced  by  the
provisions  of  a  statute  and  this  was  the  effect   of   s.
400(2)(c)(ii) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.  M.45.   That
provision gave the municipality the right to levy unpaid taxes by
distress  upon  any goods and chattels in the possession  of  the
taxpayer  where title to the goods and chattels is  claimed,  &#147;by
way of mortgage or otherwise&#148;.  The security interests claimed by
the creditors in that case were so similar to mortgages that they
could  be included in the word &#147;otherwise&#148;.  Galligan J.A.  found
that the legislature had clearly intended that the municipalities
were entitled to levy by distress upon chattels in the possession
of  a person taxed although the chattels were subject to security
agreements.   At  p.  53, he held that it  would  &#147;amount  to  an
absurdity  if  the  statute  authorized  distress  upon  chattels
covered  by security agreements but did not intend as  well  that
the lien created by the exercise of the right of distress was  to
have priority over the security agreement&#148;.
[29] In my view, the decision in Leavere supports the position of
the appellants in this case with respect to the effect only of
the June 4th order.  There is no statutory exception to prevent
the ordinary rule from applying &#150; that secured interests of all
kinds rank according to their dates.  In this case, the
appellants&#146; perfected security interests all preceded the
charging order of June 4, 1997.
[30] The motions judge, however, relied upon Leavere by analogy.
He referred to the following excerpt from the reasons at p. 53
and held that by substituting &#147;rule of law&#148; [being the June 4th
charging order] for &#147;statute&#148; or &#147;statutory&#148;, the same result
could be achieved.  The passage referred to by the motions judge
is as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The municipalities&#146; liens arose when the municipalities 
took possession of the chattels in exercise of their 
statutory power to distrain.  Because the statute authorizes 
distress upon chattels subject to security agreements I am 
constrained to conclude that the lien which arises upon the 
exercise of that right must take priority over the security 
agreements.  It would, in my view, amount to an absurdity if 
the statute authorized distress upon chattels covered by 
security agreements but did not intend as well that the lien 
created by the exercise of the right of distress was to have 
priority over the security agreement.  The power to distrain 
upon chattels subject to security agreements would be 
rendered nugatory if the security agreements were not 
required to rank behind the liens which had arisen by rule 
of law.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[31]  The  difficulty  with  the  analogy  is  that,  while   the
legislature  by  express  language  clearly  intended  that   the
municipality have the right to distrain upon chattels subject  to
security  agreements, the wording of the June 4th order does  not
expressly  give  that  right.   For  convenience,  I  repeat  the
relevant part of the charging order:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; any arrears in payment of occupancy costs shall be a
charge on the said equipment, inventory and trade chattels 
in the same manner and to the same extent as a landlord&#146;s 
distress &#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[32] While the order makes the arrears a charge on the assets  of
the  [now] bankrupts and provides as means for realizing  on  the
charge,  &#147;in  the  same  manner and  to  the  same  extent  as  a
landlord&#146;s  distress&#148;,  it  did  not  expressly  give  the  order
priority  over  the secured interests of the appellants  who,  it
should  be  pointed out, were not parties to  the  June  4,  1997
proceedings. My interpretation of the order is bolstered  by  the
supplementary reasons of the motions judge on May 28, 1998  where
he held:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The charge and lien created under the June 4th, 1997 order
for occupancy costs refers to a landlord&#146;s distress right 
only for purposes of describing the means of enforcement; 
it does not state nor could it reasonably imply that the 
charge or lien created could only apply to the costs of the 
means of enforcement&#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[33]  Even if the use of the phrase, &#147;in the same manner  and  to
the  same  extent  as  a  landlord&#146;s distress&#148;  was  intended  to
describe  the priority of the charging order, it cannot give  the
respondent  a  priority over the perfected security interests  of
the  appellants.   In Commercial Credit Corp. Ltd.  v.  Harry  D.
Shields  Ltd.  et  al. (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 703 (C.A.)  affirming
(1980),  29  O.R.  (2d) 106 (Ont. H.C.J.), this court  held  that
through the combined operation of the common law and s. 31(2)  of
the  Landlord and Tenant Act, R.S.O. 1970, c. 236 [now Commercial
Tenancies  Act  R.S.O. 1990, c. L.7, s. 31(2)] a  landlord  could
levy  distress  on goods found on the demised premises  including
goods  subject  to  a chattel mortgage.  However,  this  priority
arises  not simply because the landlord has a right of  distress,
but  depends upon the landlord taking possession of the  chattels
pursuant to its right of distress.
[34] However, on October 3, 1997, after Everingham filed its
Notice of Intention to file a proposal with the official receiver
pursuant to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act, MacKenzie J. made
a further order lifting the automatic stay of proceedings in
favour of Sun Life.  This order included the paragraph set out
above which I repeat for convenience:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>THIS COURT ORDERS AND DECLARES that Sun Life has a charge 
on the assets of Everingham in the possession of Sun Life 
on the Premises (the &#147;Assets&#148;) and that Sun Life shall be 
entitled to distrain against the Assets in accordance with 
the terms of the Occupation Order for the amounts payable 
to it as occupancy costs accruing at the rate of $1,305.00 
per day from June 4, 1997 to the date when Sun Life 
receives vacant possession of the Property and to, subject 
to the provisions of this Order, proceed to sell such 
portion of the Assets as described hereinafter. [Emphasis
added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[35] In my view, the only reasonable interpretation of this order
is  that  Sun  Life  was deemed to have taken possession  of  the
assets   of   Everingham  pursuant  to  its  right  of  distress.
Everingham  appealed this order but the appeal was  dismissed  by
the  Registrar of this court for failure to perfect.3  The  order
of  October 3rd therefore stands and whether or not it was  based
on  a  correct interpretation of the June 4th order, it gave  Sun
Life  priority  over  Bulut.  I would therefore  dismiss  Bulut&#146;s
appeal.
[36] The appeal of 123 Inc. stands in a different position.  It
was not affected by the order of October 3rd, which related only
to the assets of Everingham.  123 Inc.&#146;s security was on the
assets of Royal Spas.

               Issue Two:  The position in equity</pre>
    <pre>[37]  In  view of my conclusion on the first issue, this part  of
the  analysis only directly concerns the dispute between 123 Inc.
as  secured  creditor of Royal Spas and Sun  Life&#146;s  claim  to  a
charge  on the assets of Royal Spas.  In his reasons of  May  14,
1998,  dealing only with Everingham, the motions judge held  that
there were not sufficient grounds to pierce the corporate veil to
impose  personal liability on Bulut.  In his reasons of  June  3,
1998, dealing with Royal Spas, the motions judge did not make any
such  comment in respect of Mr. Bulut or his son as  regards  123
Inc.  On the other hand, there is nothing to distinguish the  two
cases.   I  did not understand the respondent to argue  that  the
order  of  June  3, 1998 could be upheld on the  basis  that  the
motions judge had pierced the corporate veil to, in effect,  make
123 Inc. or its principals responsible for the debts incurred  by
Royal Spas under the charging order.
[38] The issue then is whether the order of June 3rd can be
supported on the basis of an equitable jurisdiction.  MacKenzie
J. held that Bulut and 123 Inc. could not realize on their
security interests until they had paid the occupancy costs under
the June 4, 1997 charging order.  For convenience, I repeat his
reasons for that disposition:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The basis for such alternative relief is that it would 
be just and equitable for 123 Co. and N. Bulut to pay 
such costs since the evidence establishes a continuing 
and concerted course of action between and among Mr. N. 
Bulut, Mr. S. Bulut and their respective corporations, 
including 123 Co. herein, in delaying the payment of 
occupancy costs relating to personal property of Royal 
Spas and Everingham in respect of which Messrs. Bulut and
their respective corporations now claim an interest as 
secured parties, and which personal property Sun Life has 
effectively warehoused for one year at a cost of $1,305.00 
per day.  In my view, it would be a just, in the sense of 
fair or equitable, term that the said Messrs. Bulut and 
their respective corporations in their capacities as 
secured parties of Everingham and Royal Spas should pay to 
Sun Life the occupancy costs for this collateral prior to 
their having any rights in and to the same vis-à-vis any
security interest holders or claimants other than Sun Life.
[Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[39]  The  financial affairs of Everingham and  Royal  Spas  were
complex.    In  addition  to  the  security  interests   of   the
appellants, various other creditors sought to establish that they
had  secured  interests.  In particular,  the  City  of  Brampton
claimed  that  it was a secured creditor after it  exercised  its
right  of distress on the goods of Everingham for business taxes.
That  dispute did not involve Royal Spas, so far as I  can  tell.
However,  it seems to have been a factor that prevented Sun  Life
from  exercising  its  rights  under  the  charging  order.    On
September  24, 1997, MacKenzie J. held that Brampton  was  not  a
secured creditor.  Brampton appealed that decision to this  court
and  the  appeal was dismissed in reasons reported at (1999),  43
O.R. (3d) 594.
[40] With respect to Royal Spas, on July 2, 1997, Manton J. made
an order prohibiting Bulut and related persons from entering the
premises for any purpose or from obstructing any liquidation or
sale of the machinery and equipment of Royal Spas.
[41] Thus, because of various legal proceedings and court orders,
Sun Life, which was simply seeking vacant possession of the
premises, became the custodian of the appellants&#146; property.  The
motions judge considered it fair and equitable that 123 Inc. and
Bulut, rather than any of the other parties, bear the burden of
Sun Life&#146;s costs for preserving the appellants&#146; property.  If the
motions judge had the jurisdiction to make that determination, he
is entitled to deference from this court:  Regina v. City of
Barrie et al., Ex parte Bernick, [1970] 1 O.R. 200 (C.A.) at 206.
[42] In I. H. Jacob, &#147;The Inherent Jurisdiction of the Court&#148;
(1970), 23 Curr. Legal Probs. 23 at p. 51, the author described
the inherent jurisdiction of the court as that reserve or fund of
powers, &#147;which the court may draw upon as necessary whenever it
is just or equitable to do so, and in particular to ensure the
observance of the due process of law, to prevent improper
vexation or oppression, to do justice between the parties and to
secure a fair trial between them&#148;.4 Aside from such general
statements about a court of equity&#146;s right to do justice between
the parties, we were referred to no case that would justify the
order made by the judge in this case.
[43] Counsel for Sun Life sought to analogize its position to
that of a solicitor who is entitled to an order charging funds
that have been recovered or preserved by the action of the
solicitors.  In Budinsky v. The Breakers East Inc. (1993), 15
O.R. (3d) 198 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) at 206-9, Ground J. held
that the charging order should rank ahead of the other secured
creditor, although the latter&#146;s security preceded the charging
order of the solicitors.  Ground J. fully reviewed the
authorities, including the decision of Romer J. in Scholey v.
Peck, [1893] 1 Ch. 709 where at p. 711 he explained the rationale
for giving the solicitor priority over the secured creditor:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Here undoubtedly the property was preserved by the action
brought by these solicitors on behalf of the Plaintiff, 
and but for the proceedings taken by them the mortgagee 
would have lost her security.  In my judgment the case is 
governed by the principle of Greer v. Young [(1883), 24 
Ch. D. 545].  I hold, therefore, that the solicitors are 
entitled to the charge for which they ask, not only against 
the Plaintiff, but also against the mortgagee, who is 
taking the benefit of the action, over whose mortgage they 
must have priority.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[44]  In my view, this is not an apt analogy.  This is not a case
where, but for the actions of Sun Life, 123 Inc. would have  lost
its security.  As mortgagee in possession of the realty, Sun Life
had  certain rights.  On April 2, 1997, Dyson J. granted Sun Life
possession of the Tilbury property and leave to issue a  writ  of
possession.  The writ was issued and Sun Life took possession and
changed the locks.
[45] In any event, on May 9, 1997 the first of two orders was
made requiring Everingham and Royal Spas to pay occupancy costs.
In the second order, of June 4, 1997, MacKenzie J. ordered
Everingham and Royal Spas to pay $1,305 per day in occupancy
costs &#147;to and including the date of vacant possession&#148;.  These
costs were to be paid on a weekly basis.  They were also required
to pay the arrears to that date.  Those arrears were paid on June
19, 1997.
[46] The order also provided that Everingham and Royal Spas had
until August 1, 1997 to remove their equipment, inventory and
trade chattels from the premises.  However, pursuant to the order
if Everingham and Royal Spas failed to make the arrears payment
or the weekly payments, Sun Life was &#147;at liberty to exercise its
right under the writ of possession&#148;.  Finally, the order provided
that the occupancy costs were a charge on the equipment,
inventory and trade chattels in the same manner and to the same
extent &#147;as a landlord&#146;s distress&#148;.  None of the weekly payments
were made and Sun Life could therefore have taken steps to obtain
vacant possession or, at the very least, exercise its right of
distress and sell the goods, presumably in accordance with s. 53
of the Commercial Tenancies Act.  It did not do so.  Instead, it
entered into negotiations with the mortgagor in an attempt to
reach some solution.  This was its choice.  It seems to me that
the problem with Sun Life&#146;s position is captured in an excerpt
from its counsel&#146;s affidavit where he says:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Sun Life never wished the occupancy costs claim to keep
escalating; however, it could not, without giving up 
possession of the assets, and therefore, giving up its 
security without payment, cap the amount owing pursuant 
to the June 4 and October 3 Orders.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[47] At least under the June 4th order, Sun Life had the right to
attempt to collect the occupancy charges by exercising its rights
under  the  writ  of  possession.  That  would  have  capped  the
occupancy charges and it could have done so a week after June 19,
1997,  when  Everingham and Royal Spas failed to pay that  week&#146;s
costs.   Alternatively, it could stand by and let  the  occupancy
costs  accrue knowing that the occupancy costs were a  charge  on
the  assets.  The risk it ran in pursuing that course  of  action
was  that,  if  there was not sufficient value in the  assets  to
cover  both  the secured claims and the occupancy charges,  under
the  first-in-time  rule,  it would  not  recover  the  occupancy
charges.   This  was  a  matter within Sun Life&#146;s  control.   The
matter  is different from the case where a solicitor is  given  a
charging  order over property that would not have otherwise  been
available.   The  solicitors are given priority because,  without
their  action,  the  property  would  not  be  available  to  the
creditors.  Sun Life has not preserved assets that would not have
been available.  The assets were available.
[48] My concern with the motions judge's equitable remedy is that
it is based on nothing more than his assessment that &#147;it would be
a just, in the sense of fair or equitable&#148; result.  No doubt, in
cases where parties are in a relationship of, or akin to, trust,
a certain degree of generality or uncertainty is necessary and is
tolerable.  See Soulos v. Korkontzilas, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 217 at
236-37.  Sun Life, Everingham and Royal Spas were not in such a
relationship, nor was Sun Life in a vulnerable position.  In my
view, this degree of uncertainty is not to be encouraged in
matters associated with bankruptcy and insolvency.
[49] The result reached by the motions judge resembles the
doctrine of equitable subordination.  In Canada Deposit Insurance
Corp. v. Canadian Commercial Bank, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 558 at 609,
Iacobucci J. left open the question of whether such a doctrine
should be recognized in Canada.  This court has similarly left
the matter open in Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. v. Royal
Trust Co. (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 1.
[50] In Canada Deposit Insurance Corp., Iacobucci J. held that
assuming Canadian courts have the power in insolvency matters to
subordinate otherwise valid claims to those of other creditors on
equitable grounds relating to the conduct of these creditors
inter se, there were insufficient grounds to justify the exercise
of the power in that case.  He referred to the requirements for a
successful claim of equitable subordination as developed in the
United States as follows at p. 609:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>the claimant must have engaged in some type of 
inequitable conduct;

the misconduct must have resulted in injury to
the creditors of the bankrupt or conferred an
unfair advantage on the claimant; and

equitable subordination of the claim must not
be inconsistent with the provisions of the 
bankruptcy statute.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[51]  It  should be borne in mind that the motions judge did  not
&#147;pierce  the  corporate veil&#148;, nor did he find that the  security
interest  held  by  123  Inc.  was  not  bona  fide.   Thus,  the
&#147;claimant&#148; for the purposes of the doctrine is 123 Inc.   It  did
not  engage  in  any  kind of inequitable conduct,  nor  did  its
conduct result in injury to Sun Life.
[52] In P. V. Baker &amp; P. St. J. Langan, Snell's Equity, 29th ed.
(1990), at p. 57 the authors describe the circumstances in which
persons may lose a prima facie claim to which they would
otherwise be entitled under the first-in-time rule:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>A person with a prima facie claim to priority for his
interest may lose it through his own misconduct.  The 
owner of a legal interest may be postponed to a 
subsequent equitable interest owing to his fraud, or by 
estoppel, or through his gross negligence; and the 
owner of a prior equitable interest may be postponed if 
his conduct is inequitable.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[53] The motions judge made no finding of fraud against 123 Inc.,
nor  was there any evidence of estoppel or gross negligence  that
would  disentitle  123  Inc.  from asserting  its  prior  secured
interest.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[54]  Accordingly, I would dismiss Mr. Bulut&#146;s appeal.   I  would
allow  the appeal by 1238157 Ontario Inc., set aside paragraph  4
of  the order of MacKenzie J. dated June 3, 1998 and in its place
provide  that the rights of Sun Life are subject to the  security
interest of 1238157 Ontario Inc.  The appellants were represented
by  the same counsel in this court.  Accordingly, I would make no
order  for costs in this court.  1238157 Ontario Inc. is entitled
to its costs before MacKenzie J.</pre>
    <pre>                                   (signed) &quot;M. Rosenberg J.A.&quot;</pre>
    <pre><strong>MACPHERSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[55]  I  have had the benefit of reading the reasons prepared  by
Rosenberg  J.A.  I agree with his summary of the  facts  and  the
positions of the parties and with his statement of the issues.
[56] Rosenberg J.A. would dismiss Nicholas Bulut&#146;s appeal,
essentially on grounds of res judicata.  I agree with his
proposed disposition but would dismiss Mr. Bulut&#146;s appeal on the
merits.
[57] Rosenberg J.A. would allow 1238157 Ontario Inc.&#146;s appeal.
With respect, I disagree.
[58] I will attempt to set out, in brief fashion, my reasons for
the above conclusions.  Essentially, I agree with the reasons and
conclusions of MacKenzie J. in the two decisions which are the
subject of these appeals.</pre>
    <pre>
ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>[59]  There is a good deal in the legal analysis in my  colleague
Rosenberg J.A.&#146;s judgment with which I agree.  In order  to  move
quickly  to  the  crucial point of difference, I will  record  in
summary  form  the points on which I agree with Rosenberg  J.A.&#146;s
analysis.
[60] First, the appellant Nicholas Bulut (&#147;Bulut&#148;) is a secured
creditor of Everingham Brothers Ltd.  (&#147;Everingham&#148;).  Bulut
registered his security under the Personal Property Security Act
(&#147;PPSA&#148;) on April 2, 1997.
[61] Second, the appellant 1238157 Ontario Inc. (&#147;123 Co.&#148;) is a
secured creditor of 764388 Ontario Ltd. carrying on business as
Royal Spas (&#147;Royal Spas&#148;).  Through a variety of transactions
with Bulut and the National Bank of Canada, 123 Co. held a
registered security interest in Royal Spas by May 23, 1997.
[62] Third, there is nothing to suggest that Bulut&#146;s and 123
Co.&#146;s security interests in Everingham and Royal Spas are not
legitimate.
[63] Fourth, Bulut and his family controlled Everingham, Royal
Spas and 123 Co. at all times relevant to this appeal.  Royal
Spas leased space at Everingham&#146;s premises in Brampton.
[64] Fifth, the respondent Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada
(&#147;Sun Life&#148;) held a first mortgage on Everingham&#146;s property at 5
Tilbury Court in Brampton.  The mortgage was registered in
January 1992 and secured an original loan of $2,250,000.
Everingham defaulted on the mortgage in January 1996.  Sun Life
took possession on April 25, 1997 and changed the locks.  At this
juncture, Sun Life had no security interest in the personal
property at Everingham&#146;s premises.
[65] Sixth, as expressed by Rosenberg J.A., &#147;a critical order in
the appeal is the order made by MacKenzie J. on June 4, 1997.&#148;
Moreover, &#147;the fifth paragraph of the Order is the most
important&#148; because it purported to create a charging order over
personal property in favour of Sun Life and against both
Everingham and Royal Spas.  The relevant portion of paragraph 5
of the Order is:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>5.   THIS COURT ORDERS &#133; that any arrears in payment of
occupancy costs shall be a charge on the said equipment,
inventory and trade chattels in the same manner and to 
the same extent as a landlord&#146;s distress&#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[66]  Seventh,  as can be seen from the relevant  dates  set  out
above,  Bulut&#146;s and 123 Co.&#146;s security interests under  the  PPSA
arose  before Sun Life&#146;s security interest created by court order
(April 20 and May 23 versus June 4, 1997).
[67] Eighth, for reasons explained by Rosenberg J.A. and
MacKenzie J., neither the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (&#147;BIA&#148;)
nor the PPSA resolves the question of whose security interests
have priority.
[68] I turn now to where my analysis diverges from that of
Rosenberg J.A.
[69] After MacKenzie J. made his order on June 4, 1997, the
financial situations at Everingham and Royal Spas became
increasingly gloomy.  Everingham became bankrupt on October 17,
1997.  Royal Spas followed suit on March 31, 1998.
[70] The question then arose: which security interest had
priority, Sun Life&#146;s or Bulut&#146;s and 123 Co.&#146;s ?  On April 1,
1998, Bulut and 123 Co. brought a motion for a declaration that
their security interests had priority over Sun Life&#146;s.  On April
2, 1998, Sun Life brought a &#145;mirror&#146; motion seeking a declaration
in its favour.
[71] MacKenzie J. heard the motions and decided in favour of Sun
Life.  His reasons on the Sun Life-Bulut priority question (May
14, 1998) were sparse: &#147;Since Sun Life is outside the ambit of
both the BIA and the PPSA regimes in terms of priorities, Sun
Life has priority over Bulut in satisfying the charge or lien in
its favour with respect to occupancy costs.&#148;
[72] However, the motions judge provided more elaborate reasons
when he analyzed the Sun Life-123 Co. priority question (June 3,
1998).  In these reasons, he found in favour of Sun Life on two
bases &#150; first, reasoning by analogy from this court&#146;s decision in
Leavere v. City of Port Colborne (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 44; second,
applying equitable principles to require 123 Co. (and, by parity
of reasoning, Bulut) to pay occupancy costs before collecting
under its (their) security interest(s).  In broad terms, and
acknowledging that there is an overlap between the two reasons, I
would describe the motions judge&#146;s first reason as dealing with
how Sun Life could be given priority, and his second reason as
explaining why Sun Life should be given priority.
[73] On the question of &#145;how&#146;, the starting point, as the motions
judge recognized, was that the priorities regimes in the BIA and
PPSA did not apply.  Accordingly, the priorities issue had to be
resolved by the application of common law principles.
[74] Prima facie, the common law principle that applies to
priorities between secured interests is the &#145;first in time&#146; rule:
see McLaren, Secured Transactions in Personal Property in Canada,
2nd ed., looseleaf (Scarborough: Carswell, 1989)  at p. 5-202.
[75] However, the &#145;first in time&#146; rule is not an absolute rule.
It can be overridden by statute: see McLaren, Secured
Transactions in Personal Property in Canada, at p. 5-202.  An
example is s. 400 (2)(c)(ii) of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. M. 45, which allows municipalities to distrain upon the
chattels of persons who have not paid municipal taxes even though
the chattels are subject to security interests which arose before
the tax liability: see Leavere v. Port Colborne (City), supra.
[76] A second line of exception to the &#145;first in time&#146; rule is
provided by equity.  In Spence on the Equitable Jurisdiction of
the Courts of Chancery, the author identified the &#145;first in time&#146;
rule as &#147;the general rule&#148;( Vol. II, at p. 727).  However, he
stated that the rule was qualified by the notion of &#145;the better
equity&#146; and that  &#147;the circumstance of priority of time alone
does not give a better equity&#148; (Vol. II, at p. 737).
[77] In Snell&#146;s Principles of Equity, 29th ed. by P.V. Baker and
P. St. J. Langan (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1990) the authors
explain (at p. 57) the circumstances in which the holder of a
prima facie priority can lose it:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>A person with a prima facie claim to priority for 
his interest may lose it through his own misconduct.
The owner of a legal interest may be postponed to a 
subsequent equitable interest owing to his fraud, or 
by estoppel, or through gross negligence; and the 
owner of a prior equitable interest may be postponed 
if his conduct is inequitable.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[78]  The  motions  judge recognized the &#145;first  in  time&#146;  rule.
However,  he  determined that Sun Life had a better equity.   The
mechanism  he  chose  to  give effect to this  determination  was
reasoning  by  analogy from this court&#146;s decision in  Leavere  v.
Port  Colborne  (City).  He said that what  the  statute  did  in
Leavere  he  could  do  by  &#147;rule of  law&#148;  &#150;  i.e.  by  judicial
application  of  common law and equitable principles  &#150;  in  this
litigation.   Since  the  priority issue  had  to  be  determined
outside  the  framework of the BIA and the PPSA, I  can  find  no
fault in the motions judge&#146;s approach.
[79] Turning to the question of &#145;why&#146; Sun Life&#146;s interest was
entitled to be given priority over Bulut&#146;s and 123&#146;s interests,
the motions judge provided a clear reason:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>[T]he evidence establishes a continuing and concerted 
course of action between and among Mr. N. Bulut, Mr. 
S. Bulut and their respective corporations, including 
123 Co. herein, in delaying the payment of occupancy 
costs relating to personal property of Royal Spas and 
Everingham in respect of which Messrs. Bulut and their 
respective corporations now claim an interest as second
parties, and which personal property Sun Life has 
effectively warehoused for one year at a cost of 
$1,305.00 per day.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[80]  In  my  view,  the  motions judge&#146;s  reasons  for  applying
equitable principles to give Sun Life priority over Bulut and 123
Co.  are  sound.   The  record before  the  motions  judge  amply
supports his analysis and conclusion.  I will mention just a  few
of  the factors that, in my view, suggest that the motions  judge
was correct.
[81] First, the Bulut family were the principals and directing
minds of Everingham, Royal Spas and 123 Co.  One does not need to
pierce corporate veils to agree with the motions judge&#146;s
description of &#147;Mr. N. Bulut, Mr. S. Bulut and their respective
corporations.&#148;
[82] Second, Everingham had a huge mortgage from Sun Life.  It
defaulted on this mortgage in January 1996.  Bulut acquired the
major part of his security interest in Everingham  (approximately
$550,000 of a total interest of $650,000) after Everingham&#146;s
default on the mortgage.  Similarly, 123 Co. acquired its
security interest in Royal Spas (approximately $1,500,000) in May
1997.  Royal Spas was a tenant of Everingham.  It is obvious that
Bulut and 123 Co. acquired their security interests with full
knowledge that Everingham and Royal Spas were in serious
financial trouble, especially vis-à-vis Sun Life.
[83] Third, Sun Life&#146;s security interest in the personal property
at Everingham&#146;s premises was obtained in a court proceeding
launched by Everingham and Royal Spas in which they sought to
obtain their personal property (i.e. equipment and inventory)
from Everingham&#146;s premises.  On May 1, 1997, Nicholas Bulut, the
President of both Everingham and Royal Spas, swore an affidavit
in support of the motion.  At the time Bulut was a secured
creditor of both Everingham and Royal Spas. In his affidavit,
Bulut spoke on behalf of Everingham and Royal Spas.  However,
importantly, he also spoke explicitly in his capacity as holder
of security interests in the personal property of Everingham and
Royal Spas.  Bulut stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>15. &#133;  The items of personal property are owned by
Everingham and Royal Spas and Everingham and Royal 
Spas are lawfully entitled to possession of such 
property.  The items of personal property belonging 
to these corporations are themselves secured under 
a General Security Agreement.  I, Nicholas Bulut,
hold the security interest in these items of personal 
property belonging to Everingham and Royal Spas.  I 
am content, Royal Spas is content and Everingham5 is 
content if the items of personal property simply are 
released to all three of us and we can sort out our 
respective interests in the personal property.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[84]  In  other  words,  Bulut was openly representing  not  only
Everingham  and Royal Spas, but also himself in his  capacity  as
holder  of  security  interests  in  the  personal  property   of
Everingham and Royal Spas. He was seeking relief from  the  court
in both of these capacities.
[85] Fourth, the motions judge provided Everingham, Royal Spas
and Bulut with the relief they sought, provided Everingham and
Royal Spas paid occupancy costs of $1,305 per day from April 25,
1997 to the date on which the personal property was removed.
This order was not appealed.  Yet, almost immediately, the
companies stopped making occupancy cost payments.  Further, the
companies made no serious efforts to remove their personal
property.  In short, the companies and Bulut (explicitly) and 123
Co. (by strong and fair inference) sought relief from the court,
obtained it, did not appeal the court order &#150; and then promptly
ignored it.
[86] For these reasons, I agree with the motions judge that
Bulut&#146;s and 123 Co.&#146;s conduct disentitles them to obtain a
priority over Sun Life.  In the language of Snell&#146;s Principles of
Equity, supra, their misconduct estops them from claiming a
priority.
[87] I conclude with a final observation.  It is true, as
Rosenberg J.A. notes, that the motions judge&#146;s orders resemble
the doctrine of equitable subordination and that the Supreme
Court of Canada and this court have expressly left open the
question of whether this doctrine should be introduced into
Canadian law: see Canadian Deposit Insurance Corp. v. Canadian
Commercial Bank, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 558; and Olympia &amp; York
Developments Ltd. v. Royal Trust Co. (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 1
(C.A.).
[88] There is a crucial difference between those cases and this
appeal. In those cases, the issue before the courts was whether
the doctrine of equitable subordination should be introduced into
statutory regimes for determining priorities between creditors.
There is, as the courts recognized, a serious issue as to whether
courts should modify explicit priorities created by statute, even
if the modification arose through the application of equitable
principles.
[89] The situation in the present appeal is entirely different.
No statutory regime, including the BIA and the PPSA, determines
the priority issue as between Sun Life and Bulut and 123 Co.
That issue must be determined under common law principles.  In
that context, there is nothing wrong with a motions judge doing
what common law judges have done for centuries, namely
considering common law and equitable principles together in an
attempt to reach a fair result.  That is what the motions judge
did on these motions.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION
</pre>
    <pre>[90] For the above reasons, I would dismiss the appeals.  I would
award the respondent its costs of the appeal.</pre>

3    With the consent of the trustee, Bulut brought an
application for an extension of time to perfect the appeal.  That
application was dismissed.

para. 29, Lamer C.J.C. described this as the &#147;seminal article on
the core or inherent jurisdiction of superior courts&quot;.
5 123 Co. is not mentioned in this paragraph.  That is because on
May 1, 1997, when Bulut swore his affidavit, Bulut held the
security interest in the personal property of both Everingham and
Royal Spas.  On May 23, he assigned his security interest in
Royal Spas to 123 Co., another family company.  In my view, it is
no stretch to infer that what Bulut said qua secured creditor on
May 1 could be imputed to 123 Co. three weeks later.</pre></td>
