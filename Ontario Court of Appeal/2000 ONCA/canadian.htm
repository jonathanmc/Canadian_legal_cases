    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Swinton dated March
10, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LASKIN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns the interpretation of a contract.  The
respondent Canadian Premier Holdings Ltd. purchased the shares of
Canadian Premier Life Insurance Company, formerly The Citadel
Life Assurance Company, from the appellant Winterthur Canada
Financial Corporation by a share purchase agreement dated January
13, 1994.  The issue on the appeal is which party was required by
the terms of the agreement to pay industry-wide assessments
levied in 1994 and 1995 to indemnify the insureds of two
insolvent life insurance companies.
[2]  The trial judge, Swinton J., concluded that the terms of the
agreement required Winterthur to pay the assessments.  To support
this conclusion she relied on parol evidence of the negotiations
that led to the agreement.  In my view, she erred in her
interpretation of both the agreement and the parol evidence.  I
interpret the agreement to require Canadian Premier Life
Insurance to pay the assessments and I think the evidence of the
negotiations confirms this interpretation.  I would therefore
allow the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]  This dispute arises from J.C. Penny Life Insurance Co.&#146;s
entry into the Canadian life and health insurance market.  To
avoid the time and expense of obtaining its own licences J.C.
Penny decided to buy two existing companies &#150; The Citadel and
Legacy General &#150; which owned the necessary federal and provincial
licences, but wished to withdraw from the Canadian market and had
already sold off their blocks of business.  J. C. Penny purchased
the two Canadian companies through Canadian Premier Holdings for
$1,450,000.  Only the sale of The Citadel is relevant on this
appeal.
[4]  Winterthur acknowledged that J.C. Penny intended to buy
&#147;clean shell&#148; companies, that is companies with existing licences
but no existing business or liabilities.  Several provisions of
the share purchase agreement required Winterthur to indemnify the
respondents and their officers, directors and employees for any
liabilities of The Citadel.
[5]  Section 4.2 of the agreement dealt with liability for the
assessments levied by CompCorp (Canadian Life and Health
Insurance Compensation Corporation), an industry association
whose purpose is to compensate insureds if their insurance
company becomes insolvent.  Section 4.2 is the main term of the
agreeement in issue on this appeal.  It provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The Vendors shall pay any 1993 or prior years&#146; 
assessments by the Canadian Life and Health 
Insurance Compensation Corporation in respect 
of Canadian Premier and the Property and
Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation in 
respect of Legacy General no matter when they 
are made.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[6]  Every company licensed to sell life insurance in Canada must
be a member of CompCorp.  CompCorp is funded by three kinds of
assessments levied against member companies:  administrative
assessments to meet operating expenses; loan assessments to fund
CompCorp&#146;s extraordinary expenses; and specific assessments to
compensate insureds of insolvent insurers.  Specific assessments
are levied as needed and are calculated by applying a percentage
to each member company&#146;s average premium income for the preceding
five years.
[7]  What precipitated this litigation were several specific
assessments levied by CompCorp in 1994 and 1995, largely to pay
claims arising out of the insolvencies of Les Coopérants and
Confederation Life.  &#147;1994 Specific Assessment No. 1,&#148; dated June
13, 1994, called on the respondent Canadian Premier Life
Insurance to pay $84,157 in connection with the insolvency of Les
Coopérants.  The amount of the assessment was based on the
company&#146;s average premium income between 1989 and 1993, when The
Citadel operated the business.  Canadian Premier Life Insurance
paid the special assessment without objection at the time.  It
did not ask Winterthur to pay the assessment or suggest that
Winterthur was responsible for doing so.
[8]  In August 1994 Confederation Life became insolvent.  The
unexpected failure of this large insurer created the risk of a
significant liability for the life insurance industry in Canada.
&#147;1994 Specific Assessment No. 2,&#148; dated August 19, 1994, called
on Canadian Premier Life Insurance to pay $130,771 in connection
with the insolvency of Confederation Life and a further $13,024
in connection with the insolvency of Les Coopérants.  Canadian
Premier Life Insurance objected to paying this assessment.  In
October 1994 it sent the two specific assessments to Winterthur
and asked Winterthur to pay them.  When Winterthur refused to pay
these assessments and additional specific assessments levied by
CompCorp in 1995, the respondents started this litigation.
[9]  The amount of the specific assessments for Canadian Premier
Life Insurance between 1994 and 1996 totalled $485,880.  The
trial judge granted judgment for the respondents for $449,635,
that portion of the specific assessments attributable to The
Citadel&#146;s premium income in 1993 and previous years.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial judge concluded that Winterthur was responsible
for the specific assessments levied by CompCorp between 1994 and
1996 for three reasons:  s. 4.2 of the share purchase agreement,
the evidence of the negotiations that led to the inclusion of
s. 4.2, and s. 5.2, a general indemnity provision in the
agreement.
[11] The main reason for the trial judge&#146;s conclusion was her
interpretation of s. 4.2. For convenience I reproduce that
section:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The Vendors shall pay any 1993 or prior years&#146; 
assessments by the Canadian Life and Health 
Insurance Compensation Corporation in respect 
of Canadian Premier and the Property and
Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation in 
respect of Legacy General no matter when they 
are made.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12] The trial judge held that the phrase &#147;1993 or prior years&#146;
assessments&#148; meant &#147;assessments for those years,&#148; not
&#147;assessments in those years.&#148;  I agree that was a reasonable
interpretation of that phrase.  However, the trial judge then
concluded that the assessments in issue were assessments for
&#147;1993 or prior years&#148; because they were calculated on the
company&#146;s premium income for those years.  In my view, her
conclusion is flawed because it confuses liability for the
assessments with the method of calculating them.  The CompCorp
assessments are not a tax on previous income.  They are levied to
cover expenses in a particular year.  The Citadel had no
outstanding liability for assessments when the sale purchase
agreement closed in January 1994.  The assessments in question
were levied to cover the expenses of two insolvencies that took
place after closing.  They are therefore properly characterized
as 1994 and 1995 assessments and the respondents are liable to
pay them.  The basis for calculating these assessments &#150; the
company&#146;s previous five years&#146; premium income &#150; is irrelevant in
deciding which party is liable to pay them under s. 4.2 of the
agreement.  A court should interpret a plainly worded document by
presuming that the parties intended the legal consequences of
their words:  Eli Lilly &amp; Co. v. Novopharm Ltd., [1998] 2 S.C.R.
129 at 166-167.  In my view, the plain wording of s. 4.2 imposes
liability for the assessments in question on the respondents.
[13] The trial judge held that her interpretation of s. 4.2,
making the appellants liable, made commercial sense because it
protected the purchasers, the respondents, from the ongoing
burden of assessments calculated on premium income earned while
The Citadel was in business.  Where the words of a contract are
not ambiguous commercial reasonableness may inform the court&#146;s
reading of the text, but the interpretation that produces a
sensible commercial result is not determinative.  Nonetheless, as
Iacobucci J. wrote in Eli Lilly v. Novopharm, supra, at 166-167
&#147;it would be absurd to adopt an interpretation which is clearly
inconsistent with the commercial interests of the parties, if the
goal is to ascertain their true contractual intent.&#148;
[14] In my view, however, the trial judge&#146;s interpretation of s.
4.2 is not commercially reasonable because it fixes the
appellants, who are no longer in the insurance business, with an
ongoing and undetermined liability for five years in connection
with insolvencies not known or contemplated at the time the
agreement was made.  It seems to make more commercial sense that
the respondents, who are now in the insurance business, pay the
assessments associated with the insolvencies of others in the
industry.
[15] In interpreting s. 4.2, the trial judge considered evidence
of the parties&#146; negotiations.  In her view, the phrase &#147;no matter
when they are made&#148; in s. 4.2 made the interpretation of this
provision &#147;problematic.&#148;  Because I do not view the meaning of
s. 4.2 to be ambiguous, I think resort to parol evidence was
unnecessary.  Even so, the evidence of the parties&#146; negotiations
confirms that the parties intended the respondents to pay the
CompCorp assessments in issue.
[16] In the negotiations both sides were represented by major
Toronto law firms.  A draft share purchase agreement was
circulated in early January 1994.  That draft contained the
precursor to what became s. 4.2 of the final agreement, draft s.
4.7, which provided:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>4.7      CompCorp and PACICC</pre>
      <pre>In respect of time periods prior to the Closing 
Time, the Vendors shall prior to Closing pay all 
amounts due and, after Closing, pay all amounts 
that become due based on business written prior 
to the Closing Time to the Canadian Life and 
Health Insurance Compensation Corporation in 
respect of Citadel Life and the Property and 
Casualty Insurance Compensation Corporation in 
respect of Fire Insurance.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[17] This draft provision would have required the appellants to
pay the assessments in issue because they were &#147;based on business
written prior to the closing time.&#148;  But the wording of the
clause changed in the subsequent negotiations.  Counsel for the
respondents, believing that CompCorp made retroactive
assessments, wanted the appellants to pay for these assessments.
He made this point in a letter to the appellants&#146; counsel:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In respect of Section 4.7, my understanding is that 
CompCorp and PACICC make assessments retroactively, 
i.e. at the end of 1994, they could levy the 
assessment for 1993.  If that is the case, it is up 
to the Vendors to pay such an assessment.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18] The appellants were willing to pay for any assessments for
1993 or previous years but not for assessments after closing.
Thus, counsel for the appellants revised draft s. 4.7 to its
final wording in s. 4.2, including the phrase &#147;no matter when
they are made&#148; to deal with retroactive assessments.  He wrote
counsel for the respondents about the revision:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>We have revised section 4.7 to attempt to make it clear 
that the Vendors will be responsible for any CompCorp 
and PACICC assessments made for 1993 or prior years, but 
that the Vendors will not be responsible for any 
assessments made for subsequent years.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] Therefore the wording of s. 4.2 reflected the respondents&#146;
concern not to be responsible for retroactive assessments for
1993 or earlier years and the appellants&#146; concern not to be
responsible for assessments after 1993.  The trial judge rejected
the suggestion that the phrase &#147;no matter when they are made&#148; was
meant to cover retroactive assessments.  She did so because a
representative of CompCorp testified that up to the closing of
the transaction in January 1994 CompCorp had never levied a
retroactive assessment.  It seems to me, however, that what
CompCorp had done or not done was immaterial.  What mattered was
what was in the minds of the negotiators. Counsel for the
respondents was obviously concerned about retroactive assessments
and his concern was reflected in the final wording of s. 4.2.
The negotiations that led to the agreement therefore confirm that
the respondents were to be responsible for the CompCorp
assessments in issue on this appeal.
[20] Finally, the trial judge found that s. 5.2(f) of the share
purchase agreement imposed an obligation on the appellants to
indemnify the respondents for assessments calculated on premium
income in 1993 or previously.  Section 5.2(f), a general
indemnity provision, required the appellants to indemnify the
respondents for any losses arising from The Citadel&#146;s book of
business before closing:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>5.2  The Vendors shall, jointly and severally, indemnify,
defend and save harmless the Purchaser and its Affiliates 
and each of their directors, officers and employees from 
and against any and all Loss suffered or incurred by them, 
as a direct or indirect result of, or arising in connection 
with:</pre>
      <pre>(f)   any and all books of business, Assets or liabilities 
of any nature whatsoever of the Companies on or before
Closing, whether or not disclosed to the Purchaser, and 
regardless of whether the circumstances giving rise to a 
right of indemnification in connection with said books of
business, Assets or liabilities may, or may be said to, 
give rise to a right of indemnification under another 
Subsection of this Section 5.2.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21] In my view, the trial judge erred in relying on s. 5.2(f)
for two reasons.  First, the section does not apply to
assessments levied by CompCorp. The parties addressed liability
for CompCorp assessment separately and specifically in s. 4.2.  I
therefore think it reasonable to conclude that they did not
intend liability for these assessments to be governed by s.
5.2(f).  See Novopharm v. Apotex Inc. (1995), 60 C.P.R. (3d) 345
(Ont. Gen. Div.), affirmed (1996), 68 C.P.R. (3d) 238 (Ont.
C.A.).
[22] Second, even if s. 5.2(f) applies, it does not make the
appellants liable for the assessments in question.  Section
5.2(f) calls for indemnification for any liabilities arising from
The Citadel&#146;s book of business before closing. But the appellants
were not liable for any assessments before closing.  The
liability for the assessments in question arose after closing.
Again, the method for calculating those assessments is irrelevant
to when liability for them arose.
[23] I therefore conclude that the terms of the agreement require
the respondents to pay the assessments levied by CompCorp between
1994 and 1996.  I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
at trial, and dismiss the action.  The appellants are entitled to
their costs of the trial and the appeal.</pre>
