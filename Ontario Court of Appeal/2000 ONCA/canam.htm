“Realtors”) and the fourth party, National Trust Company of Canada (“National

and sale dated March 5, 1993, Canam Enterprises Inc. (“Canam”) agreed to
purchase 200 Finch Avenue West in Toronto (“the property”) from National Trust
pursuant to a power of sale.  The
purchase price of the property was $1,420,000. 
Canam provided a down payment of $290,000, and National Trust agreed to
take back a mortgage of $1,130,000 to secure the balance of the purchase price.</span></p>

also stipulated that the zoning of the property was C-1 Commercial.  It contained a requisition period that gave
Canam the right to make requisitions as to title and other matters.  Canam’s solicitor on the transaction, Coles,
requisitioned evidence that C-1 Commercial use could be lawfully
continued.  National Trust’s solicitors
responded with what has been described as “the usual satisfy yourself reply”.</span></p>

29, 1993, the property was subject to a site-specific zoning by-law which

on the vendor take-back mortgage to National Trust.</span></p>

was void and unenforceable because of the false representations made by the
Realtors about the zoning.  National
Trust counter-claimed for the balance owing on its mortgage and for payment on

J. concluded that false representations were made concerning zoning on behalf
of National Trust.  He then examined the
doctrine of merger in the context of the requisition period contained in the
agreement of purchase and sale.  He
concluded: “From the broad considerations it appears that the defence of Canam

breached their professional duty to Canam, including a fiduciary duty to Canam,
in failing to ascertain and disclose the restricted zoning by-law.  Coles pleads and relies on the provisions of

lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge referred to the
relevant authorities on the issues of cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel
and abuse of process.  He found
primarily that issue estoppel applied to the third party proceedings and in the
alternative that they were an abuse of process.  </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the false
representations made about the zoning possibilities, the motions judge
clarified that Coles was not asserting any independent liability claims.  All of the liability alleged in the third
and fourth party claims arising from the false representations involved
liability to Canam alone.  The motions
judge went on to find that issue estoppel applied.  He found that Day J.’s decision on the matter was final.  He also found that the issue regarding the
legal consequences of the false representations made to Canam was a fundamental
part of Day. J’s decision. The motions judge then concluded at para. 19:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>The fundamental
issue determined by Mr. Justice Day is whether, in all of the circumstances,
the transaction could be rescinded, or liability on the mortgage avoided, by
Canam based on the false representations. 
The source of those representations was not the issue.  The fact of the representations being false,
and the fact that they were made by others on behalf of National Trust, was
accepted by Mr. Justice Day.  He concluded,
regardless of those facts, that the transaction could not be avoided by Canam.  In my view, that is a complete answer to
whether Canam could now claim any relief surrounding these representations--it
could not.  Put another way, the
decision of Mr. Justice Day clearly determined that there was no liability of
National Trust to Canam arising from the false representations.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>            It follows from that conclusion that
it is not open to Coles to indirectly advance such a claim on behalf of Canam
because, in the end result, it would still involve a re-litigation of the same

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The principle of <i>res judicata</i> applies where a judgment rendered by a court of
competent jurisdiction provides a conclusive disposition of the merits of the
case and acts as an absolute bar to any subsequent proceedings involving the
same claim, demand or cause of action. 
Issue estoppel is one aspect of <i>res
judicata.  </i>The oft-cited
requirements of issue estoppel are attributed to Lord Guest in <i>Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung v. Rayner &amp; Keeler
Ltd. (No. 2)</i>, [1967] 1 A.C. 853 at 935 (H.L.): (1) That the same question
has been previously decided; (2) that the judicial decision which is said to
create the estoppel was final; and, (3) that the parties to the judicial
decision or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the
proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The key issue raised in this court is
whether the appropriate parties were privy to the proceedings between Canam and
National Trust so that the doctrine of issue estoppel applies to prevent the
third party claim by Coles against the Realtors.  I agree with the result arrived at by the motions judge but for
different reasons.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issues of identity of subject
matter and identity of parties had to be resolved by the motions judge.  The latter issue, also referred to as
privity, is treated identically under the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> whether the claim is cause of action estoppel or issue
estoppel. Someone who </span><span lang=EN-GB>is
privy in interest to a party in an action is equally bound by the final
judgment in those proceedings.  Thus,
where a party to the prior proceeding is clearly and sufficiently identified
with a non-party to the litigation, the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> may be applied: </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Gleeson v. J. Wippell &amp; Co. Ltd.</span></i><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Privity between an agent and a
principal will be based on privity of interest.  This matter was considered by Megarry V.-C. in <i>Gleeson </i>at p. 60:  “it seems to me that the substratum of the
doctrine is that a man ought not to be allowed to litigate a second time what
has already been decided between himself and the other party to the
litigation.  This is in the interest
both of the successful party and of the public. ... It is in that sense that I
would regard the phrase ‘privity of interest’.”</span></p>

on the question of privies. ... ‘Privies’ have been described as those who are
‘privy to the party in estate or interest’. 
Before a person can be privy to a party there must be community or
privity of interest between them.” Lord Reid made a similar comment in that
decision at p. 550:  “It has always been
said that there must be privity of blood, title or interest: here it would have
to be privity of interest.  That can
arise in many ways, but it seems to me to be essential that [there be] some
kind of interest in the previous litigation or its subject-matter”.  Thus, in the case of an agent and principal,
their mutual interest in the outcome of the lawsuit will make the agent a privy
to the principal -- a necessary element for the application of issue estoppel.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US> The motions judge found that Cole was a privy of Canam in the
prior proceeding between Canam and National Trust because he was Canam’s
solicitor.  This finding seems to me to
illustrate a misconception of the interaction between the various
proceedings.  Canam responded to the
Notice of Sale of National Trust by instituting an action against National
Trust for a declaration that the mortgage that authorized the Notice was void
and unenforceable by virtue of false representations as to the nature of the
zoning emanating from National Trust and conveyed to Canam by the
Realtors.  Canam did not sue the
Realtors, who had acted as the agents of National Trust in conveying these
alleged misrepresentations to it, and does not propose to sue them now.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the present action, Canam is suing
Coles for negligence for not advising it of the true nature of the zoning.  Coles, for his part, does not say he relied
on the representations of National Trust (or the Realtors) in not advising
Canam of the state of the zoning. 
Rather, he states that his retainer did not require him to give such
advice.  He is not attempting to excuse
his tort of negligence by stating that he relied upon the representations of
the Realtors.  He seeks to add the
Realtors as joint tortfeasors for their misrepresentations to Canam and claims
contribution under the <i>Negligence Act</i>.  </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue before the motions judge and
this court became whether Coles was estopped, or barred by the doctrine of
abuse of process, from raising as between Canam and the Realtors the issue of
whether Canam was relieved of liability under the mortgage to National Trust
because Canam relied on the zoning representations conveyed to it through
National Trust’s Agents, the Realtors. 
If my assessment of the situation is correct, the issue is not whether
Coles was a privy of Canam, but whether the Realtors were privies of National
Trust.  Instead of looking at the
relationship between the solicitor Cole and his client, the plaintiff, Canam,
we should look to the relationship between the third party Realtors and the
defendant in the Mortgage Action, National Trust.  The Realtors should take the position that Canam could have sued
them in the Mortgage Action as agents of National Trust for the same
misrepresentations that it alleged against National Trust and did not do so.
Since the Mortgage Action involving these allegations of misrepresentation was
resolved adversely to Canam, it follows that the issue of the validity of the
real estate transaction is <i>res judicata</i>
between Canam and National Trust and issue estoppel applies as between Canam
and the Realtors as  privies to National
Trust.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am satisfied that the Realtors are
privies of National Trust, but I am having some difficulty in applying issue
estoppel in this case.  The summary
judgment judge in the Mortgage Action found that false representations had been
made that were attributable to National Trust but that no remedy was available
to Canam because the representations complained of had merged in the closing of
the original real estate transaction. 
Because it was not required of him, he did not deal with the present
assertion that had the Realtors been parties to the Mortgage Action, he could
have awarded damages against them in favour of National Trust.  Accordingly, I am concerned that the
misrepresentation issue was disposed of in a manner that may not be dispositive
if the action was against the Realtors as well as National Trust.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In deciding the application of issue
estoppel, it is necessary to consider the context and rationale behind the
doctrine of <i>res judicata</i>.  As was stated by Ritchie J. in <i>Fenerty v. Halifax (City of) </i>(1920), 53

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-top:6.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US>The

as to the matters dealt with, but also as to questions which the parties had an
opportunity of raising.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Additional clarification for the
application of “issue estoppel” was provided by Dickson J. in <i>Angle v. M.N.R.</i> (1974), 47 D.L.R. (3d)
544 at 555-556 (S.C.C.):  “It will not
suffice if the question arose collaterally or incidentally in the earlier
proceedings or is one which must be inferred by argument from the judgment. ...
The question out of which the estoppel is said to arise must have been ‘<i>fundamental</i> <i>to the decision arrived at</i>’ in the earlier proceedings.” [Emphasis

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>It can hardly be said in this case
that the parties to the Mortgage Action had an opportunity to raise the issue
of the potential liability of an entity that was not a party to the action at
all.  Additionally, while the decision
that the misrepresentation merged in the conveyance was fundamental to the
decision that it could not affect the validity of the mortgage that was being
enforced, I am not altogether sure that merger would be a defence to the agents
of the National Trust in an action against them in damages.  Certainly, the point was never raised
because it was irrelevant to the proceedings as framed.  </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, we are not limited in this
case to the application of issue estoppel. 
The court can still utilize the broader doctrine of abuse of
process.  Abuse of process is a discretionary
principle that is not limited by any set number of categories.  It is an intangible principle that is used
to bar proceedings that are inconsistent with the objectives of public
policy.  The doctrine can be relied upon
by persons who were not parties to the previous litigation but who claim that
if they were going to be sued they should have been sued in the previous
litigation. This was the case in <i>M.C.C.
Proceeds Inc. v. Lehman Brothers International (Europe)</i>, [1998] 4 All E.R.
675 (C.A.) where the second claim was against a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
defendant in the first claim. 
Similarly, in <i>Solomon v. Smith</i>,
[1988] 1 W.W.R. 410 at 419-20 (Man. C.A.), the purchaser unsuccessfully sued
the vendor and was seeking to sue the vendor’s agent.  The court found that allowing the second action to proceed would
amount to an abuse of process. </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although there are no cases directly
on point in this jurisdiction, the general principles of abuse of process
dictate that the agent in this case should not be required to defend a cause of
action previously litigated.  The safest
question to ask is whether the same evidence is needed to support the issues in
both cases.  It would seem that the
evidence would be the same: the same evidence will be presented to show that a
negligent representation was made and the same evidence will be used to show
that the plaintiff relied upon the representations to his detriment. </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Unless there is new evidence, special
circumstances or equitable reasons, then Coles should not be entitled to raise
a second cause of action, identical in merit, against an agent who was a privy
to the initial proceeding.  The Realtors
could have been properly included in the initial proceeding. There could be any
number of reasons why Canam did not do so, but it hardly lies in the mouth of a
stranger to those proceedings to insist constructively that there now be a
trial as to the liability of the Realtors to Canam.       </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Maintaining open and ready access to
the courts by all legitimate suitors is fundamental to our system of
justice.  However, to achieve this
worthy purpose, the courts must be vigilant to ensure that our system does not
become clogged with unnecessary, repetitious litigation.  To allow the defendant to retry the issue of
misrepresentation would be a classic example of abuse of process and a waste of
the time and resources of the litigants and the court.  The retrying of the issues in this case
would also erode the principle of finality that is crucial to the proper
administration of justice.  Thus, where
agents as third parties must raise a defence to issues that are identical to
those in a prior proceeding against their principal, the court is entitled to
exercise its discretion and terminate the third party proceedings (and in this
case the fourth party) as an abuse of process.

analysis of both the factual context and the legal question addressed in the

specific issue determined in the earlier proceeding to be identified and
compared to the issue to be resolved in the subsequent proceeding.  This reflects “the fastidious approach” that

whether the Realtors owed a duty of care to Canam which was breached by the
misrepresentation concerning zoning. 
This duty is separate from and not derived from the contractual
relationship between Canam and National Trust. 
It depends on the nature of the direct relationship between Canam and
the Realtors.  This duty was not part of
the proceedings before Day J., which dealt with whether the contractual rights

consequence for National Trust of the false representation made to Canam was
fundamental to the decision of Day J., the legal consequence for the Realtors
of making that false representation was not before him.  In the language of <i>Angle v. Minister of National Revenue</i> (1974), 47 D.L.R. (3d) 544
(S.C.C.) quoted by my colleague, the question of whether the Realtor had an
independent duty of care to Canam, was not “fundamental to the decision arrived

proceedings do not raise the same question. 
The measure of whether the parties are the privies of those in the
earlier proceeding would seem to require that the same question be involved in
both proceedings, that is that the subject matter of both disputes be the
same.  This is implicit in <i>Gleeson v. J. Wipple &amp; Co. Ltd., </i>[1977]
3 All E.R. 54 (Ch.D.) at p.60 where Vice-Chancellor Megarry said:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>I do not say
that one must be the alter ego of the other: but it does seem to me that, <i>having due regard to the subject-matter of
the dispute</i>, there must be a sufficient degree of identification between
the two to make it just to hold that the decision to which one was party should
be binding in proceedings to which the other is party.  It is in that sense that I would regard the
phrase ‘privity of interest.’” [Emphasis added]</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Even if one were to address the “same
parties” requirement having due regard only to the subject matter of the
dispute before Day J. I do not think one could find the privity of interest
between Coles and Canam or between the Realtors and National Trust.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The subject matter of the dispute
before Day J. was the contractual right of National Trust and the corresponding
contractual obligation of Canam under the mortgage. Coles has no identification
of interest with Canam having regard to this subject matter.  He was simply its lawyer.  Canam’s contract with National Trust does
not reach him.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the same way, having regard to this
subject matter, the Realtors have no identification of interest with National
Trust.  The contract between Canam and
National Trust does not affect them at all. 
In <i>Solomon v. Smith</i> (1987), 45
D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 266 the Manitoba Court of Appeal reached just such a
conclusion.  It found that where a
purchaser had unsuccessfully sued a vendor seeking to avoid the transaction because
of a misrepresentation, the purchaser’s subsequent action in tort against the
vendor’s agent based on the same misrepresentation was not against the same
party or its privy.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary therefore it is my view
that the first requirement of issue estoppel is not met in this case, and the
third requirement is probably not met as well. 
I agree with my colleague that the third party claim ought not to have
been dismissed on the basis of issue estoppel.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Abuse of Process</span></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The doctrine of abuse of process engages
the inherent power of the court to prevent the misuse of its procedure, in a
way that would be manifestly unfair to a party to the litigation before it or
would in some other way bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  It is a flexible doctrine unencumbered by
the specific requirements of concepts such as issue estoppel.  See <i>House
of Spring Gardens Ltd. v. Waite and Others,</i> [1990] 3 W.L.R. 347 (C.A.) at
358.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>One circumstance in which abuse of
process has been applied is where the litigation before the court is found to
be in essence an attempt to relitigate a claim which the court has already
determined.  See <i>Solomon v. Smith</i>,<i> supra</i>.  It is on that basis that Nordheimer J. found
that this third party claim ought to be terminated as an abuse of process.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would disagree.  As I have attempted to indicate, the issue
in the third party claim is different from the issue already determined by Day
J.  The duty of care owed by the Realtors
to Canam was simply not before Day J. 
This is not the relitigation of an issue already decided by the court.
Hence, in my view, Nordheimer J. built his conclusion of an abuse of process on
an erroneous foundation.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This issue can be addressed by looking
not just at the claim but also at the party bringing it.  Here it cannot be said that the third party
claim is an attempt by Coles to relitigate a claim which he has previously
raised but lost. Coles has not raised this issue before in any legal
proceeding.  Nor could Coles have forced
Canam to raise this issue and sue the Realtors in the action in contrast
against National Trust before Day J. 
Coles has not had his day in court on this issue.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Equally this issue can be examined
from the perspective of the party required to defend the claim. Here, it cannot
be said that the third party claim forces the Realtors to relitigate a claim
which it has already successfully resisted. 
The Realtors have not previously been required to defend this nor any
other claim by either Canam or Coles.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although this is the first time that
the Realtors have had to respond to the assertion that they breached their duty
to Canam by making the negligent misrepresentation, they  say it is manifestly unfair to require them
to do so because of a prior proceeding in which it was found that on behalf of
National Trust they knowingly made this false representation. I do not find
this persuasive.  The prior proceeding
did not vindicate their conduct in the slightest, but rather found that the
Realtors had made the false representation. 
This prior finding hardly makes it unfair that they now must defend the
third party claim.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In summary, the third party claim
raises an issue not previously litigated. 
It is not manifestly unfair to allow Coles to bring the claim or to
require the Realtors to defend it.  In
my view, it is not an abuse of process. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would therefore allow the appeal
with costs payable by the third party. 
I would set aside the order below and order that the motion for summary
judgment in the third party claim be dismissed with costs payable by the third
party.</span></p>
