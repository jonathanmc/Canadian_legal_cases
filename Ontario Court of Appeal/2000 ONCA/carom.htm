<h2><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h2>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Disasters spawn litigation.  Trains collide or derail, planes crash,
ships sink, lakes and rivers become polluted, chemical factories explode,
ordinary people eat, drink, wear or use unhealthy or defective products.  People  sometimes hundreds, even thousands
 are injured or killed by these events. 
When the crisis subsides, some of the victims turn to the courts for
redress and compensation.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>One of the modern mechanisms for
dealing with the litigation fallout from major disasters is the class
action.  In Ontario, this type of action
is regulated in a detailed fashion by a relatively recent statute, the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992,
c.6.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In the <i>Report of the Attorney Generals Advisory Committee on Class Action
Reform</i> (1990), a class action was defined in simple, straightforward terms,
at p. 15:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A class action is an action
brought on behalf of, or for the benefit of numerous persons having a common
interest.  It is a procedural mechanism
that is intended to provide an efficient means to achieve redress for
widespread harm or injury by allowing one or more persons to bring the action
on behalf of the many.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In this passage, one of the principal
procedural goals of class actions is stated explicitly, namely litigation
efficiency.  This goal is sometimes
framed with different terminology  judicial economy.  The underlying objective of either formulation is the same,
namely to find a mechanism to enable the court system to deal efficiently with
a large number of claims being made by many aggrieved persons who have all
suffered injuries from the same event or product.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is, however, a second
fundamental procedural goal of class actions. 
It is to encourage access by victims to the court system.  In its landmark study, <i>Report on Class Actions</i> (1982), the Ontario Law Reform Commission
discussed the linkage between class actions and access to the courts in
considerable detail.  The Commission
stated its conclusion on this point, at p. 139:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The Commission is of the view that
many claims are not individually litigated, not because they are lacking in
merit or unimportant to the potential claimant, but because of economic,
social, and psychological barriers.  We
believe that class actions can help to overcome such barriers and, by providing
increased access to the courts, may perform an important function in society.
Quite clearly, effective access to justice is a precondition to the exercise of
all other legal rights.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i> (<i>CPA</i>)
is anchored in the principles of access to justice and judicial economy.  Lawyers and judges in Ontario are in the
early stages of grappling with this law. 
Class proceedings have been certified in several cases.  Some of the cases have dealt with defective
products such as silicone gel breast implants and pacemakers:  see, respectively, <i>Bendall v. McGhan Medical Corp.</i> (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 734 (Gen.
Div.), and <i>Nantais v. Teletronics
Proprietary (Canada) Ltd.</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 331 (Gen. Div.).  In other cases, courts have certified mass
tort claims in relation to a single accident, for example, a fire in a subway:
see <i>Bywater v. Toronto Transit</i> <i>Commission</i> (1998), 27 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>)
172 (Gen. Div.).</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Certifications of class actions under
the <i>CPA </i>have not been limited to
situations in which redress is sought for physical injuries.  Economic injury or financial loss has also
served as a basis for some class actions. 
For example, a class action was certified for a copyright infringement
claim by writers who alleged that a publisher had wrongfully reproduced their
work in electronic form: see <i>Robertson v.
Thomson Group</i> (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 161 (Gen. Div.).  Another class action was certified for
a  claim by building owners that certain
companies had engaged in illegal price fixing in relation to construction
materials:  see <i>Chadha v. Bayer Inc.</i> (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 29 (S.C.).</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, certifications of class
actions have not been automatic. 
Probably the most notable domain in which certification has been refused
relates to claims grounded in allegations of misrepresentation.  For example, a claim against a petroleum
company for misrepresenting the nature of a franchise to potential franchisees
was not certified:  see <i>Rosedale Motors Inc. v. Petro-Canada Inc.</i>
(1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 776 (Gen. Div.).  A
claim against Ontario Hydro for misrepresentation in the context of a bidding
process was also not certified:  see <i>Controltech Engineering Inc. v. Ontario
Hydro</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 5350 (Gen. Div.), affd.  [2000] O.J. No. 379 (Div. Ct.).</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The present appeal involves some of
the causes of action that have been considered by Ontario courts in previous
cases  misrepresentation, anti-competitive practices and conspiracy.  It arises in the context of economic, not
physical, injuries suffered by thousands of people who invested in a sham gold
mining company.  The plaintiffs in the
action lost a great deal of money.  They
allege that the defendants, the insiders of the company, made great fortunes
by lying to the public about the presence of gold in a mine in Indonesia.  The investors seek redress from the
insiders of the company.  The
procedural mechanism the investors want to employ in their litigation is
certification as a class action.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge, Winkler J.,
certified a class action with respect to three of the claims advanced by the
plaintiffs  fraudulent misrepresentation, the tort of conspiracy and breach of
the <i>Competition Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.
C-34.  However, he refused to certify a
class action for a fourth claim put forward by the plaintiffs, namely negligent
misrepresentation.  Winkler J.s decision
was upheld by the Divisional Court.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appeal from the Divisional Courts
decision raises at least two interesting and important questions.  First, is it appropriate to certify part of
an action as a class proceeding?  Is it
logical and desirable to permit a two-track lawsuit, with some claims
proceeding under the <i>CPA</i> while others
advance through the normal route of lawsuits initiated by individual
plaintiffs?  Second, is there a
sufficient distinction between the torts of fraudulent misrepresentation and
negligent misrepresentation to justify routing them onto separate tracks in the
litigation process?  Why is it
appropriate to certify a class action for a claim of fraudulent
misrepresentation, but refuse certification for a claim of negligent misrepresentation?</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The contextual point is this.  The plaintiffs initiated eight lawsuits
relating to the Bre-X gold mine and stock market debacle which I will shortly
describe.  The main action is against
Bre-X Minerals Ltd., Bresea Resources Ltd. and various individuals who held
senior positions in these companies.  In
the main action, the plaintiffs also sued two stock brokerage firms, Nesbitt
Burns Inc. and First Marathon Securities Ltd., and two research analysts,
Egizio Bianchini and Kerry Smith, employed by these firms.  The second action was brought against two
engineering companies which conducted analyses of gold resources on behalf of
Bre-X.  Five other actions were brought
against various stock brokerage firms and some of their individual analysts who
are alleged to have promoted Bre-X stock. 
An eighth action was brought against Ingrid Felderhof and Spartacus
Corp.;  it was stayed at an early
juncture.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge heard motions
seeking certification of the first seven actions as class proceedings.  His decision was that class proceedings were
inappropriate for all seven actions. 
His decisions with respect to all of the brokerage firms, the two
engineering firms, and all of the named individual analysts in those firms,
have not been appealed by the plaintiffs. 
In other words, the only defendants who remain in the proposed class
action are the companies and individuals directly involved in the gold mine
venture.  I make this point at the
outset to indicate that what might appear on the record as a highly complicated
matter (eight lawsuits, three categories of defendants, and almost three dozen
named defendants) is in fact, at this juncture, a much smaller matter  a
single action, a single category of defendants and ten named defendants.  In short, the lawsuit that will go forward
is against two gold mine companies and their senior officers;  it no longer relates to stock brokerage
firms or engineering companies which provided professional services to the gold
mine companies and to investors.</span></p>

point.  Although the title and sub-title
of this section of my reasons are factual background and  the events, an important warning is
required at the outset.  There has been
no trial in this matter.  Indeed, at
this juncture none of the defendants has been required to file a Statement of
Defence.  The facts in the action thus
far are not facts at all; rather, they are allegations by the plaintiffs.  However, as required by the <i>CPA</i>, the courts below accepted the
factual background set out in the plaintiffs statement of claim for purposes
of determining whether the plaintiffs claims should be certified as a class
action.  I will do the same, but
underline that at this point no one should accept those allegations as proven.</span></p>

junior mining company.  In 1989, its

venture obtained a contract of work to drill for gold in a remote area of
Indonesia known as the Busang.  For
several years, the results of the project were generally poor.  In the spring of 1993, Bre-X acquired an
option to purchase an 80 per cent interest in the Busang project.</span></p>

the deal and stating that the property showed sufficient gold to yield an
annual after-tax cash flow of US $10 million to Bre-X.  Thereafter, Bre-X and Bresea issued a series
of 160 press releases and other statements building on the favourable results
in the first release.  From January
1994, Bre-X reported core drilling results that gave investors reason to
believe that the Busang properties contained one of the largest gold deposits
ever discovered.  The price of Bre-X
shares rose from 50 cents in 1993 to more than $200 in late 1996.  Many Canadians made fortunes during these
years by trading in Bre-X shares.</span></p>

deposits in the Busang properties.  The
core samples drilled by Bre-X had been, in the language of the mining industry,
salted with gold which could not have come from the Busang.  In short, someone committed a massive
fraud.  As expressed bluntly in a May 3,
1997 report by Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd., a company retained by Bre-X to
perform a technical audit of Bre-Xs exploration work:</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge certified 15 common
issues for the class action.  He
explicitly held that these common issues are relevant to three of the legal
claims advanced by the plaintiffs  conspiracy, fraudulent misrepresentation
and breach of the <i>Competition Act</i>.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>However, the motions judge further
held that the 15 common issues did not relate to the plaintiffs claim of
negligent misrepresentation.  He
explained the different results for the torts of fraudulent misrepresentation
and negligent misrepresentation in this fashion:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The essence of each tort is the
representation made by the defendant to the plaintiff.  The plaintiffs contend that the series of
statements contained in the press releases and other documentation emanating
from Bre-X, notwithstanding their number and diversity of content, contain a
common misrepresentation, namely that gold was present in mineable quantities
in the Busang.  Thus they contend that
a number of common issues arise from what they state is a singular
misrepresentation.</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The plaintiffs identify some 160
statements made by the defendants over a 4 year period to a class indeterminate
in number and national in scope.  The
statements were distributed to the public through various forms of media and
subject to whatever editorial control that may have been exercised by the
respective proprietors.  The statements
were received by investors with varying degrees of sophistication and
knowledge, and more importantly, differing investment strategies.</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . . . .</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A reduction of the numerous
representations to a common representation requires analysis and
characterization of each individual representation, the plaintiffs perception
of the representation and the circumstances in which it was made.  This is, of necessity, an individual
inquiry.  Thus, the plaintiffs
contention that a multitude of statements can be reduced to a single core
representation is antithetical to the essence of a common issue in a class
proceeding.  That is to say, that the
common trial in the class proceeding is intended to resolve issues which have
been determined to be common between the defendants and the plaintiff
class.  As such, a resolution binds
every class member.  The existence of
the common issue must be discernible at the certification stage since it
provides the basis for the common issue trial and the viability of a class
proceeding.  The common issue cannot be
dependent upon findings which will have to be made at individual trials, nor
can it be based on an assumption to circumvent the necessity for the individual
inquiries.  <i>As such, there is no prospect of a resolution in a trial on common
issues which would advance this litigation in any manner as it relates to the
claim in negligent misrepresentation</i>.</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>However, I am of the view that the
claim in fraudulent misrepresentation raises common issues.  The plaintiffs allegation is that the Bre-X
operation was fraudulent.  Therefore, it
is contended, every representation, whenever made, is tainted by the
fraud.  The allegation that the fraud
permeates every statement raises common issues regardless of whether individual
issues may arise from the actual communications made to the class members.

are a new, different and, in many cases, complex development in the Ontario
legal system.  Because of this, a
practice has developed of assigning a small number of judges to hear

courts.  As expressed by Carthy J.A. in <i>Anderson v. Wilson</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d)

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bearing in mind this admonishment, I
have reached the reluctant conclusion that the Divisional Court and the motions
judge have erred on a matter of general principle.  I do not agree that there is a sufficient difference between the
plaintiffs claims in fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent
misrepresentation to justify certification of the former and non-certification
of the latter.  In my view, the creation
of such a dichotomy in this litigation is an error in logic, in principle and
in policy.  I reach this conclusion for
several reasons.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

ones.  </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, s. 8(1) of the <i>CPA</i> provides that a certification order
should set out the common issues of the class. 
Section 1 of the <i>CPA</i> defines
common issues as:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

issues of law that arise from common but not necessarily identical facts.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The observation I would make about
this definition is that it represents a conscious attempt by the Ontario
legislature to avoid setting the bar for certification too high.  The important procedural objectives of the <i>CPA</i>, namely promoting access to justice
and judicial economy, would not be realized if there was a requirement that the
prospective plaintiffs in a class action present absolutely identical issues of
fact or law.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the courts have also been wary
of setting the bar too high on the common issues factor.  In many cases, the Ontario courts have
stated explicitly that certification should be ordered if the resolution of the
common issues would advance the litigation. 
Resolution through the class proceeding of the entire action, or even
resolution of particular legal claims in the action, is not required.  In <i>Campbell
v. Flexwatt Corp.</i> (1997), 15 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 1 (B.C.C.A.), Cumming
J.A. said, at p. 18:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>When examining the existence of
common issues it is important to understand that the common issues do not have
to be issues which are determinative of liability; they need only be issues of
fact or law that move the litigation forward. 
The resolution of a common issue does not have to be, in and of itself,
sufficient to support relief.  To
require every common issue to be determinative of liability for every plaintiff
and every defendant would make class proceedings with more than one defendant
virtually impossible.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>In <i>Anderson v. Wilson</i>, <i>supra</i>, Carthy J.A., speaking for a
unanimous court, expressly adopted this reasoning.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Against the backdrop of the low bar
set by the legislature and judiciary for common issues, I turn to my third, and
most important, reason for thinking that the courts below erred.  Given the accepted definitions of the torts
of fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation, I can see no
logical or principled basis for treating them differently on the question of
certification.  I could understand an
order certifying, or refusing to certify, both claims.  I do not, however, understand why opposite
orders were considered appropriate for the two claims.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The best way to commence my discussion
of my doubts on this issue is by setting out the motions judges careful and
accurate description of the elements of the two torts.  He said:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The constituent elements of a
claim for fraudulent misrepresentation were enunciated by the Supreme Court of
Canada in <i>Parna v. G. &amp; S. Properties</i>
<i>Ltd.</i> (1970), 15 D.L.R. (3d) 336
(S.C.C.) at 344:</span></p>

margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt'><span lang=EN-US><i>Anson on Contract</i>, 12<sup>th</sup> ed., p. 187, where fraud has
been defined, reads:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote style='margin-top:6.0pt;margin-right:72.0pt;
margin-bottom:12.0pt;margin-left:72.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>[Fraud is] a false
representation of fact, made with a knowledge of its falsehood, or recklessly,
without belief in its truth, with the intention that it should be acted upon by
the complaining party, and actually inducing him to act upon it.</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>See also <i>Derry v. Peek</i> (1889), 14 A.C. 337 (H.L.) at 374.</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The tort of negligent
misrepresentation has five constituent elements.  There must be a duty of care arising from a special relationship
between a representator and a representee. 
There must be a representation made that was untrue, inaccurate or
misleading.  The representor must have
made the statement negligently.  The
representee must have reasonably relied upon the statement and further,
suffered damages as a result of the reliance. 
See <i>Queen v. Cognos</i>, [1993] 1
S.C.R. 87 at 110.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>There are substantial similarities in
these definitions of the two torts.  A
fraudulent misrepresentation is a false representation of fact; a negligent
misrepresentation is one that is untrue, inaccurate or misleading.  A fraudulent misrepresentation can be one
that is made recklessly, without belief in its truth; a negligent
misrepresentation is one that is made negligently or, to employ the standard
non-conclusory word, carelessly.  At
least two of the 15 common issues that have been certified relate directly to
the tort of fraudulent misrepresentation:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(g)       Did Bre-X and or the named defendants represent that:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote style='text-indent:36.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>(i)        There is gold in mineable quantities in
the Busang? </span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote style='margin-left:72.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt'><span
lang=EN-US>(h)       Were the
representations identified by issue (g) made knowing that they were false or
recklessly, caring not whether they were false or without exercising reasonable
care and attention?                   </span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>These common issues relate to two of the four components of the tort
of fraudulent misrepresentation  a false statement and two potential reasons
(knowledge or recklessness) for the statement. 
In my view, they relate equally to two of the five components of the
tort of negligent misrepresentation  a false statement and one potential
reason (carelessness) for the statement. 
My conclusion, therefore, is that there is a sufficient overlap in the <i>legal</i> claims of the plaintiffs, grounded
in fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation, to justify
certification for both claims.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, in my view there is a
substantial overlap of <i>factual</i> issues
common to both torts.  There are two
core issues in this litigation: first, was there gold in mineable quantities in
the Busang; and second, if there was not, what was the various defendants
knowledge of the true state of affairs?</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defendants conduct with respect
to the first question was manifested in the 160 statements and press releases
which informed the public about exploration developments in the Busang.  These 160 statements will have to be
analyzed in the context of the fraudulent misrepresentation claim.  The analysis might become somewhat
complicated.  For example, it cannot be
said categorically that the fraud crystallized with the first press release on
May 6, 1993 and that all of the other statements from Bre-X during the next
four years were mere elaborations on the crystallized fraud.  This would not be true for several of the
named defendants who were not associated with Bre-X in 1993  for example,
Francisco, Lyons and Kavanagh.  It
follows that an individualized assessment of each defendants conduct will be
required in the certified class action relating to fraudulent
misrepresentation.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given this reality, I see no
principled basis for treating the claim in negligent misrepresentation
differently.  Under both torts, the
focus will be on the defendants, their knowledge and their conduct.  Did they know (fraud) that there was no gold
in the Busang?  Were they careless about
(negligence) their knowledge of the state of affairs in the Busang?  The answers to these questions under the
tort of fraudulent misrepresentation might be different for each
defendant.  Some might have participated
in the fraud from its inception.  Some
might have joined the fraud later.  Others might never have known that there was a fraud or
participated in it in a fashion that might give rise to liability.  Precisely the same thing can be said about
the tort of negligent misrepresentation. 
Some of the defendants might have been careless about the state of
affairs in the Busang from the outset. 
Some might have become careless later. 
Others might never have been careless or participated in Bre-Xs affairs
in a fashion that would give rise to liability.  In short, the complexity that exists with respect to determining
the defendants states of mind and conduct is inherent in both torts.  It follows that certification should either
be granted or withheld for both claims.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I make one other observation with
respect to the overlap of factual issues common to both torts.  Both the motions judge and the Divisional
Court attached great significance to the fact that the contested
representations by Bre-X were not made on a single occasion;  rather they took the form of 160 statements
and press releases.  In the eyes of the
motions judge and the Divisional Court, this posed particularly difficult
problems on the reliance component of the tort of negligent
misrepresentation.  As expressed by the
Divisional Court:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>The alleged negligent misrepresentations include 160 or more Bre-X
press releases over a four year period beginning May 10, 1993.  The representations were different in
content and made at different times by different people for different reasons   As Winkler J. pointed out, the case of each individual
plaintiff requires an individual inquiry as to what representations he or she
relied upon and how he or she was affected by the particular
representation.  These individual
inquiries cannot be circumvented.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, I think it is a mistake,
at this early juncture of the litigation, to overemphasize the number and
diversity of Bre-Xs representations. 
One of the potential benefits of a class action with certified common
issues relating to the knowledge and conduct of the defendants is that the
resolution of those issues might narrow substantially the subsequent inquiries
on the plaintiffs side of the coin.  As
I understand the theory of the plaintiffs, the named defendants participated in
a scheme to promote Bre-X shares by embarking on a program of issuing press
releases they knew to be false, that portrayed the assay results from the
Busang site as demonstrating the existence of a gold mine of staggering
dimensions.  If these facts can be
established by the plaintiffs, the questions raised in paragraph 8(f) of the
order declaring the common issues must be addressed.  What did the individual defendants know about the promotional
fraud?  Here, if knowledge of the fraud
cannot be attributed to a given defendant, the lesser degree of complicity respecting
carelessness can be addressed.  At this
stage of the proceedings, the court does not know what this will entail by way
of evidence.  It is possible  I put it
no higher  that fixing the knowledge and conduct of each Bre-X insider will
present a much clearer picture.  For
example, if the moment when a Bre-X insider became careless about a
representation or representations in which he participated could be isolated,
the subsequent consideration, admittedly in individual trials, of such issues
as duty of care and reliance might be rendered more focussed and
manageable.  This would move the
litigation forward.  In short, the
existence of 160 representations should not be used as a reason to refuse
certification as a class action;  rather
certification is, potentially, a way of reducing those 160 representations to a
much smaller number of relevant ones.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fifth, in this action and in five
companion actions, the plaintiffs made claims against five stock brokerage
firms which provided investment advice and services to them.  The motions judge concluded that the claims
of fraudulent misrepresentation <i>and</i> <i>negligent misrepresentation</i> against the
brokerage firms raised common issues appropriate for certification.  He said:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I accept the plaintiffs
contention that common issues are raised on the basis that it is arguable that
a finding can be made at a common issue trial that there is a point in time at
which the analysts were, or ought to have been aware of the alleged fraud.</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>. . . . .</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The essence of misrepresentation
is the negligent statement.  If a point
in time is fixed at which the analysts knew or ought to have known of the
alleged fraud, then any statement to the contrary after that point is an
inaccurate, negligently made statement. 
Such a finding would advance the litigation.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>I agree with this analysis. 
In my view, if the words Bre-X insiders were substituted for
analysts, this reasoning would be equally applicable.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>  In summary, the motions judge and the Divisional Court certified
15 common issues as appropriate for resolution in a class proceeding.  The focus of these common issues is the
knowledge and conduct of the defendants, the Bre-X insiders.  The conduct, especially the reliance, of the
plaintiffs stays on the sidelines at this juncture in the litigation.  The plaintiffs advance four claims against
the defendants.  The courts below
certified three of them, including the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation.  I agree with these components of the courts
decisions.  However, the courts below
refused to certify the claim in negligent misrepresentation.  For the above reasons, I am of the view that
they erred in this refusal.  After
setting out the definitions of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation, the
motions judge said: The essence of each tort is the representation made by the
defendant to the plaintiff.  I agree
with that statement.  However, in my
view it serves to bind together, not divide, the treatment of both claims under
the <i>CPA</i>. </span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, and at a general level, I am
not aware of any Ontario case, before this one, in which some of the potential
claims were certified while others were not certified.  <i>Anderson
v. Wilson</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>Dabbs v. Sun Life Assurance Company of
Canada</i> (1998), 40 O.R. (3d) 429 (Gen. Div.), <i>Maxwell v. MLG Ventures Ltd</i>., [1995] O.J. No. 1136 (Gen. Div.), and
<i>Peppiatt v. Nicol</i> (1993), 16 O.R.
(3d) 133 (Gen. Div.) are all cases in which certifications were ordered.  In several of these cases there were
multiple claims advanced by the plaintiffs. 
On the other hand, <i>Hollick v. City
of Toronto</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 257 (C.A.),<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>
<i>Controltech Engineering Inc. v. Ontario
Hydro</i>, <i>supra</i>, <i>Rosedale Motors Inc. v. Petro-Canada Inc</i>.,
<i>supra</i>, <i>Mouhertos v. DeVry Canada Inc</i>. (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 63 (Div. Ct.),
and <i>Abdool v</i>. <i>Anaheim Management Ltd.</i> (1995), 21 O.R. (3d) 453 (Div. Ct.) are all
cases in which certification was refused. 
Again, in several of these cases there were multiple claims against the
defendants.  The implicit message from
these results is that the courts seem to employ a starting point or presumption
 I put it no higher  in favour of either <i>complete</i>
certification or <i>no</i>
certification.  The decisions of the
motions judge and Divisional Court in the present matter are not in tune with
these results.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, in my view there is
substantial merit in trying to utilize the <i>CPA</i>
to deal with as many issues as possible. 
On this point, the motions judges analysis of the relationship among
the three claims he certified is instructive:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Since I have found a class
proceeding to be the preferable procedure for resolving the common issues in
respect of the claim in conspiracy, I have concluded as well that it is in
keeping with the goals of the <i>CPA</i> to
determine the common issues arising out of the claims in fraudulent
misrepresentation and breach of the <i>Competition
Act</i> as part and parcel of the inquiry. 
The determination of the common issues proposed for the claims in
fraudulent misrepresentation and under the <i>Competition
Act</i> will not unduly complicate the common issue trial.  In my view, it advances the goals of
judicial economy to take advantage of the opportunity for efficiency presented
by the common issue trial necessary for the claim in conspiracy.  The fact that there will be a common issue
trial between the same parties, on a claim which arises from the same
background circumstances, favours including the common issues arising from
claims in fraudulent misrepresentation and breach of the <i>Competition Act</i>, even though the plaintiffs may still have to
engage in lengthy individual trials to determine the actual liability of the
defendants on the claims.  In these
unique circumstances, the efficiencies achieved on the one hand, offset the
inefficiencies on the other.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>I agree with this analysis. 
I would simply extend it to the plaintiffs fourth claim, the one in
negligent misrepresentation.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, I observe that the plaintiffs
and defendants accept that detrimental reliance is an element of both the torts
of fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. 
Moreover, they agree that the reliance component will have to be dealt
with at individual trials on the issue of fraudulent misrepresentation.  Yet the defendants do not use this two-track
scenario as a basis for challenging, by way of appeal or cross-appeal, the
certification of the claim in fraudulent misrepresentation.  In my view, this silence tells in favour of
moving the negligent misrepresentation claim onto the same unchallenged track
on which the fraudulent misrepresentation claim is already situated.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, the fact that determination of
some of the common issues relevant to the claim in negligent misrepresentation
(or indeed the other three claims) will not resolve the entire litigation is
not determinative.  Certification can be
the preferable procedure in situations far short of final resolution of the lawsuit.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>On this point, the decision of this
court in <i>Anderson v. Wilson</i>, <i>supra</i>, is instructive.  In that case, the court certified claims in
negligence and breach of contract by patients exposed to Hepatitis B through
electroencephalogram tests administered by the defendant clinics.  The court found that the class proceeding
could not resolve the ultimate issues of liability and damages because it could
not provide an answer to the pivotal question of causation.  In those circumstances, Carthy J.A. framed the
question in these terms, at p. 683:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The question then becomes whether
there are sufficient common issues left to justify certification.  In my view, it seems sensible with this
number of potential plaintiffs and the similarities that are evident in their
claims, that any potential efficiency in advancement of their claims through
the flexibility provided by the <i>CPA</i>
should, where reasonable, be utilized. </span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, this passage evinces a
proper understanding of, and respect for, the objectives of the <i>CPA</i>. 
The <i>CPA</i> does provide a
flexible procedure for dealing with multiple plaintiffs with similar claims,
usually arising out of a single accident, catastrophe or other major event.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Carthy J.A. then proceeded to answer
his own question in <i>Anderson v. Wilson</i>.  He said, at pp. 683-84:</span></p>

<p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In this case, the common issue as
to the standard of conduct expected from the clinics from time to time, and
whether they fell below the standard, can fairly be tried as a common
issue.  Resolving this issue would move
the litigation forward.  The
participation of the class members is not needed for that inquiry, although
their later evidence may bear upon whether standards, such as the use of
gloves, were actually met in individual cases. 
Isolating this one major issue, the class action proceeding clearly
appears to be the preferable method of resolution to the benefit of all
parties.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>A similar analysis can be made in the
present appeal.  The major common issue
in this action is the knowledge and conduct of the Bre-X insiders.  What did they know about gold in the Busang
and when did they know about it?  And,
given their knowledge, what did they tell the public and what legal rubrics
(innocent, false, careless, anti-competitive, conspiratorial) should be
attached to their statements?  The
answers to some of these questions may become complicated.  Moreover, different answers may be required
for different defendants.  However, the
complications are offset by two overarching considerations.  First, the presence and the stories of the
plaintiffs are not required for the first stage of the lawsuit.  The focus is on the defendants, their
knowledge and their conduct.  The
determination of these matters, although perhaps difficult, will move the litigation
forward.  Second, it is uncontroverted
that there will be a class proceeding with respect to three of the plaintiffs
claims.  In that context, it seems
sensible and desirable to place the claim of negligent misrepresentation on the
same litigation track.</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h2>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I think it important, and fair, to
place the disposition of this appeal in a proper context.  The Bre-X debacle has given rise to seven
separate lawsuits involving three different groups of defendants  the Bre-X
insiders, external analyst corporations and stock brokerage firms.  The plaintiffs have sought certification of
all of their legal claims in all seven actions.  A single judge, Winkler J., has been charged with dealing with
all class proceedings aspects of these actions.  In a series of comprehensive, careful and, I might say, timely
decisions, the motions judge has resolved many important and difficult issues,
including whether there are causes of action, the definition of the plaintiff
class, mechanisms for non-residents of Ontario to participate (or not) in the
class proceedings, and, ultimately, the appropriateness of certification of
class actions in terms of the statutory criteria of common issues and
preferable procedure.  In all of this,
the vast majority of the motions judges decisions have been accepted by the
parties.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The sole exception  and it is a minor
one in the grand scheme of the lawsuits relating to Bre-X  is this appeal
which challenges the decisions of the Divisional Court and the motions judge
refusing to certify the plaintiffs claim in negligent misrepresentation
against the Bre-X insiders.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons I have outlined above,
I would allow the appeal.  Paragraph 9
of the Order of the Superior Court of Justice should be amended by deleting
reference to the claim in negligent misrepresentation.</span></p>

<p class=Mainparagraph style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the appellants are entitled
to their costs of the appeal, including the motion for leave to appeal.  The appellants are also entitled to their
costs in the Divisional Court.  The
costs order of the motions judge should stand.    </span></p>
