    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent was arrested on a warrant of apprehension
issued pursuant to the Extradition Act, S.C. 1999 on December 3,
1999.  The respondent was released on January 18, 2000 by order
of LaForme J. sitting as an extradition bail hearing judge.  The
Attorney General of Canada, on behalf of the United States, seeks
review of the release order pursuant to s.18(2) of the
Extradition Act, supra.  It provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               18(2)     A decision respecting judicial interim release may
          be reviewed by a judge of the court of appeal and that judge may
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  confirm the decision;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  vary the decision; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  substitute any other decision that,
          in  the  judge&#146;s  opinion, should  have  been
          made.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  This is a new provision and counsel for the United States
was unable to provide me with any authority providing guidance as
to the standard of review.  It would appear to me that by way of
analogy to the review of judicial interim release or detention
orders, there is an onus upon the applicant to demonstrate an
error in principle to justify review:  See Ewaschuk, Criminal
Pleadings and Practice in Canada (2d ed.) Vol. I, para. 6:1400.
The issue, accordingly, is not whether I would grant bail if the
matter came before me at first instance, but rather, whether the
applicant can demonstrate reviewable error on the part of LaForme
J.
[3]  The respondent was arrested in Toronto in 1997 and charged
with importing heroin and conspiracy to import heroin.  He was
granted judicial interim release with respect to those charges.
The respondent was further charged with various drug offences in
Vancouver in December 1999. The time frame for the Vancouver
charges spans from April 26, 1998 to December 6, 1998.  It would
appear that the United States charges forming the basis for the
extradition proceedings, span the period of June to July 1998 and
overlap with the Vancouver charges in that they arise from the
same conspiracy.
[4]  It is common ground that the judicial interim release
provisions of the Criminal Code apply by analogy to extradition.
The applicant, United States, submits that LaForme J. failed to
apply the reverse onus provision of s.515(6) which are applicable
to the respondent for two reasons.  First, the respondent is
charged with a serious drug offence punishable by imprisonment
for life (s.516(6)(d)) and secondly, he is charged with an
offence alleged to have been committed while he was at large
after being released in respect of another indictable offence
(s.516(6)(a)).
[5]  I do not accept the submission that LaForme J. failed to
apply the reverse onus provision.  It was conceded by counsel for
the United States that at the extradition bail hearing, it was
common ground between all counsel that the reverse onus provision
applied.  The case was presented and argued on that basis and I
can see nothing in the reasons of LaForme J. to indicate that he
failed to perceive that the applicant bore the onus.
[6]  Nor am I persuaded that , on the facts, it was not open to
LaForme J. to conclude that the reverse onus provision was
satisfied.  The reverse onus provision applied to the respondent
when he was granted judicial interim release on the Toronto
charges in 1997.  It applied again when he was released on the
Vancouver charges in 1999.  The trial on the Toronto charges is
scheduled to commence next week and a trial date in May 2000 has
been set for the Vancouver charges.  LaForme J. was faced with a
situation where on two prior occasions, faced with the same
reverse onus provision, the respondent was given judicial interim
release by posting substantial sureties.  Despite the gravity of
the charges he faces and the virtual certainty of a lengthy term
of imprisonment if he is convicted, the respondent has not fled.
[7]  In my view, it was open on this record for LaForme J. to
reach the conclusion that the respondent had demonstrated that
the extradition request by the United States was not a sufficient
additional factor to warrant his detention.  The facts relied
upon by the applicant as justifying detention date from 1998 and,
presumably, were available to the authorities in Vancouver when
judicial interim release was granted on those charges.    The
trial of the respondent on the Toronto charges will start within
days.  He is subject to relatively strict bail conditions and he
remains very much in the sights of the Canadian authorities.
[8]  On these facts, I cannot say that LaForme J. lacked a
sufficient basis to conclude that the respondent does not pose a
significant flight risk, particularly as there are now
significant additional sureties from whom LaForme J. heard viva
voce evidence.
[9]  Given the overlap between the Vancouver and American charges
and the fact that the evidence now relied upon to show the
alleged criminal network of the respondent was previously
available, I am not persuaded that LaForme J. erred in rejecting
the argument that the respondent should now be detained on the
secondary ground.
[10] Finally, I find the contention that the respondent should be
detained on the tertiary ground of satisfying Canada&#146;s
international obligations to be unpersuasive.  The Canadian
authorities did not seek review of the judicial interim release
orders on the Canadian charges.  I fail to see why the situation
should suddenly and dramatically change at the instance of
another state, given the apparent link between the foreign
charges and the charges pending in this country and in view of
the fact that trial on one set of charges here is imminent.
[11] For these reasons, the application for review of the order
of LaForme J. is dismissed.
