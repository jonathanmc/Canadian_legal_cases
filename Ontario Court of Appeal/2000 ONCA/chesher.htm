    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of R. J. Kealey J. dated July 2, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>AUSTIN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>Nature of Appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   Section  116 of the Courts of Justice Act R.S.O.  1990,  c.
C.43 authorizes a court in appropriate circumstances to require a
successful  plaintiff to accept a structured or annuitized  award
instead  of a lump sum.  The defendant Monaghan appeals from  the
trial  judge&#146;s refusal to make such an order.  His  concerns  are
with both the procedure and the merits.</pre>
    <pre><strong>The Facts</strong></pre>
    <pre>[2]  William Chesher, the plaintiff, suffered a knee injury while
water  skiing  on August 14, 1993.  He was taken by ambulance  to
the  Trenton Memorial Hospital where he was seen by the defendant
Dr.  Monaghan.  The plaintiff was discharged about an hour and  a
quarter  later.   He was seen the next day at Belleville  General
Hospital and later that day at Kingston General Hospital.  In the
result,  his  left leg was amputated below the knee on  September
29, 1994.
[3]  This action was brought and, after trial, judgment was given
in  favor of the plaintiff on April 27, 1999 for $579,863.   This
figure  constitutes 75% of the damages assessed, 25% having  been
deducted to reflect the possibility that the leg would have  been
lost even if Dr. Monaghan had not been negligent.
[4]  Of the $579,863, approximately $188,500 represents the
present value of future care costs and $92,370 the &#147;gross-up&#148;,
being the amount required to offset liability for income tax
payable on the income from the anticipated investment of the
$188,500.
[5]  On June 21, 1999 the defendant brought a motion for an order
permitting him to pay the future care costs periodically in the
form of a structure, in order to avoid having to pay the gross-
up.  The motion was heard on June 29, and dismissed on July 2,
1999.  The defendant appeals from that dismissal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Section 116 of the Courts of Justice Act</strong></pre>
    <pre>[6]  Section 116 of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.
43 reads as follows:
    </pre>
    <pre><strong>    Periodic payment and review of damages</strong>
    </pre>
    <pre>    116.-(1)    In   a   proceeding   where   damages   are
    claimed  for  personal injuries  or  under  Part  V  of
    the   Family  Law  Act  for  loss  resulting  from  the
    injury to or death of a person, the court,</pre>
    <pre>               (a)  if all affected parties consent, may
	       order the defendant to pay all or part of
	       the  award  for  damages  periodically on
	       such  terms  as the court considers just;
	       and
        </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  if  the plaintiff requests that  an
               amount  be  included  in  the  award  to
               offset  any  liability  for  income  tax
               payable on income from the investment of
               the award, shall order the defendant  to
               pay   all   or   part   of   the   award
               periodically on such terms as the  court
               considers just.
        </pre>
    <pre>               <strong>No order</strong>
        </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  An  order under clause (1)(b) shall
               not  be  made  if the parties  otherwise
               consent  or  if  the  court  is  of  the
               opinion that the order would not  be  in
               the  best  interests of  the  plaintiff,
               having  regard  to all the circumstances
               of the case.
        </pre>
    <pre>               <strong>Best interests</strong>
        </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  In  considering the best  interests
               of  the plaintiff, the court shall  take
               into account,
               </pre>
    <pre>                  (a)        whether  the defendant  has
	          sufficient  means  to fund an adequate
	  	  scheme of periodic payments;
               </pre>
    <pre>                  (b)         whether the plaintiff  has
                  a  plan  or  a method of payment  that
                  is  better  able to meet the interests
                  of   the   plaintiff   than   periodic
                  payments by the defendant; and
               </pre>
    <pre>                  (c)          whether   a   scheme   of
                  periodic   payments   is   practicable
                  having     regard    to    all     the
                  circumstances of the case.
        </pre>
    <pre>               <strong>Future review</strong>
        </pre>
    <pre>               (4)  In an order made under this section, the
	       court   may,   with   the  consent of all the
               affected  parties,  order  that  the award be
	       subject to future review and revision in such
               circumstances and on such terms as  the court
	       considers just.
        </pre>
    <pre>               <strong>Amount to offset liability for income tax</strong>
        </pre>
    <pre>               (5)  If the court does not make an order for
               periodic payment under  subsection  (1),  it
               shall make an award for  damages that  shall
               include an amount to  offset  liability  for
               income tax on income  from investment of the
               award.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Section 116 makes available to the court a remedy applicable
to  certain claims for damages for personal injuries.  It usually
comes  into  play  following the determination of  liability  and
assessment  of  damages. The triggering  event  is  the  request,
express  or  implied, on behalf of the plaintiff,  for  gross-up,
that  is  for an amount to be included in the judgment to  offset
the  liability which it is anticipated will become  payable  over
the  years on the income earned on the lump sum award or part  of
it.   If  that  request  is  made, the court  must  consider  the
possibility  of  granting the plaintiff an amount  payable  on  a
periodic basis rather than a single lump sum.
[8]  If the parties consent, the court may make the order for
periodic payments on such terms as it considers just.  Likewise
the parties may agree that periodic payments need not be
considered.  If the parties do not agree, as in the instant case,
the court is bound to consider the wisdom of periodic payments in
any event, once the request is made for a gross-up.  In this
event the defendant will frequently move, or otherwise support,
the making of a periodic award, rather than a lump sum plus gross-
up.  The rationale behind the defendant&#146;s position is cost.  A
structured settlement or award is not subject to income tax.  A
judgment payable in a lump sum is not subject to income tax
either, but the income it will earn while invested is subject to
income tax, hence the need to &#147;gross-up&#148; that lump sum.  Report
of Inquiry Into Motor Vehicle Accident Compensation in Ontario,
Coulter A. Osborne J., (now A.C.J.O.), Vol. 1, Toronto Queen&#146;s
Printer for Ontario, (1988), pp. 422 and 423.
[9]  If the parties are not in agreement and the plaintiff asks
for a gross-up then s. 116 requires the court to order periodic
payments in such fashion as it considers just (s. 116(1)(b)),
unless the court is of the opinion that such an order would not
be in the best interests of the plaintiff (s. 116(2)), having
regard to all the circumstances of the case (s. 116(2)).  The
onus is thus upon the plaintiff to demonstrate that periodic
payments are not in his or her best interests.  In considering
the best interests of the plaintiff, the court must take into
account whether the defendant has sufficient means to fund an
adequate scheme of period payments (this usually involves one or
more insurers), whether the plaintiff has a plan or a method of
payment that is better able to meet the interests of the
plaintiff than periodic payments by the defendant and whether a
scheme of periodic payments is practicable having regard to all
the circumstances of the case (s. 116 (3)(a)(b)(c)).
[10] Section 116 (4) makes provision for the future review and
revision of orders made under s. 116 on consent.  No concern was
raised in this regard in the instant case.
[11] Where an order for periodic payment has been asked for and
refused, s.116(5) requires the court to award a gross-up.
[12] As I read the legislative scheme in s. 116(1)(2) and (3),
damages are to be paid periodically unless to do so is not in the
plaintiff&#146;s best interests.  This requires the court to determine
what is in the plaintiff&#146;s best interests: lump sum or periodic
payment.  This, perhaps, begs the question somewhat as it
presupposes the court knows what is in the plaintiff&#146;s best
interests.  Therefore, a contextual setting is required to
determine whether a lump sum payment, or a periodic payment, is
in the plaintiff&#146;s best interests.
[13] In this appeal, the contextual setting is determined by the
nature of the damages, i.e., what loss or expenses are the
damages intended to compensate.  In the instant case, as the
damages are intended to compensate the plaintiff for his future
care costs as assessed by the trial judge, the question that can
be restated: what are the plaintiff&#146;s best interests in the
context of having been awarded $188,500.00 in damages for his
future care costs?  Applying this analysis, the overarching issue
in the appeal is whether the plaintiff&#146;s best interests &#150; having
available, when needed, the money required to pay his future care
costs &#150; can be achieved as well by the payment of a lump sum as
by guaranteed periodic payments throughout his lifetime.
[14] In determining whether a structured award is not in the best
interests of the plaintiff, the court need not engage in a
conclusive or in depth analysis of each of the factors listed in
s. 116(3).  The provision merely requires the judge to take these
factors into account in the context of all the circumstances of
the case as required by s. 116(2).
[15] In taking into consideration the factors listed in s.
116(3), the court is not required to rule conclusively on each
factor.  For example, the court is not required to determine
whether factors relating to the plaintiff&#146;s &#147;plan or &#133;. method of
payment&#148; outweigh factors relating to &#147;periodic payments by the
defendant&#148; and visa-versa.  The scheme created by the legislature
in s. 116(2)(3) permits the court to exercise its discretion and
to consider a variety of factors for the purpose of determining
whether an order for periodic payments would be in the best
interests of the plaintiff.</pre>
    <pre><strong>The motion for a structured award</strong></pre>
    <pre>[16]  The  motion was argued on the basis of affidavit  evidence.
The  trial  judge calculated the annual cost of  future  care  at
$8,533.26, 75% of which is $6,399.95.  The defendant&#146;s  affidavit
material  proposed a structure that would pay this either  on  an
annual  basis  or on a monthly basis ($533.33).   These  payments
would be tax-exempt in the hands of the plaintiff.  They would be
adjusted to the Consumer Price Index so that any negative  effect
of  inflation  would  be made up.  They would  continue  for  the
duration  of the plaintiff&#146;s life whether or not he lived  longer
than the life expectancy used by the trial judge to calculate the
present  value  of  the assessment of cost of future  care.   The
funds  to  purchase the annuity, $173,992.12 if paid monthly,  or
$177,189.42  if  paid  annually,  would  be  available  from  the
Canadian Medical Protective Association and they would be  placed
with  a  federally registered Canadian life insurance company  in
business  for  more than 100 years, with minimum  assets  of  $15
billion, high surplus ratios and a minimum AA + credit rating.</pre>
    <pre>[17] The plaintiff&#146;s opposition to the defendant&#146;s proposal was
set out in the plaintiff&#146;s affidavit as follows:
     </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>5. I feel that it would very much not be in my best interests,
considering my entire situation and circumstances, that the 
lump sum Judgment be replaced by the structure proposed by the
Defendant.</pre>
      <pre>6. I feel that the proposed structure would not be in my best
interests for, speaking broadly, two reasons:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>1.  I have plans for the lump sum award which would
    be interfered with, if not totally disrupted, by
    the lump sum award for future care, and the
    gross-up, being replaced by the proposed structure.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>2.  There are specific aspects of the proposed 
    structure which, over  and  above the fact that it
    would interfere with my plans for the money, are
    not in my best interests.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><u>The Structure would Interfere with my Plans for the Lump Sum
Award</u></pre>
      <pre>7. Having discussed the matter in some detail with [my 
lawyer] Mr. Reynolds, it is  my expectation that, after
payment of all legal costs and disbursements not recovered
from the Defendant, and after deduction of the amount due 
to OHIP out of the judgment, I should be able to realize
something in the neighbourhood of $400,000 or slightly more.</pre>
      <pre>8. My plans for that lump sum are as follows:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li><pre>The roofing business which my brother and I
have operated for some years currently carries 
a debt of approximately $100,000, a lot of 
which is traceable to the construction of the 
building out of which we operate.  The first 
thing that I want to do is pay off my share of 
that debt, $50,000.</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>The next thing that I want to do is pay off the
rest of the mortgage on our  home, approximately
$30,000.</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>The nex thing that I want to do is pay off some
small debts, including a Visa bill, totaling
approximately $13,000.</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>The next thing that I want to do is finish our
home.  There are a lot of things that we simply
haven&#146;t been able to afford  to do yet,
including finishing  the basement, putting on
a deck, landscaping, etc.   I expect this to 
cost somewhere between $30,000 and $50,000.</pre>
          </li>
          <li><pre>Satisfaction of all of these commitments will, 
in total, take approximately $123,000 to $143,000
of the lump sum award, leaving me with $257,000 to
$277,000.  That remainder will have to do to cover
my future income loss, and  my future care costs.   
I have already discussed potential investments with  
my bank, and I expect to put the money in a mixture  
of investments which will give me both some ongoing 
income and, hopefully, some long-term growth.
                                </pre>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>                                &#133;&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          9.   The difficulty with the structure proposed by the 
	  Defendant is that, effectively, it reduces the amount of 
	  money coming to me in cash so drastically - by a total of  
	  ($92,370.00 + $188,510.25 = $280,880.25) to $119,119.75 
	  that it simply does not leave me with enough money to even 
	  cover the commitments mentioned above, i.e. paying off debts
	  and finishing our home.  It would leave nothing at all to 
	  fund investment to generate some future income and,
	  hopefully, capital investment growth for myself and my 
	  family.
     </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre><u>Specific Aspects of the Defendant&#146;s Structure Contrary to my Best
Interests
</u>     </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>    10.  I see four critical problems with the structure proposed by
    the Defendant.</pre>
    <pre>    11.  In the first place, it is indexed to increase with the
    Consumer Price Index.  However, Mr. Reynolds is advised by Mr.
    Frank McKellar, of McKellar Structured Settlements, that medical
    costs have historically increased at a rate approximately 10%
    greater than consumer prices in general.  Accordingly, the
    structure which the Defendant proposes is likely, as years
    progress, to fall further and further short of my true future
    care costs.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>12.  The second problem with the Defendant&#146;s structure is this:
it proposes what, by definition, has to be a fixed pattern of
future payments which cannot be adjusted once set.  I am not yet
30 years of age and, with any luck, I&#146;ll be around for another 50
years.  It seems very likely to me that, over the next 5 or 10 or
20 or 30 years, there are going to be major changes in the
technology available in prosthetic design.  Who is to say, for
example, that a prosthetic may not become available which is
powered and articulated at the ankle, and functions through
microelectronics so that the nerves which terminate at the knee
can control its functioning?  Such a prosthetic might become
available, might be very expensive, and probably wouldn&#146;t be
covered by government or insurance funding.  If I am on a fixed
structure, I would have no way of buying it.  Quite simply, I
don&#146;t want to be locked for so long into a fixed payment pattern
that would give me no flexibility to take advantage of
technological innovation, especially when we are looking at such
a long time frame.  I think it&#146;s important to remember that 20
years ago desktop computers didn&#146;t even exist.  Who is to say
what prosthetic devices will be available 20 years from now?
     </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>13.  I am advised by Mr. Reynolds and verily believe that, 
even if a structure were thought, in some general sense, to be 
appropriate, it would have to be a  structure  purchased  
utilizing the full  amount of  the court&#146;s award for future care
costs - $188,510.25.  The structure proposed by the Defendant  
would only cost the Defendant something under $174,000.  Thus,  
the Defendant&#146;s structure  is  not in my best interests because 
it is less than the structure amount to which I would be 
entitled on any approach.</pre>
      <pre>14.  My last concern with the proposed structure is this: It  
carries absolutely no guarantee.  In other words, if  I die 
next month, the entire value of the future care award and the
gross-up  would  be lost.   My family would completely lose 
the benefit of that money.   In contrast to the situation where  
I receive the money in a lump sum, and invest it, so that it
would be available to them if I die, the value in the structure 
would simply disappear on my death.  I see this as grossly  
contrary to my &#147;best interests&#148;.  It may be argued that the 
only people who would lose in the event of my death would be
my family, and not me, but I don&#146;t think that my interests can 
be divorced from that of my family in such a fashion.  It seems  
to me that my interests have to be seen as including my
interests as a father and a husband, and it would be completely  
contrary to those interests to deprive me of the ability to 
ensure that, should something happen to me, my family will have  
the benefit of this money.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18] The defendant did not cross examine the plaintiff on his
affidavit, nor did he file any material in reply.  There is a
dispute as to whether any of the plaintiff&#146;s evidence was
challenged during the argument before the trial judge.
[19] The trial judge dismissed the defendant&#146;s motion to
structure the award for the cost of future care, giving the
following reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>                The defendant seeks an order under s.116
	  (1) (b)  of  the  Courts  of  Justice  Act  to
	  satisfy the portion of  the  Judgment in  this
          matter which relates to future care  costs  by
	  periodic payments pursuant to the terms of the
	  structure  which  is  outlined  in  the Motion
	  Record.

    <pre>                A  close reading of the section, as the
          Court   of  Appeal  has  held  in  Wilson   &amp;
          Martinello [(1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 417 (C.A.)],
          makes such a disposition mandatory where  the
          plaintiff has sought and been allowed a gross
          up  for  income  tax as part of  a  lump  sum
          award,  unless the structure is found not  to
          be in the plaintiffs best interests.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  court  is required  to  take  into
          account the provisions of subsection  3  (a),
          (b)  and  (c)  in considering the  plaintiffs
          best interests.  In the Wilson case while the
          court   seems  to  place  the  onus  on   the
          plaintiff regarding the best interests issue,
          it  held  the  plaintiff  was  not  bound  to
          propose  an  alternative  structure  or  give
          assurances  as  to any particular  investment
          scheme,   notwithstanding  the  language   of
          subsection   3  (b).   As  well   the   court
          confirmed that a plaintiff is entitled  to  a
          grossed up lump sum payment in law subject to
          the  section  under review and  any  duty  to
          mitigate.   Further, the plaintiffs  proposed
          plan  for  the  use  of  the  money  is   not
          necessarily restricted to the head of  damage
          for which the sum was awarded.  Indeed if the
          plaintiffs background negates any significant
          risk  of dissipation no critical scrutiny  of
          his  or her plan is required in order to rule
          on the question of best interests.
          </pre>
    <pre>                William  Chesher is a bright,  healthy,
          energetic   32   year  old   who   has   been
          permanently employed with Proctor &amp; Gamble in
          Belleville,  Ontario  since  he   left   High
          School.  He  is  married and has  become  the
          father  of  two  children  since  the  tragic
          accident  which  gave  rise  to  the   within
          action.   He and a brother operate a  roofing
          business on the side and have been so engaged
          for  many  years.   Mr. Chesher  outlines  an
          overall    financial   plan   which   enables
          elimination of a business debt in the  amount
          of $50,000, retirement of the mortgage on his
          family  home  $30,000, payment of accumulated
          debts  in an amount of approximately  $13,000
          and   finishing  and  refurbishing  his  home
          including the basement area, the addition  of
          a deck and other incidental improvements at a
          cost   of   somewhere  between  $30,000   and
          $50,000.   He has already obtained advice  as
          to the investment of the remaining cash so as
          to  supplement  his income to  meet  on-going
          financial needs and to provide flexibility in
          this  regard, as well as to achieve some long
          term   growth.    The  scheme  is   sensible,
          reasonable,    and   meets   Mr.    Chesher&#146;s
          particular   financial   requirements,   both
          present  and  future.   As  acknowledged   by
          counsel for the defendant there is no concern
          that  Mr.  Chesher will ever become a  public
          charge in any way.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Obviously, the structure (or structures)
          proposed  by the defendant are very  relevant
          to  the  determination of the best  interests
          issue.   Where  the plaintiff criticizes  the
          suggested  scheme, it would be  inappropriate
          and  unfair to permit the defendant  to  meet
          such  criticism by suggesting the  court  re-
          craft the details because S.116 provides that
          any order is to be made &#147;on such terms as the
          court  considers  just&#148;.    In  my  view  the
          section  contemplates that the defendant  put
          its  best  plan  forward to be  tested.   The
          following  are some other reasons which  lead
          me  to  conclude that the structure described
          is not in the best interests of Mr. Chesher.
          </pre>
    <pre>                1.    The  inflexibility of a structure
          might   prevent   or   make   difficult   the
          acquisition of future improved prosthetics as
          technology develops these.
          </pre>
    <pre>                2.    The  proposed structure does  not
          utilize  the  full  amount  assessed  in  the
          Judgment for future care costs.
          </pre>
    <pre>                3.    The  proposed  structure  indexes
          future  payments to the Consumer Price  Index
          only.   In this case there was evidence  that
          medical care costs escalate at a rate  faster
          than  the Consumer price Index.  Thus erosion
          of the future care funding could result.
          </pre>
    <pre>                4.   There is no guarantee of payments.
          In the event of Mr. Chesher&#146;s premature death
          the  funds which would otherwise be available
          to  meet  long  term needs of  his  wife  and
          children would be eliminated.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 As  such,  the  defendants  motion  is
          dismissed with costs to the plaintiffs.</pre>
    <pre><strong>The Issues on Appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre>[20] The issues raised on appeal are conveniently set out in  the
appellant&#146;s factum as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                a)   Did the trial court err in holding
	  that  Mr. Chesher&#146;s  plan for  the use of the
	  award   for   future   care  costs   is   not
          necessarily   restricted   to   that  head of
	  damages?
          </pre>
    <pre>                b)   Did the trial court err in holding
          that as Mr. Chesher&#146;s background negated  any
          significant risk of dissipation, no  critical
          scrutiny  of his financial plan was  required
          in  order to rule on the question of his best
          interests?
          </pre>
    <pre>                c)   Did the trial court err in holding
          that  the proposed structure was not  in  Mr.
          Chesher&#146;s  best interests because it  offered
          no guarantee of payments?
          </pre>
    <pre>                d)   Did the trial court err in holding
          that  the proposed structure was not  in  Mr.
          Chesher&#146;s best interests because it  did  not
          utilize  the  full  amount  assessed  in  the
          Judgment for future care costs?
          </pre>
    <pre>                e)   Did the trial court err in holding
          that  it  could  not re-craft  the  structure
          proposed  by the defendant in order  to  meet
          what, in the court&#146;s opinion, is in the  best
          interests of the plaintiff?
          </pre>
    <pre>                f)   Did the trial court err in holding
          that  the  periodic payment of the award  for
          future  care  costs was not in Mr.  Chesher&#146;s
          best  interests  as  its inflexibility  might
          prevent  or impede the acquisition of  future
          prosthetic technology?
          </pre>
    <pre>                g)   Did the trial court err in holding
          that  there  was evidence that  medical  care
          costs  escalate  at a rate  faster  than  the
          Consumer  Price Index and that therefore  the
          proposed  structure was not in Mr.  Chesher&#146;s
          best interest.</pre>
    <pre><u>A.</u>   Did  the  trial court err in holding that Mr. Chesher&#146;s
     plan for the use of the award for future care costs  is
     not necessarily restricted to that head of damages?</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  appellant  relies upon the proposition  enunciated  by
McLachlin  J., as she then was, in Milina v. Bartsch  (1985),  49
B.C.L.R.  (2d)  33  at 78, aff&#146;d., (1987), 49  B.C.L.R.  (2d)  99
(C.A.), that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The fundamental governing precept is restitutio in 
integrum.  The injured person is to be restored to 
the position he would have been in had the accident 
not occurred, insofar as this can be done with money.  
This is the philosophical justification for damages 
for loss of earning capacity, cost of future care and
special damages.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[22]  The  appellant argues that &#147;[T]hese fundamental  principles
are   to   apply  equally  to  subsidiary  problems  in   damages
assessments as they are to the main issues in question.  One such
subsidiary  problem is the question of whether the  award  is  to
take the form of a lump-sum or a periodic payment.&#148;
[23]  It appears to be the appellant&#146;s position that because  the
damages  were calculated by the trial judge in a particular  way,
it follows that they must be paid in the same fashion.  Absent  a
better  method of accomplishing the same objective,  such  better
method to be set out in the plaintiff&#146;s plan, the court is  bound
to impose a structured award.
[24] As I understand the appellant&#146;s argument, it is dealt with
in Wilson v. Martinello at p. 430, as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I think that counsel for the defendants is creating 
his own problems by insisting upon a reconciliation 
between the structure that he is advocating and the 
plan or method of payment that the plaintiff proposes. 
Defendant&#146;s counsel emphasizes that the plaintiff 
must propose a method of payment which is superior to
the periodic payments of the defendant, as if this was 
simply a contest between structured awards.  In the 
case on appeal, the contest is between periodic 
payments and no periodic payments.   The plaintiff is 
not bound by s.116 of the Act to propose an alternative 
structure to that of the defendant.  He need give no
undertaking that he will invest it in any particular 
manner.  He wants a lump sum payment to invest or spend 
as he pleases. The only issue facing the trial judge is 
whether he should be allowed to have it.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[25]  The  appellant&#146;s approach also appears to  be  contrary  to
s.116  (2),  which provides that an award is not to be structured
if  not &#147;in the best interests of the plaintiff, having regard to
all  the  circumstances  of the case&#148;.  This  suggests  a  global
rather than an item by item evaluation or comparison.  By way  of
example, the structure proposed by the appellant does not concern
itself with the respondent&#146;s debts.  This is not surprising.  The
respondent,  on  the other hand, must concern  himself  with  his
debts;  and in opposing the structure, he explained how it  would
interfere with his plans to retire those debts.  In my view,  the
respondent&#146;s  plan was sound.  This is not just a personal  view.
In  an article entitled &#147;Structured Settlements&#148; in the Nov./Dec.
1995  issue  of  Canadian Lawyer Magazine, Norton Finkelstein  of
Finkelstein Structured Settlements Inc. of Vancouver and Victoria
is  quoted,  under the subtitle &#147;When Do You Not  Structure&#148;,  as
saying:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Normally we would look at [people&#146;s situations] and 
ask, what else they could do with their money.  
Could they pay off debt?  Could they do something 
useful with the money rather than put it into a 
structure?  And if they can, then we recommend that.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[26]  In  my  view,  the  trial judge was clearly  right  in  his
approach in this respect.</pre>
    <pre><u>B.</u>   Did  the  trial  court  err in holding  that  as  Mr.
     Chesher&#146;s background negated any significant risk  of
     dissipation,  no critical scrutiny of  his  financial
     plan was required in order to rule on the question of
     his best interest?</pre>
    <pre>[27]  By  way  of  background, it is helpful first  to  see  what
Finlayson J.A. said in Wilson v. Martinello and then to see  what
the  trial  judge said in the instant case.  At p. 430, Finlayson
J.A.  stated that &#147;[h]aving regard to the circumstances  of  this
case  and  the  background of the plaintiff,  the  court  is  not
required to scrutinize too critically the investment plans of the
plaintiff in order to make a ruling as to his best interests.&#148;
[28] In the instant case the trial judge said that &#147;if the
plaintiff&#146;s background negates any significant risk of
dissipation no critical scrutiny of his or her plan is required
in order to rule on the question of best interest.&#148; [Emphasis
added.]
[29] The trial judge was obviously dealing with the procedure to
be followed generally, and not just with this particular case.
The trial judge then went on to set out the facts of
Mr. Chesher&#146;s background, education, family circumstances,
employment and prospects. Those are set out earlier in these
reasons.  He noted that Mr. Chesher had already obtained
financial advice and concluded as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The scheme is sensible, reasonable, and meets Mr. 
Chesher&#146;s particular financial requirements, both 
present and future.  As acknowledged by counsel 
for the defendant there is no concern that Mr. 
Chesher will ever become a public charge in any way.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>I  should  say as well that the trial judge had ample opportunity
to study both Mr. and Mrs. Chesher when they gave evidence during
the  twelve  day trial.  Amongst other matters, the  trial  judge
found   that  &#147;both  Mr.  and  Mrs.  Chesher  [were]  forthright,
responsive and fair&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[30]  The  claims of Mr. Chesher and Mr. Wilson arose under  very
different circumstances.  Wilson&#146;s wife and daughter were killed.
The  survivors were the husband and a fifteen year old  daughter.
The  husband  was 44 years old and an experienced  teacher.   The
damage  award was for housekeeping costs.  There was  no  ongoing
obligation on his part to provide medical or financial  care.   A
structure  was not needed to provide for the victims.  They  were
never going to be public charges.
[31] The instant respondent was 24 years old at the time of the
accident, married and without children.  At the time of the
motion he was six years older and had two young children.  His
education and employment are set out earlier.  The trial judge
had ample opportunity to assess him and his prospects.
[32] In the text Structured Settlements by John P. Weir, Carswell
Legal Publications 1984, the author deals with the &#147;nature of the
claimant&#148; from a variety of perspectives.  At p. 18 under the
heading &#147;Investment Sophistication&#148;, he says:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>There can be no doubt that most injured claimants have
neither the ability nor the inclination to handle any 
investment portfolio, let alone a substantial one.  
This is particularly evident in situations involving 
minors, the elderly, mental incompetents, alcoholics 
and the uneducated.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[33]  The  respondent not only does not come within any of  these
categories,  he has expressed his desire to manage his  portfolio
and,  in  discussing  potential investments with  his  bank,  has
demonstrated  some ability to do so. No basis has been  suggested
for believing that any aspect of the trial judge&#146;s assessment  of
the plaintiff was inadequate or inaccurate.</pre>
    <pre><u>C.</u>   Did the trial court err in holding that the proposed 
     structure was not in Mr. Chesher&#146;s best interest because 
     it offered no guarantee of payments?</pre>
    <pre>[34] Putting this issue more accurately, did the trial judge  err
in  considering as one of the reasons for rejecting the  proposed
structure, the fact that it had no guaranteed period of payments?
In my view, the obvious answer to this question is &#147;no&#148;.
[35]  The appellant&#146;s position is that the objective of the award
is  restitutio  ad integrum, that restitutio in the circumstances
is  a series of payments, either on an annual or a monthly basis,
for  medical  care and that that requirement will  end  when  the
respondent  dies.  Accordingly, there is neither need  nor  place
for  a  guarantee.   If  there were a guarantee  period  and  the
plaintiff died before that period ran out, then his family  would
get a benefit not required or contemplated by the judgment.
[36] If one considers only the matter of future care costs and
nothing more, the appellant&#146;s logic is unassailable. Yet, from
the respondent&#146;s perspective certainly a structure with a
guarantee is better than one without. Counsel for the respondent
argued that s.116 (2) requires the court to consider &#147;the best
interests of the plaintiff, having regard to all the
circumstances of the case&#148;.  This is the same argument as
advanced on behalf of the plaintiff with respect to issue A.  I
agree with that argument.  One of the &#147;circumstances&#148; affected by
the loss of his lower leg is the plaintiff&#146;s ability to provide
for his family, during and following his life.  That
&#147;circumstance&#148; makes relevant the question whether the proposed
structure has a guarantee period.  Obviously, in all the
&#147;circumstances&#148; a structure with a guarantee period is better
than one without, assuming all other conditions are equal.
[37] Under heading E. the appellant argues that the trial judge
erred in holding that the court &#147;could not re-craft the structure
proposed by the defendant in order to meet what, in the court&#146;s
opinion, is in the best interests of the plaintiff&#148;.  Among the
examples of such re-crafting given by the appellant are &#147;indexing
and guarantees&#148;.  The appellant appears to reject guarantees in
principle, but is prepared to accept them for bargaining
purposes.
[38] The trial judge was clearly correct in regarding a structure
with a guarantee as better than one without and in regarding the
fact that the appellant did not provide a guarantee as one of the
reasons for rejecting the structure proposed.</pre>
    <pre><u>D.</u>   Did the  trial court err in holding that the  proposed
     structure  was  not  in  Mr. Chesher&#146;s  best  interest
     because it did not utilize the full amount assessed in
     the judgment for future care costs?</pre>
    <pre>[39] This issue arises because of the existence of R. 53.09(1) of
the Rules of Civil Procedure.  It provides as follows:</pre>
    <pre>	Discount rate &#150; The discount rate to be used in 
	determining the amount of an award in respect of 
	future pecuniary damages, to the extent that it 
	reflects the difference between estimated
        investment and price inflation rates, is 2.5 per 
	cent per year.</pre>
    <pre>[40]  The trial judge used the figure of 2.5 per cent in arriving
at  $188,500 as the present value of the amount required  to  pay
the  plaintiff&#146;s  anticipated medical care  expenses  during  his
life.
[41] An insurance company designing an annuity for a structured
settlement or award is not bound by R. 53.09 (1) and would look
to the market for an appropriate rate.  In the instant case the
appellant has determined that an annuity can be provided for
$177,189.42 (or $173,992.12 if paid monthly), which would meet
the requirements as determined by the trial judge.  The appellant
refers to the difference between the $188,500 and the actual cost
of the annuity as &#147;savings&#148;.
[42] The issue is &#150; who gets the &#147;savings&#148;?  Does the defendant
get to keep them &#150; or must the whole amount be applied to the
structure?  If the latter, then the plaintiff will be over-
compensated.  If the former, then the defendant will be paying
less than the amount awarded to the plaintiff.
[43] No Ontario case was cited in which the defendant was allowed
to keep the &#147;savings&#148;.  In three cases the defendant was ordered
to pay the whole amount of the conventional award towards the
structure.  (See Valliant v. Powell, [1996] O.J. No. 5100 para.
19 (Gen. Div.); Peddle  (Litigation Guardian of) v. Ontario
(Minister of Transportation), [1997] O.J. No 2830 paras. 9 and 14
(Gen. Div.); and Roberts v. Morana (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 333 (Gen.
Div.).)
[44]  The court did not provide any reasons for the decision that
the  whole amount of the award should be applied to the structure
in  either Vailliant or Pebble.  In Roberts, O&#146;Brien J. concluded
that  despite the possibility of overcompensation, s.116 did  not
permit  a defendant to create &#147;savings&#148; by purchasing an  annuity
at  a  cost lower than the amount of the damages awarded  to  the
plaintiff.  At p. 341 he said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>While the present market rates may result in what 
appears to be potential gain to a plaintiff when
rule 53.09 is used to determine future care costs, 
I conclude courts should not accept that market 
difference as a means of reducing damages assessed
for those costs.  I conclude if there is to be 
(what is in effect) a change in the discount rate 
in these cases it must be as a result of clear and 
specific legislation or a change to rule 53.09.  I 
conclude s.116 as presently worded does not do so.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>He  confirmed this ruling in supplementary reasons, which  appear
at p. 342 as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Following release of my supplementary reasons
	  dated  October  28, 1997,  there  was further 
	  argument related to the structured settlement 
	  issue.   Counsel  for  the  plaintiff  stated 
	  gross-up  was  requested.   Defence   counsel
	  repeated   briefly   some   of   the argument
          previously  made as to  whether the structure
	  proposed  by  them  could be imposed with the
          cost  saving  going  to  the  defendants.   I
          ruled it could not, and  the  full  amount of 
 	  the future care costs outlined in my judgment
	  would  be  required  to  provide a structured
          settlement.
          </pre>
    <pre>          There   was  further  argument  as  to  which
          party was obliged to pay the commission costs
          payable  to obtain that structure. My  ruling
          was   the  benefits  to  the  defendants   in
          avoiding  the  costs  of  gross-up  justified
          their  paying all commission costs and  I  so
          ordered.
          </pre>
    <pre>          On that  point, and  in  requiring  the  full
          amount  of  the future care costs awarded  be
          required to fund the structure, I follow  and
          agree  with  the  reasons  of  Karam,  J.  in
          Valliant v. Powell, (citation omitted).</pre>
    <pre>[45]  The  appellant  argues  that  following  this  course  will
inevitably  result  in  the plaintiff being over-compensated  and
that  that  could  not possibly have been the  intention  of  the
legislature.  The appellant&#146;s position is that the application of
R.  53.09 (1) is to be limited to the calculation of an award  in
respect  of future pecuniary damages, but no further.   That  is,
once  the amount has been determined, the application of the rule
is  ended  and the payment of the award falls to be  governed  by
other provisions, in this case market forces.
[46] The appellant relies upon the decision of Jewers J. of the
Manitoba Court of Queen&#146;s Bench in Lusignan (Litigation Guardian
of) v. Concordia Hospital (1998), 44 C.C. L.T. (2d)90.  This was
an action for damages for medical malpractice with respect to
brain damage suffered at birth.  The claim was allowed, the trial
judge found that the plaintiff&#146;s needs would best be met by
residence in a group home and he assessed her annual costs at
$54,750.  A structure was imposed and an issue arose as to the
disposition of the difference between the actual cost of the
structure and the assessment of the damages on a lump sum basis.
[47] The issue was resolved in favour of the defendant.  Jewers
J. pointed out in his reasons that the corresponding Manitoba
legislation &#147;does not call for an initial conventional award to
be made which is then to be satisfied by periodic payments&#148;. His
reasons read as follows at p. 100:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The scheme of the [Manitoba] legislation is that the 
court may order that damages be paid in whole or in 
part by periodic payments.  The court must specify 
and identify each head of damage for which the 
periodic payments are to be made. (Here I have 
identified future care costs as the subject for 
periodic payments.)  Unlike the Ontario legislation, 
the Act does not call for an initial conventional 
award to be made which is then to be satisfied by 
periodic payments.  Rather it authorizes the court
to order that &#147;damages be paid in whole or in part by 
periodic payments&#148; (s.88.2).  Section 88.3(a) refers 
to a &#147;periodic award&#148;; s.88.3(b) refers to a &#147;head of 
damage&#148; &#147;for which periodic payments are awarded&#148;; 
and s. 88.4(1) refers to a judgment that orders 
damages &#147;to be paid by periodic payments&#148;.   This 
phraseology implies that where the court desires to 
make a periodic award, there is to be the one award 
and that award is to be periodic.</pre>
      <pre>I interpret the Manitoba legislation to mean that what
the court should do is stipulate a plan of periodic  
payments and that all the defendant need do is produce
security to meet the payments.  The cost of that 
security (in the form of an annuity) is strictly the 
defendant&#146;s business as are any cost savings.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[48]  Roberts  is under appeal to this court; one of  the  issues
raised is the question whether there can be any &#147;savings&#148;  &#150;  and
if   so,   who  gets  them,  plaintiff  or  defendant.   In   the
circumstances,  it  is  neither necessary,  nor  appropriate,  to
decide  that  issue in this appeal.  The trial  judge  ultimately
decided against a structured award.  His decision was made  on  a
number  of  bases.  I am persuaded that even if he had  concluded
that  the  appellant was entitled to the savings, this would  not
have resulted in his arriving at a different conclusion as to the
respondent&#146;s best interests.</pre>
    <pre><u>E.</u>   Did  the trial court err in holding that it could not re-
     craft the structure proposed by the defendant in order to
     meet  what,  in  the  court&#146;s opinion,  is  in  the  best
     interests of the plaintiff?</pre>
    <pre>[49]  What the trial judge actually said in regard to this  issue
was as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Obviously, the structure (or structures) proposed 
by the defendant are very relevant to the 
determination of the best interest issue.  Where 
the plaintiff criticizes the suggested scheme, it 
would be inappropriate and unfair to permit the
defendant to meet such criticism by suggesting the 
court re-craft the details because s.116 provides 
that any order is to be made &#147;on such terms as the 
court considers just&#148;.  In my view the section 
contemplates that the defendant puts its best plan
forward to be tested.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[50]  This  issue  raises the question of  the  procedure  to  be
followed in dealing with s. 116.  Wilson v. Martinello  lays down
the  procedure in general terms, but there was no need to go into
the  specifics that are now in issue.  In some cases such as  the
instant  one,  courts have dealt with s.116 by way of  an  after-
trial  motion based on affidavit evidence.  However done,  it  is
clear that the onus remains on the plaintiff.
[51] In the instant case the motion was launched by the defendant
almost two months after judgment, on the basis of a ten page
affidavit of trial counsel, appended to which was a five-page
letter from a member of the McKellar Group, well known
specialists in structured settlements.  The response was in the
form of the affidavit of the plaintiff, most of which is set out
earlier in these reasons.  The plaintiff was not cross-examined,
nor was any further material filed.
[52] I take it from the argument of appellant&#146;s counsel in this
court that he suggested at least one change in the structure in
the course of argument below and that that change was not
adopted.  No specific change is referred to in the appellant&#146;s
factum.  The oral argument in that court may have suggested that
the appellant should have been allowed to add a guarantee to its
original offer.
[53] The appellant argues that the position taken by the trial
judge is inconsistent with the wording of s.116, with the
principles of the adversarial system and with the decided cases.
In Peddle, supra, paras. 13 and 14, the defendants proposed four
different structures and in the end the court imposed a fifth.
[54] Reliance was placed by the appellant upon statements of a
Mr. Polsinelli, speaking on behalf of the Attorney General, Mr.
Ian Scott, during the legislative debate on the introduction of
s.116 in 1989 as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Again, what we think this does is provide the court 
with some guidance in determining what the best 
interest of the plaintiff is in this particular 
situation.  If they find that a structured 
settlement or a particular structure is not in the
plaintiff&#146;s best interest, they may order something 
else such as a lump sum payment, for example, or a 
different type of structure.   [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[55]   With   respect,   this  statement  disregards   both   the
responsibility  of counsel and the principles  of  the  adversary
system without providing any appreciable guidance.
[56] In order to more adequately review on appeal the kind of
order appealed from, it may be preferable to conduct such
hearings on a vive voce basis, either in whole or in part, or to
make provision for a transcript of the hearing.  The appellant
argues that the position taken by the trial judge was
&#147;inconsistent with the principles of the adversarial process,&#148;
presumably because the appellant was not permitted to alter its
proposal during the hearing of the motion.  Without a more
specific complaint, it is difficult to know precisely what
changes the appellant would have made.
[57] Here the appellant neither cross-examined the respondent,
nor tendered additional material.  Presumably it was content to
proceed on the basis of the record as it stood.  Is an insurer in
the position of the appellant entitled to come to court, as to a
settlement meeting, with a relatively unlimited purse and to
start raising the bidding if and when it detects the wind is
blowing against it?  What chance has a plaintiff such as Mr.
Chesher in such a procedure?  What is the role of the judge &#150; is
he or she a judge, a mediator or a bargaining agent?
[58] The appellant supplied no answers to these questions beyond
the bald propositions that it should have been able to amend its
proposal on the hearing, and that, in any event, the judge had
the power to order whatever was in the plaintiff&#146;s best
interests.  The defendant launched the motion to structure.
There would have been time to negotiate both before and after the
bringing of that motion.  I agree with the judge below that the
time to make one&#146;s best offer is before the time for decision
passes to the court.  In the final analysis, what the court can
lawfully order falls within a very narrow range.  I do not take
the position that the trial judge cannot suggest that a guarantee
be added or be increased or that applying the full amount of the
award to the premium wouldn&#146;t be enough to persuade the court to
accept the structure.  I do suggest, however, that such a course
is a very slippery slope for a judge to embark upon.  I cannot
fault this judge for not doing so.</pre>
    <pre><u>F. and G.</u> Did  the  trial  court  err   in  holding  that  the
          periodic payment of the award for future care  costs
          was  not  in  Mr.  Chesher&#146;s best  interest  as  its
          inflexibility   might   prevent   or   impede    the
          acquisition of future prosthetic technology?
          </pre>
    <pre>          Did  the  trial court err in holding that there  was
          evidence that medical care costs escalate at a  rate
          faster  than  the  Consumer  Price  Index  and  that
          therefore  the  proposed structure was  not  in  Mr.
          Chesher&#146;s best interest?</pre>
    <pre>[59]   These   two  grounds  may  be  dealt  with  together   for
convenience.  They were given by the trial judge as &#147;&#133;.some other
reasons which lead [him] to conclude that the structure described
is not in the best interest of Mr. Chesher&#148;.
[60] The foundation for each is found in the plaintiff&#146;s
affidavit set out earlier, which refers to the cost of prosthetic
devices in para. 12 and a reference to differing rates of
increase of medical costs and of the Consumer Price Index in
para. 11.  Neither foundation is entirely sound.  The statement
respecting medical costs is double hearsay (McKellar to Reynolds
to Chesher) with attribution but without affirmation of belief as
required by R. 39.01(4).  The statement with respect to the
future cost of prosthetic devices describes the possibility of
major advances in such devices but at such expense that, locked
into a structure, the plaintiff could not afford to buy such a
device.
[61]  As noted earlier, there was no cross-examination on  either
statement,  nor was there any responding material  filed.   As  I
understood counsel on the appeal, counsel for the respondent said
that no complaint was made in argument on either matter.  Counsel
for  the  appellant  on  the other hand  said  he  did  complain.
Counsel  for  the  respondent stated flatly in  his  factum  that
counsel  for  the appellant did not contest the admissibility  at
any  stage  below.  This court cannot resolve this  issue  beyond
pointing out that the trial judge relied on both of these  points
without noting any objection to the evidence by anyone.
[62]  Insofar  as  the statement respecting the  future  cost  of
prosthetic devices is concerned, that is not hearsay.  It is  the
opinion  of  an  intelligent lay person who has a  very  definite
reason  to be relatively knowledgeable about the subject and  who
is  expressing an entirely reasonable idea as to what might  well
happen  within  a  period of immediate concern  to  him.   It  is
clearly  not  an  expert  opinion.  It is  admissible;  the  only
question is the weight to be attached to it.
[63] Standing behind the appellant is the Canadian Medical
Protective Association.  It is difficult to imagine anyone being
in a better position to provide a response to the statement about
prosthetic devices.  The structure tendered by the appellant is
one prepared by and with the assistance of Frank McKellar
Associates.  Again, in the circumstances, it is difficult to
imagine anyone being in a better or stronger position to provide
a response to the statement comparing medical costs with the
C.P.I.
[64] Instead of providing such responses, the appellant devoted
41 out of the 100 paragraphs in his factum to dealing with those
two statements in every imaginable way except one &#150; namely to
suggest that they are false.  In the circumstances, I am not
prepared to find that the trial judge erred in relying on those
statements to the extent that he did.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Summary and Conclusion</strong></pre>
    <pre>[65] In summary, I agree that the trial judge was correct in  not
considering the proposed structure in isolation and in  regarding
the  non-inclusion  of a guarantee, and the  inflexibility  of  a
structure  as factors.  I am not persuaded that the  trial  judge
gave  insufficient  consideration to  the  plaintiff&#146;s  means  or
inappropriate  weight  to the evidence  respecting  the  cost  of
future  prosthetic technology or the relative rates of escalation
of medical care costs and the C.P.I.  Nor am I persuaded that the
trial  judge  improperly denied the defendant the opportunity  to
alter its proposed structure.  Having regard to the amount of the
prospective  &#147;savings&#148;, namely, a maximum  of  $14,518.01,  I  am
persuaded that the trial judge&#146;s conclusion as to the plaintiff&#146;s
best  interests  would  not have been  changed  had  he  taken  a
different  view of the question as to the appellants&#146; entitlement
to the &#147;savings&#148;.
[66] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
