    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court (O&#146;Leary J.
(dissenting), Rosenberg and Ferguson JJ.) dated April 21, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The general issue on this appeal is whether the majority of
the Divisional Court erred in holding that the motions judge had
improperly exercised his discretion in extending the time for
service of the statement of claim.  In my view, the Divisional
Court did err. I would therefore allow the appeal and restore the
order of the motions judge.</pre>
    <pre>     A.   Background</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The main facts giving rise to the motion were not disputed.
The plaintiff Cathy Chiarelli was injured in a car accident in a
parking lot on October 26, 1988.  She suffered a very severe
whiplash injury.  Only the parties witnessed the accident. A
police report was prepared but there were no independent
witnesses.  The day after the accident occurred, it was reported
to the defendant&#146;s insurer State Farm.  State Farm&#146;s claims
adjuster promptly took a statement from Ms. Chiarelli and from
the defendant, had the plaintiffs&#146; car appraised, and obtained a
copy of the police report.  From Ms. Chiarelli&#146;s statement, State
Farm learned that she complained of pain in her neck, shoulders
and back.
[3]  The plaintiffs retained a lawyer soon after the accident and
by the end of Novemer 1988 he had put State Farm on notice of a
claim.  Meanwhile, Ms. Chiarelli&#146;s condition deteriorated.  She
experienced numbness in her right arm and was diagnosed with disc
damage in her lower back.  Between December 1988 and November
1992 the plaintiffs&#146; lawyer forwarded medical information &#150;
including 12 medical reports &#150; to State Farm as the information
became available.  State Farm paid for the medical reports and
never once indicated to the plaintiffs&#146; lawyer that it was
disputing liability.  Medical reports in 1988 and 1989, which
State Farm received, showed that Ms. Chiarelli&#146;s injury was much
more serious than had originally been thought. She was diagnosed
as having a severe long term back injury with permanent partial
disability.
[4]  The statement of claim was issued on October 24, 1990 within
the two-year limitation period under the Highway Traffic Act.1
The dollar amount of the claim was well within the defendant&#146;s
policy limits.  The plaintiffs&#146; lawyer gave the claim to the
sheriff to serve on the defendant.  Until this time the lawyer&#146;s
handling of the claim on behalf of his clients was commendable.
[5]  Unfortunately the sheriff could not locate the defendant to
serve her.  She lived in the country, outside Niagara-on-the-
Lake, and the address shown on the police report and at the
Ministry of Transportation did not include the number of the
street on which she lived.  The plaintiffs&#146; lawyer sent a copy of
the statement of claim to State Farm and asked if it would accept
service.  State Farm refused to do so, and indeed did not even
offer to seek instructions from its insured to accept service.
[6]  The six-month period for serving the statement of claim
expired on April 24, 1991, without the defendant having been
served and without the plaintiffs&#146; lawyer having moved to extend
the time for service.  In October 1991 State Farm wrote the
plaintiffs&#146; lawyer to say that its insured had not been served
and that it assumed the claim had been abandoned.  The
plaintiffs&#146; lawyer wrote back to say that he could not find the
insured and that he would seek an order to extend the time for
service unless State Farm admitted service.  State Farm would not
admit service and the lawyer never moved to extend the time.  In
his affidavit, which was uncontradicted, the lawyer, a sole
practitioner, said that he succumbed to the pressure of work,
that he became embarrassed and depressed by his negligence, and
that instead of bringing a motion he &#147;froze.&#148;  State Farm closed
its file in February 1994.
[7]  The plaintiffs, unhappy with the delay, retained a new
lawyer in the fall of 1996.  The file was transferred in February
1997.  The motion was launched in May 1997 and was served on the
defendant (at her corrected address) in August 1997.</pre>
    <pre>     B.   The decision of the motions judge to extend the time
          for service of the statement of claim</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The motions judge, Taliano J. gave lengthy reasons for
exercising his discretion to extend the time for service of the
statement of claim. I am not persuaded that the motions judge
made any reviewable error in the exercise of that discretion,
despite the long delay from the date the time for service
expired.
[9]  After referring to the applicable rules of civil procedure &#150;
rules 1.04, 2.01, 3.02 and 14.08(1)2 &#150; the motions judge
correctly stated that, on a motion to extend the time for
service, the court should be concerned mainly with the rights of
litigants, not with the conduct of counsel.  He then took into
account that the defendant had notice of the claim, that the
defendant&#146;s address was inadequate for service, that the
plaintiffs moved reasonably promptly once they learned the claim
had expired, and that until then they had no knowledge of their
lawyer&#146;s negligence.
[10] Finally, the motions judge turned to the issue of prejudice,
the key issue on the motion.  He recognized that the court should
not extend the time for service if to do so would prejudice the
defendant, and that the plaintiffs bore the onus to show that the
defendant would not be prejudiced by an extension.  The motions
judge canvassed in detail all possible areas of prejudice caused
by the delay, but one.  He considered the unavailability of
witnesses, the eroding memory of the available witnesses, the
failure of the defence to conduct neighbourhood interviews or
surveillance on Ms. Chiarelli, the failure of the defence to
interview the police officer, the lost documents of the
appraiser, the difficulties in dealing with Ms. Chiarelli&#146;s pre-
existing injury, the missing records and documents, the allegedly
inaccurate productions, and the fact of the &#147;inordinate delay.&#148;
He made findings on each of these areas of possible prejudice and
concluded generally that the defendant would not be prejudiced by
the admittedly very long delay.
[11] The one area not addressed by the motions judge was the
possible prejudice arising from a delayed defence medical.  State
Farm had requested an independent medical assessment of Ms.
Chiarelli in July 1989, not, however, to be considered its
defence medical.  The plaintiffs&#146; lawyer refused saying there was
not yet enough medical information.  State Farm never renewed its
request.  Still, the defence was entitled to a defence medical
and is still entitled to one if the action proceeds.3  However, I
consider any prejudice caused by a delayed defence medical to be
slight.  Because the defence typically is only entitled to one
medical examination of the plaintiff, usually that examination
takes place shortly before the trial when the most up-to-date
medical information has been obtained.  Thus, even if the
statement of claim had been served on time, the defence medical
would likely still have taken place several years after the
accident.  The added years caused by the delay in service will
not appreciably affect the defence&#146;s position, especially
considering the voluminous medical information on Ms. Chiarelli
now available to State Farm.  Therefore, in my view, a delayed
defence medical provides no basis for interfering with the
motions judge&#146;s order.</pre>
    <pre>     C.   The decision of the Divisional Court</pre>
    <pre>[12] On appeal the Divisional Court divided.  O&#146;Leary J.,
dissenting, would have dismissed the appeal largely for the
reasons of Taliano J. supplemented by his own brief reasons.
Rosenberg and Ferguson JJ. allowed the appeal.  Ferguson J., who
wrote the majority reasons, discussed at great length the caselaw
under both the current rules for extending the time for service
and under former Rule 8.  In my view, although the wording of the
former and current rules differs, the guiding principles remain
the same.  As Lacourcière J.A. said in Laurin v. Foldesi: &#147;The
basic consideration &#133; is whether the [extension of time for
service] will advance the just resolution of the dispute, without
prejudice or unfairness to the parties.&#148;4  And, the plaintiff has
the onus to prove that extending the time for service will not
prejudice the defence.
[13] Taliano J. applied these guiding principles in extending the
time for service.  Nonetheless, the majority of the Divisional
Court concluded that Taliano J. committed four errors in
principle.  Having so concluded, the majority made its own
determination of prejudice, and decided that the defence would be
prejudiced by extending the time for service.  In my view,
Taliano J. did not commit any error in principle and thus the
Divisional Court should not have made its own determination of
prejudice. I will briefly address the four errors found by the
Divisional Court.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (i)  The Divisional Court found that the motions judge had
reversed the burden of proof on prejudice by requiring the
defence to show that it would be prejudiced by the delay in
service.  In support of this finding Ferguson J. referred to
several passages from the motions judge&#146;s reasons, in which the
motions judge noted the defence&#146;s inability to specify, for
example, what witnesses might not be available to testify or what
doctors could no longer be found. I do not consider that these
passages reflect any shift of the burden of proof on prejudice.</pre>
    <pre>[14] I make three observations in response to the Divisional
Court&#146;s finding.  First, the passages from the reasons of the
motions judge have to be considered in their context.  The
motions judge was obviously unimpressed, as am I, with the
defence&#146;s assertion of prejudice.  The only allegation of
prejudice in the material filed by the defence on the motion is
the following very general statement in the affidavit of State
Farm&#146;s claims adjuster:
          </pre>
    <pre>  It is my belief that the defence of this action has
  been seriously prejudiced due to the passage of time
  and the strong possibility that pre-accident and 
  post-accident records and witnesses may not be available
  or that their recollections may not be accurate.
          
          
Although the onus remains on the plaintiffs to show that the
defendant will not be prejudiced by an extension, in the face of
such a general allegation, the plaintiffs cannot be expected to
speculate on what witnesses or records might be relevant to the
defence and then attempt to show that these witnesses and records
are still available or that their unavailability will not cause
prejudice.  It seems to me that if the defence is seriously
claiming that it will be prejudiced by an extension it has at
least an evidentiary obligation to provide some details.  The
defence did not do that in this case.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Second, the defence cannot create prejudice by its failure
to do something that it reasonably could have or ought to have
done.  For example, the defence cannot complain about the lost
opportunity to interview the police officer or to conduct
surveillance on Ms. Chiarelli or to obtain the no-fault insurer&#146;s
file.  If, as the defence now maintains, it is contesting
liability, then it should have interviewed the police officer at
the time and cannot blame its failure to do so on the plaintiffs&#146;
delay.  Similarly, the defence knew in 1989 that Ms. Chiarelli&#146;s
injury was serious and if surveillance on her was appropriate,
that surveillance should have been undertaken at the time.  The
defence also had all the particulars of the file maintained by
Ms. Chiarelli&#146;s no-fault insurer and could have requested it at
any time.
[16] Third, prejudice that will defeat an extension of time for
service must be caused by the delay.  Prejudice to the defence
that exists whether or not service is delayed ordinarily is not
relevant on a motion to extend the time for service.  In this
case the defence complains that the police officer&#146;s notes have
been destroyed.  However, they were destroyed within two years of
the accident under a local police policy.  Thus, the notes would
have been unavailable to the defence even if the statement of
claim had been served on time.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (ii) The Divisional Court found that the motions judge erred by
&#147;focusing on what the defendant&#146;s insurer could have done to
preserve evidence rather than on what prejudice had probably been
caused by the delay.&#148;  Ferguson J. held that the insurer&#146;s
investigation, including, for example, its decision not to
conduct surveillance, was reasonable.  I see no merit in this
criticism of the motions judge&#146;s reasons by the Divisional Court.
Even if the insurer&#146;s decision not to conduct surveillance was
reasonable, as the motions judge pointed out, the insurer could
have undertaken surveillance for several years after the
accident.  Its failure to do so when it knew Ms. Chiarelli&#146;s
injury was serious was not caused by any delay in serving the
statement of claim.

     (iii) The Divisional Court found that the plaintiffs&#146; lawyer
&#147;deliberately&#148; did not move to extend the time for service after
he realized the time had expired, and that the motions judge
erred by giving no weight to this fact.  Moreover, Ferguson J.
relied heavily on the lawyer&#146;s &#147;deliberate delay&#148; when
considering whether an extension should be granted.  In my view,
the Divisional Court&#146;s finding is unwarranted.  There is no
evidence to support a finding that the lawyer acted deliberately.
His evidence, unchallenged by the defence, was simply that he
Sfroze.&#148;

     (iv) Finally, the Divisional Court found that the motions judge
erred in &#147;not considering the factors relating to the policy of
repose.&#148;  Although Ferguson J. stated that the court should not
set a fixed time limit beyond which an extension should be
refused, he nonetheless was &#147;inclined to think it would not be
appropriate to grant an extension if after the deadline for
service expires, there is absolute silence for a period longer
than the limitation period.&#148;  The limitation period in this case
is two years.  Therefore, if Ferguson J.&#146;s suggestion were
followed the plaintiffs could not obtain an extension after April
1993.  However, I see no rational basis for refusing to extend
the time for service simply because the delay is longer than the
applicable limitation period.</pre>
    <pre>[17] The court should not fix in advance rules or guidelines when
an extension should be refused.  Each case should be decided on
its facts, focusing as the motions judge did in this case, on
whether the defence is prejudiced by the delay.  Undoubtedly the
delay in this case &#150; over six years from the expiry date for
serving the claim &#150; was significant, much longer than in most if
not all of the decided cases where an extension has been granted.
However, the motions judge recognized this delay and still found
no prejudice.  As I have already said, I am not persuaded that he
erred in making that finding. Thus, the motions judge did not err
in principle by granting an extension though the length of the
delay exceeded the two year limitation period under the Highway
Traffic Act.
[18] I therefore conclude that the majority of the Divisional
Court was wrong in holding that Taliano J. erred in principle in
exercising his discretion to extend the time for service.  I add
one final observation.  In refusing to grant an extension,
Ferguson J. found it &#147;very significant&#148; that the defendant
herself never knew that a statement of claim had been issued. I
would give no weight to this consideration.  State Farm took a
statement from its insured and then negotiated on her behalf with
the plantiffs&#146; lawyer for nearly three years.  The plaintiffs
cannot be held accountable if, for tactical reasons, State Farm
chose not to tell its own insured that an action had been
started, and refused to accept service of the statement of claim
for her or even seek instructions from her to accept service.</pre>
    <pre>     D.   Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[19] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the
Divisional Court and in its place dismiss the appeal from the
order of Taliano J.  The plaintiffs are entitled to their costs
of the appeal in the Divisional Court and in this court,
including the costs of the motion for leave to appeal.
