<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Summary of the
decision</b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>From June 19th to 29th, 2000, a five-judge panel of the
Court of Appeal for Ontario, composed of Associate Chief Justice Osborne and
Justices Finlayson, Doherty, Charron, and Sharpe, considered appeals arising
from a series of motions for summary judgment related to an aboriginal land
claim over a four square mile parcel of land in and near the City of
Sarnia.  The land is presently occupied
by over 2,000 businesses, organizations, and individuals.  On April 30, 1999, the motions judge,
Ontario Superior Court Justice Archie Campbell, ruled that a 1853 Crown patent
purporting to transfer the lands from the Chippewas of Sarnia to a non-aboriginal
party was invalid.  On equitable
grounds, however, he dismissed the Chippewas’ claim against the present owners
of the disputed lands, and declared that they held their lands free and clear
of any Chippewa aboriginal or treaty right. 
However, the Band’s action for damages against the Crown did not form
part of the summary judgment motion and could continue.  All parties appealed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The unanimous Court of Appeal upholds the decision below
that the Chippewa lands were never properly surrendered to the Crown.  However, the Court holds that as the 1853
patent has been relied on as valid for over 150 years, it should not now be set
aside.  By virtue of their subsequent
actions, the Chippewas effectively accepted the sale of their lands and cannot
now challenge the validity of the transaction or be entitled to the return of
the lands.  Therefore, the Chippewas are
left with their claim in damages against the Crown.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Factual background</b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Prior to 1825, much of southwestern Ontario consisted of
unceded lands of the Chippewas.  In
1827, the Chippewas entered into Treaty 29 with the British Crown, finalizing
an earlier agreement whereby the Chippewas surrendered some 2.2 million acres
of land to King George IV.  However, the
Chippewas retained four small reserves for themselves, including the “Upper
Reserve” which then encompassed the disputed lands.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>By 1839, Malcolm Cameron, a businessman, politician, and
land speculator, had developed a close working relationship with Joshua
Wawanosh, the regional Head Chief of the Chippewas.  Cameron was interested in the purchase of a large part of the
Upper Reserve, and was permitted by government officials to negotiate with the
Chippewas to this end.  He was advised
that any bargain reached would be subject to ultimate Crown approval.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Cameron met with the Chippewa chiefs on the Upper Reserve
and negotiated a sale of the lands. 
Those chiefs later called on Indian Department officials to propose to
the government on their behalf the sale of lands “off the rear of the Upper St.
Clair Reserve”.  There is every reason
to believe that the chiefs spoke on behalf of the Chippewas for the purposes of
the transaction.  Contrary to the proper
legal procedures then in place, however, no formal surrender of the Chippewa
lands was ever obtained.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>No evidence was proffered from which to infer that the
lack of surrender was due to any conspiracy to deprive the Chippewas of their
land.  Rather, it appears that the
requirement that there be a valid surrender was merely forgotten amidst the
administrative chaos that reigned over the Indian Department of the day.  Regardless of this oversight, it is clear
that by the fall of 1843 the Chippewas were aware of the full extent of the
lands involved in the sale, yet lodged no complaints of irregularities with the
Indian Department.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In the fourteen years following the sale discussions,
Cameron sold portions of the disputed lands to settlers who then began to
occupy and develop the land. 
Furthermore, disputes regarding road allowances through the reserve illustrated
that the Chippewas had accepted the Cameron transaction as an effective
transfer of land, despite the absence of a surrender.  In 1853, letters patent were finally granted by the Crown to
Cameron.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText><b>Current legal
proceedings</b></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>In 1995, after they determined that there was no formal
surrender of the land, the Chippewas commenced an action against the
governments of Ontario and Canada, and the current commercial and residential
landowners.  The Chippewas sought a
declaration of their right of possession over the disputed lands, in addition
to monetary damages for trespass and breach of the Crown’s fiduciary duty.  Prior to trial, the Government of Canada
moved for summary judgment, claiming that there was no factual or legal basis
for the Chippewas’ claim.  The
landowners brought a similar motion.  In
response, the Chippewas brought a cross-motion for a declaration that no valid
defence to their claim had been raised, and therefore that the claim should
succeed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The motions judge held that the disputed lands had never
been validly surrendered by the Chippewas, and that the patent the Crown had
issued to Cameron in 1853 was therefore invalid.  The motions judge held further, however, that the passage of time
allowed the landowners to rely upon the defence that they were good faith
purchasers of the land for value.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Court of Appeal agrees that there was no surrender,
and accepts the proposition that aboriginal title over land can only be lost
through a surrender of the lands to the Crown. 
The Court thus considers that the issue of importance in this case is
whether, in the absence of a surrender, the Chippewas have a right to the
relief sought, or whether their claims are barred, either by statutory
limitations or equitable doctrines.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The present landowners and the Government of Ontario
argued that the <i>Crown Liability and
Proceedings Act</i>, the <i>Nullum Tempus
Act</i> of 1769, and a series of pre-confederation limitation statutes operated
to bar the Chippewas claim.  The Court
dismisses their arguments on the first two statutes because their application
is restricted to proceedings by the Crown, and are thus inapplicable to the
Chippewas’ claim.  Regarding the
pre-Confederation statutes, the Court holds that the legislation did not evince
a “clear and plain” intention to extinguish aboriginal title, and thus could
not legally bar the Chippewas from seeking a remedy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>With respect to the application of equitable doctrines,
the Court holds that the unique nature of aboriginal title does not preclude
analogizing from, or adapting, the rules of the common law.  The reasons why public and private law
defences must be available are particularly evident in a case such as this,
where the remedies claimed by the Chippewas invoke both the principles of
public law, to challenge the legality of governmental action, and those
applicable to private property, to assert a claim against the private citizens
now occupying the disputed lands.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The Court states that despite the absence of a surrender
in this case, the Cameron patent was valid on its face.  Accordingly, since apparently valid acts of
public officials are relied upon by members of the public at large in planning
their affairs, the rights of the Chippewas as the party aggrieved by the error
must be balanced with the interests of the subsequent purchasers and the interests
of orderly administration.  As a
principle of law, the Court holds that a remedy may be refused where delay by
the aggrieved party in asserting the claim would result in prejudice or
hardship to the public interest or to third parties who have acted in good
faith upon the censured act.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Considering the Chippewas’ acceptance of the Cameron
transaction, the Court holds that, while this does not and cannot amount to a
formal surrender, it is a fact that may be considered in a decision to grant or
to withhold a remedy.  Another factor of
importance is that, from a purposive perspective, the transaction occurred in
such a way that the concerns that the surrender requirement was meant to
address were in fact dealt with. For example, the Crown did interpose between
the parties to ensure that the Chippewas’ interests were protected and the sale
proceeds, which reflected the market value of the land, were paid to the Crown,
and held in trust for the Chippewas. 
The Court finds that there is every indication that the Crown officials
had every intention of following the usual practice and obtaining a formal
surrender, but that for some reason they neglected to do so.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>Therefore, while the Cameron patent is subject to judicial
review because of the failure to obtain a formal surrender, it does not appear
to have been the source of prejudice to the Chippewas at the time they sold the
disputed lands.  The third party
purchasers relied upon the patent for over 150 years, and the Court finds that
the good faith purchaser for value defence should be applied in favour of the
present landowners to dismiss the Chippewas’ claim against them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>As a result, the Court allows the appeals by the
landowners, along with the Governments of Canada and Ontario, to dismiss the
Chippewa claim as related to the land in question on the basis that the 1853
Cameron patent was valid.  The Court
dismisses the Chippewas’ appeal on their motion for summary judgment in respect
of the invalidity of the patent.  The
Chippewas are left with their claim in damages against the Crown.</p>
