    <pre><strong>On Appeal from the judgment of Blair J., dated February 27, 1998

FELDMAN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   This is an appeal from the judgment of Blair J. of February
27, 1998, made in the context of the winding up of The Christian
Brothers of Ireland in Canada (&#147;CBIC&#148;) under the Winding-Up and
Restructuring Act, R.S.C. 1985 c.W-11, pursuant to leave granted
under s. 1031 by McMurtry C.J.O. on July 14, 1998.
[2]   The CBIC was incorporated in 1962 by Act of Parliament
entitled An Act to Incorporate The Christian Brothers of Ireland
in Canada.  The CBIC is the Canadian branch of the Congregation
of Christian Brothers, a world-wide teaching order of the
Catholic Church.  Its activities included operating schools,
educational institutions and orphanages in various parts of the
country. The context of the winding-up application by the CBIC is
the many claims made by boys and men who suffered abuse in the
60&#146;s, 70&#146;s and 80&#146;s at the hands of some of the Brothers at the
Mount Cashel Orphanage in Newfoundland. As a result of the number
of claims arising from the public exposure of these unspeakable
events, the Brothers felt compelled to seek the wind up of their
temporal affairs in Canada with a view to making their assets
available to compensate the victims. In his affidavit in support
of the winding-up application, Brother Barry Lynch stated that
the application was brought to &#147;ensure that the maximum amount of
the Corporation&#146;s assets&#133;are employed compensating all of the
claimants in a fair and expedited manner&#148;.
[3]   Blair J. was asked to decide whether in law, the assets of
a charity are available to compensate tort claimants, and if so,
whether any particular assets of the CBIC are nevertheless
protected and cannot be used to pay compensation to the Mount
Cashel victims. Two schools operated by the CBIC in British
Columbia constitute the most valuable assets potentially
available to pay these claims. Blair J. confirmed that charities
are not immune from liability to tort claimants who have suffered
damage or injury at the hands of the charity. Whether the assets
are held as a charitable trust or beneficially by a charity
organized in corporate form, they are exigible to pay such
claims. However, he went on to carve out an exception for
property held on a &#147;special purpose trust&#148;. He found that if the
British Columbia schools are held by the CBIC as &#147;special purpose
trusts&#148;, then those assets could be used to compensate a claimant
whose claim arose at those schools, but they cannot be used to
pay tort victims abused at other CBIC institutions including
Mount Cashel. For the reasons set out below, I agree that
charities are not immune from liability to tort victims, but I do
not agree that there is any exception for assets held on a
special purpose trust.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND OF THE MOTION</pre>
    <pre>[4]    The winding-up order was granted by Houlden J. on October
28, 1996. The effect of a winding-up order was stated as follows
by the New Brunswick Supreme Court in Partington v. Cushing
(1906), 1 E.L.R. 493, at pp. 494-95, quoted with approval by the
Supreme Court of Canada in Cooprants Mutual Life Ins. Society
(Liquidator of) v. Dubois, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 900 at p.914:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;The  title to the company&#146;s property  remains
          in the company; the control and management and
          disposal of it is taken from the directors and
          placed  in  the  liquidators, who  simply  are
          officers  of the Court, receivers and managers
          acting  under the direction of the Court,  for
          the  purposes  of  closing  up  the  company&#146;s
          business,  realizing its assets and  making  a
          legal distribution thereof among the creditors
          and    shareholders&#133;.Every   statutory   power
          conferred upon the liquidators is given with a
          view  to the speedy, inexpensive and effectual
          accomplishment of this object
        
[5]    Before any claims could be paid, the liquidator required
the direction of the court on three issues. The first was the
general issue of whether assets of a charity are available to pay
creditors or whether they are immune on the basis that they are
in effect held by the charity in trust to be used only for the
charitable purposes of the charity. The second issue relates
specifically to the two most valuable properties administered by
the Christian Brothers, two Catholic high schools in British
Columbia, and whether these properties are beneficially owned by
the corporation or whether they are held in trust and, if held in
trust, whether that makes them unavailable for the victims of
abuse at Mount Cashel. The third issue was whether the liquidator
should admit liability to individual victim claimants and
compromise claims for which the corporation may be liable. These
issues were brought before the court on a motion by the
liquidator for advice and directions.
[6]    A further order made by Houlden J. on July 18, 1997
provided for the appointment of representative counsel to speak
on behalf of all the potential interests in the assets to ensure
that all relevant arguments would be presented to the court for
full consideration.
[7]    A very full record was developed for the motion dealing
with the history of the Congregation of Christian Brothers, the
incorporation of The Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada, the
history of its properties and assets, how the charity and these
assets were administered, the holding of the shares of Vancouver
College Limited and of St. Thomas More Collegiate, the events at
Mount Cashel and the claims arising from those events, as well as
the events leading up to the wind-up of the corporation.  Blair
J. noted that the facts were not in dispute, except in respect of
the two British Columbia schools.
[8]    On November 14, 1997, Blair J. granted an order to the
representatives of the two British Columbia schools for leave, as
required under s. 21 of the Winding-Up and Restructuring Act,2 to
commence proceedings in the Supreme Court of British Columbia.
The purpose of those proceedings is to determine the ownership of
the shares of each of the schools and whether they are held in
trust for the specific purposes of those schools. In other words,
the factual findings regarding ownership and any particular terms
of ownership of those assets are to be determined not by the
court exercising the winding-up jurisdiction, but by the superior
court of the province where the properties are situated. There is
no appeal from the order of November 14, 1997.
[9]    In the result, the Ontario court was not asked to make
factual findings with respect to how the two British Columbia
schools are held and then on that basis to determine whether
those assets will form part of the liquidation and be available
to pay the claims of the tort victims. Rather, the questions
posed for the Ontario court were treated as general or generic
questions, the answers to which could be applied by the
liquidator to particular assets as required and based on the
facts regarding each asset. On the other hand, it was clear that
because the two major properties in issue are the two schools in
British Columbia, the possible status of the ownership of those
two schools formed the only backdrop or context for the answers
to the questions. I will comment later in these reasons about the
desirability of deciding issues such as these in a factual
vacuum.
[10] Vancouver College Limited is a Catholic private school in
Vancouver. It is itself a registered charity under the Income Tax
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.1 (5th Supp.). Since the incorporation of the
school in 1927, the shares of the corporation have been held from
time to time by four individual Brothers in trust for &#147;the
Christian Brothers of Ireland.&#148; The assets of the school are
valued at approximately $31,500,000. The liquidator submits that
the CBIC owns the shares of the college beneficially. The college
submits that its shares are held by the individual Brothers on
trust &#147;for the purposes of operating Vancouver College as a
Catholic independent school committed to the Congregation&#146;s
mission to educate young people in British Columbia&#148;.
[11] St. Thomas More Collegiate Ltd. is a Catholic high school in
Burnaby, British Columbia. It is also a registered charity under
the Income Tax Act.  It was incorporated in 1962. There are three
shares of the company, two of which are in the name of The
Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada, while the third is held
by John Burnell as Trustee for The Christian Brothers of Ireland
in Canada. Mr. Burnell is a teacher at the school but not a
Brother. The assets of the school are valued at approximately
$7,000,000. The original funding for the school was a gift from
the Archdiocese of Vancouver under an agreement that the Brothers
would administer the school. The liquidator submits that the CBIC
is the beneficial owner of the shares of the company. The
position of the school and of Mr. Burnell is that the shares are
held in trust &#147;for the charitable purpose of establishing and
carrying on a Roman Catholic high school at 7450 &#150; 12th Avenue,
Burnaby, British Columbia&#148;.
[12] Essentially, the position asserted by the two British
Columbia schools is that their assets are not owned beneficially
by the CBIC, but are held in trust for the specific purposes of
their schools in British Columbia and therefore are not part of
the assets to be wound up and are not to be used to pay the
claims of the victims of the Christian Brothers at the Mount
Cashel Orphanage in Newfoundland. At stake are the competing
claims of the innocent victims of abuse in Newfoundland versus
the innocent students and their Catholic communities in Vancouver
and Burnaby, British Columbia. Without the assets of the two
schools, CBIC has available approximately $4,000,000 to
compensate victims, whose claims are estimated to reach
$36,000,000.
[13] The three specific questions were stated by the motions
judge and answered in the following way:</pre>
    <pre>	(i)   Whether, because of its charitable objects, The
              Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada is immune 
	      from liability to persons with tort claims (&#147;the
	      charitable immunity issue&#148;)?
             </pre>
    <pre>              A.:  No, the corporation is not immune from liability.
          </pre>
    <pre>        (ii)  If The Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada is
	      not so immune from liability, whether any or all of
	      its assets are exigible to satisfy any judgments
              which may be entered against the Corporation by those
              persons (&#147;the exigibility issue&#148;)?
               </pre>
    <pre>              A.:  All of the assets are exigible to pay the tort 
		   claims. However, if any assets are held as a
		   special purpose trust, then such assets are only
                   exigible to pay tort claims when the wrong was
		   perpetrated within the framework of the particular
                   charitable purpose.
          </pre>
    <pre>        (iii) Following determination of the above questions,
	      directions to the Liquidator with respect to the
              defence or compromise of the claims for which The
	      Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada may be liable
	      (&#147;the liability issue&#148;).
               </pre>
    <pre>              A.:  The liquidator was directed to compromise the
	 	   individual tort claims by admitting liability
		   where claims are proved in accordance with  a
                   formula to be proposed by the liquidator for
		   proof of the claims and for determining the
		   damages.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Blair J. was at pains to assure the parties that the issues
to be decided by the British Columbia court were not being
decided by him, but that once those issues of ownership were
decided, the order of the winding-up court would apply to
determine in law the issue of the exigibility of the British
Columbia properties and assets. Paragraph 5 of the Order was
based on the Reasons for Judgment on this issue:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>5.   THIS COURT ORDERS AND DIRECTS that nothing in the
Reasons of Blair J. released February 27, 1998 in this 
matter or the within Order is intended to affect the 
determination by the British Columbia Supreme Court of 
the questions raised in the Petitions in that Court with 
respect to which leave was granted by the Order of the 
Ontario Court (General Division) on November 14, 1997 in 
the within matter.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>THE ISSUES ON APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[15] The liquidator, supported by representative counsel for the
victims and by the Government of Newfoundland which also has some
liability to the victims, raised two issues on appeal:</pre>
    <pre>a) They appeal from the portion of the answer to question 2
(exigibility) where Blair J. held that there is in law a special
purpose charitable trust which has the effect of protecting the
assets within that trust from all tort claimants except those
whose claims arose in relation to the purposes of that trust.</pre>
    <pre>b) They appeal the jurisdiction of Blair J. to make an order
which provides that it is not binding in respect of British
Columbia assets. They seek an order deleting paragraph 5 of the
Order so that the Order does not purport to say that it is not
binding in respect of the British Columbia properties.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Representative counsel for the charitable objects did not
file a Notice of Cross-Appeal, but in their written and oral
submissions, challenged all of the findings of Blair J. in
respect of the exigibility of assets of the charity, and
submitted that any assets held in trust by the CBIC  are not
available to any tort claimants. These assets include all assets
previously held in trust by the Congregation of Christian
Brothers before incorporation, or by individual Brothers, and all
assets held in trust by the corporation for its charitable
objects. In the alternative, representative counsel for the
charitable objects submitted that Blair J. was correct in
limiting the exigibility of assets in a special purpose trust to
tort claimants injured within the purposes of that trust.
[17] The two British Columbia schools supported the decision of
Blair J. in its entirety.</pre>
    <pre>THE  JUDGMENT BELOW3</pre>
    <pre>[18] Blair J.&#146;s analysis began with the issue of general
charitable immunity. In the mid-19th century, a doctrine had
developed that a charity, or those who operate it, held its
assets in trust for the objects of the charity and therefore,
such assets could not be used to pay damages for the actions of
those who manage the fund. However, this doctrine was overruled
in 1867 by the House of Lords in the case of Mersey Docks and
Harbour Board of Trustees v. Gibbs (1846), 11 E. R. 1500, [1861-
73] All E.R. Rep. 397.
[19] In Canada the charitable immunity theory was never adopted
but was expressly rejected in Lavere v. Smith&#146;s Falls Public
Hospital (1915), 35 O.L.R. 98, (C.A.) and Nyberg v. Provost
Municipal Hospital Board, [1927] S.C.R. 226. Blair J. noted that
that early rejection of the doctrine is consistent with recent
case law in British Columbia and Ontario where charities have
been held liable to tort victims: B (P.A.) v. Curry, [1997] 4
W.W.R. 431 (B.C.C.A.) [since aff&#146;d. [1999] 2 S.C.R. 534]; T.(G.)
v. Griffiths, [1997] 5 W.W.R. 203 (B.C.C.A.); K.(W.) v.
Pornbacher (1997), 34 C.C.L.T. (2d) 174 (B.C.S.C.); McCaw v.
United Church of Canada (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.); and to
pay a large fine: R. v. Church of Scientology (1997), 33 O.R.
(3d) 65 (C.A.).
[20] Having confirmed that the law in Canada is that a charity,
whether it takes the form of a trust or a charitable corporation,
is not immune from liability for the negligent acts of those who
administer the charity, Blair J. turned to the second question
and proceeded to consider whether any of the assets of the
charity enjoyed immunity from exigibility depending on how the
asset was held by the charity. He stated as a general principle
that a charitable corporation does not hold its assets as trustee
for its charitable purposes but rather holds them beneficially as
does any other corporation.
[21] Blair J. then discussed how a charitable corporation must
use its funds in the furtherance of its corporate objects because
the position of a charitable corporation is analogous to that of
a trustee in that respect. However, that does not preclude the
use of the funds to compensate tort victims who were abused when
the charitable objects were carried out in an uncharitable way.
Blair J. noted how large and financially significant the
charitable sector is today in our society and posed this question
rhetorically in reference to charities: &#147;Why, then, should such a
large segment of society have its assets protected from answering
for wrongs done in the course of the pursuit of these charitable
purposes?&#148; (p. 393). He pointed out that such immunity has been
rejected in Ontario in respect of criminal responsibility in the
case of R. v. Church of Scientology, supra.
[22] Blair J. also rejected as ill-founded, both legally and
practically, the concept that a charity be required to maintain
records of the sources and respective intended uses of donated
funds. He concluded that he was satisfied both on a legal and
policy basis that the funds donated to a charity to be used for
its charitable purposes should be available to tort victims of
abuse at the hands of those who were intended to be carrying out
those purposes.
[23] He then went on to address what he identified as the most
problematic aspect of the issue, that is, the status of funds
donated to the charitable corporation but earmarked or designated
not for the general purposes of the corporation but for a
specific purpose. He distinguished between gifts given in what is
sometimes referred to as a precatory trust and those given as a
specific charitable purpose trust.
[24] A precatory trust is not a true trust, but rather an
expression of the desire of the donor to have the funds used for
a specific purpose without the creation of a true trust for the
purpose. That desire is not binding on the corporation and such
funds are beneficially owned by the corporation and not shielded
from execution. Blair J. included in this category funds raised
through general fundraising campaigns or even campaigns for a
particular project of the corporation.
[25] This is to be distinguished from the case where the three
certainties of a trust are present: certainty of intention,
certainty of subject-matter and certainty of objects (in this
case charitable purposes) so that a charitable purpose trust is
created. However, although trust property is not available to the
personal creditors of a trustee, where the claim is for wrongs
done by the trustee  in the course of carrying out the charitable
purposes, Blair J. concluded that the trust funds should be
available for such claimants.
[26] This conclusion is consistent with his preceding analysis
that when funds are donated to the charity to be used only for
its charitable purposes, those purposes must include the payment
of legitimate claims of people abused in the course of the
carrying out of those purposes.
[27] However, Blair J. then went on to hold that in order to
qualify as a claim payable out of the trust funds, the claim must
relate to a wrong done only while the trustee was carrying out
the specific purpose of the trust, and not any of the other
charitable objects of the corporation. That finding is key in
this case, because it means that if the two British Columbia
schools or their assets are held by the corporation as special
purpose trusts, then the victims of abuse at the Mount Cashel
Orphanage in Newfoundland or other schools cannot look to those
properties to satisfy their claims.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[28] In my view, Blair J. was led into a fundamental error by the
way in which the questions for the court were formulated. Once he
had determined that there is no doctrine of charitable immunity
in Canada, it became redundant to then analyze whether the assets
are held on trust in order to determine if they are exigible to
pay the claims of tort victims of the charity in the context of
the winding-up of the charitable corporation. Because a charity
is not immune from liability to those who have suffered wrong at
its hands, either through its trustees, employees or other agents
for whom the charity is responsible, the assets of the charity,
be they beneficially owned or be they &#147;trust funds&#148;, are
available to respond to those liabilities. That has been the law
of Canada for almost a century. It is neither necessary, nor
logically probative, to examine each asset of the charity on an
individual basis to determine its availability to be answerable
for the debts of the charity on a wind-up, based on whether that
asset is held in trust for one or more charitable purposes. To do
so, is to reintroduce into our law the rejected doctrine of
charitable immunity by resurrecting the equally rejected trust
fund theory.</pre>
    <pre>HISTORY OF CHARITABLE IMMUNITY DOCTRINE</pre>
    <pre>[29] The traditional trust arose out of both the common law and
equity.4 The establishment of a trust required the three
certainties: the intention of the settlor to create a trust (and
therefore to appoint a trustee), the assets of the trust, and the
beneficiaries or objects of the trust. Initially, the
beneficiaries had to be persons who could enforce the trust.
However, an exception was allowed whereby the objects could be
charitable purposes, for which the Crown could enforce the trust
on behalf of the public. The charitable purpose trust thereby
allowed a settlor to leave money or other assets on trust to
trustees obliged to hold and administer the assets for the
designated charitable purposes. This type of trust attracted
other legal advantages not available to private trusts. One was
that the trust could vest beyond the perpetuity period, and
another, that it could remain in existence forever, whereas
private trusts could neither vest nor exist beyond the defined
perpetuity period. The third advantage was that a charitable
trust would not fail if the objects of the trust were uncertain
as long as the court could determine that the settlor had a
general charitable intention. In that case the court has the
power to devise a scheme to remove the uncertainty and give
effect to the trust. Furthermore, if the charitable object
becomes impracticable or impossible to carry out after the gift
has vested in the charity, then the court again has the power to
alter the charitable object and to apply the funds cy-pres to
another charitable object. In effect the court has supervisory
power over the trust.
[30] The concept that the trust funds held by the trustees of a
public charity will not be answerable for the tort liabilities
incurred by actions taken by or on behalf of the charity, was
formulated in three 19th century cases from the House of Lords,
Feoffees of Heriot&#146;s Hospital v. Ross, [1846]  XII Cl. &amp; Fin.
507, 8 E. R. 1508, which followed Duncan v. Findlater, [1839] VI
Cl. &amp; Fin. 894, 7 E.R. 934 and Holliday v. St. Leonard&#146;s,
Shoreditch (1861), 11 C.B. (N.S.) 192, 142 E.R. 769 5.  In
Heriot&#146;s Hospital, a charity had been established for a home for
fatherless boys, but the plaintiff Ross, who was fatherless and
otherwise qualified, had been excluded from the home. As he was
too old for admission by the time his case was determined, the
only issue was whether he was entitled to damages from the trust
funds used for the home. Lord Cottenham determined that this was
not possible and following his earlier decision in Duncan, supra,
articulated his reasons as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          He sues in this proceeding not the individual
          trustee,  nor  is  this  a  personal   action
          against  any  of  them; it  is  a  proceeding
          against  them in their corporate capacity  as
          feoffees of the charity funds. He does not in
          terms  pray for the payment of damages,  from
          the trust funds, but still as the summons  is
          constituted, he cannot receive damages should
          he  receive  them at all, except  from  those
          funds;   and  it  has  been  throughout   the
          proceedings understood that, if there are  to
          be  any damages at all, they must be paid out
          of the trust fund. The question then comes to
          this,  -  whether by the law  of  Scotland  a
          person who claims damages from those who  are
          managers of a trust fund, in respect of their
          management of that fund, can make  it  liable
          in payment. It is obvious that it would be  a
          direct  violation,  in  all  cases,  of   the
          purposes  of a trust, if this could be  done;
          for  there is not any person who ever created
          a trust fund that provided for payment out of
          it  of damages to be recovered from those who
          had  the  management of  the  fund.  No  such
          provision  has  been made here.  There  is  a
          trust,  and  there  are persons  intended  to
          manage it for the benefit of those who are to
          be  the  objects  of  the  charity.  To  give
          damages out of a trust fund would not  be  to
          apply  it to those objects who the author  of
          the  fund had in view, but would be to divert
          it   to   a   completely  different  purpose.
          (p.1510)</pre>
    <pre>In  a  concurring  judgment, Lord Campbell  stated  that  if  the
trustees   had  done  wrong,  then  they  alone  were  personally
responsible for the loss suffered.</pre>
    <pre>[31] To the extent that there had thereby developed a concept of
charitable immunity in England, it was very shortlived. In Mersey
Docks and Harbour Board Trustees v. Gibbs et al. (1866), [1861-
1873] All E.R. Rep. 397 (H.L.), the Board was sued by the owners
of a ship and its cargo, damaged when the ship got stuck in mud
at the mouth of the harbour. The Board was held to be negligent,
but the issue was whether the Board and the funds it collected
and administered to operate the docks could be answerable to an
action for negligence. The argument was that because the funds
were held by the trustees in trust for the benefit of the public,
they could not be used to compensate tort claimants against the
Board. The House of Lords firmly rejected the concept of such
immunity. In so doing Lord Westbury rejected Lord Cottenham&#146;s
reasoning from the Duncan case as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          I  can  well  divine what was  at  that  time
          passing in the mind of my Lord Cottenham.  He
          seems  to have thought that, if a corporation
          be   trustees  of  property  for  the  direct
          benefit  of certain individuals and there  is
          no  other corporate property, and if in their
          capacity as trustees an act is done by  order
          of the corporation which amounts to a tort or
          trespass  and gives a right of action  and  a
          right to damages to any private individual, a
          court of equity would not permit an execution
          to  issue  on  any  judgment  that  might  be
          recovered   against  the  property   of   the
          corporation, seeing that it is property  held
          upon trust for certain beneficiaries and that
          the  corporation as trustees have no interest
          therein. But, my Lords, I apprehend that  was
          a  misapprehension on the part of  the  noble
          and  learned Lord, and that it would lead  to
          very  mischievous consequences. It is  by  no
          means true that a court of equity is able  to
          protect the property of beneficiaries against
          the  act  of  trustees. If trustees  alienate
          property  for  valuable  consideration  to  a
          person  who  pays that consideration  without
          notice  of  the  trust, the interest  of  the
          beneficiaries suffers from that act,  and  it
          would  be  a  very unreasonable  and  a  very
          mischievous  thing  if,  in  the  case  of  a
          corporation dealing with the public  or  with
          individuals, such corporation should, by  any
          act   of   theirs  in  respect  of   property
          committed  to  their care, give  a  right  of
          action  to individuals, that such individuals
          should  be deprived of the ordinary right  of
          resorting for a remedy against the body doing
          or  authorising  those acts,  and  should  be
          driven   to   seek  a  remedy   against   the
          individual  corporators  whose  decision   or
          order in the name of the corporation may have
          led to the mischief complained of. It is much
          more reasonable in such a case that the trust
          or  corporate property should be amenable  to
          the  individuals  injured, because  there  is
          then  no failure of justice, seeing that  the
          beneficiary  will always have  his  right  of
          complaint  and   his title to relief  against
          the    individual   corporators   who    have
          wrongfully used the name of the corporation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
          &#133; Those observations of Lord Cottenham, which
          directly  tend to this conclusion,  that  the
          corporation in the case supposed would not be
          amenable, nor would the corporate property be
          liable,  but that the party injured would  be
          obliged  to  have  resort to  the  individual
          members  who  directed the act  to  be  done,
          would,  if they were recognized as  the  law,
          undoubtedly  lead  to  very  great  evil  and
          injury. (pp.412-413)
</pre>
    <pre>[32] Interestingly, an anomalous development occurred in the
United States. There the courts imported the doctrine of
charitable immunity from England after 1866, unaware that it had
already been overruled. They developed various theories to
support the doctrine including: a) the &#147;trust fund&#148; model which
focused on the donor&#146;s intention that the funds be used for the
charitable purposes only and not to pay tort claims; b) the
concept that respondeat superior did not apply to charities
because they did not profit from their employees&#146; work; c) the
doctrine that the beneficiaries of the charity could not sue for
any damage because they assumed the risk of negligence; and d) in
order to ensure the continued viability of charities, public
policy required that donors be assured that the money donated
would be used only for the good works of the charity.
[33] Because the immunity of charities conflicted with the
general liability of others to answer for wrongs done, a number
of exceptions developed to the immunity doctrine in different
U.S. jurisdictions, including: a) charities were liable to
strangers but not to beneficiaries of the charity; b) charities
were liable for the negligence of managing officials but not of
servants; c) charities were liable if they had insurance but not
otherwise; d) charities could pay tort judgments from commercial
funds or funds from paying beneficiaries but not from their
charitable funds.6
[34] The inconsistent state of American law on charitable
immunity was fully addressed in the important decision of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, President and
Directors of Georgetown College v. Hughes (1942), 130 Fed. Rep.
(2d) 810. The action was brought by a nurse against the hospital
for injuries sustained from a swinging door. The negligence case
was made out. Three judges of the court sustained the liability
of the hospital on the basis that the nurse was a stranger to the
charity. Rutledge J., speaking for the other three, upheld the
verdict but on the ground that there was no sound basis in law or
public policy for the maintenance of any doctrine of charitable
immunity. He summarized his analysis in this way:</pre>
    <pre>          The    chief   arguments,   therefore,    for
          sustaining  the immunity, namely ultra  vires
          marked  out  by  authority or intent  of  the
          donor  and danger of destroying or preventing
          the  creation of charitable institutions,  no
          longer  have,  if  they ever had,  compelling
          effect.  Changes  in  the  law  and  in   the
          organization and mores of community life have
          taken  away their major force. That is  true,
          whether for full or for modified immunity&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          As  against the factors favouring it, may  be
          mentioned the tendency of immunity to  foster
          neglect  and of liability to induce care  and
          caution; the departure from the general  rule
          of   liability;  the  anomaly  of   exempting
          charitable corporations and trust funds, when
          charity  is  not  a defence  to  others;  the
          injustice  of giving benefit to some  at  the
          cost  of  injury to others and of the injured
          individual&#146;s   having  to   bear   the   loss
          wrongfully inflicted upon him, at a time when
          the  direction  of the law is towards  social
          distribution of losses through liability  for
          fault,    liability   without   fault,    and
          legislation  which gives the person  disabled
          to  work  what  is commonly but  inaccurately
          called   &#147;social&#148; security. There are  others
          we do not stop to mention.
          </pre>
    <pre>          It is hardly necessary to discuss the various
          theories of exemption or their application in
          various  modifications. Whether  immunity  be
          founded on the &#147;trust fund&#148; theory, the  rule
          of  respondeat  superior,  so-called  &#147;public
          policy&#148;, or the more indefensible doctrine of
          &#147;implied waiver&#148;, is not for us a controlling
          consideration. At bottom, except possibly for
          the  last, these come down to the same thing,
          supported  by  the same considerations.  They
          are merely different names for the same idea,
          cast  according  to the predilection  of  the
          user    for   technical   or   for    broader
          terminology.   The   &#147;trust   fund    theory&#148;
          comprehends all that is involved  in  &#147;public
          policy&#148;, with only an apparent difference  in
          approach.   This   is   true   likewise    of
          respondeat  superior and implied  waiver.  In
          any  event  the  result is a  departure  from
          general,  and  we think right, principles  of
          liability.  The differences in foundation  do
          not  affect even the extent of the departure.
          We  think  it  should be  complete  and  that
          charitable  corporations  should  respond  as
          others do for the wrongs inflicted by persons
          who  act in their behalf about their business
          and within the course of their duties, actual
          or   apparent.  Immunity,  whether  full   or
          partial,   is   to  be  granted   only   when
          compelling reason requires it. If  there  has
          been,  there  is no longer such  reason.  The
          reasons  which support governmental immunity,
          where it remains, are largely different,  but
          even  so  they  too  give  way  gradually  to
          liability    imposed    or    permitted    by
          legislation. (p.824-825)</pre>
    <pre>He  concluded with the following observation, which is consistent
with current thinking in Canada:

          The   law&#146;s   emphasis   ordinarily   is   on
          liability,  not  immunity,   for  wrongdoing.
          Respondeat  superior has  widened  it  in  an
          institutionally,  and  to  a   large   extent
          corporately, organized community. Charity  is
          generally  no  defense.  When  it  has   been
          organized as a trust or corporation, emphasis
          has  shifted from liability to immunity.  The
          conditions  of law and of fact which  created
          the  shift have changed. The rule of immunity
          is  out  of  step with the general  trend  of
          legislative    and   judicial    policy    in
          distributing  losses incurred by  individuals
          through the operation of an enterprise  among
          all  who benefit by it rather than in leaving
          them  wholly to be borne by those who sustain
          them. (p.827)
</pre>
    <pre>[35] Although the law on charitable immunity remains inconsistent
in some U.S. states, the doctrine of charitable immunity has
never been the law in Canada.
[36] In Donaldson v. The Commissioners of the General Public
Hospital in Saint John (1890), 30 N.B.R. 279 (N.B.C.A.), an
action was brought by a patient against a public charitable
hospital for negligent care by the doctors and nurses. It was
argued that the hospital could not be held liable because it was
a charity. The majority firmly rejected this proposition after
reviewing the state of the law in England including the fact that
the Mersey Docks case had overruled the Heriot&#146;s Hospital and
Duncan cases, and held that:</pre>
    <pre>          the funds of the Hospital would be applicable
          for the payment of the damages, if any should
          be  recovered in this action as  incident  to
          the administration of the trust. (p.299-300)
</pre>
    <pre>[37] In Ontario, Riddell J.A. dispelled the &#147;trust fund&#148; theory
of immunity in the 1915 case  Lavere v. Smith&#146;s Falls Public
Hospital, supra.  There the hospital was held liable for the
negligence of a nurse in the course of her duty. Riddell J.A.
approved the conclusion of the majority of the Supreme Court of
Alabama in Tucker v. Mobile Infirmary Association, (1915), 68
Sou. Repr. 4 that: &#147;a charitable hospital is in no higher
position than any other corporation in respect of liability for
the negligence of its servants, the &#147;charitable trusts&#148; theory,
though supported by a great weight of authority in the American
Courts, being untenable.&#148; (p.113) He concluded:</pre>
    <pre>          After  all  the cases, it is plain that  once
          the  &#147;trust fund theory&#148; is got rid of &#150;  and
          it  is conceded that it has now no footing in
          our   law  &#150;  the  case  is  reduced  to  the
          question,  what did the defendants  undertake
          to  do?  If  only  to supply  a  nurse,  then
          supplying a nurse selected with due  care  is
          enough;  if  to nurse, then, the nurse  doing
          that  which the defendants undertook  to  do,
          they are responsible for her negligence as in
          contract &#150; respondeat superior. I am  of  the
          opinion  that  the plaintiff should  succeed.
          (p.114)
</pre>
    <pre>[38] In the 1926 Supreme Court of Canada decision in Nyberg v.
Provost Municipal Hospital Board, supra, the court held, relying
on the Mersey Docks decision of the House of Lords, that a public
not-for-profit hospital is not free from liability for the
negligence of its servants. The majority approved the observation
of Mignault J. that the opposite contention was &#147;hopeless&#148; in
light of the authority. As recently as 1994 in Pittman Estate v.
Bain, 112 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at 351, Lang J. noted
that the immunity doctrine was long defunct in Canadian law and
expressed the sentiment that it should not be resurrected under
another guise.
[39] Most recently in Bazley v. Curry, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 534 the
Supreme Court reaffirmed that a charity enjoys no immunity from
liability to its tort victims. The court approached the issue
without relying on previous case law, but instead addressed the
issue afresh, applying a principled analysis. The court
considered and rejected the following three submissions made in
favour of immunity at pp. 563-564 (para. 48): 1) that it is
unfair to fix liability without fault on non-profit organizations
performing needed services on behalf of the general public; 2)
that non-profit organizations are less able to control and
supervise the conduct of their agents, many of whom are
volunteers, which enhances the unfairness of imposing vicarious
liability and diminishes its deterrent effect; and 3) that the
practical effect of making non-profit organizations vicariously
liable for the misconduct of their agents would be to make it
difficult or impossible for such organizations to carry out their
important work.
[40] In rejecting these arguments, the court concluded that as
between the innocent victim and the charity which had the
opportunity to prevent the loss, fairness demands that the loss
should be borne by the charity. The court doubted that the public
social benefit from the existence and operation of charitable
institutions justified leaving a victim without a remedy, in
effect making the victim a significant and disproportionate
contributor to that public benefit.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION  ON CHARITABLE IMMUNITY DOCTRINE</pre>
    <pre>[41] This review of the history of the issue of &#147;charity
immunity&#148;, whether charities enjoy immunity from liability to
victims of torts perpetrated by or on behalf of the charity and
for which the charity is in law responsible, leaves no doubt that
there is not, nor was there ever in Canada, any such immunity.
This was also the conclusion reached by Blair J. and his answer
to the first question posed for the court.
[42] However, the law goes much further. The courts in England
and Canada have fully considered the issue of whether the fact
that the charity trustees hold the charity&#146;s funds in trust,
means that those funds are required to be used only directly for
the charitable purposes for which they are held, and not
indirectly to compensate tort victims for wrongs done in the
operation of the charity. Our courts have firmly rejected the
&#147;trust fund theory&#148; of immunity which had earlier been
articulated by Lord Cottenham in the Duncan, supra, and Heriot&#146;s
Hospital, supra, cases.
[43] In other words, the question of charitable immunity was not
raised and resolved as a hollow issue addressing only whether
judgment could be registered against a charitable corporation or
Board of Trustees. The immunity issue addressed and decided that
the funds of the charity, held by the board or by the corporation
as the case may be, are available to satisfy the tort claims. The
fact that they may be held on charitable trusts by the trustees,
does not make those funds immune from execution.

ANALYSIS OF THE EXIGIBILITY ISSUE</pre>
    <pre>[44] With  respect to Blair J., in my view he erred by proceeding
to answer the second question, whether the assets of a charity
are exigible to satisfy tort claims, by analyzing that issue
separately, embarking on a trust analysis of the way charities
hold their assets. In my view, by so doing he simply re-addressed
the same immunity issue by asking the question in a different
manner.
[45] Blair J. noted that trust funds are immune from execution to
pay creditors of the trustee for debts or other obligations
incurred by the trustee in the trustee&#146;s personal life: Kimniak
v. Anderson (1929), 63 O.L.R. 428 (C.A.)
[46] However, the essential reason why our courts rejected the
&#147;trust theory&#148; analysis of charitable immunity - i.e. immunity of
the trust assets because they belonged beneficially to the
charitable purposes and not to the trustee -  was because in
those cases,  tort liability was not incurred by trustees in
their personal life, but rather in the administration of the
trust, or by a servant or agent of the trust who was carrying out
duties for the trust and under its auspices. In those
circumstances where a tort was committed by or on behalf of or in
the name of the charitable agency, our courts have recognized
that the trust assets must answer for the wrong done: see for
example Mersey Docks, supra, Donaldson, supra, Lavere, supra, and
Nyberg, supra.
[47] One question that has continued to vex the courts over the
years is whether, in the particular case, the tort was committed
by or on behalf of the charity and whether the charity should be
held responsible in law for the acts of the person who caused the
damage to the claimant, for example, where it is alleged that the
wrongdoer was acting outside his or her authority. Again in 1999
in the Curry case, the court first had to find that the charity
was vicariously liable for the sexual abuse perpetrated by its
employee on the victim. The court then went on to consider, on a
policy basis, whether in spite of vicarious liability the charity
should have immunity, and concluded that it should not.
[48] What is the basis of the &#147;trust fund theory&#148; which suggests
that the funds held by charities may not be available in law or
equity to pay tort claimants against the charity? I discern that
the theory emerges from three concepts, working either alone or
together. The first is the intent of the donor: that when a donor
gives money to a charity or to be used for charitable purposes,
the intention is that it is to be held in trust and used for
those purposes only, that is, for the good works carried out by
the charity, and therefore it would be a breach of trust to use
the funds to pay liabilities incurred in the course of carrying
out those good works. The second is that charities originally
took the form of charitable trusts where gifts were given to a
trustee to be held for certain charitable purposes or objects.
Because there was a trust, the trustee held the legal title to
the trust assets but they were owned beneficially by the trust
purposes. Therefore, a judgment obtained against the trustee
could not be enforced against the assets because the trustee did
not own them in his or her own right. The third is that if a
trustee is held liable to an injured party, the trustee is not
entitled to be reimbursed out of the trust funds if he or she was
guilty of any wrongdoing. Therefore neither is the victim
entitled to obtain access to the funds by that route.
[49] I am satisfied that each of these rationales for the trust
theory was either expressly or impliedly rejected with the
rejection of charitable immunity.
     </pre>
    <pre>     A. THE INTENTION OF THE DONOR</pre>
    <pre>[50] This issue was raised squarely in the Heriot&#146;s case as the
rationale for denying the plaintiff any damages from the funds of
the charity. Lord Cottenham, in the passage quoted earlier in
paragraph [30], stated that it would be a &#147;direct violation, in
all cases, of the purposes of a trust&#148; to allow the funds to be
used for that purpose. He observed in support of his conclusion
that no one who creates a trust fund provides that it can be used
to recover damages from those who manage it. Although the
intention of the donor was not specifically addressed, by
rejecting the concept of charitable immunity, the court in Mersey
Docks also necessarily rejected the notion that the donor&#146;s
intention should govern, either as a matter of policy or of law.
I agree with the statement of Blair J. (p.393) that &#147;the payment
of properly established tort claims is as much a part of the
conduct of the corporation&#146;s charitable calling as are the &#145;good
works&#146; aspect of its mandate.&#148;
[51] In later discussions of the policy arguments for and against
immunity, such as in Curry and in the U.S. cases, courts have
considered seriously whether allowing the funds to be used for
payment to tort victims would undermine charitable giving
generally and discourage donors on a broad scale. Ultimately this
fear is discounted, based on the increase in the size and number
of charities operating within our societies today and because
based on fairness, the need for compensation of the victims is
recognized as paramount.</pre>
    <pre>     B. THE ISSUE OF SPLIT OWNERSHIP</pre>
    <pre>[52] Originally the trust developed where one person held
property, but for the use of another. That obligation was
enforced by the courts of equity. Out of this concept which
applied in the strict sense only to land and not to personalty,7
a trustee is said to hold the legal title to trust property,
while the beneficial or equitable title belongs to the
beneficiary. In effect, a trust is a relationship where the
trustee owes duties to the beneficiary in respect of the trust
property. In The Law of Trusts 10th ed. (1974) by G.W. Keeton and
L.A. Sheridan, the authors describe a trust as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          All  that  can be said of a trust, therefore,
          is  that it is the relationship which  arises
          whenever  a  person  called  the  trustee  is
          compelled in equity to hold property, whether
          real  or  personal, and whether by  legal  or
          equitable  title,  for the  benefit  of  some
          persons  (of whom he may be one, and who  are
          termed  beneficiaries)  or  for  some  object
          permitted by law, in such a way that the real
          benefit of the property accrues, not  to  the
          trustees, but to the beneficiaries  or  other
          objects of the trust. (p.5)</pre>
    <pre>It   is  problematic  to  conceptualize  charitable  purposes  as
&#147;owning&#148;  the  equitable  interest in trust  property.   In  this
context,  whether the purposes can be said to &#147;own&#148; the equitable
interest in trust property, that property is held by the trustees
for  use only for the charitable purposes and that obligation  is
enforced by the Attorney General through the courts8.</pre>
    <pre>[53] It is the duality of ownership which compels the rule in
debtor/creditor law that where a trustee is subject to a judgment
obtained in respect of an act done in his or her personal
capacity and not in connection with the administration of the
trust, then the property held by the trustee not for him or
herself but for the beneficiaries of the trust, is not answerable
for the personal debts of the trustee: Jellett v. Wilkie (1896),
26 S.C.R. 282; Kimniak v. Anderson (1929), 63 O.L.R. 428 (C.A.).
[54] In Mersey Docks, Lord Westbury specifically rejected the
concept that because the property was held for the benefit of
beneficiaries, it could not be reached by individuals who had
suffered damage from the acts of trustees in carrying out their
trust duties. He concluded that equity will not protect the
property of beneficiaries from the consequences of the acts of
their trustees where those acts are done in respect of the
property committed to the care of the trustees, and where members
of the public who deal with them have a right of action as a
result. In his view this result was fair, because the
beneficiaries would have the right to seek compensation from the
trustees who have done wrong. In other words, the fact that the
property was held in trust did not affect its exigibility for
victims of acts of the trustees when the trustees were acting on
behalf of the trust.</pre>
    <pre>     C. A TRUSTEE CAN ONLY BE REIMBURSED IF HE OR SHE DID NOT ACT
     WRONGFULLY</pre>
    <pre>[55] Counsel for the trust objects take the position that all
assets of the charity are trust assets which are not exigible to
pay tort claimants. They argue that a tort claimant cannot sue a
charitable trust directly but only the trustee, and that the
trustee may only seek indemnity from the trust assets if the
trustee acted with due diligence and reasonably and was not
personally at fault. The tort claimant, having successfully
obtained judgment against the trustee, can only seek recovery
from the trust assets if those same circumstances apply. This
proposition is derived from two 19th century English Chancery
cases: Raybould v. Turner, [1900] 1 Ch. 199, following Bennett v.
Wyndham (1862), 4 De G.F.&amp; J. 259. Blair J. was concerned about
the implications of this line of authority because there is some
evidence of CBIC complicity and cover-up of the actions of
certain of the perpetrators of the abuse at Mount Cashel.
[56] In my view, the two Chancery decisions, which were made in
the context of private and not charitable trusts, were never
consistent with the authorities which established that there is
no charitable immunity for torts perpetrated by or on behalf of a
charity. First, I do not believe that those cases hold that no
action lies against the trust but only the trustees. Technically,
there is no entity to sue but the trustees. The issue is whether
the judgment against the trustees is against them in their
personal capacity or is it effective against the corpus of the
trust. In Mersey Docks, the judgment obtained against the Board
of Trustees, who were found responsible for the condition of the
port which caused the damage, was explicitly said by the Law
Lords to be recoverable from the funds held by the Board.
[57] However, any doubt on the issue has been put to rest by the
Curry decision which defined the rule for determining when an
employer, including a charity, will be held liable for the
unauthorized, intentional wrongs perpetrated by an employee. The
court held at p. 563, para. 46, that &#147;the test&#133;should focus on
whether the employer&#146;s enterprise and empowerment of the employee
materially increased the risk of&#133; the harm&#148; with a view to &#147;the
policy considerations that justify the imposition of vicarious
liability &#150; fair and efficient compensation for wrong and
deterrence&#148;. In my view it follows that the risk of harm and the
policy of compensation will apply even more strongly if there is
any suggestion that the wrongful acts of employees (or other
agents) were in some way condoned or implicitly authorized by the
charity. If the Attorney General on behalf of the charitable
objects may seek compensation from the wrongdoers, that is a
separate issue which does not affect the rights of the victims.
[58] In this case, the issue of the CBIC&#146;s liability to the
victims of abuse at the hands of individual brothers has been
determined. In one action9 the corporation admitted liability. In
respect of the other claims, Blair J. ruled in answer to the
third question posed, that the liquidator should admit the claims
subject to proof. That ruling has not been appealed. He approved
the position of the liquidator, standing in the shoes of the
corporation, that liability should be admitted to claimants able
to prove that they suffered physical, emotional or sexual assault
or abuse by a Christian Brother at an institution managed or
operated by the CBIC. Therefore, in this case there is vicarious
liability of the CBIC for the abuse perpetrated by individual
Christian Brothers.
         
THE EXIGIBILITY OF SPECIFIC ASSETS OF CBIC</pre>
    <pre>[59] Blair J. approached the issue of exigibility of specific
assets by analyzing how the assets of a charity are held and in
particular, whether they are held on trust. For the reasons which
I have already stated, this inquiry was redundant when the
doctrine of no charitable immunity for trust assets had been
established. Blair J.&#146;s analysis followed these steps to the
conclusion which he reached:</pre>
    <pre>     1)   The   CBIC  is  a  charitable  corporation.  Charitable
          corporations generally hold their assets beneficially as
	  do other corporations.</pre>
    <pre>     2)   However, the charitable corporation must use those assets
          only in a manner consistent with its charitable purposes.</pre>
    <pre>     3)   A charitable corporation is in a position analogous to a
     	  trustee (a trust-like capacity) with respect to the use and
          disposition of its property.     </pre>
    <pre>     4)   Using monies held in a trust-like capacity to pay  tort
          claims is not inconsistent with the trust-like obligations
	  of the charity. Rather, &#147;the payment of properly established
	  tort claims is as much a part of the conduct of the
	  corporation&#146;s charitable calling as are the &#145;good works&#146;
 	  aspect of its mandate.&#148; (p. 393)</pre>
    <pre>     5)   It would be impractical for a charity to operate on the
          presumption that donations are given in trust for the
	  charitable purposes of the corporation and for that reason
	  to keep donations segregated from other funds held
	  beneficially such as insurance proceeds, fees, or government
	  grants.</pre>
    <pre>     6)   Property  which has been earmarked by the donor  for  a
          particular charitable purpose of the charity and takes the
	  form of  a precatory trust is still held beneficially by the
          corporation and therefore is available to execution creditors.</pre>
    <pre>     7)   Property  which  is  held by a  trustee  on  trust  for
          beneficiaries is not available to the creditors of the trustee
	  or to satisfy a personal judgment against a trustee, because
	  the trustee has legal title but the beneficiary has beneficial
          ownership of that property. This principle does not apply,
          however, when the trust object is a charitable purpose, not a
          person, and when the wrong done is not in the trustee&#146;s
	  personal affairs but in the context of the charitable purpose.
	  In those circumstances, the trust property is held subject to
	  the equities which include legitimate tort claims incurred in
	  respect of the charitable purpose.</pre>
    <pre>[60] The critical conclusion is stated as follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>          The  charitable  purpose  property  must   be
          available to satisfy claims legitimately made
          against   the   charitable   corporation   in
          relation  to  it,  for  the  reasons  I  have
          articulated   in  earlier  parts   of   these
          reasons. Thus, property held by The Christian
          Brothers of Ireland in Canada on trust for  a
          specific    charitable   purpose    is    not
          necessarily protected from attachment at  the
          hands  of  tort  claimants  asserting  claims
          against  the corporation, simply  because  of
          the  &#147;trust&#148;  nature of such an  arrangement.
          Exigibility  of  such property  depends  upon
          whether the wrong has been perpetrated within
          the  framework  of the particular  charitable
          purpose   in  question,  as  I  have  earlier
          delineated  it.  I  do not  think  that  tort
          claims  legitimately  asserted  against   one
          specific charitable purpose property  can  be
          asserted  against  other specific  charitable
          purpose  property that may be  held  by  that
          same   charitable   corporation.   (p.   400)
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>No  authority  was cited for this conclusion. The judgment  broke
new   ground  by  suggesting  that  tort  claimants  against  the
corporation  assert their claims against specific  properties  or
assets  depending  upon where, by whom or in what  situation  the
tort occurred or the damage was suffered.</pre>
    <pre>[61] In my view this conclusion is wrong in law as well as
policy. It undermines the rule that there is no charitable
immunity from compensating tort victims, by requiring before
payment of any claim, an analysis of how each asset of the
charity was acquired, to determine whether that asset may be
available to pay the particular victim. Examples of potential
problems arising from the application of this principle are not
difficult to conceive. They were alluded to by Blair J. in an
earlier part of the reasons where he queried rhetorically:</pre>
    <pre>          What  of  the  building,  or  the  piece   of
          equipment, that is built or acquired  with  a
          combination  of gifts, bequests,  grants  and
          fees  for service? Are they to be divided  up
          into  pieces, some of which will be available
          to  creditors and some of which will not?  To
          say  that the onus is on the trustee to  keep
          such  donations  (and  assets  acquired  with
          them)  separate  at the risk  of  having  all
          assets swept into the classification of trust
          funds  if  they  are  co-mingled  with  other
          assets  or  revenues  hardly  addresses   the
          problem.  Rather, it rewards  the  charitable
          organization  and encourages the co-mingling,
          at  the  expense  of  the  tort  victims,  by
          shielding  all  assets  from  the  reach   of
          creditors  &#150;  on  the trust  analysis  basis!
          (p.394)</pre>
    <pre>[62] Because in this case the potential &#147;special purpose
properties&#148; are free-standing schools which may appear to be
easily severable from the balance of the charity&#146;s assets, the
concept of relating the tort to the property and having that
property respond may appear to be a straightforward one. However,
the result is more complex and difficult in the following
examples. Example 1: there is a &#147;special purpose trust&#148; of a gift
of funds to a hospital on trust, to be used to construct a
cardiac care wing. Torts are committed in the surgical wing, and
the hospital must be sold or mortgaged in order to pay the
claims. In those circumstances, can the whole hospital be sold,
arguably breaching the trust with respect to the cardiac care
wing? Can the cardiac care wing be mortgaged and put in
financial jeopardy to pay tort victims whose claims arose in
another part of the hospital? Is a hospital to be viewed as an
integrated facility for the purpose of determining within which
special purpose property the tort was perpetrated, or as a
collection of separate parts, assuming some parts were built with
special purpose trust funds?
[63] Example 2: assume a donation on trust was given to the CBIC
to be used by the CBIC to establish and provide a music program
in each of its schools. The money was used to equip a music room
in each school. Abuse took place at one of the schools but not in
the music room. The question then becomes, did the wrong have to
be committed in the music room in order to make that room and its
contents available to pay the claim?
[64] The result reached below does not address how to determine
what is to be considered as the specific charitable purpose when
deciding whether the tort was committed within the framework of
the purpose. Is it the charitable purpose itself, for example,
providing education, or is it a particular project at a
particular location, such as an entire school, or can it be a
portion of a specific project, such as one room within the
school? By defining &#147;specific charitable purpose&#148; in terms of any
specific use of funds designated by a donor, the tort claimants
seeking to maximize their recovery will always be pitted against
the interests of those who wish to preserve as many of the assets
of the charity intact as possible, who will argue the narrowest
scope for the definition of the charitable purpose within which
the wrong was perpetrated. As suggested by the music room and
hospital wing examples, if different rooms within an educational
institution or hospital are endowed on trust for the purpose of
the room or wing, one could argue that because the wrong was not
committed in that room or wing, therefore that asset is not
exigible and  should be preserved.
[65] In its factum the liquidator refers to practical problems it
will face associated with determining whether specific assets
including but not limited to the two British Columbia schools,
are held by the CBIC on special purpose trusts.
[66] In my view, the articulation of these problems demonstrates
that the concept of attempting to relate the wrong done to the
particular assets of the charity is fatally flawed, as well as
being incompatible with the long-standing rule of charitable non-
immunity.
[67] The fundamental problem with the analysis and result reached
below is that its logic is not reconcilable with the accepted
rule that assets donated on trust for the general charitable
purposes of a charity will be answerable to tort claims which may
arise out of a particular operation of a charity. The effect is
that if the tort arises within the context of one of the
operations of the charity, then the trust funds donated to
benefit all the purposes generally will go to pay that claim,
with the result that the other trust purposes for which the funds
were also donated will suffer, although the funds were supposed
to be in trust for those purposes as well. This result is the
accepted consequence of the no-immunity rule. There is no logical
basis not to apply the same consequence when the funds were
donated for only one of the charity&#146;s purposes or establishments.
[68] I do not discern that an inconsistent application or result
was ever intended by the House of Lords in Mersey Docks or by the
courts that followed its authority. Those courts recognized that
the public who were intended to benefit from the charity&#146;s
operations would have to lose out when judgments were executed
against property held on trust by the trustees of the public
institution.
     </pre>
    <pre>MODERN RECOGNITION OF &#147;A SPECIAL PURPOSE TRUST&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[69] For many years organized charities have taken the form of
corporations incorporated to carry out charitable objects. It is
generally accepted that charitable corporations receive and hold
their assets beneficially as all corporations do. However, they
are obliged to use those assets only to further the charitable
purposes of the corporation. The position was well-summarized by
Slade J. in Liverpool and District Hospital For Diseases of the
Heart v. A.-G., [1981] 1 Ch. 193 at 209 as follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>          In  a  broad  sense a corporate body  may  no
          doubt aptly be said to hold its assets  as  a
          &#147;trustee&#148; for charitable purposes in any case
          where  the terms of its constitution place  a
          legally  binding restriction  upon  it  which
          obliges   it   to   apply  its   assets   for
          exclusively charitable purposes. In  a  broad
          sense  it may even be said, in such  a  case,
          that  the  company  is  not  the  &#147;beneficial
          owner&#148;   of   its  assets.  In  my  judgment,
          however, none of the authorities on which Mr.
          Mummery has relied, including the decision in
          Construction  Industry  Training   Board   v.
          Attorney  General [1973] Ch.  173,  establish
          that a company formed under the Companies Act
          1948 for charitable purposes is a trustee  in
          the strict sense of its corporate assets,  so
          that on a winding up these assets do not fall
          to  be  dealt  with  in accordance  with  the
          provisions  of s. 257 et seq.  of  that  Act.
          They  do,  in  my opinion, clearly  establish
          that   such  a  company  is  in  a   position
          analogous to that of a trustee in relation to
          its  corporate assets, such as ordinarily  to
          give rise to the jurisdiction of the court to
          intervene in its affairs; but that is quite a
          different matter. [Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[70] He went on to support this conclusion in part by reference
to the 1917 decision of the House of Lords in Bowman v. Secular
Society Ltd., 1917] A.C. 406, where it was held that a person who
gives a gift to a corporation does not do so in trust for the
objects of that corporation, even where the donor gave the gift
with certain objects in mind.
[71] Because of the trust-like obligations of the charitable
corporation, it is accepted that the court maintains its
supervisory scheme-making power whether a charity&#146;s legal form is
as a charitable trust or a charitable corporation: Liverpool
Hospital v. Attorney General, supra, at 213. This is to continue
to ensure that gifts made with charitable intent will not fail
even if the object of the gift is unclear or uncertain, or if the
gift is directed to a charitable corporation which is misnamed or
the corporation no longer exists: Re Vernon&#146;s Will Trusts (1962),
[1971] 3 All E.R.1061 (Ch.D.); Re Myers, [1951] 1 All E.R. 538
(Ch.D.); Re Morgan&#146;s Will Trusts, [1950] 1 All E.R. 1097 (Ch.D.);
Re Finger&#146;s Will Trusts, [1972] 1 Ch. 286; Re Buchanan Estate
(1995), 11 E.T.R. (2d) 8 (B.C.S.C.). This power of the court is
referred to as the cy-pres doctrine. It is described in the
Restatement of the Law of Trusts (2d) s. 399 as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If property is given in trust to be applied to a
	  particular charitable purpose, and it is or becomes
	  impossible or impracticable or illegal to carry out
	  the particular purpose, and if the settlor manifested
	  a more general intention to devote the property to
 	  charitable purposes, the trust will not fail but the
          court will direct the application of the property to
	  some charitable purpose which falls within the general
	  charitable intention of the settlor.10</pre>
    <pre>[72] It was in the context of a testamentary gift to a charity
which no longer existed under the same name that Buckley J.
discussed the nature of gifts to an incorporated and an
unincorporated charity in Re Vernon&#146;s Will Trusts, supra,:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Every bequest to an unincorporated charity by
          name  without more must take effect as a gift
          for a charitable purpose&#133;
          A  bequest to a corporate body, on the  other
          hand,  takes effect simply as a gift to  that
          body    beneficially,   unless   there    are
          circumstances  which show that the  recipient
          is  to take the gift as a trustee&#133;the natural
          construction is that the bequest is  made  to
          the  corporate  body as part of  its  general
          funds,  that  is  to  say,  beneficially  and
          without  the imposition of a trust.  (p.1064)
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[73] The issue of whether a gift was given &#147;in trust&#148; to an
incorporated charity has arisen in those cases in the context of
determining whether a testamentary gift can be saved which was
left to charity but with problems of interpreting the true intent
of the donor; specifically, whether a gift left to a named
corporate or unincorporated charity which either no longer
existed or which had changed its objects by the time the gift was
to take effect, was intended as a gift to that corporation or
charity or, alternatively, as a trust for the purposes of the
corporation or charity. For example, in Re Finger&#146;s Will Trusts,
supra, the testatrix left a share of the residue of her estate to
the National Radium Commission, an unincorporated body which had
ceased to exist, and to the National Council for Maternity and
Child Welfare, an incorporated body which had also ceased to
exist. The court viewed the situation in the following way:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Both gifts therefore fail unless they can  be
          supported as purpose gifts in which case they
          will  be applicable by way of scheme for  the
          indicated  purpose, and  if  either  or  both
          cannot   so  stand  there  remains  a   final
          question,   whether  the  will  discloses   a
          general  charitable intention, in which  case
          of   course  the  share  or  shares  will  be
          applicable  by scheme cy-pres, failing  which
          there is an intestacy. (p.294)</pre>
    <pre>[74] The public policy which the courts wish to implement is to
save charitable gifts and to apply them as far as possible to the
purposes intended by the donor: Lapointe v. Ontario, supra, at
208, Re Buchanan Estate, supra, at 15. To do that, the court can
determine that a gift was intended as a trust, even though left
to a corporate charity, in order to save the gift where the
particular corporate charity is no longer available to receive
the gift.
[75] Another example where that law was applied is the case of Re
ARMS (Multiple Sclerosis Research) Ltd., [1997] 2 All E.R. 679
(Ch. D.), which involved the winding-up of an incorporated
charity. The issue for the court to determine was whether gifts
which did not vest until after the charity was in liquidation
still took effect, and therefore would be used in the liquidation
for the payment of the debts of the charity, or whether the
liquidation meant that there was initial impossibility and the
court should propound a scheme. Neuberger J. held that a bequest
to a company takes effect as long as the company is still in
existence, whether in liquidation or not, so that even though the
company was no longer carrying out its charitable purposes, the
gift would not fail, unless it was given in trust. Presumably in
that circumstance, the court would apply cy-pres because the
charitable purpose for which the gift was given in trust was no
longer being carried out by the charity. The court rejected the
argument that the situation was analogous to the cases where a
gift was left as a special purpose trust but that purpose was no
longer being carried on, that is, initial impossibility: &#147;It
appears to me, however, that there is a clear difference between
a gift to a specific company, which still exists (albeit that it
is in liquidation), and a gift for a specific charitable purpose,
where that purpose no longer exists.&#148; (p. 684)11
[76] The authors of Tudor on Charities 8th ed. (1995), p. 159,
have extrapolated from this law the proposition that a charitable
company may hold particular property on trust for specific
charitable purposes, distinct from its other property, and that
&#147;clearly to misapply such property would be a breach of trust.&#148; I
agree with the authors of Tudor on Charities as to the
obligations of the charity when it accepts such a gift, but with
the following qualifications:  (a) as long as the charity is in
operation, and (b) subject to any cy-pres order of the court, the
charity would be obliged to use the funds for the purpose
stipulated by the trust.
[77] (a) Where a corporation is no longer in operation but is
wound up, s. 19 of the Winding Up and Restructuring Act provides:          </pre>
    <pre>          19.  A company, from the time of the making of a
	  winding-up order, shall cease to carry on its
	  business, except in so far as is, in the opinion
 	  of the liquidator, required for the beneficial
          winding-up thereof, but the corporate state and all
	  the corporate powers of the company, notwithstanding
	  that it is otherwise provided by the Act, charter or
	  instrument of incorporation of the company, continue
	  until the affairs of the company are wound up.</pre>
    <pre>Therefore, where a corporate charity is wound up, the charity  is
obliged to stop carrying out its charitable purposes in order  to
allow the liquidator to proceed to wind up the charity.</pre>
    <pre>[78] (b) The trustees may be required to seek approval of the
court to use the trust property for another purpose where the
purpose originally stipulated has become impossible or
impracticable to carry out. The second branch of the cy-pres
doctrine known as &#145;supervening impossibility&#146; (as opposed to
&#145;initial impossibility&#146;) applies where a particular object of a
charity becomes impossible or impracticable to carry out after
the gift for that purpose has vested in the charity. It is
succinctly described by Waters in the following passage:
          </pre>
    <pre>          When impossibility or impracticability occurs
	  after the instrument has taken effect, a so-called
	  supervening impossibility or impracticability has
	  occurred. In these circumstances the court now looks
	  to see whether the instrument of gift has given the
 	  property in question exclusively to the charitable
	  purpose. However, if there is an exclusive dedication,
          and the purpose can no longer be carried out because
	  of impossibility or impracticability, the property is
	  regarded as dedicated to charity, and passes to the
	  Crown in right of the province as the ultimate
	  protector of charity and charities. By long custom,
	  the Crown will now agree to the drawing up of a cy-
          pres scheme for the approval of the court.12</pre>
    <pre>[79]  We do not know to what extent large charitable corporations
accept donations to be held in perpetuity on trust for a
particular purpose within their charitable objects, and thereby
accept true trust obligations with respect to such donations.
Some of the issues that would confront the corporation if it were
prepared to accept a donation on such terms include: what would
be involved in keeping separate accounts, how and to what extent
other corporate funds could be used and applied to the operation
of the trust property, the effect of the application of other
funds from the charity to the purpose for its ongoing operation
or for other purposes.
[80] However, assuming that a corporate charity with multiple
objects will accept gifts on trust for special purposes, the
question that confronts this court is whether it would be a
breach of trust for the charity, or the liquidator standing in
the shoes of the charity, to allow such property to be used to
satisfy tort claims which did not arise in connection with that
property or the purpose for which that property was donated. Or,
stated in the context of exigibility, does the fact that such
property is held on trust for one charitable purpose of the
corporation mean that if the corporation incurs a liability for a
wrong done by the corporation but not in connection with that
particular charitable object, then that property is not exigible
because of the trust?
[81] I am satisfied that the answer to both questions is no for
the following reasons.
[82] First, the concept of vicarious liability is that the entire
corporation is responsible to the victim for the wrong which was
done, although it may have been committed by only one person for
whose actions that corporation is responsible. Judgment is
obtained against the corporation. All of its assets are
answerable for that judgment whether they are held beneficially
or on trust for the charitable purposes of the corporation,
including one or more of those purposes.
[83] Second, there exists no law of liability which requires that
the claims of a plaintiff be related to particular assets of a
corporation. Nor is it a part of the defence to establish in
relation to which of its objects the tort occurred. It would not
be an issue in an action against the charitable corporation for
the court to determine in connection with which asset or
charitable purpose the wrong occurred.  As I have tried to
demonstrate by some of the examples, the answer could be very
broad (the charitable purpose is a particular hospital) or very
narrow (the charitable purpose was one room, or one bed in the
hospital), depending on the interests of the parties.
[84] Third, there is no valid policy objective to introduce into
our law the concept of relating a wrong done by a charity to the
operation or administration of a particular endeavor of the
corporation in order to protect other assets of the charity from
responding to legitimate tort victims of the charity. In this
case, the potential result is that the assets of the charity
available to satisfy the tort claims will fall woefully short.
After the policy analysis recently carried out by the Supreme
Court of Canada in the Curry case, McLachlin J. concluded at p.
566, para. 54:  &#147;the suggestion that the victim must remain
remediless for the greater good smacks of crass and
unsubstantiated utilitarianism. Indeed, it is far from clear to
me that the &#145;net&#146; good produced by non-profit institutions
justifies the price placed on the individual victim, nor that
this is a fair way for society to order its resources.&#148;
[85] A major part of the concern traditionally asserted on behalf
of charitable institutions is that donors will be reluctant to
give if they believe that the donations will not be used for the
good works of the charity but rather to pay tort claims. Whether
or not this may be a more legitimate concern in recent years
where there have been several instances of large charities held
responsible for damage to large numbers of victims, both
charities and their donors may see the special charitable purpose
trust as a device to enable to them to segregate the assets of
the charity and to try in that way to make it difficult for tort
claimants to collect judgments from the assets of the charity.
This would be contrary to the policy conclusion of Curry and the
other decisions which rejected charitable immunity on the basis
that fairness requires that the victim be compensated out of the
assets of the charity.
[86] Fourth, would not the directors of the charitable
corporation find themselves in a hopeless conflict of interest,
given their obligations as directors to act in the best interests
of the entire charity including all of its objects, if in any
proceeding with the victims they attempted to protect the assets
of certain purposes at the expense of all of the other assets,
perhaps including some which also were not related to the wrong
which was perpetrated?
[87] Fifth, the purpose of the reference in recent case law
dealing with the disposition of certain charitable gifts, to the
concept of a testator leaving a gift as a special purpose trust
is not to immunize such gifts from liability to victims of
wrongdoing by the charity. It is to allow a court to apply the
doctrine of cy-pres to such a gift and, rather than have the gift
fail ab initio, the court may propound a scheme for the funds to
be used as closely as possible to the use the testator intended.
However, if there is no problem of interpretation and such a gift
becomes vested in the charity and used as directed, if the
charity is then wound up, the charity can no longer carry out any
of its purposes (s. 19 of the Winding-Up and Restructuring Act)
because it must cease its business except as required by the
liquidator for the winding up. In that case, all the purposes of
the charity including the special purpose have become impossible
for the charity to continue, except to pay the claims incurred by
the charity while it was operating.13 The court may be called on
to propound a scheme, however, if there is a surplus: Liverpool
and District Hospital for Diseases of the Heart v. Attorney
General, supra.
[88] One statement made by Slade J. in Liverpool requires comment
as it appears to revert to the concept that property held on
trust for charitable purposes is not exigible. He states at p.
205 that the &#147;surplus&#148; and the &#147;property of a company&#148; (under the
Companies Act 1948 (11 &amp;12 Geo. 6, c. 38)) &#147;will not&#133;comprise
assets of which the company at the date of its liquidation was
merely a trustee (in the strict sense) for third parties or for
charitable purposes, even though the legal title may have been
vested in it.&#148; This statement was not considered in the context
of the doctrine of no charitable immunity and the cases which
hold that the assets of a charitable trust are answerable to tort
claimants. Therefore, I do not read this statement as a
contradiction of those long-established principles.</pre>
    <pre>SUMMARY OF CONCLUSIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE EFFECT OF A SPECIAL
PURPOSE TRUST</pre>
    <pre>[89] The purpose of the recognition by courts of the possibility
that assets can be given to a charitable corporation on a special
purpose trust is to allow the courts to propound a scheme for the
gift, rather then have it fail if the corporation has been
misnamed or no longer exists. It was not to give immunity from
exigibility to such a gift in the hands of the charity.
[90] A wrong done to a tort victim by or on behalf of the charity
is done by or on behalf of all of its objects because the
corporation is a single legal entity for the purpose of vicarious
liability. The charitable objects are not severable as actors nor
as separate legal units individually vicariously liable. Nor are
the assets used in furtherance of particular objects referable to
particular tortious conduct in any legally relevant way.
[91] Because assets held for charitable purposes are not immune
from execution on the &#147;trust theory&#148;, assets held for one or more
than one of the charitable purposes of the corporation are
answerable for the obligation of the corporation as a whole to
tort claimants, once that obligation is established.
[92] To the extent that charitable corporations do accept
donations in trust for one of their charitable purposes, as
opposed to in the form of a precatory trust, or a non-trust
agreement governing the conditions and use of the gift, the trust
obliges the charity to use the donation only for the specific
objects of the trust while the charity is operating, again
subject to any court order that may be sought for cy-pres if
while the charity itself continues to operate, that purpose or
object becomes impossible or impracticable to continue. If the
charity, while still operating, determined that it was in the
best interests of the charity to use the assets held on special
purpose trust instead of other assets to pay tort claims, that
may be a situation where the charity would seek the approval of
the court for the scheme, if the consequence would be that the
particular purpose would no longer be carried out by the charity.
[93] When a corporation is wound up, the &#147;business&#148; of the
corporation ceases except insofar as in the opinion of the
liquidator is required for the beneficial winding up. (s. 19 of
the Winding up and Restructuring Act). Where the corporation is a
charity, this means that the charity ceases to carry out its
charitable purposes. The obligation of the charity to use assets
held on trust for one or more of the trust purposes also ceases
as it may no longer carry on. If there is a surplus after the
completion of the winding-up, then the assets can be applied cy-
pres to another charity with similar purposes.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION ON THE EXIGIBILITY ISSUE</pre>
    <pre>[94] For the purposes of this winding-up procedure, all assets of
the CBIC, whether owned beneficially or on trust for one or more
charitable purposes, are exigible and may be used by the
liquidator to pay the claims of the tort victims.
[95] However, the liquidator is free, in accordance with its
obligations, to seek the advice and assistance of the court in
respect of any particular asset where there remains an issue with
respect to its ownership or exigibility.</pre>
    <pre>THE JURISDICTION ISSUE</pre>
    <pre>[96] The liquidator appeals from para. 5 of the Order of Blair J.
which provides:</pre>
    <pre>          THIS  COURT  ORDERS AND DIRECTS that  nothing
          contained in the Reasons of Blair J. released
          February  27,  1998  in this  matter  or  the
          within  Order  is  intended  to  affect   the
          determination by the British Columbia Supreme
          Court   of  the  questions  raised   in   the
          Petitions in that Court with respect to which
          leave  was  granted by Order of  the  Ontario
          Court  (General  Division)  on  November  14,
          1997.</pre>
    <pre>and from the portions of the Reasons for Judgment upon which that
paragraph was based.</pre>
    <pre>[97] The liquidator&#146;s concern is the intent and extent of that
parapraph and its effect on the findings of the court and on the
balance of the order. The liquidator&#146;s position is that the
rulings of the winding up court are applicable and enforceable by
the liquidator throughout Canada and are therefore binding in all
jurisdictions and in respect of all assets. The winding up court
cannot limit the effect of its own decisions.
[98] The question whether paragraph 5 of the Order was necessary,
as the same statement was made in the Reasons for Judgment, or
whether as a middle position, it should have been placed in the
preamble to the Order, was considered in an Endorsement of Blair
J. dated June 1, 1998. He determined that in substance it made no
difference because the determination had already been made and
included in the Reasons, but that on balance, the paragraph
should go into the body of the Order.
[99] In my view, Blair J.&#146;s intent in paragraph 5 is clear. He
made the Order under s. 21 of the Winding-Up and Restructuring
Act allowing representatives for the two British Columbia schools
to bring petitions in the Supreme Court of British Columbia for
the court to determine how their shares are held and the
ownership of those shares for the purposes of the winding-up.
Although there was a substantial record before the winding-up
court on the history of the schools and of their shares, he noted
that that record was incomplete. As the British Columbia court
would have before it the complete record, its factual findings
with respect to the issue before it would be based on that full
record.
[100]     I am satisfied that Blair J.&#146;s intent was to reassure
those involved in the British Columbia proceedings that any
statements about the history of the schools and their
shareholdings in his reasons for judgment were not intended to be
taken as determinative of the issues which were to be litigated
in the British Columbia court. The reason I say reassure, is
because this would be the legal result, whether or not this
statement was made by the judge in his reasons.
[101]     However, this statement in the Reasons and paragraph in
the Order are not intended to have the effect of making any of
the other findings or determinations in the Reasons and the Order
any less binding. As an example, paragraph 1 of the Order
provides:      </pre>
    <pre>      THIS  COURT  ORDERS AND DECLARES that the  intent
      and  legal  effect of &#145;An Act to Incorporate  the
      Christian  Brother  of  Ireland  in  Canada&#148;,  11
      Elizabeth   II,  Chap.  22  is  to  establish   a
      corporate  body  which is the  civil  law  entity
      through   which  the  Congregation  of  Christian
      Brothers  (&#147;Congregation&#148;) conducts its  temporal
      affairs in Canada and that the Corporation is  in
      all  respects the temporal identity and actor  of
      the Congregation in Canada.
      
</pre>
    <pre>This determination was made and has effect for all purposes
within the liquidation, and is equally effective in respect of
all assets of the corporation, wherever situated.</pre>
    <pre>[102]     In my view, paragraph 5 as part of the Order is
unnecessary and should be struck out. It is unclear who is
ordered and directed in that paragraph. It would not be another
court. However, the Reasons for Judgment which seek to clarify
that the British Columbia court is free to make its factual
determinations regarding the ownership and shareholding of the
two British Columbia schools, are a proper statement of the role
of any specific finding of fact by Blair J. on those issues.:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I agree  that  the  winding-up court  must  be
	  cautious in this respect, and  I  wish to make
	  it  clear  that  nothing  contained  in  these
	  reasons and the  order  providing  advice  and
	  directions emanating from them is  intended to
	  affect  the  determination   by   the  British
 	  Columbia   Supreme  Court  of   the  questions
	  raised in the Petitions  in  that  Court  with
	  respect to  which leave  was  granted in  this
	  Court&#146;s Order of November 14, 1997.
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is  inevitable,  though,  that  some  of
          the directions given here, in response to the
          questions  posed by Justice Houlden&#146;s  order,
          will  have a bearing on the way in which  the
          findings of the British Columbia court &#150; once
          those  determinations have been made  &#150;  will
          fit into the winding-up proceedings regarding
          the  Christian Brothers of Ireland in Canada.
          I  am  satisfied that the state of the record
          before   me  justifies  proceeding  to   that
          extent, in the interests of all concerned and
          the  effective administration of that estate.
          (p.376)</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[103]     The issues faced by the liquidator in this winding-up
procedure caused it to seek the direction of the court on broad
questions with respect to the application of the assets of the
charity to its obligations to tort victims. As well-meaning as
this exercise may have been, in my view it is not a path upon
which the court ought to be asked to embark. The role of a court
is to pronounce on legal issues in the context of facts found
based on evidence. That evidence and those facts form the
framework within which the law is developed. The liquidator
should seek the advice of the court only in respect of the
particular assets about which there is a factual or legal issue
or dispute, and present the facts to the court upon which the law
is to be determined and applied.</pre>
    <pre>RESULT</pre>
    <pre>[104]     The appeal is allowed in part. Paragraph 2, Question 2,
Answer 6 of the Order is struck out. The fact that any asset is
held by the corporation on trust does not affect its exigibility
in respect of the claims of the tort victims of the CBIC.
Paragraph 5 of the Order is struck out but the Reasons for
Judgment of Blair J. referred to in para. [102] above are
approved.

                                        &#147;I agree R. S. Abella J.A.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A. (Concurring):</pre>
    <pre>[105]     I agree with the reasons of Blair J. with one
significant exception.  After holding that property held by a
charitable corporation by way of a charitable purposes trust may
be exigible to answer tort claims, he added this important
qualification:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; Exigibility of such property depends upon whether the wrong
has been perpetrated within the framework of the particular
charitable purpose in question, as I have earlier delineated it.
I do not think that tort claims legitimately asserted against one
specific charitable purpose property can be asserted against
other specific charitable purpose properties that may be held by
the same charitable corporation.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[106]     While the distinction drawn by Blair J. is an
attractive one, I do not think it is tenable in the context of a
winding-up of a charitable corporation.  The winding-up process
sounds the end of the charitable corporation.  It ceases to carry
on any and all of the charitable purposes it formerly served.
Its obligation to use particular property to further specific
charitable purposes must also terminate.  A winding-up is a time
for a final accounting.  That accounting should look at the
charitable corporation as a single whole entity and not as a
number of separate pieces each with its own set of obligations
and assets.
[107]     Blair J. correctly observed that the determination of
the extent to which property held by a charitable corporation by
way of a charitable purpose trust should be exigible to satisfy
tort claims is ultimately a matter of equity (398-399 O.R.).  The
practical and policy considerations effectively marshalled by my
colleague, Feldman J.A. at paras. 61-66 and 84-85 satisfy me
that, in the context of a winding-up, equity favours making all
property held by the charitable corporation by way of charitable
purpose trusts available to answer legitimate tort claims arising
out of the corporation&#146;s pursuit of its charitable purposes.
[108]     I concur in the result reached by Feldman J.A.</pre>

et seq.
5  In  Duncan v. Findlater, supra, the plaintiff was injured  and
his  son  killed when their carriage struck a pile of rocks  left
negligently  in the middle of a highway by repairmen  working  on
the  adjacent  ditch.  He sued for damages against  the  trustees
charged  with the maintenance of the highway.  The trustees  were
appointed under an act which specified that they were to use  the
highway  toll  monies  for making, improving  and  repairing  the
highways,  but &quot;to no other purposes whatsoever&quot; (p.939).    Lord
Cottenham  found  that  the  workmen were  not  servants  of  the
trustees  and  the trustees were not personally  liable  for  the
damage.  Furthermore, there could be no resort to the trust funds
because this was not intention of the legislature in creating the
trust.  He stated:</pre>
    <pre>     It is impossible to suppose that the framers of this
     statute contemplated that any part of this fund would
     be appropriated for the purpose of affording
     compensation for any act of the persons who might be
     employed under the authority of the trustees.  If the
     thing is done within the statute, it is clear that no
     compensation can be afforded for any damage sustained
     thereby, except so far as the statute itself has
     provided it; and this is clear on the legal presumption
     that the act creating damage being within the statute
     must be a lawful act.  On the other hand, if the thing
     done is not within the statute, either from the party
     doing it having exceeded the powers conferred on him by
     the statute, or from the manner in which he has thought
     fit to perform the work, why should the public fund be
     liable to make good his private error or misconduct?</pre>
    <pre>Similar  facts  led to an even broader expression  of  charitable
immunity in Holliday v. St. Leonard's, Shoreditch, supra.   Here,
the  trustees of the parish had instructed workmen  to  repair  a
street.  The workmen negligently left a pile of paving stones  in
the  middle  of  street, which the plaintiff's carriage  promptly
struck.   The carriage overturned and the plaintiff was  injured.
Relying  on  Duncan  v.  Findlater, Erle J.  held  that  &quot;persons
intrusted  with the performance of a public duty, discharging  it
gratuitously, and themselves taking no personal share in the mode
of its performance, are exempted from liability for the negligent
acts of persons employed by them.&quot;

13 It would be facetious to argue that the winding up itself makes
the specific purpose impossible to carry out and that the assets,
without the liabilities, should be applied cy-pres to allow the
charitable purpose to be continued, free of the liabilities of
the corporation. This would wholly undermine the winding-up
process and its purpose.</pre></td>
