</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant served as the banker to
Mr. A. Obront, the perpetrator of a massive fraudulent telemarketing scheme
wherein many victims in the United States were induced to purchase gemstones at
inflated prices. Mr. Obront pled guilty and received a sentence of 4 years in
penitentiary. A forfeiture order was also made. One of the assets ordered
forfeited to the Crown was a U.S. dollar bank account at the Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce (C.I.B.C.) in the amount of U.S. $28,809.37 in the name
of  Royal International Collectibles
(R.I.C.) the corporate vehicle of Mr. Obront. The bank account had been frozen
by order of Roberts J. made on January 20, 1997 and served on the bank on
January 21, 1997. The bank appeals that portion of the forfeiture order.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The forfeiture order was made by Kelly
J. on October 30, 1998. The portion of his reasons dealing with the issue are
as follows:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>            As
far as the U.S. account is concerned, I must confess, this gave me more
difficulty than some of the other issues. There is a Personal Property Security
Act security which was taken by the bank, apparently in good faith, and among
other assets, this U.S. account, formed part of the security. On the other
hand, there is no doubt that the proceeds, which the bank is claiming out of
this account, are proceeds of crime and as such, cannot be given or dealt with
given as security by Mr. Obront.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The sections of the <i>Code </i>which allow these orders to be made
are ss. 462.37(1) and (2) which provide: </span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>462.37 (1) Subject to this
section and sections 462.39 and 462.41, where an offender is convicted or discharged
under section 730 of an enterprise crime offence and the court imposing
sentence on the offender, on application of the Attorney General, is satisfied,
on a balance of probabilities, that any property is proceeds of crime and that
the enterprise crime offence was committed in relation to that property, the
court shall order that the property be forfeited to Her Majesty to be disposed
of as the Attorney General directs or otherwise dealt with in accordance with
the law.</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>(2)  Where the evidence does not establish to the satisfaction of the
court that the enterprise crime offence of which the offender is convicted or
discharged under section 730 was committed in relation to property in respect
of which an order of forfeiture would otherwise be made under subsection (1)
but the court is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that that property is
proceeds of crime, the court may make an order of forfeiture under subsection
(1) in relation to that property.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      Section 462.41 requires
that before a forfeiture order is made, notice must be given to any person
“who, in the opinion of the court, appears to have a valid interest in the
property.” Section 462.41(3) says:  </span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-top:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'>462.41 (3) Where
a court is satisfied that any person, other than</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>(a)       a person who is charged with, or was convicted of, an
enterprise crime offence or a designated substance offence, or</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>(b)       a person who acquired title to or a right of possession of
that property from a person referred to in paragraph (a) under circumstances
that give rise to a reasonable inference that the title or right was
transferred for the purpose of avoiding the forfeiture of the property,</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE>is the lawful owner or is lawfully
entitled to possession of any property or any part thereof that would otherwise
be forfeited pursuant to subsection 462.37(1) or 462.38(2) and that the person
appears innocent of any complicity in an offence referred to in paragraph (a)
or of any collusion in relation to such an offence, the court may order that
the property or part thereof be returned to that person.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The appellant’s position
is that it has a valid interest in the bank account and that Kelly&nbsp;J.
erred by ordering the monies in the account forfeited to the Crown. First, the
bank submits that Kelly J. erred by holding that because the “proceeds” in the
account are proceeds of crime, they could not be given as security by the
perpetrator of the fraud. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-GB>      The appellant’s  submission is correct. The bank was a
secured creditor of R.I.C. pursuant to a security agreement dated May 2, 1995
and registered under the <i>Personal
Property Security Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 10 (P.P.S.A.), which agreement
secured credit facilities provided to R.I.C. by the bank. The Crown’s
submission is that s. 11 of the P.P.S.A. provides that a security interest only
attaches when the debtor acquires rights in the collateral, and that R.I.C.
never acquired rights in the funds of the victims because the funds were
obtained by fraud, an application of the <i>nemo
dat</i> rule, which says essentially that you cannot give what you do not have.
The argument is that R.I.C. never acquired any interest in the funds of the
victims because they were obtained by fraud. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Crown relies on the case of <i>Chrysler Credit Canada Ltd. v. MVL Leasing
Ltd.</i> (1993), 5 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 92 (Ont.Ct. Gen.Div.).That case involved a stolen car, and is distinguishable form the
case at bar. There was never any intent by the owner of the car to transfer
ownership to the rogue. In this case, the victims of the gem scam did not know
they were victims and intended to forward their funds to R.I.C. in exchange for
the gemstones which they received. The interest of R.I.C. in the funds was
voidable but not void <i>ab initio</i>. The
security interest of the bank was therefore able to attach to the funds
deposited into the account.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Because of the trial judge’s error, he
did not go on to consider whether to exercise his discretion under s. 462.41 of
the <i>Code</i> and allow the bank to retain
for itself the balance in the bank account. On appeal, this court may exercise
the discretion conferred by that section on the sentencing judge: (ss.686(8)
and s.462.44 of the <i>Code</i>).</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant further submits that the
funds in the account are not proceeds of crime or at least part are not. The
evidence disclosed that the way the account operated was that the cheques from
the victims in U.S. funds were deposited into the account, and R.I.C. was
permitted by the bank to immediately withdraw the funds, usually by
transferring them first to its Canadian dollar operations account. If a cheque
from a victim was subsequently dishonoured, R.I.C. would then owe that amount
as a debt to the bank. That debt was secured by the general security agreement
in respect of whatever funds were in the account.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At the close of the day on the date
that the order was made freezing the account, January 20, 1997, the account
balance stood at U.S. $1,491.27. The order was served on the bank on January
21, 1997. The time of service is not in evidence. On January 21, the account
went into a debit balance as the amount represented by one returned cheque,
presumably from a victim, was deducted (U.S. $13,664.50), together with U.S.
$7,000 as a debit in error, corrected the next day by a credit memo. However,
there was also a deposit into the account on January 21, in the amount of U.S.
$41,014.08. This deposit included cheques from 7 victims.  At the end of January 21, the balance in the
account was U.S. $21, 860.77, rising to U.S. $28,860.77 the next day after the
credit memo for U.S. $7,000. The bank deducted some service charges by the end
of the month, leaving the total showing in the frozen account  as U.S. $28,809.37 on January 31, 1997. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>However, one of the victims’ cheques
in the amount of U.S. $13,640, which was deposited on January 21, 1997 as part
of the U.S. $41,014. was subsequently dishonoured. The bank submits that that
amount, U.S. $13,640., although shown as in the account as of the date the
account was frozen, was not victims’ money, but the bank’s money, in effect
loaned to R.I.C. in accordance with the normal operation of the account, and is
therefore not proceeds of crime. That analysis was also accepted by the
forensic accounting expert called by the Attorney General to give evidence at
the forfeiture hearing.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Because the U.S. $13,640  is not proceeds of crime, we agree that it
cannot be the subject of a forfeiture order. However, the balance of the funds
deposited into the account on January 21, 1997, U.S. $27,374.08, is clearly
proceeds of crime and represents the cheques of six identifiable new victims. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The bank takes the position that the
most that can be forfeited is the closing account balance at January 21 of U.S.
$28,809.37 minus U.S. $13,640 for the dishonoured cheque, leaving U.S.
$15,169.37. That approach effectively allows the bank to use part of the new
victims’ money, deposited on January 21, 1997, to make up the overdraft into
which the account had fallen on that day, as a result of the dishonour of
another cheque from an earlier date. 
(U.S. $13,644.50)</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The court has a discretion under s.
462.41 of the <i>Code </i>whether to return
part of any proceeds of crime to an innocent 
person with an interest in those proceeds. Although we are satisfied
that the bank has a security interest in all the monies in the account pursuant
to its security agreement, we would not exercise the court’s discretion in
favour of the bank in these circumstances in respect of any of the
U.S.$27,374.08 of new victims’ money deposited on January 21, 1997. Those
monies are identifiable proceeds of crime which should be returned to the victims.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In the result, the order of Kelly J.
is set aside, and instead, an order will go forfeiting to the Crown the amount
of U.S. $27,374.08. The balance shown in the account of  U.S. $1,435.29 is to be returned to the bank.</span></p>
