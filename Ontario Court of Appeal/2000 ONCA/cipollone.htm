    <pre>HEARD:         January 17, 2000</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Howden J., with a jury,
dated October 16, 1996.

    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]    The  appellant  submits  that  the  trial  judge  did  not
adequately present the factual background underlying the  defence
of  provocation.  In particular, he submits that the trial  judge
did  not make it clear that, in considering whether there was  an
act  or  insult and whether the appellant acted all of a  sudden,
the  jury  had  to  take  into  account  the  background  of  the
matrimonial  dispute  between the appellant  and  the  deceased&#146;s
daughter.</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  trial judge had fully reviewed the evidence, including
the appellant&#146;s testimony.  The jury could have no doubt that the
quarrel witnessed by the deceased was anchored in the matrimonial
dispute.   The trial judge told the jury expressly that they  had
to  consider  the  position of an ordinary  person  in  the  same
situation  or  circumstances  as the  appellant.   There  was  no
objection to the charge or the further charge on this basis.   We
are  satisfied that the jury would have appreciated  the  factual
circumstances  underlying  the defence  and  that  there  was  no
misdirection.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  appellant also submits that the trial judge  erred  in
directing  the jury with respect to s.34(2) of the Criminal  Code
that  self-defence under that subsection was unavailable  if  the
appellant was the aggressor.  The central factual dispute in this
case  was  whether  the  appellant or the deceased&#146;s  wife  first
introduced the hammer into the altercation.  Realistically, self-
defence  was not available if the appellant first introduced  the
hammer  into the altercation.  It was open to the trial judge  to
assist the jury by focusing them on the central factual and legal
issues  upon which the defence depended.  We are satisfied  that,
in the circumstances, there was no misdirection.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
