      <pre><b>On appeal from the conviction imposed by The Honourable Mr.

      <pre><b>                      ENDORSEMENT</b></pre>
      <pre>[1]  At the conclusion of argument in this appeal, we indicated
that, for reasons to follow, the appeal from conviction was
dismissed but the appeal from sentence was allowed and the
sentence reduced to time served.
     </pre>
      <pre>THE CONVICTION APPEAL        </pre>
      <pre>The non-existent letter</pre>
      <pre>[2]  Approximately five years elapsed between the time of the
alleged offence and the trial.  In reviewing the position of the
defence, the trial judge pointed out to the jury that it was a
position of the defence that, while the complainant may be honest
and credible, the issue was whether her evidence was reliable and
that “she may well believe after five years that this happened”.
The trial judge then told the jury that, in addition to the
complainant’s own testimony, there was the letter that she wrote
a year after the event to her best friend and the statement to
the investigating officer.
[3]  The reference to a letter was an error.  There was no such
letter and it became apparent during the objections to the charge
that there was some confusion with another case.  In any event,
the trial judge immediately recalled the jury and told the jury
that there was no evidence of that letter and they should
disregard that reference in his charge.  While it might have been
preferable for the trial judge to have been clearer as to the
origin of the mistake, we are satisfied that the appellant was
not prejudiced.  There was a great deal of other evidence,
admitted without objection, that the complainant had told her
friend and others and finally the police what had happened
relatively soon after the event.  The trial judge’s recharge was
adequate in the circumstances.
          </pre>
      <pre>The charge on the elements of the offence</pre>
      <pre>[4]  The appellant argues that the trial judge did not give the
jury sufficient direction as to the meaning of position of trust
in s.153 of the Criminal Code.  The trial judge reviewed at
considerable length the evidence to be considered on this issue
and, in particular, drew the jury’s attention to the age
difference and the nature of the relationship, which were the
important factors on the facts of this case.  The trial judge at
certain points referred to the appellant as the complainant’s
“uncle”.  This was not an entirely accurate description of the
family relationship but was consistent with some of the
complainant’s prior statements, which were put to her in cross-
examination by counsel for the appellant and he raised no
objection to these references in the charge to the jury.  In the
particular circumstances of this case and given the real issues
in the case, the charge was adequate.
          </pre>
      <pre>Comment on the failure to testify</pre>
      <pre>[5]  In reviewing the position of the defence, the trial judge
referred to the defence position that the appellant had the right
to remain silent, that there was no case to meet and the jury
should not draw any negative inference from the fact that he had
not testified.  While this type of comment should be avoided, in
context it could not possibly have prejudiced the appellant.
          </pre>
      <pre>Credit and reliability</pre>
      <pre>[6]  The appellant argues that the trial judge did not make it
clear that the issue in the case was not the sincerity of the
complainant, but the reliability of her evidence.  We are
satisfied that the charge was adequate in the circumstances.
When the charge is considered as a whole, especially the trial
judge’s review of the evidence and the defence position, the jury
would clearly have understood that the reliability of the
complainant’s description of the events was the critical factor.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.
     </pre>
      <pre>THE SENTENCE APPEAL</pre>
      <pre>[8]  The trial judge sentenced the appellant to one year
imprisonment and three years probation.  The appellant had spent
nine and one-half months in pre-trial custody.  Given the
appellant’s record and that he was on probation at the time, we
agree that it was open to the trial judge to impose a further
period of imprisonment.  However, the trial judge erred in
principle in placing undue emphasis on the record.  While the
appellant was certainly not entitled to any leniency, the
sentence imposed had to be proportionate to what actually
occurred.  This was a relatively minor example of this offence.
In effect, the appellant touched the complainant from behind and
touched her hip or thigh.  Both parties were fully clothed and
the touching was very brief.  The context and the conduct was far
removed from cases such as R. v. Audet (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d)
481 (S.C.C.).
[9]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal
allowed and the sentence reduced to time served.</pre>
