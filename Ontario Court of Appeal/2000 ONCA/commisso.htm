</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the disposition of Matlow J. dated June 5, 1997.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondents are charged in the United States with two
counts of conspiracy.  The first alleges that they conspired to
distribute and possess with intent to distribute a quantity of
heroin.  The second alleges that they conspired to import heroin
into the United States.
[2]  The appellant, the United States of America, seeks to
extradite the respondents from Canada to stand trial on these
charges.  After conducting a hearing under the Extradition Act,
R.S.C. 1985, c. E-23,  Matlow J. found that there was strong
evidence that the respondent, Vincenzo Commisso, trafficked in
heroin in the United States and that all of the respondents
conspired to traffic heroin in Canada.  However, he found that
there was insufficient evidence to establish either a prima facie
case of a conspiracy in the United States, or that one of the
objects of the conspiracy was to import heroin into the United
States.  The only evidence of conspiracy, he found, showed the
commission of an offence totally within Canada that had no
reasonable connection to the United States.  He therefore ordered
that the respondents be discharged.
[3]  This is an appeal by the United States from that order.  The
appellant argues that the extradition judge misinterpreted the
test for committal under s. 18(1)(b) of the Act.  Under that
section an extradition judge is required to assume that the
impugned conduct took place in Canada and to determine if the
evidence establishes a prime facie case that the fugitive
committed an extradition crime according to the laws of Canada.
In making this assessment  the court is not to concern itself
with whether the evidence establishes the foreign charge or with
whether the foreign court has jurisdiction to try the charge
should extradition be ordered.
[4]  The appellant argues that the extradition judge made three
errors in applying s.18(1)(b):
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)  He made the assessment under s. 18(1)(b) on the assumption
that what occurred in the United States occurred in Canada and
vice versa, rather than assuming that all of the impugned conduct
occurred in Canada.
(b)  He narrowed his assessment under Canadian law to only the
&#147;approximate equivalent Canadian offences&#148; to those charged in
the United States rather than considering any Canadian
extradition offence.
(c)  Alternatively, he based his assessment on the failure of the
appellant to establish the American offences rather than
determining if the conduct established a prima facie case of any
Canadian extradition offence.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[5]  I am satisfied that the extradition judge made each of these
errors in interpreting and applying the test under s.18(1)(b).  I
am also satisfied that  if this court applies the proper test to
the evidence, a warrant of committal should issue for each of the
respondents.
[6]  In addition to opposing the appeal on the merits, the
respondents apply for an order either dismissing the appeal or
staying the extradition proceedings because of the delay of 25
months from the time of filing of the notice of appeal until the
argument of the appeal.  This delay, they contend, violated their
rights under s. 7 of the Charter.  The respondents did not lead
evidence alleging that the delay would affect the fairness of the
proceedings against them.  In the absence of evidence of
prejudice of this kind, I would deny this application.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The evidence in support of the request for extradition was
introduced by way of affidavits.  There were no cross-
examinations on those affidavits, nor was there any evidence
called by the respondents.
[8]  On March 8, 1993, Vincenzo Riverso, a cooperating witness
working with the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation,
met with the respondent Vincenzo Commisso, at the Café Bruno in
Brooklyn, New York.  Vincenzo Commisso told Riverso that he had
brown heroin available for sale at a price of $100,000.00 per
kilo.  On the following day, he gave Riverso a tin foil wrapped
sample that tested positive for heroin.  Riverso told Vincenzo
Commisso that he would buy a half kilo.
[9]  Vincenzo Commisso and Riverso had further meetings in
Brooklyn later in March during which Vincenzo Commisso introduced
Riverso to a man called Tony, who was to be present for the
proposed heroin deal.  On March 30 Riverso met Tony and purchased
a half kilo of heroin for $50,000.00.  Tony told Riverso that he
had been working for Vincenzo Commisso for 17 years and if there
was any problem, Riverso should talk to Vincenzo Commisso.
[10] On May 6, 1993, Vincenzo Commisso called Riverso at his home
in Brooklyn and asked him to come to Canada to meet with him.  He
told Riverso he would be able to provide heroin to him in Canada
at a lower price than in the United States.  On May 13, Vincenzo
Commisso called again and made  the same request.
[11] On August 17, 1993, the two met at the Café Bruno in
Brooklyn.  Vincenzo Commisso told Riverso that he had heroin in
Canada but that he did not want to transport it to New York.  He
quoted prices and told Riverso how to carry the heroin in his
possession on an airplane without being detected.  In late
September, Vincenzo Commisso again called Riverso at his home in
Brooklyn and once again asked him to come to Canada.  He repeated
that Riverso could purchase heroin at a lesser cost in Canada
than in New York.
[12] In October, Riverso flew to Toronto accompanied by
undercover FBI agents.  On October 13, Vincenzo Commisso met
Riverso and drove him to a house at 21 Nada Crescent in
Woodbridge, Ontario.  Vincenzo Commisso went into the house,
alone.  When he returned to the car he told Riverso that he had
just spoken with the person from whom he was getting the heroin
and that he would return and get a sample later.
[13] The two men went to a bar where they met Vincenzo Commisso&#146;s
cousin, the respondent Rocco Commisso.  The three of them drove
back to 21 Nada Crescent.  Vincenzo and Rocco Commisso went into
the house.  When they returned, Vincenzo Commisso handed Riverso
a small aluminum sample that subsequently tested positive for
heroin.  Vincenzo Commisso said that the supplier had only 12
ounces, which Riverso could purchase for $70,000.00.  Riverso was
prepared to proceed but this deal eventually fell through.
Vincenzo and Rocco Commisso told Riverso that they were unable to
get the heroin because the police were searching the house of the
person from whom they were to obtain it.
[14] An FBI agent who accompanied Riverso on this trip
subsequently learned that the respondent Cosimo D&#146;Agostino
resided at 21 Nada Crescent and that local police had conducted a
search of his house on October 13.
[15] On November 10, 1993, Rocco Commisso called Riverso at his
home in Brooklyn.  Riverso said he would come to Canada again,
but that the heroin must be ready.  Riverso travelled to Toronto
and on November 22 he met Rocco Commisso at Bloomingdale Dry
Cleaners in Toronto and gave him $80,000.00 in U.S. funds as up
front &#147;buy money.&#148;  Rocco Commisso left with the money.  He
returned later and gave the money, less $2,380.00, back to
Riverso.  He explained that the supplier was concerned that the
money was counterfeit and had taken the $2,380.00 to check it.
Shortly afterwards, Riverso left and returned to Brooklyn without
completing the heroin transaction.
[16] Two days later, Rocco Commisso called Riverso and told him
that if he had stayed another few minutes, he would have shown up
with &#147;that guy&#148; and the deal could have been completed.  Rocco
Commisso offered to pay Riverso&#146;s expenses to return to Canada to
complete the deal.
[17] In mid-December, Riverso spoke on the telephone from
Brooklyn to Rocco Commisso.  Rocco Commisso said he was with &#147;a
friend of mine&#148; and put D&#146;Agostino on the phone.  D&#146;Agostino said
that he felt badly about the last time and that if Riverso had
waited around a little longer the deal could have been completed.
Riverso discussed his proposed return to Canada to complete the
heroin transaction with both Rocco Commisso and D&#146;Agostino.
[18] In early January of 1994, Riverso travelled to Toronto for
the third time.  On January 6, he had lunch with Rocco Commisso
and D&#146;Agostino.  Riverso was provided with two samples which
field tested positive for heroin.  The following day, Riverso met
Rocco Commisso and D&#146;Agostino at Bloomingdale Cleaners.
D&#146;Agostino asked for the buy money in advance.  Riverso refused.
D&#146;Agostino left and returned with the respondent Matthew Szabo
who aggressively demanded the buy money in advance.  Riverso
again refused. Eventually, Riverso agreed to show them the buy
money.  He showed $77,620.00 in U.S. funds to Rocco Commisso,
D&#146;Agostino and Szabo.
[19] D&#146;Agostino and Szabo counted the money.  D&#146;Agostino left to
get the heroin while the other three waited.  While they were
waiting, Szabo told Riverso that he could get Riverso all the
heroin he needed.  D&#146;Agostino returned and gave Riverso a package
that contained 435 grams of heroin.  D&#146;Agostino and Szabo then
left with the money.
[20] Subsequently, Riverso had a number of phone conversations
from Brooklyn with Vincenzo Commisso, Rocco Commisso and
D&#146;Agostino regarding a further purchase of heroin.  However, no
further deals were completed.
[21] Indictments were returned by the grand jury in the Southern
District of New York on June 12, 1996 charging (and I will
paraphrase) that from October 1992 until the date of the
indictment, in the Southern District of New York and elsewhere,
the respondents conspired with each other and other persons known
and unknown to import heroin into the United States and to
distribute and possess with the intent to distribute heroin, both
contrary to certain sections in Title 21 of the United States
Code.
[22] The United States District Court issued warrants for the
arrest of the respondents.  As the respondents were in Canada,
the appellant made requests to Canada for their extradition under
the provisions of the Extradition Treaty between the two
countries.
[23] The respondents were arrested in Canada on warrants issued
under the Extradition Act.  Matlow J., sitting as an extradition
judge, conducted an extradition hearing and on June 5, 1997, he
ordered that the respondents be discharged.</pre>
    <pre>Issue No. 1 &#150; The Extradition Judge Erred in Applying the
Test Under s. 18(1)(b)</pre>
    <pre>a)     The Extradition Process</pre>
    <pre>[24] When Canada enters into an extradition treaty it assumes
reciprocal obligations with the other contracting country to
surrender persons found within Canada under the provisions in the
treaty.  Extradition treaties set out the obligations of the
contracting states to one another.
[25] Canada&#146;s extradition treaty with the United States
recognizes that the domestic procedures of the country from which
extradition is requested should be used to implement those
obligations.1  The internal extradition process in Canada is
governed by the Extradition Act.2  It should be noted that the
Act under which Matlow J. conducted the committal hearing (the
&#147;old Act&#148;) has since been replaced by the Extradition Act, R.S.
1999, ch. 18 (the &#147;new Act&#148;).  Section 129 of the new Act repeals
the old Act, but s. 84 provides that the old Act still applies to
extradition cases in which the hearing was begun prior to the new
Act coming into force.  That provision applies to this case, and
therefore any references to the &#147;Extradition Act&#148; (&#147;the Act&#148;)
below should be taken to be references to the old Act.
[26] The Act establishes a two-step process for determining
whether a fugitive should be surrendered to a foreign state.  The
first step is judicial in nature. Under s. 13 of the Act, the
extradition hearing is conducted by an extradition judge and is
to be conducted in a manner similar to a preliminary hearing.
Section 16 permits evidence to be received by way of deposition
taken in a foreign state.  After conducting a hearing, the
extradition judge determines whether a case has been made out
under the test in s. 18(1) of the Act.  If not, the fugitive is
discharged.  If a case for committal is made out, s. 19 of the
Act provides that the judge issues a warrant of committal and
sends a certificate of the committal, a copy of the evidence
taken at the hearing and such report on the case as the judge
thinks fit to the Minister of Justice.
[27] The second step of the extradition process involves the
executive branch of government.  The Minister of Justice makes
the final decision whether the fugitive will be surrendered to
the requesting state.  This executive decision-making phase is
the mechanism by which the Canadian government monitors whether a
requesting state has gone beyond the terms of the treaty in
exercising jurisdiction:  U.S.A. v. Lepine (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d)
385 (S.C.C.).</pre>
    <pre>b)   Test for Committal</pre>
    <pre>[28] Section 18(1) establishes the test to be applied by the
extradition judge in determining whether a fugitive should be
committed for surrender.  Section 18(1)(a) sets out the test for
those fugitives who it is alleged have already been convicted of
an offence in the requesting state.
[29] Section 18(1)(b) provides the test for cases involving
fugitives, like the respondents, who are subject to outstanding
charges in the requesting jurisdiction.  The section reads as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               18.(1)    The judge shall issue a warrant
          for the committal of the fugitive to the nearest
          convenient prison, there to remain until surrendered
          to the foreign state, or until discharged according
          to law,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  in the case of a fugitive accused
          of an extradition crime, if such evidence is
          produced as would, according to the law of
          Canada, subject to this Part, justify the
          committal of the fugitive for trial, if the
          crime had been committed in Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[30] The test under s. 18(1)(b) embodies the &#147;double criminality&#148;
rule.  This rule underlies the structure of the extradition
process and has its origins in the principle of reciprocity.  The
rule is designed to protect the fundamental rights of an
individual whose extradition is being sought by ensuring that a
person is not surrendered to another country for conduct not
considered to be a criminal offence in the country from which
extradition is sought:  Lepine, at p. 391;  U.S.A. v. McVey
(1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).
[31] The proper interpretation of the test set out in s. 18(1)(b)
has been the subject of much judicial analysis in recent years.
Before turning to the specific issues raised by this appeal, I
think it would be helpful to set out a number of the principles
that govern the way a court should apply s. 18(1)(b) to the facts
of a particular case.
[32] The first is that the assessment to be made under this
section is conduct based.  The wording of the section requires
the court to assume that &#147;the crime has been committed in
Canada.&#148; This has been interpreted to mean that the court should
look to the impugned conduct and make its assessment under
Canadian law on the basis of that conduct:  McVey, at p. 28;
Lepine, at p. 391.
[33] Next, it has been held that the court should consider only
the conduct that underlies the foreign charge for which
extradition is being sought.  The extradition judge is concerned
with whether that conduct would prima facie constitute an
extradition crime under the laws of Canada had it taken place in
Canada:  McVey at p. 21;  U.S.A. v. Manno (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d)
544 (Que. C.A.) at p.558.  Put another way, the double
criminality rule does not permit an extradition judge to base the
committal decision on evidence of conduct that &#147;has nothing to
do&#148; with the conduct charged in the foreign jurisdiction:  U.S.A.
v. Tavormina (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 563 (Que. C.A.), at p. 569.
[34] I interpret this requirement, that the court should only
look to the conduct underlying the foreign charge to mean that
the conduct to be considered in the s. 18(1)(b) assessment must
have some connection to the foreign charge or must constitute
some evidence of that charge.
[35] The extradition judge may look to the foreign indictment,
but only for the purpose of determining what conduct is be
included in the assessment under s. 18(1)(b).  The foreign
indictment enables the extradition judge to identify the conduct
with which a fugitive is charged in the requesting jurisdiction.
In referring to the foreign indictment however, the court must
not be concerned with whether the conduct establishes the
commission of the foreign charge nor with whether the foreign
court has jurisdiction to try the charge:  Manno at pp. 558-59.
[36] The third principle is that the extradition judge should
consider the impugned conduct without regard to the jurisdiction
in which the conduct took place.  In Lepine, La Forest J.,
writing for the majority, pointed out that nothing in the Act
requires the judge to consider where the acts charged took place
or to consider the jurisdiction of the requesting state.  At p.
391, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The question to be asked, then, is whether, if
          the impugned acts or conduct had been committed
          in Canada, they would constitute a crime here:
          see McVey at pp. 28 and 31-2.  It is not whether,
          if some of the conduct had been committed here and
          some abroad, it would be a crime here.</pre>
    <pre>[37] In reaching this conclusion, La Forest J. specifically
rejected what he termed &#147;a type of &#145;mirror image&#146; approach under
which only the specific acts that took place in the requesting
jurisdiction would be considered to have taken place in Canada.&#148;
[38] The respondents argue that the conclusion in Lepine was
modified or even overruled by the subsequent decision of the
Supreme Court in United States of America v. Dynar (1997), 115
C.C.C. (3d) 481.  Justices Cory and Iacobucci, writing for the
majority, at p. 521, said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          One of the most important functions of the
          extradition hearing is the protection of the
          liberty of the individual.  It ensures that an
          individual will not be surrendered for trial in a
          foreign jurisdiction unless, as previously mentioned,
          the Requesting State presents evidence that
          demonstrates on a prima facie basis that the
          individual has committed acts in the foreign
          jurisdiction that would constitute criminal conduct
          in Canada.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[39] This statement embodies the  type of &#147;mirror image&#148; approach
that was rejected by the majority in Lepine.  The reference in
this passage to &#147;acts in the foreign jurisdiction&#148; appears to
have been taken from statements in McVey and Canada v. Schmidt
(1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), both of which were decided
before Lepine.  It is difficult to reconcile this statement in
Dynar with the majority decision in Lepine.
[40] In my view, the passage in Dynar relied upon by the
respondents was not meant to overrule Lepine.  It is included in
a section of the reasons with  the heading, &#147;The Nature of the
Extradition Hearing.&#148;  In this section the majority set out a
general description of the principles that guide a court when
conducting an extradition hearing.  The jurisdiction in which the
conduct that formed the basis of the charges in Dynar took place
was not an issue considered by the court.
[41] The direction given by the majority in Lepine, namely that
the court should consider the impugned conduct without regard to
the jurisdiction in which it took place, in my view, continues to
be the proper approach.  Having said this, the requirement that
an extradition judge only consider the conduct underlying a
foreign charge may, in some cases, cause the court to draw a
line, possibly territorial, between conduct that underlies a
foreign charge and conduct that does not.
[42] With the conduct viewed in accordance with these principles,
the extradition judge is required to determine whether the
conduct, if it occurred in Canada, would constitute a prima facie
case of an extradition crime according to the laws of Canada.
[43] An &#147;extradition crime&#148; is defined in s. 2 of the Act to mean
any crime that if committed in Canada would be one of the crimes
listed in the schedule to the Act or in the case of an
extradition arrangement (a treaty) any crime described in such
arrangement.  Article 2 of the Canadian-United States Extradition
Treaty no longer lists specific extradition offences.  It
provides that &#147;extradition shall be granted for any offence
punishable by the laws of both parties by imprisonment for a term
exceeding one year or any greater punishment.&#148;
[44] It is not necessary that the Canadian offence established by
the conduct  be described by the same name or that it have the
same legal elements as the offence charged in the requesting
state.  The protection afforded by the double criminality rule is
ensured if the conduct that underlies the foreign charge
constitutes any extradition crime under the laws of Canada.  See
U.S.A. v. Smith (1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 16 (Ont. Co. Ct.), McVey,
Manno, Tavormina and Stewart v. Canada (Minister of Justice)
(1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 423 (B.C.C.A.). In most cases,
particularly when extradition is sought by the United States,
where the system of criminal law is similar to our own, there
will be a similarity between the offence charged and the Canadian
offence against which the assessment is made.  However, an
equivalency between the two is not a requirement.
[45] In summary, drawing together these principles , the test
under s. 18(1)(b) may be paraphrased as follows: The extradition
judge shall commit a fugitive for surrender if satisfied that the
conduct that underlies the foreign charge, wherever it took
place, would if it occurred in Canada constitute a prima facie
case of any of the offences listed in the Extradition Act or
described in the relevant extradition treaty.</pre>
    <pre>c)    Reasons of Extradition Judge</pre>
    <pre>[46] In his reasons, the extradition judge set out the analytical
process he proposed to follow in assessing the evidence in
support of the request for extradition.</pre>
    <pre>[47] The extradition judge said that the application of s.
18(1)(b) to the facts of the case required him to apply what he
called a &#147;notional fiction&#148; by which he would pretend that what
is said to have occurred in the United States occurred in Canada
and vice versa.
[48] With the evidence viewed in this manner, the extradition
judge said he would determine if there was sufficient evidence
such that a justice conducting a preliminary hearing in Canada
would be required to commit the persons before him to stand
trial.  In doing so, he would base his analysis on the
&#147;approximate equivalent&#148; Canadian charges to those for which
extradition was being sought.  He would apply the evidence to the
notional Canadian charges of conspiracy to import heroin and
conspiracy to traffic heroin and then determine if the evidence
would justify ordering the respondents to stand trial in Canada
on those notional charges.
[49] The extradition judge accepted that this approach differed
from that described in Smith, where Borins J. held that the s. 18
test would be satisfied if &#147;the conduct alleged &#133; would have
constituted any criminal offence pursuant to Canadian law had it
occurred in Canada&#148; [Emphasis in original.].
[50] The extradition judge then said he would consider and apply
ss. 465(3) and (4) of the Criminal Code, which deal with the
jurisdiction of a Canadian court over offences of conspiracy that
have an extra-territorial aspect.  As part of the process, the
extradition judge said that he was precluded from carrying out a
detailed analysis of the substantive law of the United States
underlying the American indictment.
[51] Having set out this analytical approach, the extradition
judge found that the appellant had not made out a prima facie
case of either of the two counts alleged in the indictment based
on their approximate Canadian equivalents.  He went on to say
that there was &#147;strong evidence that Vincenzo Commisso trafficked
in heroin in the United States and strong evidence that all of
the persons conspired to traffic heroin in Canada but there is
not sufficient evidence to support either of the two counts
alleged in the indictment.&#148;  [My emphasis.]  This reference is
clearly to the two American charges.
[52] The extradition judge then briefly reviewed the evidence and
concluded that there was no evidence that persons other than
Vincenzo Commisso &#147;were involved in anything that occurred in the
U.S. sufficient to make out a prima facie case of a conspiracy
there  [in the United States]&#148; and that he was also unable to
conclude that there was &#147;a prima facie case made out that
importation into the U.S. was one of the objects of that alleged
conspiracy.&#148;  [My emphasis.]  Accordingly, he ordered that each
of the respondents be discharged.
[53] The extradition judge concluded his reasons by stating in
the penultimate paragraph:
          </pre>
    <pre>          No-one could possibly argue reasonably that
          a Canadian extradition judge could properly
          commit persons for surrender for extradition
          to the U.S., as in this case, on the basis of
          evidence showing the commission of an offence
          totally within Canadian territorial jurisdiction
          and having no reasonable connection to the U.S.
          such as might arise upon the application of any
          U.S. approximate equivalents to section 465(3)
          and section 465(4) of the Criminal Code.</pre>
    <pre>[54] I have difficulty with these reasons.  It is not clear to me
how the extradition judge applied the test to s. 18(1)(b) in
reaching the decision to discharge the respondents.  He does not
appear to have followed the approach that he said he was going to
take.
[55] The appellant argues that the extradition judge erred in
applying the notional fiction of pretending that what occurred in
the United States occurred in Canada and vice versa and on that
basis determining if there was a prima facie case.  I agree.
This approach runs afoul of the majority decision in Lepine,
which requires the court to consider all of the conduct without
regard to the jurisdiction in which it took place.
[56] In response, Mr. Greenspan, for the respondent Rocco
Commisso, argues that the extradition judge did not actually use
this fiction when he came to apply the test under s.18(1)(b) to
the evidence.   I agree that the language he used in setting out
his conclusions suggests that he did not.  However, that language
creates other difficulties.  After reviewing the evidence, the
extradition judge said that he was not satisfied that there was
sufficient evidence to establish the American offences and that
there was insufficient evidence to establish a conspiracy in the
United States.
[57] This language suggests that the extradition judge did not
engage in the exercise of assessing the conduct to determine if
there was a prima facie case of a Canadian offence, but rather
looked to see if the evidence made out a prima facie case of the
American charges.
[58] If this is the basis upon which the extradition judge in
fact decided the case, then he engaged in an exercise that
clearly falls outside of that which is required by s.18(1)(b).
It is well settled that an extradition judge should not be
concerned either with the sufficiency of the proof of the foreign
charge or with the jurisdiction of the foreign court to try the
charge.  On the face of these conclusions, the extradition judge
appears to have done both.
[59] The appellant also submits that the extradition judge erred
when he said that he would apply the evidence to the &#147;approximate
Canadian equivalent charges&#148; rather than to any Canadian
extradition offence.  In doing so, the extradition judge
recognized that the approach he was taking differed from that set
out in Smith.  Smith has been adopted by higher courts on a
number of occasions.  See for example, McVey, Manno and Stewart.
The approach in Smith is the correct one.  It was an error to
restrict the assessment under s. 18(1)(b) to only the
&#147;approximate Canadian equivalent charges&#148; to those set out in the
foreign indictment.
[60] The effect of this error, in the context of this case,
particularly when combined with the error of assuming what
occurred in the United States occurred in Canada and vice versa,
would result in a significant departure from the basis upon which
the assessment under s. 18(1) is to be made.
[61] That said, it is not clear to me exactly how the extradition
judge used &#147;the approximate Canadian equivalent charges&#148; in the
analysis that led to his conclusions.  Although he initially said
he was not satisfied that the appellant had made out a prima
facie case based on the Canadian equivalent charges, he went on
to reason that there was insufficient evidence to support the two
counts alleged in the American indictment and that there was not
a prima facie case of a conspiracy in the United States.  As I
point out above, this approach would constitute a fundamental
error in applying s. 18(1)(b).
[62] The respondents argue that the references by the extradition
judge to the failure to prove the charges in the United States
were inadvertent and this court should find that he either
approached the assessment under s. 18(1)(b) in the proper manner
or that any errors he made in setting out the legal principles he
proposed to use did not affect his conclusion.
[63] I am not able to accept either of these arguments.  I am
satisfied that the extradition judge&#146;s reasons, however
interpreted, demonstrate the errors in law relied upon by the
appellant.  I am also satisfied that whatever approach the
extradition judge actually used, led him to reach the wrong
conclusion.   It is my view that when the test under s. 18(1)(b)
is properly applied to the evidence, a warrant of committal
should be issued for each of the respondents.</pre>
    <pre>d)   The Application of the s. 18(1)(b) Test</pre>
    <pre>[64] The first step in applying the test under s. 18(1)(b) is to
determine what conduct underlies the American charges. I will
first deal with the charge of conspiracy to import heroin into
the United States.
[65] A conspiracy is an agreement between two or more persons to
achieve an unlawful purpose or to achieve a lawful purpose by
unlawful means.  In my view, all of the conduct alleged by the
appellant underlies this charge.  That conduct is some evidence
that each of the respondents was a party to a single agreement to
sell heroin to Riverso for the purposes of importing the heroin
into the United States.
[66] In March 1993, Vincenzo Commisso sold heroin to Riverso in
Brooklyn, New York.  On different occasions after that, he and
two of the other respondents, Rocco Commisso and Cosimo
D&#146;Agostino, invited Riverso to come to Canada to buy more heroin.
As it turned out, Riverso came here three times but the
respondents were only able to sell him heroin on the third trip
in January 1994.  The fourth respondent, Szabo, was intrically
involved in the actual sale.
[67] It would be open to a court to draw an inference that the
sale in January 1994 was the culmination of the invitation first
issued by Vincenzo Commisso in the spring of 1993.  This conduct
is some evidence that the four respondents were parties to a
single agreement to sell heroin to Riverso.
[68] Moreover, this conduct is connected to the specific
conspiracy alleged, that being for the purpose of importing
heroin into the United States.  One of the alleged co-
conspirators did sell heroin in the United States.  Three of them
encouraged Riverso, whom they believed to be an American drug
dealer, to come to Canada to buy more.  He was told that the
heroin would be cheaper to buy in Canada.  On one occasion, an
offer was made to pay his plane fare.  He was told how to carry
heroin on a plane without being detected.  It was clear that the
respondents believed that Riverso would take the heroin back to
the United for resale there.  In my view, this conduct is some
evidence of the unlawful purpose alleged in the American charge,
to import heroin into the United States.
[69] I am also satisfied that this conduct constitutes some
evidence of the second American charge, conspiracy to distribute
heroin.  The respondents believed that Riverso was an American
drug dealer.  They agreed to sell an amount of heroin that was
clearly intended to be marketed or distributed in the United
States.
[70] The question is not whether this conduct establishes a prima
facie case that the respondents committed the two American
charges, but rather whether the conduct underlies those charges
in the sense that the conduct has some connection to or is some
evidence of those charges.  In my view, it does.
[71] In arguing against this conclusion, the respondents rely on
the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in Tavormina.  In my
view, the facts in Tavormina are distinguishable.  Tavormina was
charged in the United States with two conspiracies.  The purpose
of the first was to import narcotics into the United States, the
purpose of the second was to traffic in narcotics.  The evidence
disclosed the existence of two separate conspiracies.  The first
was among a number of third parties and had the object of
importing cocaine into the United States.  There was no evidence
that Tavormina was a party to this conspiracy.  The second, in
which the evidence showed Tavormina participated, had the object
of distributing the cocaine once it arrived in the United States.
Tavormina was committed by the extradition judge on the second
count but discharged on the first.  The United States appealed
the discharge.  In upholding the result, Proulx J.A. reasoned
that the facts that underlay the conspiracy to import charge did
not support a prima facie case that the fugitive had committed an
offence in Canada.  He put it this way, at p. 569:
          </pre>
    <pre>          That being said, I do not believe the double
          criminality rule permits an extradition judge
          to base his decision on evidence of certain
          conduct and to order the fugitive committed
          for surrender to the foreign state when this
          evidence has nothing to do with the conduct
          charged in the accusation [the indictment]
          for which his extradition is sought.  [My emphasis.]</pre>
    <pre>[72] In the same way, the present case is also distinguishable
from United States v. Shulman (1998), 128 C.C.C. (3d) 475 (Ont.
C.A.), app. for leave to appeal granted [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 513,
where this court upheld the extradition judge&#146;s order to
discharge the fugitive on 51 of 52 counts in an American
indictment.  In Shulman like Tavormina, there was no evidence
adduced in reference to the charges on which the fugitive had
been discharged.
[73] The respondent Szabo argues that he is in a different
position than the other three respondents.  He contends that
because the evidence only shows that he was involved on the day
of the second sale of heroin to Riverso in January 1994, that
there is no evidence to connect him to charges involving a
conspiracy that came into existence before that date.  I
disagree.  Szabo played a very active role in the events at the
time of the sale.  He aggressively demanded the buy money in
advance.  He and D&#146;Agostino counted the money.  When D&#146;Agostino
left to get the heroin, Szabo told Riverso he could get all the
heroin Riverso needed. Szabo appeared to be a central part of the
selling operation.  The fact that he was not involved in earlier
efforts to sell heroin to Riverso and the fact that the evidence
does not establish any direct connection between Szabo and
Vincenzo Commisso does not mean that his conduct could not
constitute some evidence that he was a party to the same
conspiracy.  Professor Stuart in his text, Canadian Criminal Law,
3rd, (1995) put it nicely when he said at pp. 630-31:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; there need not be direct communication between
          the conspirators.  There can be a &#147;wheel&#148; conspiracy,
          where only one person in the conspiracy communicates
          directly with each of the others, and a &#147;chain&#148;
          conspiracy, where A communicates with B, B with C,
          and C with D.  However, these metaphors cannot substitute
          substantive or requirements.  The common venture
          requirement guards against several conspiracies being
          falsely rolled into one.</pre>
    <pre>[74] In summary, I am satisfied that all of the evidence
introduced by the appellant at the extradition hearing showed
conduct that underlies the American charges and may, therefore,
be used in making the assessment under s. 18(1)(b) of the Act.
[75] The second step in the assessment under s. 18(1)(b) is to
determine whether, if this conduct occurred in Canada, it would
constitute a prima facie case of a Canadian offence.  There can
be no doubt that the evidence, if accepted, establishes that the
respondents committed the offence of conspiracy to traffic in
heroin and also the substantive offence of trafficking in heroin.
I am satisfied that the evidence meets the requirements of
s.18(1)(b) and would justify a court issuing a warrant of
committal for each of the respondents.
[76] Szabo argues that his committal would infringe ss. 6(1) and
(7) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and that these
infringements cannot be justified pursuant to s. 1.  This
argument rests on the assertion that Szabo was only present in
Canada, that his offence was committed here and that he did
nothing more than sell heroin to someone who happened to be a
foreign visitor to Canada.  Put another way, Szabo argues that
his conduct had no connection to the American charges.  I have
already set out why I disagree with this position.  I see no
merit to the arguments based on the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>Issue No. 2 Appellate Delay</pre>
    <pre>[77] The respondents apply for an order dismissing this appeal or
alternatively, for an order staying all proceedings against them.
This application is based on an alleged breach of s. 7 of the
Charter arising from the delay between the date when the
extradition judge discharged the respondents and the hearing of
this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[78] On June 5, 1997, the extradition judge ordered that the
respondents be discharged.  Over the next few months, the United
States served the respondents with a notice of this appeal and
filed it in this court on September 12, 1997.3  This appeal was
argued approximately 25 months later on October 13, 1999.
[79] The reasons for the delay reflect poorly on the appellant.
Although there was considerable delay awaiting the completion of
the transcripts, the transcripts, other than the one for June 5,
1997, were unnecessary for argument of the appeal.  There was no
viva voce evidence at the extradition hearing.  The hearing days
before June 5 only involved submissions by counsel.  The delay
occasioned by the appellant waiting for these transcripts was
unnecessary.  There was also additional delay occasioned by the
appellant&#146;s failure to promptly assign the file to appellate
counsel within the Crown office.
[80] On this application, the respondents each filed affidavits
setting out the prejudice they allege has been caused by the
delay.  These affidavits allege prejudice of a personal nature.
There are no specific allegations of prejudice to the conduct of
the appeal or to the defence of the charges should the
respondents be extradicted.  Two of the affidavits refer to the
general loss of memory by witnesses arising from the passage of
time, but nothing more specific is alleged.
[81] The respondents took no steps under the Criminal Appeal
Rules to advance or expedite the hearing of the appeal.
[82] The respondents submit that the delay has infringed their
rights under s. 7 of the Charter.  The Supreme Court addressed
the issue of appellate delay in R. v. Potvin (1993), 83 C.C.C.
(3d) 97.  Sopinka J., for the majority, held that s. 11(b) of the
Charter does not apply to the delay involved in an appeal from
conviction by an accused or to an appeal from an acquittal by the
Crown.  He concluded that although s. 11(b) does not apply, s. 7
may in appropriate circumstances afford a remedy for appellate
delay.
[83] Sopinka J. pointed out that the rules of criminal procedure
enable a party interested in a timely disposition of an appeal to
eliminate any substantial delay on the part of the adversary.  He
went on to say that &#147;[a]s for systemic delay, resort can be had
to s. 7 in cases in the cases in which real prejudice is
occasioned.&#148;  In referring to real prejudice, Sopinka J. was
addressing circumstances in which the fairness of the trial had
been affected by the delay.  The use of s. 7 in these
circumstances is an application of the court&#146;s power to remedy an
abuse of process that is enshrined in s. 7 as a principle of
fundamental justice.
[84] Sopinka J. concluded in Potvin that an 18-month delay
between a stay of proceedings and the hearing of an appeal did
not constitute a breach of s. 7 because no evidence was offered
to show that any real prejudice resulted from the appellate
delay.
[85] Although the total delay in present cases is approximately
25 months, the respondents in this case have not satisfied the
test in Potvin.  The respondents took no steps under the Criminal
Appeal Rules to eliminate the delay caused by the Crown. Section
19.5(2) of the Extradition Act provides that the rules of the
court made under s.482 of the Criminal Code apply to appeals
under the Act.  Under Ontario Criminal Appeal Rule 20, a
respondent may request that the registrar serve notice on the
appellant indicating that an appeal has not been perfected
according to the scheme in the rules and that the appeal will be
put before the court to be dismissed as an abandoned appeal
unless perfected within 10 days.
[86] More importantly, the respondents do not allege any real
prejudice.  They have not shown that the fairness of their trial,
if they are extradicted, will be affected by the delay.  I would,
therefore, dismiss this application.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[87] Section 19.8(a)(ii) provides that this court may set aside
an order discharging a fugitive on the basis of a &#147;wrong decision
on a question of law.&#148;  I am satisfied the extradition judge&#146;s
order was based on an error in law and must therefore be set
aside.
[88] Section 19.8 of the Extradition Act authorizes this court,
where it sets aside an order of discharge, to either order a new
hearing or order the committal of the fugitive with respect to
the extradition crime for which the fugitive was discharged.  In
my view, there is nothing to be gained from ordering a new
hearing.  This case was argued on the basis of a &#147;paper record.&#148;
There was no viva voce evidence.  This court is in as good a
position as an extradition judge to determine the proper result.
I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to justify an
order committing each of the respondents for surrender.
[89] Accordingly, I would set aside the order discharging the
respondents and issue a warrant of committal for each of the
respondents with respect to both charges for which extradition is
sought.

_______________________________
1  Article VIII of the Canadian-United States Extradition  Treaty
provides &#147;The determination that extradition should or should not
be  granted  shall be made in accordance with  the  laws  of  the
requested state.&#148;
2 Section 3 of the Extradition Act provides that if there are
inconsistencies between the Act and an extradition arrangement (a
treaty) the arrangement prevails.  There are articles in the
Canadian-United States Extradition Treaty that are very similar
but not identical to sections in the Extradition Act.  For
example, Article X of the Treaty and section 18 of the Act both
set out the test to be applied to justify extradition. I see no
inconsistency between any articles in the treaty and the
provisions in the Act that would affect the issues raised in this
appeal.  The parties argued the appeal relying upon the wording
of the sections in the Act and for ease of reference I will
simply refer to those sections and not refer to the corresponding
treaty provisions.
