    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction by Keenan J. dated April 24, 1998,
and on appeal from the sentence imposed by Keenan J., dated April
29, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CARTHY J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The accused agreed at the outset of this trial before a jury
that  at  about  2:30  a.m. on a Saturday morning  he  drove  his
vehicle in some haste across a parking lot adjacent to a doughnut
shop, striking and injuring one person, bumping against two  cars
on the street and that he left the scene of the accident. Some 36
hours  later,  after consulting a lawyer, he surrendered  to  the
police  and,  other than indicating the location of the  vehicle,
made  no  statement  as  to  the  circumstances  surrounding  the
incident.
[2]  He was charged and eventually convicted of criminal
negligence causing bodily harm and failure to remain at the scene
of an accident. The focus of the trial was upon the justification
put forward by the accused for his conduct, and on the appeal the
focus was upon the treatment by the Crown and the trial judge of
his credibility related to that justification, particularly
arising from the failure to recount the details to the police
upon arrest.
[3]  The appellant appeals both the convictions and the sentence
of three years concurrent on each count.
[4]  The evidence of the appellant was that on August 16, 1996,
he was at work until 11:00 p.m. and that at 1:00 a.m. on Saturday
morning he joined some friends at a discothèque on Bloor Street
West in Toronto. He had parked his car in a small plaza on the
north side of Bloor Street, adjacent to a donut shop. At about
2:30 a.m. he decided to leave and offered a ride to a friend.
They crossed Bloor Street and made their way through a group of
people to the car at the furthest area of the lot from Bloor
Street. The front windows were opened, the motor started, and the
appellant was searching for a C.D. to put on the player, when two
youths approached, one from either side of the car. The
abbreviated version of what followed is that demands were made
for money, the appellant refused, and one of the youths punched
the appellant, chipping his tooth. He then reacted in panic,
fearing a robbery and more violence, and drove onto a sidestreet,
where he found his path blocked by other people. He heard his
assailant yelling to others to stop the car and swerved back on
the parking lot, intending to cross it diagonally to reach Bloor
St. It was at that point that he struck a person who was lifting
his bicycle in the air in what might have been a threatening
manner, and, afraid of what he now saw as a group of people
ganging up on him he careened onto Bloor Street, striking two
cars, and left the scene heading east.
[5]  Once away from the scene the appellant&#146;s passenger urged
that they call the police. The appellant wanted to do this with a
lawyer (he does not speak English). He sought contact with a
trusted friend to assist him in contacting a lawyer, there was
some delay, and again delay in securing a lawyer, with the result
that the surrender was 36 hours after the incident.
[6]  Thus, on the evidence of the appellant, supported by that of
his passenger, the actus reus of the offences was essentially
admitted and the issue for the jury was the fault element of
each.
[7]  Three of the Crown witnesses gave evidence as to the manner
in which the appellant drove across the parking lot,
accelerating, striking a man, and swerving onto Bloor St., but
none provided any enlightenment as to what may have motivated
such aberrant conduct. There was evidence that there was a large
group of people milling about and that the car had been parked in
the darkest area of the lot. Thus, the witnesses could have been
out of sight and hearing of what occurred at the outset.
[8]  This digest of some of the evidence at trial is sufficient
to test the dominant point of appeal concerning the fact that the
appellant&#146;s explanations for these offences were not offered to
the police upon surrender and arrest. His explanations, if
accepted as true, might or might not have provided a defence to
either charge, but the trial judge&#146;s treatment of them and the
jury&#146;s questions concerning them made it clear that this was the
pivotal point of the trial, and, indeed, the only defence
proffered by the appellant.
[9]  When the appellant was being cross-examined by the Crown no
objection was taken to questions relating to his reasons for not
reporting the accident to the police during the 36 hour period
following the incident. Those questions went to the actus reus of
failing to remain.
[10] Objection was taken to the question:
          </pre>
    <pre>             Q.   And I am going to suggest to you, sir, 
	at no point after this happened did you ever make 
	a formal complaint to the police about having been 
	hit on the tooth that night?</pre>
    <pre>[11] The objection, in the absence of the jury, reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>             MR. HOUSE:  Yes, Your Honour, in my submission  
	my friend is asking a question which compromises my 
	client&#146;s right to remain silent. My client turned 
	himself in to the police. He made no statements. Had 
	he made a statement it is up to him whether he makes 
	a statement once he is arrested and charged with
        an offence. He was told that fact by his lawyer and 
	he chose not to make a statement. My friend is saying, 
	why didn&#146;t you tell them, why didn&#146;t you make a 
	statement? That changes the right to remain silent 
	into a trap.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The colloquy continues:
          </pre>
    <pre>             THE COURT:  He is being asked about failing to 
	make a complaint about having been a victim of a 
	criminal offence. He is not being asked about failure 
	to give a statement to the police as an accused. 
	[Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>             MR. HOUSE:  Any statement he makes to  the  
	police, that he was a victim  of an assault or   
	robbery or whatever, would compromise his right 
	to remain silent.
          </pre>
    <pre>             THE  COURT: I think it is an appropriate 
	line of questioning. As  long  as he  has the 
	right to remain silent, obviously if he is a
	ccused of a criminal offence.
          </pre>
    <pre>             MR.  HOUSE: That includes the right not to  
	make a complaint about that prior  time, that is 
	the incident for which there is charges[sic] against him.
          </pre>
    <pre>             THE COURT: I think it is a proper line of 
	questioning. Jury, please.</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Crown  counsel addressed the jury in closing  on  the  same
terms  as  the  trial judge&#146;s ruling and the trial judge  in  his
charge said the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>             It is the position of the prosecution that the 
	Cones version, which is supported by his friend, who 
	I will refer to as Jack, is simply not the truth. 
	That there was no attempted robbery; that there was 
	nothing that transpired at that scene which in any 
	way is supported by any of the other evidence. And
        that the version given to you by Cones and Jack, is 
	simply not the case. It is not the truth.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In  considering that issue members
          of  the  jury, you are entitled to take  into
          account the fact that the attempt robbery was
          mentioned to you in this trial for the  first
          time.  Let me review that with you.  You  may
          recall   that   in  cross-examination   Crown
          counsel  asked  Mr.  Cones  if  he  had  ever
          reported  the  attempted  robbery   and   the
          assault  on  him to the police  at  any  time
          after  he had turned himself in and has  been
          arrested  and  charged with  these  offences?
          Objection was taken to that question, on  the
          grounds, and quite appropriate grounds,  that
          any  one  who is charge[sic] with a  criminal
          offence  has  an  absolute  right  to  remain
          silent  and  is  not  required  to  give  any
          explanation.   The   failure   to   give   an
          explanation  is  something  from  which   you
          should  not  derive  any inference  which  is
          adverse to the case of the accused person.  I
          permitted the question to be asked and to  be
          answered on the legal basis at that time that
          it  would be relevant to support an inference
          that  the recital of that story for the first
          time  was  a  recent  fabrication;  that  is,
          something that was made up after the fact and
          presented  for  the  first  time  at   trial.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The  friend to whom the appellant turned for assistance  in
obtaining a lawyer was Ms. Natoli. She had given testimony  at  a
bail  hearing including a reference to the passenger telling  her
of  the  punching incident. She also gave evidence at trial  that
both  the  accused and the passenger related the details  of  the
assault  to  her  in the day or days following the  incident.  In
reference to her evidence the trial judge stated in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>	Then when she was cross-examined, it appears that 
	she had testified on, August 19th, which would 
	have been the Monday following the accident, she 
	testified at a show-cause hearing, which is a process 
	undertaken to determine whether an accused person 
	should be released on bail. You heard what she had 
	said at the show-cause hearing. She testified and 
	said that she had heard from the third person that 
	was the passenger in the car, that when they were 
	approaching the car that they were set upon by a
        group of young men and that Cones was punched and 
	assaulted.  There is no reference to an attempted 
	robbery, so the evidence with respect to the attempted 
	robbery is still subject to the consideration that it 
	is something that was not mentioned before this time. 
	You are entitled to take that into account in
        determining how much credibility or reliability you 
	place on the testimony relating to an attempted robbery.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The trial judge is the only one to refer to the evidence  as
that of an attempted robbery, seemingly to distinguish it from  a
punch and demands for money. In any event, the references to  the
evidence of Ms. Natoli have the strongest significance in respect
of  a  question from the jury, indicating the focus of attention.
After 3 1/2 hours of deliberation the jury asked:
          </pre>
    <pre>	We would like to know if the incident of the punch 
	was mentioned at any time in the legal proceedings 
	previous to this trial and who mentioned it?</pre>
    <pre>[16]  In response, the trial judge reviewed the evidence  of  Ms.
Natoli and concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>	So the answer to your question is, there was mention 
	of an incident at the Show Cause hearing on August 19th. 
	Whether that is viewed by you as mention of the punch 
	incident, is up to you.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  appellant has put forward a separate ground of  appeal
concerning   the   trial  judge&#146;s  response  to  jury   questions
suggesting  an  all or nothing verdict on both counts.  This  may
well have been detrimental to the appellant. It was possible  for
the jury to accept his story as giving rise to a reasonable doubt
on  the  criminal negligence causing bodily harm charge, but  not
raising a reasonable doubt on the charge of leaving the scene  of
an  accident.  I include some of the exchange at  this  point  to
emphasize  the  focus  of  attention on the  credibility  of  the
explanations put forward by the defence.
[18] The jury&#146;s first question was:
          </pre>
    <pre>	&#147;Want judge&#146;s statement to us re if we believe his 
	story we must find him not guilty on both counts. 
	May we hear that again?&#148;  [Emphasis of the jury.]</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The trial judge repeated his earlier instructions with  one
modification respecting count 1:
          </pre>
    <pre>	It is only if you reject his evidence and find that 
	it is not the truth then it would be your duty in 
	those circumstances to find him guilty of the criminal 
	negligence count, number 1.</pre>
    <pre>[20] On appeal the Crown conceded that this was an error in that,
even  if that evidence was rejected, the entirety of the evidence
must  be  considered. It might be added that  even  if  the  jury
accepted the evidence of the appellant, they would still have  to
consider whether his conduct fell below the prescribed standard.
[21] When the jury retired the trial judge commented:
          </pre>
    <pre>        Basically the jury is going to have to decide whether
        this story about the attempt robbery is real or 
	fictional. That is what the issue is in this case. All 
	right.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Some time later the jury returned to ask:
          </pre>
    <pre>        Several of the Jury still aren&#146;t clear on your directive. 
	We would like to hear it one more time.</pre>
    <pre>After  repeating  his  initial charge the trial  judge  had  this
exchange with the foreperson of the jury:
          </pre>
    <pre>        The Foreperson:  I think the concern was if we did or 
	didn&#146;t believe the robbery story, then we have to find 
	it on both counts. If you believe the story on one, you 
	believe the story on the other. Whether it was a different 
	count on both, they were saying they believe one but that 
	is why we came back to you, whether if you believe one 
	story, your belief is carried through with the other.
          </pre>
    <pre>        The Court: What do your logical processes tell you?
          </pre>
    <pre>        The Foreperson: If it is one, it is both.
          </pre>
    <pre>        The Court: Yes. If that is your concern, ask  
	yourselves, could it be consistent to believe 
	in relation to one count and not in relation 
	to the other count?</pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant raises as a separate ground of appeal that the
trial  judge  effectively  and  erroneously  directed  a  special
verdict  restricted to credibility in this segment of the charge.
That  submission is cause for concern, even though it might  have
benefitted  the appellant if the jury believed his  evidence  and
felt foreclosed from considering whether that truly absolved  him
of   fault  on  either  count.  In  any  event,  I  am  presently
considering   the  issue   of  silence  upon   arrest   and   the
significance of this segment of the exchange with the jury is  to
underline  that  the  nerve centre of this  trial  was  upon  the
credibility of the appellant&#146;s explanation for his conduct.
[24] On appeal the Crown did not attempt to defend the use of the
appellant&#146;s silence upon arrest on the trial judge&#146;s reasoning
that there is a distinction between silence facing charges and
silence concerning the reporting of a crime. Clearly, the two
merged and the &#147;crime&#148; was both the defence of the accused and
evidence of his presence at the scene.
[25] The Crown&#146;s first point is that the defence counsel opened
up the subject by asking questions as to his panic and fear and
conduct in the interval between the incident and the surrender
and that the cross-examination was only intended to pursue that
exculpatory evidence to its natural conclusion. The appellant
rightly points out that the events during the 36 hours constitute
the actus reus of the offence of failing to remain, which ended
upon surrender. A similar situation was dealt with by the New
Brunswick Court of Appeal in R. v. Blackmore et al. (1991), 67
C.C.C. (3d) 67 (N.B.C.A.) where the court directed a new trial
because the trial judge had not warned the jury to ignore
questions and answers as to silence upon arrest concerning
evidence given by the appellant at trial that their pre-trial
conduct was motivated by an attempt to trap a corrupt employer. I
agree with that disposition. Here, the error is more than one of
omission. There was a specific invitation to use silence before
the police as evidence going to credibility.
[26] The second argument of the Crown is that the defence here is
similar to that of alibi and is subject to an exception to the
general right to silence during the investigative stage of
proceedings. He points out that the right under s.7 is not
absolute and refers to authorities such as R. v. Stevenson
(1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 464 (Ont. C.A.) where the refusal to
discuss the crime with an examining psychiatrist was considered
relevant to the weight of that doctor&#146;s evidence as against
another who did have the advantage of full disclosure. In that
case the evidence of silence was relevant to evidence the jury
would have to weigh and, even there, the court indicated that the
jury must be warned that the silence had no bearing on guilt. In
the present case the evidence has no relevance to any issue
except credibility and guilt or innocence.
[27] An alibi defence has traditionally been treated separately
from other defences for the obvious reason that it can so readily
be concocted and the perjury which supports it may not be exposed
without the opportunity for investigation. An additional feature
of alibi, calling for special treatment, is that it involves a
completely separate issue to be tried, disembodied from the
events surrounding the alleged crime and the witnesses to it.
[28] Yet, no authority has ever suggested that the ends of
justice demand that the alibi must be disclosed at the point of
arrest and that failure to do so can be specifically referred to
in evidence. Questions indicating no previous disclosure of an
alibi inferentially includes that to the police at the outset,
but does not isolate that interview and invite an inference to be
taken from silence.
[29] In the present case there is no need to analogize to alibi
defences. Recent fabrication was alleged and inquiry was properly
made as to when the allegations of demands and punching first
came to light. This was the basis for Ms. Natoli&#146;s evidence that
both the appellant and the passenger had related the incident to
her and she had testified to some of that at the bail hearing.
Subject to the arguments of the appellant as to the unfairness of
the treatment of that evidence in the trial judge&#146;s charge, that
evidence was before the jury to test recent fabrication, and
there was no need in the interests of justice to impinge upon s.7
rights by backing the inquiry into the initial police interview.
[30] The jurisprudence under s.7, and prior thereto, supports my
conclusion that, in the circumstances, there is no justification
for impugning the credibility of the accused by reason of silence
upon arrest.
[31] The prohibition against the use of the fact of exercising
the right to silence to draw any inference of guilt was
succinctly stated by Sopinka J. in  R. v. Noble, [1997] 2 S.C.R.
at p. 918:
          </pre>
    <pre>	[71] While Herbert confirmed the existence of the right 
	to silence under s.7, it remained unclear to what use the 
	silence of the detainee could be put. That is, while the 
	detainee had a right to silence on arrest or detention, 
	could this silence later be used against the accused at 
	trial as evidence of his or her guilt? R. v. Chambers, 
	[1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, settled the matter.  In that case, 
	in addressing the jury, Crown counsel treated the 
	appellant&#146;s silence on his arrest as evidence of guilt.
	The trial judge neglected to instruct the jury to ignore 
	the evidence of silence on arrest, despite requests from 
	both Crown and defence counsel to do so. This Court held 
	that such neglect constituted reversible error. Cory J., 
	speaking for a majority of six judges, stated at p. 1316 
	that:
               </pre>
    <pre>        	It has as well been recognized that
                since there is a right to silence, it would
                be a snare and a delusion to caution the
                accused that he need not say anything in
                response to a police officer&#146;s question but
                nonetheless put in evidence that the accused  
                clearly exercised his right and remained
                silent  in the face of a question  which
                suggested his guilt.</pre>
    <pre>[32]  It  is to be noted that this observation as extracted  from
Chambers  was  in  respect of a failure by  the  trial  judge  to
instruct  the jury to ignore evidence of silence. Here,  we  have
not just evidence of silence, but its exploitation through cross-
examination and then encouragement by the trial judge to consider
that evidence in respect of the credibility of the accused.
[33] The extent to which the right to silence is compromised when
there is a defence of alibi was discussed by Lamer C.J.C. in R.
v. P. (M.B.), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555 at 578:
          </pre>
    <pre>        Before trial, the criminal law seeks to protect an
        accused from being conscripted against him or herself
	by the confession rule, the right to remain silent in
	the face of state interrogation into suspected criminal 
	conduct, and the absence of a duty of disclosure on the 
	defence: R. v. Hebert, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151. With respect 
	to disclosure, the defence in Canada is under no legal 
	obligation to co-operate with or assist the Crown by
        announcing any special defence, such as an alibi, or by
        producing documentary or physical evidence. In obiter, 
	this court suggested in R. v. Stinchcome, [1991] 3 S.C.R.
	326, at p.333, that:
               </pre>
    <pre>               The suggestion that the duty [of disclosure]
               should be reciprocal may deserve consideration
               by this court in the future but is not a valid
	       reason for absolving the Crown of its duty. 
	       The contrary contention fails to take account
	       of the fundamental difference in the respective
	       roles of the prosecution and the defence. &#133;
                                </pre>
    <pre>                            .  .  .  .  .
               </pre>
    <pre>                         I would add that the fruits of
               the   investigation  which  are  in  the
               possession of counsel for the Crown  are
               not the property of the Crown for use in
               securing  a conviction but the  property
               of  the public to be used to ensure that
               justice   is  done.  In  contrast,   the
               defence has no obligation to assist  the
               prosecution and is entitled to assume  a
               purely   adversarial  role  toward   the
               prosecution. The absence of  a  duty  to
               disclose can, therefore, be justified as
               being   consistent   with   this   role.

    <pre>        However, it should be borne in mind that this
        protection against disclosure is not an absolute one.
	For example, failure to disclose an alibi defence in
        a timely manner may affect the weight given to the    
	defence: Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings &amp; Practice in  
	Canada, 2nd ed. (1987), at para. 16:8070;  McWilliams,
	Canadian Criminal Evidence, ibid., at paras. 28:10711 
	to 10712.</pre>
    <pre>[34]  In  Regina  v. Robertson (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d)  385  (Ont.
C.A.),  Martin J.A. speaking for the majority at p.419, expressed
concern  that while it is proper to introduce evidence  at  trial
that the explanation of the accused has not been advanced at  any
early  stage,  if  related to silence after being  cautioned,  it
represents  a  trap  to an accused who relies  on  the  right  to
silence.  He  suggests  that  trial  judges  exercise   care   in
identifying a reason for introducing evidence of silence so as to
avoid the difficulty in instructing a jury once it has heard  the
evidence.
[35] Dubin J.A. delivered dissenting reasons directed to the
voluntariness of a statement and in obiter, observed at p. 399-
400:
          </pre>
    <pre>               As has been observed, evidence to be 
	  admissible must be relevant to an issue at
  	  trial. It has long been held that, in appropriate
	  cases, a trial Judge may instruct a jury that in
          considering the weight to be given to any
	  explanation advanced by an accused at trial, 
	  they may take into account whether such
          explanation had been given at an earlier time. 
	  An alibi is a very good example where such
	  instruction is appropriate. However, a general 
	  instruction of that nature does not zero in on the
          silence of the accused during interrogation. [Emphasis
	  added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>                     The  right of an accused to remain
          silent  in  the  face of police interrogation
          has    been   traditional   throughout    the
          development of the common law.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    As pointed out by Diplock, L.J., in
          R.  v.  Hall (1970), 55 Cr. App.R. 108 at  p.
          112:
               </pre>
    <pre>                    The caution merely serves to remind the
               accused of a right which he already possesses
               at common law. The fact that in a particular
               case he has not been reminded of it is no
               ground for inferring that his silence was not
               in  exercise of that right, but  was  an
               acknowledgement  of  the  truth  of  the
               accusation.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      In   the  absence  of  any  issue
          raised  by  the  defence,  the  mere  silence
          of      an      accused     during     police
          interrogation  cannot  be  said  to   advance
          the  case  for  the Crown.  It  cannot  be  a
          step   on  the  way  to  the  proof  of   the
          accused&#146;s  guilt.  It,  therefore,   becomes,
          in   my  opinion,  irrelevant  to  any  issue
          at   trial.   To  prove  as   part   of   the
          Crown&#146;s   case  the  fact  that  the  accused
          has   exercised  his  common  law  right   to
          remain  silent  would  constitute  silence  a
          trap   if   his   silence   is   placed    in
          evidence against him at his trial.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Applying  these principles to the facts presented  on  this
appeal it is clear to me that the trial judge erred in permitting
cross-examination  as to the silence of the  accused  upon  being
cautioned &#150; there was no obligation to report a crime as  implied
by  the  ruling and the silence of the accused was turned into  a
trap.  The  Crown was entitled to cross-examine the accused,  Ms.
Natoli,  and  the  passenger as to when  the  defence  was  first
discussed and what was related at the bail hearing, all  directed
to  the argument of recent fabrication. There was no necessity in
that  context, in Dubin J.A.&#146;s words, to &#147;zero in on the  silence
of the accused during interrogation.&#148;
[37] The trial judge&#146;s erroneous ruling then led directly to his
contradictory instructions to the jury that the failure to give
an explanation &#147;is something from which you should not derive any
inference which is adverse to the case of the accused person&#148;,
followed immediately by an instruction that the same fact of
silence could support an inference of recent fabrication. This is
a graphic demonstration of the difficulty in instructing a jury
once such evidence is admitted, as anticipated by Martin J.A. in
Robertson (supra). The accused was painted as a potential
perjurer by reason of his silence on arrest and in the same
breath the jury was told that no adverse inference as to his
defence should be drawn.
[38] In my view this ground of appeal represents a very serious
incursion into the Charter rights of the appellant and the
questions from the jury directed to the very issue of recent
fabrication and the credibility of the accused, would remove any
doubt, if such there were, that there is room for the application
of the proviso.
[39] In my view there must be a new trial, and while there are
four other grounds of appeal (some of which have been adverted to
in passing), and each of which had sufficient merit that we
called on the Crown for response, the errors that they purport to
identify are not such as are likely to recur at a new trial, and
I choose, in those circumstances, not to pursue them. Of course,
the sentence appeal is redundant.
[40] I would allow the appeal, quash the convictions and order a
new trial.</pre>
