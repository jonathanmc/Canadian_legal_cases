[1]  We do not accept the appellant&#146;s submission that the
evidence relating to the stolen Nintendo and the note left by the
appellant was inadmissible.  In our view, that evidence was
properly admitted, so long as care was taken not to use it as
evidence of propensity.  We are of the view that it was not so
used in the present case.
[2]  However, we have concluded that the reasons of the trial
judge reflect that he did not deal appropriately with the
question of reasonable doubt in assessing the appellant&#146;s
evidence.
[3]  The case turned essentially on the credibility of the
evidence of the appellant and of Ms. Reid.  Having regard to the
trial judge&#146;s repeated assertions that various aspects of the
appellant&#146;s evidence were &#147;not unreasonable&#148; or &#147;absolutely not
worthy of credibility&#148;, it appears that the trial judge failed to
consider whether, if he concluded that he did not believe the
appellant&#146;s testimony, he was, nonetheless, left in reasonable
doubt by that evidence.  By reason of his failure to consider
that question, the verdict cannot stand.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is allowed, the conviction set aside
and a new trial is ordered.
