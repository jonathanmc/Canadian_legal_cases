<p class=headingtitle><b><span

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the morning of February 25, 1990, Cindy Coulter, the main
plaintiff in this action, left the Pine Falls Lodge, where she had been a guest
for the night, to drive back to Sudbury. The Lodge was owned and operated by
the defendant Robert Hart.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>About three miles from the Lodge, the road on which she was
travelling crossed the railway tracks of the defendant Canadian National
Railway Co. (CN) at a crossing maintained by the defendant Ontario Ministry of
Natural Resources (MNR).</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Tragically, Ms. Coulter suffered catastrophic injuries that
morning, when her car was hit at the crossing by a CN freight train. In this
lawsuit she and her dependants sought compensation from CN, MNR and Mr. Hart.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Part way through the trial, Ms. Coulters damages were agreed
on at $2 million and a settlement awarding her that sum was approved by the
trial judge. Since then she has not been a part of these proceedings.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>By agreement, the task then left to the court was, as the
trial judge put it, to decide liability for the damages amongst the three
defendants, without reference to contributory negligence of the plaintiff.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Meehan J. apportioned negligence 35% to CN and 55% to MNR,
based on their relative responsibilities for the crossing, and 10% to Mr. Hart,
finding that he had a duty to warn Ms. Coulter of the dangers of the crossing.
Meehan J. went on to find that MNR was contractually bound to indemnify CN for
the railways negligence.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>All three defendants have appealed. For the reasons that
follow I would dismiss the appeals of CN and MNR, but would allow the appeal of
Mr. Hart.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>THE RELEVANT FACTS</u></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As Ms. Coulter drove towards the crossing, the road was on the
north side of the railway tracks. For some two kilometres leading to the
crossing the road was on railway lands as was the crossing itself.          </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The road turned south to cross the tracks. A driver
approaching the crossing from the north had a very limited view of trains
coming from the east, mainly due to an embankment to the northeast of the
crossing located partly on the railway right of way and partly on provincial
Crown land. The road sloped steeply just as it approached the tracks from the
north side.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The railway crossing was a private crossing protected only by
a sign erected by CN saying Private Crossing  Persons Using the Crossing Do
So At Their Own Risk  CN Rail. Because of increased use by cottagers and
other members of the public, MNR wished to have the crossing upgraded to the
status of a public crossing. However, MNR 
had not taken the safety related steps necessary for the upgrading. Both
MNR and CN were aware of the work that needed to be done in this regard.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The day of the accident was sunny, clear and cold and the road
incline just to the north of the tracks was icy. Since Ms. Coulter has no
memory of the event, the only evidence about how the accident happened came
from the train engineer who said that the car just seemed to slide down the
slope and stop on the crossing where it was hit by the train. The train crew
had no chance to avoid the collision.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In 1980, ten years before the accident, consistent with its
desire to ensure a viable crossing, MNR entered an agreement with CN to
maintain and repair the crossing to the satisfaction of CN. That agreement also
contained the indemnity provision relied on by CN.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Against this factual backdrop Meehan J. apportioned negligence
amongst the three defendants, CN, MNR and Mr. Hart. The trial judge fixed CNs
contribution at 35%. He fixed MNRs contribution at 55%, and found that MNR was
obliged to indemnify CN pursuant to the indemnity in the agreement. Finally, he
fixed Mr. Harts contribution at 10%. All three defendants have appealed. I
will address each appeal in turn.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>THE CN APPEAL</u></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The assessment of liability against CN was based on s.3(1) of
the <i>Occupiers Liability Act</i>, R.S.O.
1990 c.O.2  The trial judge found that
as owner of the right of way CN had responsibility for the condition of the
premises including the crossing. In failing to take reasonable care to ensure
that persons entering the crossing were reasonably safe, particularly by
failing to correct the deficient sight lines and the excessive slope, CN was
found to be in breach of s.3(1) of that Act. </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On appeal, CN argues that the applicable section of the Act is
4(1) not s.3(1). In the alternative, it argues that it met the requirements of
s.3(1).</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>These two sections read as follows:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'> 
3.(1)  An occupier of premises
owes a duty to take such care as in all the circumstances of the case is
reasonable to see that persons entering on the premises, and the property
brought on the premises by those persons are reasonably safe while on the
premises.</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=center style='text-align:center;text-indent:0cm'>*
* *</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'> 
4.(1) The duty of care provided for in subsection 3(1) does not apply
in respect of risks willingly assumed by the person who enters on the premises,
but in that case the occupier owes a duty to the person to not create a danger
with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage to the person or his or her
property and to not act with reckless disregard of the presence of the person
or his or her property.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the trial judge was correct to apply s.3(1) of the
Act. It cannot be said that when Ms. Coulters car slid down the icy slope onto
the railway tracks that she was willingly assuming the risks presented by the
crossing. Section 4(1) therefore has no application.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As to s.3(1) there was ample evidence to support the finding
that CN as owner of the right of way did not take reasonable care to make the
crossing reasonably safe for people like Ms. Coulter. CN knew of the
deficiencies in the crossing, particularly concerning the lack of visibility to
the east and the steep slope of the road coming from the north. It did nothing
to correct these deficiencies, which were significant causes of the accident.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would not therefore interfere with the finding of liability
against CN.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u>THE MNR APPEAL</u></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>MNR does not contest that it was properly found negligent. However,
it raises the following three arguments: first, that there is no causal
connection between its negligence and the accident; second, that it is
protected from liability by s.50(1) of the <i>Public
Lands Act</i>. R.S.O. 1990, c.P.43 and third, that it is not required to
indemnify CN.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The first argument is readily answered. The settlement
agreement between the defendants and the plaintiff removed from the trial any
issue of contributory negligence of the plaintiff. The fault found against MNR
was simply that as the party responsible for maintaining the crossing it failed
to take reasonable care to see that the crossing was reasonably safe for those
who use it.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Meehan J. found that MNR knew of the obstruction of vision,
the substantial slope of the north grade and problems with iciness on that
slope, yet did nothing to correct them. Further, he found that these were
substantial contributing factors to the accident. There was ample evidence
available to support these findings. I would therefore not give effect to this
argument.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The second argument depends on s.50(1) of the <i>Public Lands Act</i>. It reads as follows:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>(1)  No civil action shall be brought against the Crown or any person
in respect of misfeasance, non-feasance or negligence in connection with the
construction, maintenance, repair or closing of a road.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Road is defined in that Act as a road or part of a road on
public lands (subject to certain exceptions not relevant to this case). The
trial judge dismissed this argument because of his factual determination that
for some two kilometres before the entrance to the crossing the road was on
railway lands not on public lands. This too is a finding reasonably grounded in
the evidence and one with which I would not therefore interfere. Hence, this
road is not a road as defined in the <i>Public
Lands Act</i> and the Act is of no application to this case.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Since MNRs first two arguments fail, the finding of liability
against it must stand. As I have indicated, the trial judge apportioned the
relative degrees of fault of CN and MNR 35% to CN and 55% to MNR. Given that
the finding of fault against each must be sustained, neither CN nor MNR
challenge this apportionment on appeal and in my view there is no basis for
interfering with it.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>MNRs third argument arises from the agreement relating to the
crossing made in 1980 between <i>inter</i> <i>alia</i> MNR and CN. MNR wanted to ensure
the continued operation of the crossing in order to provide access to cottage
properties being developed, fuel wood lots and a dam that required servicing.
It therefore undertook in this agreement to maintain and repair the crossing at
its own risk and expense to the satisfaction of CN. The agreement also
contained the following indemnity provision: </p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>3. To at all times indemnify and
save harmless the Railway from all loss, expense and liability howsoever
incurred by the Railway, and the Licensee hereby waives this against the
Railway all claims of whatsoever nature and kind, where such loss, expense,
liability or claims arise directly or indirectly out of or are attributable to
the exercise by the Licensee or others of the privileges herein granted and
whether such loss, expense, liability or claims result from the negligence of
the Railway, or otherwise.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my view, the trial judge was correct to interpret this clause
to encompass the circumstance where CN is to be indemnified for its own
negligence. The ordinary meaning of the language of the indemnity clearly
extends to <u>all</u> loss expense and liability however incurred by CN<i>. </i>Moreover, in the context of this
agreement such an interpretation makes commercial sense. The trial judge put it
this way:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>In this case, it was not
unreasonable, on the evidence for the Railway to demand indemnification because
it was gaining no benefit from the crossing agreement, but rather the Railways
demands were to seek protection from liability, which might arise, as a result
of this operation of this crossing, which was continued in operation for the
benefit of the Ministry.</p>

</span>In summary, therefore, all three MNR arguments fail and its
appeal must be dismissed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge found that while Mr. Hart undertook from time
to time to plough the road on a voluntary basis there was no evidence that he
was aware of the icy conditions on the day of the accident. The trial judge concluded
that Mr. Harts ploughing of the road prior to February 25, 1990 was not
causally related to the accident and that his failure to salt or sand the
incline on that day did not constitute negligence on his part. He also held
that since Mr. Hart had no responsibility for or control over the condition of
the crossing he was not an occupier for the purposes of the <i>Occupiers Liability Act</i>. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Hart was, however, familiar with the crossing, its poor
visibility to the east and the short but steep grade of the road approaching it
from the north. The trial judge framed his finding of a duty on Mr. Hart to
warn Ms. Coulter of the dangers of the crossing in the following terms:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>Mr. Hart owed Mrs. Coulter a duty
as an invitee to use reasonable care to prevent injury or damage to her as a
guest from unusual dangers known to him and also those dangers of which he
should be aware.</p>

by the S.C.C. in <i><u>Stewart v. Routhier</u></i><u>
[1975], 1 S.C.R. 566 at 581</u>.</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'>In my view, he should have warned
the plaintiff of the unusual nature of the crossing when approached from the
north with its obstruction of view, the possibility of icy conditions and the
steep grade. I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that that failure
to warn contributed to the damages occasioned by the plaintiff, Cindy Coulter.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In my opinion, on the facts of this case the trial judge erred
in imposing a duty to warn on Mr. Hart.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The two cases relied on by the trial judge are cases of
occupiers liability, where the defendant occupied the premises posing an
unusual danger which resulted in harm. The use of these authorities, together
with the reference to the duty to Ms. Coulter as an invitee suggests that the
finding of a duty to warn was based on principles of occupiers liability<i>. </i>However, Mr. Hart was not an occupier
of the crossing, nor did he exercise any responsibility for or control over it.
It follows that he did not have a duty to warn Ms. Coulter pursuant to the <i>Occupiers Liability Act</i>.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor do I think that on these facts a common law duty to warn
could be assigned to Mr. Hart on the basis of the general approach to duty of
care set out in <i>City of Kamloops v.
Nielsen,</i> [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2. While it is unclear whether the trial judge
adopted this approach, any such analysis must proceed against the backdrop of
the reluctance of the common law to impose a duty on a person to take action to
assist another who is facing a risk of harm that the person played no part in
creating. See <i>Linden, Canadian Tort Law</i>
6<sup>th</sup> Edition at p.284. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The two stages of the <i>Kamloops</i>
test were set out by Wilson J. at pp. 10-11:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-left:108.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt;'>(1)       is there a sufficiently close
relationship between the parties (the [defendant] and the person who has
suffered the damage) so that, in the reasonable contemplation of the
[defendant], carelessness on its part might cause damage to that person? If so,</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-left:108.0pt;text-indent:-36.0pt;'>(2)       are there any considerations which ought
to negative or limit (a) the scope of the duty and (b) the class of persons to
whom it is owed or (c) the damages to which a breach of it may give rise?</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>While I recognize that the first of these steps presents a
relatively low threshold, I do not think that threshold is crossed in the
circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Hart played no part in the creation of the risk of harm
presented by the crossing. He had no responsibility for or control over it. Ms.
Coulter was on her way home three miles from the Lodge when she reached the
crossing. The road to the crossing was not used only by guests of the Lodge,
but by cottagers and members of the public as well. Mr. Hart was unaware of any
icing problems on the road that day. </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Taking these factors together, I do not think that there was a
sufficiently close relationship between Mr. Hart and Ms. Coulter with respect
to any risk posed by the crossing that in the reasonable contemplation of Mr.
Hart, carelessness on his part might cause her damage. Thus I conclude that Mr.
Hart was under no duty of care to warn her in this case.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Were it necessary, I would also find that at the second stage
of the analysis, policy considerations exist which must eliminate any such duty
here. There is an indeterminacy to the class to whom any such duty might be
owed  guests, suppliers, members of the public who use the road or who might
do so, etc. There is also an indeterminacy to its geographical scope   how far beyond three miles might it
extend?  Against the backdrop of the
reluctance of the common law to impose a duty to act on an innocent bystander,
such indeterminacy is a sufficient policy basis to conclude that it would not
be just to impose a duty of care on Mr. Hart in these circumstances.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I would therefore allow the Hart appeal and order that the
action by the plaintiffs and the cross-claims by CN and MNR be dismissed as
against Mr. Hart.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the result, the appeals of CN and MNR are dismissed. The
appeal of Mr. Hart is allowed. The judgment below is amended to reflect the
full apportionment of fault between CN and MNR in the ratio of  35 to 55 subject to the indemnity. The costs
order below is amended by changing paragraph 8(a) to give Mr. Hart his trial
costs on a party-and-party basis against his co-defendants.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Hart is entitled to his costs of the appeal from his
co-defendants. Following the apparent logic of the order at trial, the
indemnity between CN and MNR would appear to permit CN to recover its share of
these costs from MNR and it is so ordered.</p>
