    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Kennedy J. dated August 18, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Oxford Leaseway Ltd (Oxford) appeals from the judgment of
Kennedy J. ordering that the security interest held by Crop &amp;
Soil Service in two vehicles &#150; a 1996 Dodge Neon and a Dodge pick-
up truck &#150; had priority over Oxford.
[2]  The narrow issue on this appeal is whether Oxford was
obliged to register its lease agreement under the Personal
Property Security Act, 1989, S.O. 1989, c. 16 (&#147;P.P.S.A.&#148;).
[3]  Section 2 of the P.P.S.A. states that the Act applies to
every transaction without regard to its form that creates a
security interest, including a lease.
[4]  If the agreement is a true lease in which no security
interest was created, Oxford was not obliged to register it.  If,
on the other hand, the lease was in substance a financing
agreement, then Oxford was obliged to register the agreement in
order to obtain priority.  It is acknowledged that Oxford did not
register at all in the case of one vehicle and filed a late
registration, that is of no purport, in the other.
[5]  The appellant submits that the lease is a true lease in form
and substance.  One of the indicia of whether a lease is a true
lease is whether the payments made during the term of the lease
are payments for actual use of the vehicle.  If so, the option to
purchase at the end of the lease will be for fair market value.
[6]  We agree with Kennedy J. that the real substance of the
agreements in question is to secure financial payment and that
they are not true leases.  These are &#147;open end&#148; leases and the
options to purchase available to the lessee at the end of the
leases are not true options in which the lessee may acquire the
vehicle at fair market value.  This type of arrangement is
accurately described by Montgomery J. in HOJ Franchise Systems
Inc. v. Municipal Savings and Loan Corp. ( 1994), 6 P.P.S.A.C.
(2d) 302 (O.C.J.) at 309:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>While the form of contract between Municipal and the
consumer is a &#147;lease&#148; under which the consumer has a 
right to possession for a term of months or years in 
exchange for a monthly stream of payments, the lessee 
does not fulfil his obligations to the lessor simply 
by making those monthly payments and by returning the 
vehicle in reasonable condition at the end of the 
lease.  The lessee guarantees to the lessor that at 
the end of the lease the automobile will have a 
&#147;residual value&#148; in an amount specified at the 
commencement of the lease.  At his or her option, the
lessee may purchase the automobile for the &#147;residual 
value&#148; thus fulfilling his or her guarantee to the
lessor.  Alternatively, the lessor will sell the 
vehicle on a wholesale basis and deduct from the 
proceeds of sale the lessor&#146;s costs of sale, thus 
yielding the &#147;net proceeds of sale&#148;.  If the net
proceeds of sale is less than the residual value, 
the lessee is obliged to pay the &#147;deficiency&#148; on demand.</pre>
      <pre>The amount of the residual value is essentially a 
function of the monthly payment to which the &#147;lessor&#148;
and the &#147;lessee&#148; have agreed.</pre>
      <pre>.....</pre>
      <pre>... the lessor holds title to the automobile as 
security for the promise of the lessee to make the 
stream of payments stipulated in the lease and to 
purchase the vehicle at the end of the term of the 
lease by paying whatever principal amount of the 
debt is then left outstanding (&#147;the residual value&#148;).</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[7]  In the result, Montgomery J. held that the lease in HOJ was
in substance a financing arrangement.
[8]  In Re Cronin Fire Equipment Ltd. (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 269
(Ont. Gen. Div.), Rosenberg J. also held that a security interest
is created when the property in question has a predetermined
fixed value at the end of the lease and the lessee is entitled to
the profits or responsible for a deficiency upon the sale of the
property.
[9]  Here, for example, the total value of one of the leases in
question was $15,000.  The amount of the buyout after three years
was for $7,000.  (The second lease was essentially the same.)
The option to purchase is stated to be &#147;based upon an estimation
of what we feel the wholesale market value of this vehicle will
be at lease termination.&#148;  That is not, however, the actual
situation.  The agreement between the parties stipulates that
factors such as excess mileage, poor interior or exterior, poor
mechanical condition from lack of service, and changes in the
market conditions could affect the value of the vehicle.  The
lease goes on to say that the lessee has to bear the result of
any decrease in the market value of the vehicle.  If the lessee
chooses not to exercise the option to purchase, the vehicle goes
back to the owner and is sold at auction.  If the vehicles are
sold for more than $7,000, the lessee, and not the owner, gets to
keep the amount over $7,000.  Conversely, the lessee is liable
for any shortfall between the amount of the sale and $7,000.  The
amount of $7,000 represents the balance due and owing in respect
of a debt obligation at the end of the lease.  The obligations of
the lessee are not fulfilled by the lessee simply making the
rental payments and returning the vehicle at the end of the lease
in good condition.  The lessor holds title as security for the
payments during the currency of the lease and in respect of the
lessee&#146;s obligation to pay the sum of $7,000.
[10] In addition, it is clear from the amortization schedule
that, in the event the vehicle is returned to the owner during
the currency of the lease, the &#147;lessee&#148; is responsible for the
amount of the value of the vehicle at that time.  This is another
indicia that the transaction is driven by the cost of ownership
of the property in question as opposed to the cost of its use for
a limited period of time.
[11] The decisions relied upon by the appellant, Finchside
International Ltd. v. Roy Foss Motors Ltd. (1996), 10 P.P.S.A.C.
(2d) 33 (O.C.J.), Trexar Inc. v. Agnes Beckett and David Beckett
(1996), 11 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 356 (O.C.J.), and MTC Leasing v.
National Bank Leasing Inc. (1996), 12 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 319
(O.C.J.), do not involve open-ended leases and are
distinguishable on that basis.  The lessee was not obligated to
pay a fixed amount at the end of the lease irrespective of
whether the option to purchase was exercised.
[12] Accordingly, for the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed
with costs to the respondent.
