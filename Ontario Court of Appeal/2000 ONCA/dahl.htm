</strong>[1]  In our view, Mr. Justice Weekes, the summary conviction
appeal judge, was correcting in setting aside the stay of
proceedings.  The delay in completing the trial from December
15th to May 5th was attributable to the defence.  The case was
not reached on May 5th.  The defence was offered the next day to
complete the trial but was not available to do so.
[2]  The defence moved for a stay under s. 11(b).  In granting
the  stay, the trial judge attached significant weight to
concerns that he had about the scheduling of trials and the
availability of Crown Attorneys in that jurisdiction.  These
concerns, while perhaps well founded, had nothing to do with the
causes of the delay in this case.  We agree with Mr. Justice
Weekes that the trial judge erred in failing to properly consider
or balance those factors that were relevant to the s. 11(b)
issue.
[3]  We are satisfied, for the reasons expressed by Mr. Justice
Weekes, that when the relevant factors are fairly balanced, this
is not an appropriate case for a stay under s.11(b).  The
application for leave to appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
