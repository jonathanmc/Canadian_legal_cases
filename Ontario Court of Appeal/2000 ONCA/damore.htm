    <pre><strong>               Rodney M. Godard

    <pre><strong>HEARD:         April 28, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Quinn J. dated June 17, 1997.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T
</strong>                                
[1]  In 1996 Quinn J. ordered that the Danrus assessment proceed
without consideration of the issues of negligence and failure to
follow instructions.  Leave to appeal from this order was denied.
Given this, in our view, the assessment officer had no option but
to proceed with the assessment on that basis.
[2]  In the circumstances it is not open to this court to review
the merits of the order of Quinn J. of June 17, 1997, and we
would therefore dismiss the appeal.
[3]  In doing so we are not to be taken as in any way agreeing
with the assertion in the reasons of Quinn J. that the
relationship between the solicitors and Danrus was not a
solicitor/client relationship.  Indeed, Mr. Godard indicated he
would not be taking the position in the negligence litigation
that this issue had been finally adjudicated.
[4]  In the result the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
