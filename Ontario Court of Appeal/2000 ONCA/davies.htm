    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Colin L. Campbell dated
February 24, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LABROSSE J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Davies, Ward &amp; Beck appeals the order of Colin Campbell J.
which dismissed its motion to set aside the order of the
Registrar of the Assessment Office of the Ontario Court (General
Division) relating to the assessment of bills of fees and
disbursements delivered to Union Industries, Inc.
[2]  This appeal concerns the statutory authority and consequent
jurisdiction of the Registrar to make an order on requisition
under s. 3 of the Solicitors Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15 (also
referred to as &#147;the Act&#148;).</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[3]  Davies, Ward &amp; Beck (&quot;the solicitors&quot;) was retained
initially by Union Industries, Inc. (&quot;the client&quot;) in July 1986.
Over the course of the next twelve years, the solicitors provided
various services to the client related to litigation leading to a
judgment, a proposed appeal from that judgment, and attempted
collection of the judgment including services related to
securities issues and representation in bankruptcy proceedings.
[4]  Between April 15, 1987 and October 13, 1998, the solicitors
rendered twenty-nine bills of costs to the client.  All bills
were paid in full by the client except the last one dated October
13, 1998 and delivered to the client on October 28, 1998.
[5]  On November 23, 1998, pursuant to s. 3 of the Solicitors
Act, the client requisitioned an order from the Registrar of the
Assessment Office of the Ontario Court (General Division) (&#147;the
Registrar&#148;) &#147;that the bill of fees, charges and disbursements by
the said solicitor, copies of which are attached hereto, be
referred&#148; for assessment.   To the draft order, was attached all
twenty-nine bills that had been rendered to the client.
[6]  The order was obtained ex parte on the same date.
[7]  The material submitted to the Registrar consisted of a
Requisition by Client for Assessment of Solicitor&#146;s bill signed
by Blake, Cassels &amp; Graydon on behalf of the client, a draft
order with all bills attached, a Notice of Appointment which was
intended to be completed by the Assessment Officer and a
Solicitor&#146;s Requisition For An Appointment To Assess Costs.  This
last document bears no relevance to the proceedings: it is not a
solicitor who is seeking the assessment of his or her own bill,
it is the client seeking assessment of its lawyers' bills.
[8]  By way of  Notice of Motion dated December 29, 1998, the
solicitors sought to set aside the order of the Registrar,
essentially on the grounds that, as of the date of the order, a
timely requisition could be made only with respect to the last
bill delivered on October 28, 1998.  They argued that the other
twenty-eight accounts of various dates from April 15, 1987 to
August 4, 1998 could only be referred for assessment upon
application to the court pursuant to other sections of the
Solicitors Act.
[9]  On February 24, 1999, Campbell J. (&quot;the motions judge&quot;)
concluded that:</pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the accounts were part of a continuum 
	       of legal services provided by the solicitors;</pre>
    <pre>               (b)  there was an absence of evidence
               that previous bills, although paid, were
               to be considered final;</pre>
    <pre>               (c)  there was an onus on the solicitors
               to show the accounts were interim
               accounts; and</pre>
    <pre>               (d)  the Registrar did not lack
               jurisdiction to make the order.
          </pre>
    <pre>The motions judge dismissed the motion without costs.</pre>
    <pre>[10] It is my view that the motions judge erred in dismissing the
motion.  The Registrar had no jurisdiction to issue the order on
requisition. Even assuming that the Registrar had jurisdiction,
it was evident on the material that there were special
circumstances and the client was not entitled to obtain an order
on requisition.</pre>
    <pre><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[11] Section 3 of the Solicitors Act provides, in part, as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>      3. Where the retainer of the solicitor is not 
disputed and there are no special circumstances, an 
order may be obtained on requisition from a local 
registrar of the Ontario Court (General Division),</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>                                &#133;</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(b)  by the client, for the assessment of a bill 
already delivered, within one month from its delivery;</pre>
        <pre>                        &#133;
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12] This section allows a client to obtain an order on
requisition only when four statutory preconditions have been
satisfied: (a) the retainer is not is dispute (not an issue in
this case), (b) there are no special circumstances, (c) the bill
is already delivered and (d) the requisition is made within one
month of the delivery of the bill. See Re Solicitor, [1940] 4
D.L.R. 712 (Ont. S.C.) affirmed without reasons [1940] 4 D.L.R.
821 (Ont. C.A.) which confirmed that the authority of the
Registrar to issue an order for assessment is confined by the
statutory preconditions.
[13] In Re Peel Terminal Warehouses Ltd. and Wootten, Rinaldo &amp;
Rosenfeld (1978), 21 O.R. (2d) 857 (C.A.) this court concluded
that a Master could not allow an application to tax a solicitor&#146;s
bill where, because of a gap in the Solicitors Act, there was no
statutory basis for the taxation.  The Master must find his
jurisdiction to act in either the statute or a rule of court.
Where no such jurisdiction existed, the Master could not act.  A
fortiori, this principle applies in the present case and the
Registrar had no authority to issue an order for assessment on
requisition except as expressly conferred by the statute. In
other words, a registrar has no inherent jurisdiction.
[14] The requisition submitted to the Registrar on November 23,
1998 reads as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I REQUIRE and Order under section 3 of the Solicitors 
Act for the assessment of the Solicitor and client bill 
of costs delivered to me on or about 1996, the retainer 
of the solicitor not being disputed and there being no 
special circumstances.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Although one of the bills is dated April 16, 1996, the registrar,
on November 23, 1998, had no jurisdiction under s. 3 (b) to refer
for assessment a bill of costs delivered &quot;on or about 1996&quot;.  The
requisition on its face is defective as the stated time of
delivery of the bill falls outside the scope of the subsection.</pre>
    <pre>[15] Campbell J. did not address this defect.  Presumably, he did
not notice it and it was not brought to his attention.  It was
not addressed by either counsel in their respective factum or
during oral argument.  This court brought it to the attention of
counsel after judgment had been reserved and counsel were given
the opportunity to, and did, provide their submissions.
[16] It is submitted on behalf of the client that the year &#147;1996&#148;
is a typographical error and that the client had intended that
the requisition refer to 1998.   This submission has no merit.
It is questionable that the Registrar, exercising a purely
administrative function, had the authority to issue the order on
requisition even if she concluded that the year stated was a
typographical error.  However, even if the year is changed to
read &#147;1998&#148; (there are five bills dated in 1998), the correction
does little to assist the client. The requisition must include a
month and a day, not simply the year, in order to comply with
precondition (d).  The one-month window in the subsection
requires the requisition to be more specific than the year the
bill was delivered, otherwise it fails to comply with the
statute.
[17] The requisition was defective.  The draft order and the
order in its final form spoke of the twenty-nine bills attached
hereto.  It must be remembered that it is the requisition that
forms the basis for the granting of the order: it is not the
order that operates to validate the requisition.  Unless the
requisition was amended to specify the date, month and year in
order to conform to the statute, the defect was fatal and the
Registrar had no jurisdiction to, and should have refused to,
issue the order on requisition.
[18] Assuming, however, that this defect can be overlooked and
that the requisition could be read to relate to the date, month
and year of the last bill to conform with precondition (d), there
is another equally persuasive reason why the order should not
have been issued.  It relates to precondition (b). This issue was
not addressed by Campbell J.
[19] The unusual circumstances revealed in the material presented
to the Registrar brought into question precondition (b), namely,
whether there were &#147;special circumstances&#148;.
[20] These unusual circumstances are:</pre>
    <pre>
  1.   The bills involved a large number of accounts: twenty-nine
       bills.</pre>
    <pre>  2.   The accounts had been rendered over a period of over eleven
       years;</pre>
    <pre>  3.   The services described in the bills established that
       fundamentally different services had been rendered which 
       included accounts for services relating to litigation (both 
       for judgment and appeal), corporate services, and bankruptcy 
       proceedings;</pre>
    <pre>  4.   The bills disclosed two different file numbers, which may be
       indicative of some degree of finality between certain bills; 
       and</pre>
    <pre>  5.   All accounts rendered had been paid, except the last bill.</pre>
    <pre>     
With respect to this last particular, I am aware that in Aird &amp;
Berlis v. Federchuk (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 406 (Gen. Div.), Molloy
J. considered the effect of a paid bill when dealing with s. 3 of
the Act.  She stated at p. 411:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Suffice to say for the present purposes that I do not 
regard the payment of an account to constitute a &#147;special 
circumstance&#148;  which would preclude an assessment under 
s. 3(b).</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>I note that Molloy J. used the singular while section 3 refers to
&#147;special circumstances&#148; in the plural.</pre>
    <pre>[21] In my view, the payment of accounts is a factor to be
considered in deciding whether or not there are &#147;special
circumstances&#148;.  The totality of the circumstances must be
considered.  No single factor needs to be a special circumstance
by itself. I find support for this conclusion in the wording of
s. 11 of the Act which specifically deals with the payment of
bills and special circumstances.
[22] The phrase &#147;special circumstances&#148;, as it appears in s. 3 of
the Solicitors Act, was considered by this court in Rooney et al.
v. Jasinki, [1952] O.R. 869 (C.A.).  It was said to include &#147;any
circumstances of an exceptional nature affecting the matter of
costs or the liability of a solicitor&#146;s client which a judge, in
the exercise of his judicial discretion in each particular case,
may consider to justify a taxation&#148;.  As the court noted, if
special circumstances are present, the solicitor (or the client)
may apply to the court, on notice, for an order for assessment.
[23] In the present case, in light of the large number of bills,
the lengthy period of time involved, the nature of the services,
the different file numbers and the payment of twenty-eight out of
twenty-nine bills, the only reasonable conclusion is that there
were &#147;special circumstances&#148;.  Section 3 of the Act provides, in
limited circumstances, a summary and inexpensive procedure for an
assessment of costs between solicitor and client.  This is not
such a case.  I do not accept the submission that the client was
entitled to requisition the order and, in effect, shift the onus
to the solicitors on a motion to set it aside.  The client should
not have sought the order on requisition. The application for an
order for taxation of the solicitor and client bills should have
been brought on notice to the solicitors with proper evidentiary
support.
[24] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal with costs of the
motion below and this appeal.  I would set aside both the order
of Campbell J. dated February 24, 1999 and the order of the
Registrar dated November 23, 1998.</pre>
