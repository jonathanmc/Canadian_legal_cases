    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Hoilett dated August 28,
1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]       The appellant sued the respondents for damages for
personal injuries arising out of an automobile accident.  By
order dated August 28, 1998, Hoilett J. allowed the respondents&#146;
pre-trial motion under s. 266(3) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. I.8, and dismissed the appellant&#146;s action.  Hoilett J.
found that the injuries suffered by the appellant were not
sufficiently serious to bring her claim within the exceptions to
the immunity from liability provided to the respondents in s.
266(1) of the Insurance Act.
[2]  The appellant argues that the motions judge erred in basing
his decision solely on evidence that related to the appellant&#146;s
condition before 1997 and by disregarding the evidence of the
deterioration of her condition during the ensuing eighteen months
that preceded the argument of the motion on June 19, 1998.
[3]  I agree with the argument and for the reasons below, I would
allow the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Facts</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On May 9, 1991, the appellant Cheryl D&#146;Costa was a passenger
in the front seat of a vehicle owned by the respondent Mortakis
Tailor Ltd. and driven on Highway 417 in the City of Ottawa by
the respondent Constantin Mortakis.  Mortakis lost control of the
vehicle and it struck a concrete median.  There were no other
vehicles involved in the accident.
[5]  Shortly afterwards, Ms. D&#146;Costa was taken by friends to the
Ottawa General Hospital.  The attending emergency doctor
diagnosed a myofascial neck pain and a sprained right wrist.
There is no indication in the hospital record that Ms. D&#146;Costa
complained of losing consciousness at the time of the accident.
She was released from hospital the same day.  On May 12, Ms.
D&#146;Costa went to the Riverside Hospital in Ottawa complaining of
neck pain, back pain and head pressure.  She was diagnosed as
having a cervical sprain and given a cervical collar.
[6]  Following the accident, Ms. D&#146;Costa was treated by her
family doctor.  Initially, her principal complaints were neck
pain and headaches.  She managed these problems through massage
therapy, chiropractic treatments, analgesics and non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory medication.  In August 1992, she began to
complain of pain in her back, her jaw and her hip.
[7]  At the time of the accident, Ms. D&#146;Costa was 17 years of
age.  After the accident she continued her education and in June
1993 graduated from high school.  While at high school, she
participated in several sporting activities, including soccer,
volleyball and swimming.  She continued to be involved in the
Duke of Edinburgh Award Program, a program designed to recognize
extracurricular achievement in physical fitness and community
service.  She qualified for the silver and gold achievement
levels.  As part of this program, she went on five backpacking
expeditions between October 1991 and September 1993.
[8]  In September 1993, Ms. D&#146;Costa enrolled in the physical
education course at the University of Toronto.  This is a four-
year degree program which she successfully completed in June
1997.
[9]  On her arrival in Toronto, Ms. D&#146;Costa was referred to Dr.
Harold Becker who was asked to co-ordinate the assessment of her
injuries.  In January 1994, Dr. Becker reported that Ms. D&#146;Costa
had suffered a temporomandibular joint (jaw) injury and that she
was experiencing ongoing symptoms from soft tissue neck and back
strain.  Dr. Becker&#146;s full report is not in the material that was
filed with this court.  However, it appears from later reports
that he also concluded that Ms. D&#146;Costa had suffered a closed
head injury from which she was experiencing symptoms of a post-
concussive syndrome, including suffering from headaches.  Dr.
Becker referred Ms. D&#146;Costa to a physiotherapist and to a number
of other physicians for further assessment and treatment. On
January 21, 1994,  Ms. D&#146;Costa began this action.
[10] On September 1, 1994, Ms. D&#146;Costa was involved in a second
motor vehicle accident.  At her examination-for-discovery, she
testified that the second accident exacerbated her existing
injuries, but that by March 1995 she had returned to the same
physical condition she was in following the accident of May 9,
1991.  Dr. Becker saw Ms. D&#146;Costa again in December 1994 and
reported that the second accident caused her problems to flare up
to some extent but that her main difficulties clearly related to
the first accident.
[11] In a report dated December 15, 1994, Dr. Becker noted that
Ms. D&#146;Costa was experiencing cognitive difficulties.  He said
that she demonstrated problems consistent with a closed head
injury.  She continued to have headaches and those &#147;appear to be
prolonged, indicating a likely long-term problem.&#148;  He also noted
that she was still reporting pain in her neck, back, jaw and
right knee.  Dr. Becker observed that Ms. D&#146;Costa was a very
straightforward young woman and that he expected that she would
continue to improve.
[12] Dr. Becker saw Ms. D&#146;Costa again on June 20, 1996.  He
reported that she continued to present with ongoing post-
concussive symptoms relating to a closed head injury.  He said
that physically, she demonstrated a normal clinical examination.
However, she reported continuing pain and difficulty with higher
levels of physical activity.  He said that he did not know what
her future held and that it was unclear if she could remain in
the field of physical education training.  He said he thought
that she would be able to function as a stewardess (her summer
job at the time) without difficulty.
[13] Ms. D&#146;Costa began to see Dr. Lhotsky, a family physician, in
March 1996.  In October 1996, he reported that her complaints had
not changed since he had started to see her.  She complained of
persistent headaches, neck pain, tiredness, problems with
concentration, easy frustration, memory lapses and overall a
depressed mood.  He was of the opinion that physically she had
reached a plateau and that some of her symptoms might continue
indefinitely.
[14] Ms. D&#146;Costa was examined for discovery on July 9, 1996 and
again on November 7, 1996.  She testified that there were some
components of her course work in the physical education program
at the University of Toronto that she was unable to complete
because of her injuries.  She mentioned pole vaulting, hurdles,
swimming and gymnastics.  On the other hand, she was able to take
part in a large number of physical activities.  She completed a
neuromuscular conditioning course that involved an exercise
program of running, weight training and sit-ups.  She went on a
three-day canoe trip in Algonquin Park.  She competed as a
coxswain on the University of Toronto rowing team in the fall of
1993 and as a member of the Argonaut rowing club in the spring of
1994.  She maintained a B- and B average in her academic and
practical courses respectively.  She said that her injuries had a
detrimental effect on her marks in high school and at university.
[15] In October 1996, private investigators conducted video
surveillance of Ms. D&#146;Costa over a four-day period.  The written
reports of the surveillance describe Ms. D&#146;Costa as walking
quickly with a strong gait.  There was no evidence that her
actions were limited by pain or discomfort.  The motions judge
who saw the videos said: &#133; they portray an average young
university student of extraordinary energy.&#148;
[16] In the summers of 1994, 1995 and 1996, Ms. D&#146;Costa was
employed as a full-time stewardess at Royal Airlines.  She
remained employed on a part-time basis during her third and
fourth years at university.  From October 1995 to December 1996
she also worked part-time shifts as a hostess at the Sheraton
Centre in Toronto.
[17] In June 1996, Ms. D&#146;Costa was seen by a neurologist, Dr.
M.B. Weber.  He was of the opinion that Ms. D&#146;Costa had likely
suffered a mild concussion at the time of the accident and that
she had developed a post-concussion syndrome.  Dr. Weber reviewed
the results of an EEG and of a brain mapping study.  He concluded
that there was objective evidence to support his clinical
diagnosis that Ms. D&#146;Costa had suffered a concussion followed by
the clinical features of a post-concussion syndrome.  He said
that the studies corresponded with Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s complaints of
dysphasia and dyslexia.
[18] At the request of her accident benefits insurer, a clinical
psychologist, Judith Shapiro conducted a neuropsychological
assessment of Ms. D&#146;Costa.  In her report of October 1, 1996, Ms.
Shapiro said that to the extent that Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s cognitive
abilities were less than expected, it was questionable whether
such a result was a sequela to a head injury suffered in the
accident.  The cognitive complaints, in her opinion, were more
consistent with a pre-existing neuropsychological weakness or
with emotional difficulties than with a head injury.  She said
that Ms. D&#146;Costa should be reassured that she likely did not have
a head injury.  She also said that Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s complaints and
her neuropsychological profile were suggestive of post-traumatic
stress disorder and that the deficiencies identified were quite
mild in nature.  She concluded that overall the prognosis was
quite favourable.
[19] Ms. D&#146;Costa graduated from university in June 1997 and began
full time employment as a stewardess with Royal Airlines.
[20] On January 4, 1998, Dr. Lhotsky reported that Ms. D&#146;Costa
continued to complain of intermittent neck pain, upper and lower
back pain, right hip and knee pain and headaches.  He arranged
for an appointment for her at the Rothbart Pain Management
Clinic.  He said her long-term prognosis remained guarded.
[21] On March 6, 1998, the respondents brought the motion under
s. 266(3) seeking a determination that Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s injuries did
not come within the exceptions to the immunity set out in s.
266(1) and seeking to have her action dismissed.  In support of
the motion, the respondents relied on material that, with one
minor exception, related to Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s condition before 1997.
[22] In response, Ms. D&#146;Costa introduced a number of medical
reports and her own affidavit.  The most important medical
reports were those of Dr. G.D. Gale of the Rothbart Pain
Management Clinic.  He had seen Ms. D&#146;Costa on March 9 and March
25, 1998.  In a report dated April 22, 1998, Dr. Gale concluded
that Ms. D&#146;Costa had significant limitations both physically and
cognitively which affected her work as an airline stewardess as
well as her domestic and recreational activities.  He said that
she was partially disabled even though she managed to hold down
her job.  He also said that it was only a matter of time before
she would have to give up the job entirely.  It was 6 ½ years
since the accident and there would probably not be any further
spontaneous improvement in her condition.
[23] It was Dr. Gale&#146;s opinion that the post-concussion syndrome
diagnosed by Dr. Weber and the musculoskeletal problems would
deteriorate over time and that there would come a point when she
could no longer work.  He said that if should she lose her job
with Royal Airlines she would have great difficulty finding
another type of work.  He noted that there were further tests to
be done with respect to her musculoskeletal injuries.  Diagnostic
blocks of the cervical spine, the lumbar spine and the sacroiliac
joints were scheduled for September 1998.  If positive, these
tests would provide objective evidence of the spinal and
sacroiliac joint injuries.
[24] In May 1998, Ms. D&#146;Costa took leave from her job on the
basis of her physical limitations.  On May 11 1998, Dr. Gale
certified that Ms. D&#146;Costa was unfit to work for a period of
three weeks due to spinal injury and cervicogneic headaches.
[25] On June 5, 1998, Dr. Gale provided an attending physician&#146;s
statement in support of a disability coverage claim being made by
Ms. D&#146;Costa.  In that statement he noted that her symptoms were
getting worse and that the period during which she would be
unable to work was unknown.  He stated that she was unable to
work because of physical limitations in bending, lifting and
standing.
[26] In an affidavit sworn on June 16, 1998, Ms. D&#146;Costa
described her condition during the time she held full-time
employment with Royal Airlines.  She said that she had tried to
maintain full-time employment, but that her physical injuries,
most significantly her low back pain, had been aggravating her
and were getting worse.  The ongoing pain interfered with her
ability to perform her job tasks such as leaning over passengers
to pass them items and carrying full pots of coffee.
[27] Ms. D&#146;Costa said she wished to return to work.  She said
that Dr. Gale questioned whether she will ever be able to work
for an airline again.  He had advised her that she would likely
have to choose between being a mother and a career woman, since
physically she will be capable of doing only one or the other.
[28] The respondents did not cross-examine Ms. D&#146;Costa on this
affidavit.
[29] The motion was heard on June 19, 1998.  In a brief
endorsement dated August 28, 1998, the motions judge allowed the
motion and dismissed Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s action.</pre>
    <pre>The legislation</pre>
    <pre>[30] Section 266(1) of the Insurance Act provides as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>	266(1)    In respect of loss or damage arising 
	directly or indirectly from the use or operation, 
	after the 21st day of June, 1990, of an 
	automobile and despite any other Act, none of the
        owner of an automobile, the occupants of an 
	automobile or any person present at the incident 
	are liable in an action in Ontario for loss or 
	damage from bodily injury arising from such use or
        operation in Canada, the United States of America 
	or any other jurisdiction designated in the 
	Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule involving the 
	automobile unless, as a result of such use or 
	operation, the injured person has died or has 
	sustained,
          </pre>
    <pre>        (a)  permanent serious disfigurement; or

        (b)  permanent serious impairment of an important 
	bodily function caused by continuing injury which 
	is physical in  nature.1</pre>
    <pre>[31] Sections 266(3) and (4) establish procedures for determining
if an injured person comes within one of the exceptions in s.
266(1).  Those sections read as follows:</pre>
    <pre>	s.266(3)  In an action for loss or damage from 
	bodily injury arising directly or indirectly from 
	the use or operation of an automobile, the judge 
	shall, on motion made before or at trial, determine 
	if the injured person has, as a result of the accident,
        died or has sustained,
          </pre>
    <pre>        a)   permanent serious disfigurement; or
          </pre>
    <pre>        b)   permanent serious impairment of an important 
	bodily function caused by continuing injury which is 
	physical in nature.
          </pre>
    <pre>        (4)  Even though a defence motion under subsection (3) 
	is denied, the defendant may, at trial, in the absence 
	of the jury, and following the hearing of evidence, raise 
	the defence provided in subsection (1).</pre>
    <pre>[32] If a case comes within one of the exceptions, the immunity
created by s. 266(1) does not apply and the injured person may
sue for loss or damage from bodily injury at large:  Meyer v.
Bright (1994), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.).
[33] In Chilman v. Dimitrijevic (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 536 at 541,
this court described the onus on a motion under s. 266(3) as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               To summarize, in establishing whether a 
	  plaintiff has met the requirements of s. 266(3) 
	  with respect to personal injuries, whether at 
	  trial or on a pre-trial motion:
          </pre>
    <pre>               a)   The onus is on the party alleging
          the injury to bring himself or herself within
          the statutory exception.
          </pre>
    <pre>               b)   With respect to past or existing
          matters, the standard of proof is upon a
          balance of probabilities.
          </pre>
    <pre>               c)   With respect to what will happen in
          the future, a party can satisfy the onus by
          showing upon expert or cogent evidence that
          there is a substantial possibility that a
          particular event or a condition may occur.</pre>
    <pre>Motion judge&#146;s reasons</pre>
    <pre>[34] In his endorsement, the motions judge said that the
essential facts set out in the respondents&#146; factum were admitted
as accurate.  Those facts, supported by several minutes of
videotaped surveillance, led him to observe that the appellant&#146;s
athletic and academic accomplishments after the accident were
enviable by any standard.  He said that there was nothing to be
gained by a review of the conflicting expert opinions because
expert opinions can never be a substitute for common sense.  He
concluded that the undisputed facts belied Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s
entitlement to assert the claim which he found did not come
within the exception in s. 266(1)(b) upon which she relied.  He
therefore allowed the motion and dismissed the action.</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[35] Ms. D&#146;Costa argues that the motions judge erred by basing
his decision solely on evidence that related to her condition
before 1997 and by disregarding the medical evidence and the
evidence of the deterioration of her condition up to the time of
the motion.
[36] The motions judge&#146;s finding that Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s condition
fell short of coming within the exception set out in s. 266(1)(b)
was a finding of fact and as such is deserving of deference from
this court.
[37] It is well settled that an appellate court may interfere
with a finding of fact if the court below disregards evidence
relevant to the issue being determined.  In Harper v. The Queen
(1982), 133 D.L.R. (3d) 546 (S.C.C.), Estey J. expressed this
principle as follows, at p. 563:
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>An appellate tribunal has neither the duty nor the 
right to reassess evidence at trial for the purpose 
of determining guilt or innocence.  The duty of the 
appellate tribunal does, however, include a review 
of the record below in order to determine whether 
the trial Court has properly directed itself to all 
the evidence bearing on the relevant issues.  Where 
the record, including the reasons for judgment, 
discloses a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence 
and more particularly the complete disregard of such 
evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal 
to intercede.  &#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[38] These comments were made in the context of an appeal from a
decision that was made after a trial.  However, the same
principle applies to appeals from judgments or orders made after
a motion where the entire record consists of documentary or
written evidence:  Re Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton
Hills (Town) (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 at 336 (C.A.);  Carter v.
Brooks (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 321 at 329-330 (C.A.).
[39] In the present case, the motions judge seems to have
completely disregarded the evidence led by Ms. D&#146;Costa that
related to her condition after 1996 and most particularly her
condition in the period immediately leading up to the motion.  He
based his decision on the evidence of the surveillance which took
place in 1996 and on the undisputed facts set out in the
respondents&#146; factum.  Although that factum was not before this
court, the reference is clearly to the athletic, academic and
employment activities of Ms. D&#146;Costa that were described by her
on her examination for discovery and which I have summarized
above.  These activities obviously took place prior to the
examination for discovery which was completed in November 1996.
[40] The motions judge dealt with the various medical reports by
making two brief comments.  First, he said that there was nothing
to be gained from reviewing conflicting expert opinions.  The
difficulty with this comment is that most of the medical reports
were not in conflict.  Arguably, there was conflict between the
report of Ms. Shapiro, the clinical psychologist, and Dr. Weber,
the neurologist, about whether Ms. D&#146;Costa had suffered a
concussion in the accident and whether that accounted for the
cognitive difficulties she was experiencing in 1996.  That aside,
there was no serious conflict in the other reports.  In
particular, the reports of Dr. Lhotsky and Dr. Gale about Ms.
D&#146;Costa&#146;s condition in the six months leading up to the motion
were the only reports relating to her condition at that time.
Dr. Gale certified that immediately before the motion Ms. D&#146;Costa
was not able to work.  He was not able to say when, if at all,
she would be able to return to work.
[41] The motions judge also said that expert opinions can never
be a substitute for common sense.  He said that the undisputed
facts belied Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s entitlement to a claim.  Clearly, the
motions judge was skeptical about the seriousness of Ms.
D&#146;Costa&#146;s complaints.  The effect of the motion judge&#146;s
conclusion, however, was to substitute his view of Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s
condition for that of the two doctors who had seen her in 1998.
With respect, this was not really an exercise of common sense,
but more of an expression of a medical opinion that her condition
could not have deteriorated to the extent described in the
uncontradicted reports of the two doctors.
[42] In adopting this approach, the motions judge also implicitly
rejected the evidence of Ms. D&#146;Costa that in May 1998 she was
physically not able to work as a stewardess.  As I mention above,
there was no cross-examination of Ms. D&#146;Costa on her affidavit.
The motions judge did not refer to this evidence nor did he give
any reason to justify disregarding it out of hand.
[43] In summary, I am satisfied that the motions judge erred in
disregarding the evidence that related to Ms. D&#146;Costa&#146;s condition
in the months leading up to the hearing of the motion in June of
1998.
[44] I am also satisfied that the evidence that the motions judge
disregarded was capable, if accepted, of establishing that Ms.
D&#146;Costa&#146;s injuries came within the exception in s.266(1)(b).  In
Meyer v. Bright, at 137, this court said that the appropriate
approach in cases considering this exemption is to answer
sequentially the following three questions:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   Has the injured person sustained permanent impairment of a
bodily function caused by continuing injury which is physical in
nature?
2.   If the answer to question 1 is yes, is the bodily function,
which is permanently impaired, an important one?
3.   If the answer to question 2 is yes, is the impairment of the
important bodily function serious?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[45] The evidence in this case, if accepted, establishes that Ms.
D&#146;Costa suffered soft tissue injuries and a closed head injury,
both of which are physical in nature and that 6 ½ years after the
accident those injuries prevented her from working at her chosen
occupation. The prognosis was that her condition was unlikely to
improve.  For Ms. D&#146;Costa, the bodily functions impaired by these
injuries are important and the impairment is serious in that she
is unable to perform the physical tasks necessary for her job.
This condition, if it is found to exist, would come within the
exception in s. 266(1)(b).  Accordingly, in my view, the decision
of the motions judge must be set aside.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[46] I see no benefit in remitting this case to another motions
judge for disposition. This court has the authority to make any
order that ought to or could have been made in the court below:
s. 134(1)(a) Courts of Justice Act. The entire record consists of
affidavits, medical reports and other written evidence.  We are
in as a good a position as a judge in the court below to dispose
of the respondents&#146; motion.
[47] Counsel suggested that if we were to allow the appeal, we
should either dismiss the respondents&#146; motion or adjourn it to
the trial judge.
[48] One interpretation of the language in s. 266(3) appears to
require the judge hearing a motion before trial to decide the
issue raised by the motion rather than adjourn it to the trial
judge.  The section reads: &#147;&#133;the judge shall, on motion made
before or at trial, determine if the injured person&#133;&#148; comes
within one of the exceptions in s. 266(1).  However, this court
in Chilman v. Dimitrijevic held that a judge hearing a pre-trial
motion may adjourn the motion to the trial judge if the motion is
premature or if the motion judge is unable for any reason to
fairly determine the issue:  see also Grossi v. Bates (1995), 21
O.R. (3d) 564 at 566.  I accept that adjourning the motion to the
trial judge is an available option.
[49] In my view, however, the proper course in this case is for
this court to dismiss the respondents&#146; motion.  The respondents
chose to bring the motion before trial.  Ms. D&#146;Costa filed
material, medical reports and her affidavit, which, if accepted,
would bring her claim within the exception in s. 266(1)(b).  The
respondents did not challenge this evidence either by way of
cross-examination or by filing material in response.  Rather,
they chose to rely on the argument that the evidence introduced
by Ms. D&#146;Costa was not credible in light of the evidence of Ms.
D&#146;Costa&#146;s physical capabilities before 1997.  That argument, it
seems to me, asks the court to substitute its view of Ms.
D&#146;Costa&#146;s condition at the time of the motion for the opinion of
the two doctors who saw her in 1998 and whose reports are in the
record.  I am not prepared to do that on the basis of the record
before this court.  Accordingly, I am of the view that Ms.
D&#146;Costa has satisfied the onus of showing that her claim comes
within the exception in s. 266(1)(b).
[50] Finally, I would observe that there is little to be gained
by adjourning this motion to the trial judge.  The respondents
will be free, at trial, after the evidence is heard, to raise
again the defence of the immunity provided in s. 266(1).  If they
do so, the trial judge will determine the issue on the basis of
the evidence introduced at trial.  That evidence may be
significantly different than the evidence introduced on the pre-
trial motion.  The fact that the respondents&#146; pre-trial motion
was dismissed will not be a bar to the respondents bringing a new
motion at trial.2
[51] In the result, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order
of the motions judge and dismiss the respondents&#146; motion with
costs of the motion and the appeal to the appellant.

1 In 1993, the Insurance Act was amended (see S.O. 1993, c. 10).
For automobile accidents occurring after the effective date
(January 1, 1994), s. 266 was replaced by s. 267.1 Although there
are some significant changes in these amendments, the language
creating the exceptions from the immunity established by the new
section is the same as the comparable language in s. 266(1).
2 Under the amendments to the Insurance Act mentioned above, this
is no longer the case.  Section 267.1(3) provides that a pre-
trial motion may only be brought on the consent of the parties or
by order of a pre-trial judge.  Section 267.1(4) provides that
the determination of the judge on a pre-trial motion is binding
on the parties at trial.<!-- /NOKISS --><!-- NOKISS --></pre></td>
