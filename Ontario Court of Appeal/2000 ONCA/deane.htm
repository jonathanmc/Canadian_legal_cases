    <pre><strong>WEILER J.A. (Dissenting):</strong></pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On April 28, 1997, the appellant was found guilty of
criminal negligence causing death.  He received a conditional
sentence of imprisonment of two years less a day.  The appellant
appeals his conviction.  The Crown cross-appeals the sentence.
[2]  Of the several issues raised on the conviction appeal, I
propose to deal with only one in detail.  That issue is whether
the trial judge erred in failing to hold a voir dire with respect
to three sets of statements made by the appellant.  For the
reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal on this point and
order a new trial.  As a result, it is not necessary to deal with
any of the other grounds of appeal raised as to conviction, and
the Crown&#146;s cross-appeal as to sentence is moot.  Because there
must be a new trial, I will give a bare outline of the facts
sufficient to understand the context of the issue.  Some detailed
reference to the evidence is, however, necessary in order to
appreciate the context in which the issue concerning the voir
dire arose.

Role of Appellate Court when lack of voir dire is ground of
appeal</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In R. v. Hodgson (1998), 127 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 472
(S.C.C.), Cory J. dealt with the role of an appellate court when
it is alleged on appeal that the trial judge failed to hold a
voir dire:

      &#133;the test for holding a voir dire is assessed by an
      appellate court&#146;s objective review of the evidence
      in the record to determine whether something should
      have triggered the trial judge&#146;s obligation to conduct
      an inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  With this issue in mind, I will now attempt to review the
background facts and the evidence in the record pertaining to
this issue.</pre>
    <pre>Facts and Excerpts from Trial Record</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Ipperwash Provincial Park (the &#147;Park&#148;) was occupied by a
group of First Nations people in early August 1995 in connection
with a land claim dispute.  As a result of certain incidents, an
Ontario Provincial Police Crowd Management Unit (&#147;CMU&#148;) was
instructed to secure a sand-covered roadway just outside the
Park.  On the night of September 6, 1995, the CMU assembled and
walked down an asphalt road known as East Parkway Drive towards
the Park.  (For ease of reference, a map of the area is attached
to these reasons.)  The CMU was supported by armed members of the
Ontario Provincial Police Tactics and Rescue Unit (&#147;TRU&#148;).  The
appellant had been a member of the TRU for 10 years and was an
Acting Sergeant within the unit.
[6]  When the CMU approached, the people on the sand-covered
roadway retreated into the Park.  The police, having accomplished
their goal at that time, retreated.  Some occupiers came back out
of the Park, however, and the CMU was commanded to rush toward
them at running speed.  The members did so.  Some of the
occupiers were slammed with shields and others were struck with
batons.  One person, Cecil George, was seen struggling with a
number of officers and he was eventually handcuffed and removed
from the scene.  The CMU moved back up East Parkway Drive.  A
school bus, followed by a car, came out of the Park and drove up
East Parkway Drive towards the officers.  The officers scattered
to either side of the road.  The car veered to the right and
struck some of the officers.  Several officers opened fire at the
car, and the car began to reverse back towards the Park.  As the
car was backing up, the appellant fired three shots at a man who
was crouched in front of the sand-covered roadway at the
intersection of East Parkway Drive and Army Camp Road.  The
appellant believed he wounded the man and that the injury was
possibly fatal; the man who was shot, Dudley George, did in fact
die from the injuries.  Following the incident in front of the
Park, the appellant proceeded to &#147;fall back&#148; with the rest of the
CMU to their headquarters, the Tactical Operations Centre (the
&#147;TOC site&#148;), located between 500 metres and one kilometre west of
the Park.
[7]  The appellant was charged with criminal negligence causing
death.  The Crown&#146;s position at trial was that the appellant had
fired a spray of bullets randomly towards the Park following the
demonstrators&#146; acts against the police.  The appellant testified
at his trial and denied that he had shot randomly into the Park
area.  He said that, as the car which struck the officers was
reversing, he saw muzzle flashes from a sandy berm.  The
appellant testified that he fired his rifle at the muzzle
flashes.  Then he saw a man with a rifle move from the sandy
berm, from which he had previously seen muzzle flashes, to East
Parkway Drive at the point where it intersects with Army Camp
Road.  The man hid down by a ditch by three posts.  The man aimed
his rifle at the police, whereupon the appellant fired three
bullets at him.
[8]  In order to test the appellant&#146;s credibility, he was cross-
examined at trial with respect to statements that he made, or did
not make, about the shooting, both during and immediately after
the incident.  Within this time period, there are three distinct
stages.  The first stage was during the confrontation in front of
the Park, at which time the TRU officers were able to communicate
with each other, as the dramatic events unfolded, by means of a
radio communications system.  Each officer had a walkie-talkie
and a headset by which the officer could relay statements to
other TRU members by activating a switch.  These communications
were monitored by a supervising officer, Sgt. Skinner, located at
the TOC site.  The second stage was during the TRU&#146;s fall-back
from the Park, at which time the officers continued to
communicate by means of the radio communications system.  (A tape
recording of the radio communications that is normally made was
unavailable in this case.)  The third stage was at the TOC site
itself, after the fall-back was complete, during which time the
appellant, according to his testimony, made verbal reports to
Sgt. Skinner.  No voir dire was held with respect to the
statements made during any of the three time periods.
[9]  At the outset of the trial, Crown counsel indicated that
there was no need for a voir dire with respect to Charter and
voluntariness issues relating to certain notes and statements by
the appellant.  Defence counsel indicated he was authorized to
admit that these notes and statements were freely and voluntarily
given.
[10] The position of the defence was that the appellant had an
honest and reasonable belief that Dudley George posed a deadly
threat to officers when the appellant fired at him.  At the end
of his examination-in-chief, the appellant was asked the
following questions and gave these answers:

          Q.   How long did you stay on duty?
          A.   Well for the remainder of that night I
               was still on duty.
          Q.   What doing?
          A.   I&#146;m sorry?
          Q.   Doing what?
          A.   I spoke with my team leader, my
               commander and told him&#133;
          Q.   As a result, go ahead&#133;
          A.   Just told him what had transpired.
          Q.   And did you as soon as you were asked to
               do so, cooperate with the SIU?
          A.   Oh yes I did.  Yes.</pre>
    <pre>[11] In cross-examination, Crown counsel suggested to the
appellant that the muzzle flashes had been a fabrication.  In
response, the appellant stated his initial testimony to the
effect that he had mentioned muzzle flashes over the radio during
the TRU&#146;s fall-back from the Park.  The testimony proceeded as
follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   All right so you're telling us that
               notwithstanding the fact you had time to
               move 20 meters and notwithstanding the
               fact that you never shot at those muzzle
               flashes again, you never got on your
               head set to warn your fellow officers
               about this potential threat, is that
               right?
          A.   Yes that's right.
          Q.   Now is it possible that you didn&#146;t get
               on the head set because there never was
               muzzle flashes?
          A.   No it is not.  I did not have time as I
               told you to get onto the com system.
          Q.   Did you tell Staff Sergeant Skinner when
               you got back to the TOC centre that
               there were muzzle flashes out in the
               sandy berm?
          A.   Yes I did.
          Q.   You did?
          A.   Yes.  As soon as the crowd management
               unit had formed up and started to go
               back down East Parkway Drive, we had
               accounted for all our members&#133;
          Q.   Okay&#133;
          A.   The crowd management unit and TRU team
               members and it was at that time I
               advised Staff Sergeant Skinner of the
               events.
          Q.   Was this face to face or over the
               communications&#133;
          A.   No this was over the communication
               system.
          Q.   This was over the communication system
               now?
          A.   Yes it was.
                                &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Is that communication over the TRU
               headset is it taped?
          A.   Yes it is.
                                  &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Because clearly that would be
               confirmatory of your position if you had
               a tape that said that you told Staff
               Sergeant Skinner that there were muzzle
               flashes?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   Now similarly, let&#146;s go to your location
               when you shot Dudley George.  Now we&#146;re
               going to talk about, in some more detail
               about his location at a later point and
               his movements but all I want to know
               right now is this, did you get on the
               communication and say &#147;there is a man
               scanning our officers with a firearm.&#148;
          A.   No I did not.
                                  &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Well did you get on the com system after
               you shot him and say &#147;I just shot a man,
               he may still be dangerous out on the
               roadway.&#148;
          A.   I believe I said at the time to Staff
               Sergeant Skinner that a bus had came
               through our position, a car had came
               into our position striking members and
               also there is one individual down and we
               required an ambulance.</pre>
    <pre>The Crown then asked:
          Q.   Did you say anything over the
               communication system about a rifle?
          A.   That I cannot recall
                                  &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   &#133; repeat what if you would please what
               you did say with respect to the man that
               you shot over the communication system?
          A.   I told Staff Sergeant Skinner that there
               was an individual down and we would
               require an ambulance at that area.
          </pre>
    <pre>The Crown persisted:
          Q.   But you didn&#146;t say to him, I just shot a
               man with a rifle?
          A.   I do not believe I said that.  I cannot
               recall that.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Subsequently, Crown counsel suggested to Deane that any
statements he made over the radio communications system would
have been heard by Sgt. Skinner, and that Skinner could verify
what he heard if called to testify.  According to the transcript:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Okay so let me get this straight what
               should be over the communication system
               with respect to Staff Sergeant Skinner,
               let's do this, you&#146;re telling us that
               anything that's over the communication
               system should be on a tape, right?  And
               that tape should be available to us,
               right?
          A.   It should be yes.
          Q.   And also Staff Sergeant Skinner should
               have heard what you told him over the
               communication system, right?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   And if Staff Sergeant Skinner came and
               testified he could tell us that he took
               notes of the important things and can
               remember it, what he heard you tell him?
               Right?
          A.   Yes sir, sir.
          Q.   Have you discussed Staff Sergeant
               Skinner's notes?
          A.   No I have not.
          </pre>
    <pre>  Mr. Scott:   Your Honour I intend to go over
               these notes with Sergeant Deane pursuant
               to Section 11 of the Canada Evidence Act
               as a prior oral inconsistent statement
               and if necessary I will be proving them
               by calling Staff Sergeant Skinner.
               Okay.  That's where I'm going with this.</pre>
    <pre>Shortly after providing this notice of his intention to rely on
s.11 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.C-5, the Crown
continued with the cross-examination as follows:

          Q.   Okay, Okay I&#146;m just going back a bit
               because I want to be fair to you about
               what went over the communication system
               that is noted by Staff Sergeant Skinner
               and one of the first things he does here
               just to show this to you in his notes,
               it says &#147;Alpha&#148; and you told us that you
               were part of the Alpha unit?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   It says &#147;Alpha [Deane] radios seeing
               person on roadway, something seen in
               individual&#146;s hand which could be a long
               gun or bow.&#148;  And you told us that
               indeed that&#146;s what you did.  You
               communicated to Staff Sergeant Skinner
               that initially you saw somebody with
               what might have been a long gun or bow
               and immediately thereafter you saw the
               CM unit divide and hide, correct?
          A.   Yes it is.
                                &#133;
          Q.   All right and then you hear, is it
               Constable Beauchesne, is that his rank?
          A.   Yes
          Q.   Constable Beauchesne determines that the
               item is not a weapon, correct?
          A.   Yes
          Q.   And you hear that over your
               communication head set?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   And then one of you and I don&#146;t know
               who, I presume tells Staff Sergeant
               Skinner that it&#146;s not a threat and the
               CMU unit goes back on the roadway and
               starts marching again, right?
          A.   Yes
          Q.   Okay, okay and then&#133; We go further on
               and we hear, this is what Staff Sergeant
               Skinner says.  &#147;I hear commotion on
               radio.  I hear someone on radio saying
               they&#146;re shooting at us.&#148;  Is that you
               saying that?
          A.   I cannot recall saying that.
          Q.   Okay did you hear it when one of your
               other TRU members said that?
          A.   No I did not.
          Q.   Okay and then Staff Sergeant Skinner
               says &#147;I clearly hear numerous rounds
               fired.&#148;
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   And indeed you heard numerous rounds
               fired?
          A.   That night I only heard two rounds being
               fired.
                                &#133;
          Q.   All right well we&#146;ll get to the question
               of silencers and what rounds you heard a
               little later, let&#146;s just push on with
               Staff Sergeant Skinner&#146;s notes.  This is
               you &#147;Deane asked for ambulance.&#148;  Right?
          A.   Yes
                                  &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Okay so you ask for ambulance, do you
               see the suburban [ambulance vehicle]
               come forward?
          A.   Not that I can recall.
          Q.   All right well maybe it&#146;s explained a
               little later.  &#147;Deane advises natives
               drove bus through CMU and fired on CMU.&#148;
               Did you just say that over the
               communications?
          A.   Yes I did yes.
          Q.   Now when you say &#147;fired on the CMU&#148; is
               this because you saw these muzzle
               flashes from the bus?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   But you didn&#146;t hear any shots from the
               bus?
          A.   No I did not.
          Q.   Okay that's a visual interpretation,
               right?
          A.   Yes.
                                  &#133;
                                </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Okay.  Staff Sergeant Skinner asked for
               clarification re: ambulance.  Do you
               recall him asking that?
          A.   Not that I recall no.
          Q.   Okay and then it says &#147;determined
               natives are injured not officers.  And
               natives retreated into park.  Ambulance
               recalled.&#148;  Now did you give him that
               information to determine natives are
               injured not officers, and natives
               retreated into park?
          A.   I believe I did yes.
          Q.   Okay did you give this information to
               him before or after you fired at the
               muzzle flashes?
          A.   This would have been after.
          Q.   And before or after you shot Dudley
               George?
          A.   After.
                                  &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   What you do is you tell your Staff
               Sergeant Skinner about the fact that the
               natives drove a bus through the CMU and
               fired on the CMU and you asked for an
               ambulance, is that right?
          A.   Yes that&#146;s right.
          Q.   Nothing about muzzle flashes, right?
          A.   Not that I can recall.
          Q.   Nothing about the fact you shot and
               killed somebody, right?</pre>
    <pre>[13] At this point, the appellant&#146;s counsel objected.  He
submitted that it was unfair to use s.11 of the Canada Evidence
Act to introduce the notes of another witness (who had not
testified) and to suggest that the absence of something in those
notes could be probative.  He agreed that it was quite proper to
ask &#147;the policeman&#148; whether or not he said certain things, but
not to put in, as if this was original evidence, a probative
value to the absence of a note.
[14] The Crown responded that the concept of a prior inconsistent
statement could also encompass silence and that he would
undertake, if there was an inconsistency, to call Staff Sgt.
Skinner, but that so far there was no inconsistency.
[15] The appellant&#146;s counsel said that the Crown&#146;s statement
assumed the notes were reliable as to what was said.  The Crown
responded that that was a different issue; the Crown&#146;s obligation
under s.11 was to call the maker of the note if there was an
inconsistency but so far there was no inconsistency.  He stated:

     He&#146;s agreeing with me that he didn&#146;t say these things
     to Staff Sergeant Skinner so I don&#146;t understand what 
     the objection is.  There is no inconsistency so far.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The appellant&#146;s counsel replied:

     Sir I think it&#146;s the whole tenure [sic] of an inference
     that the best evidence here is these notes&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[17] Defence counsel also stated that there was a duty to put the
whole picture before the court and that this was not being done.
[18] The Crown replied in part:

     &#133; I&#146;ve undertaken if there&#146;s any issue to call Staff
     Sergeant Skinner and he can explain why if important
     things were said they&#146;re not in his notes.  But right
     now in my respectful submission this is classic cross-
     examination on a prior oral inconsistent statement which
     is permitted under Section 11 of the Canada Evidence Act
     and frankly so far I don&#146;t even have an inconsistency.

     The Court: I agree with you so far there  is no 
     inconsistency.  I would just caution counsel to be
     careful as to how you apply it.

The cross-examination then continued:

          Q.   Okay&#133; just to nail down that point
               Sergeant Deane, the notes made no
               mention of muzzle flashes, made no
               mention of the fact that you shot a man
               and as you tell us, you thought you
               might have killed him that evening, the
               notes don&#146;t say anything about that, do
               they?
          A.   No they don&#146;t.
          Q.   And you didn&#146;t say anything to Staff
               Sergeant Skinner at the time about these
               two important points, correct?
          A.   No I did not.
          Q.   All right now to be fair to you I want
               to go through the rest of the notes, for
               the Court, because of my friend&#146;s
               objection that I haven&#146;t painted the
               entire narrative here.  The next note is
               &#147;CMU retreats to TOC.&#148;  Is that right?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   &#147;Covered by Alpha and Sierra&#148;.
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   &#133; And then it says, like you wouldn&#146;t
               know this but I&#146;m just doing everything
               here, so that we&#146;re all singing from the
               same song book.  &#147;I requested more&#133;
               support, ERT and TRU to Inspector
               Carson.&#148;  ERT what does that stand for?
          A.   Emergency response.
          Q.   Team?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   All right so obviously you weren&#146;t in
               the room but you may have heard it over
               the head set, did you hear that, there
               was more support?
          A.   No I did not do that*
          Q.   Okay &#147;CMU arrives TOC&#148;&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>Defence counsel then objected as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          Sir with respect that is not a statement of
          the accused.
                                &#133;
          A prior inconsistent statement is a very
          plain simple thing.  It is a recording of the
          utterances of the accused and that can quite
          fairly be put by the strength of Section 11.
          I submit it is an unfair tactic to take the
          notes of another officer and intersperse what
          all those notes say about other things.  To
          draw an inference as to the time or sequence
          or when certain utterances were made.  I
          submit that&#146;s not fair.  The best evidence is
          the author of them.  The questions can be put
          but not the notes, I submit that they are not
          parts of the utterance.</pre>
    <pre>[19] The Crown disagreed.  The trial judge ruled that the cross-
examination should be confined to the areas where the officer
was, in fact, saying something.  At this point the Crown
continued the cross-examination with the following question:

          Okay so you&#146;re telling us, you just told us
	  under oath that on the way back to the TOC
	  centre, you told Staff Sergeant Skinner on the
	  communications system that there were muzzle
          flashes.  So you told us earlier that you did
	  say something over the communication set up to
	  Staff Sergeant Skinner about these two points
	  I&#146;m addressing, about the muzzle flashes and the
	  news that you shot somebody with a long arm?</pre>
    <pre>The appellant replied:

          I don&#146;t recall if I said that over the communication
	  system.  I know I told him that once I returned to
	  the TOC site area.
          </pre>
    <pre>This was an alteration in the appellant's testimony as
to whether or not he had mentioned muzzle flashes over
the radio.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The cross-examination then shifted to the topic of the
appellant&#146;s statements to his supervising officer at the TOC
site, immediately after the fall-back from the Park.  After
initiating this new line of questioning, the Crown asked:

          Q.   What did you say to Staff Sergeant
               Skinner?
          A.   I told him about the events that had
               transpired that night.
          Q.   Let&#146;s hear it.
          A.   I told him about the initial advance.
               The first advance of the CMU.  The
               second advance&#133;
          Q.   Okay.
          A.   I told him about the muzzle flashes,
               about my firing upon those.  I told him
               about the bus and the car and then I
               further told him about myself shooting
               at an individual.</pre>
    <pre>[21] It was just after this point that counsel for the appellant
objected to the lack of a voir dire.  He stated:

	Sir I&#146;m basically troubled by this whole tactic of 
	approach for the following reason.  I had thought 
	that there could not be more clear an understanding 
	with prosecution counsel that we presented at the 
	front of these proceedings that there is a very
        specific set of two statements made by the accused 
	that were given to the SIU that were admitted to be 
	voluntary and free and not have to tie the Court up 
	in Charter challenges.  And that we were formally 
	waiving a voir dire as to whether the accused was
        foregoing Charter and common-law rights that he had 
	to have those fundamentals proven and my colleague 
	is not [sic] completely outside of that set of 
	understanding.  Questioning the officer on what he
	not only said but didn&#146;t say in the course of having a
        duty to report to superiors and drawing inferences or 
	asking, inviting the Court and there can be no other 
	probative value of this, drawing an inference of 
	whether there&#146;s a partial giving of the report to a 
	superior without asking the Court if it shouldn&#146;t
        be voir dired and if there are massive Charter 
	implications and whether an officer is under duty to 
	be reporting to superiors, has voir dire protection 
	if it&#146;s going to be used for the purpose of criminal 
	law.  It is simply off the playing field that I
        thought we were on here&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[22] The Crown responded:

        Well it&#146;s an interesting point&#133; I didn&#146;t even analyse 
	it in respect of whether there could be a voir dire 
	issue because there were &#150; the O.P.P. and certainly 
	Inspector Carson, and Staff Sergeant Skinner are not 
	acting in any way, in any sense of penal authority 
	over Sergeant Deane and obviously are not the 
	investigators of this matter.  The SIU are the 
	investigators and I was treating this solely as prior 
	oral statements which I was going to explore as to 
	whether they were consistent or inconsistent with 
	my understanding of what they might say.  But if my 
	friend is saying&#133; that there&#146;s a need for a voir dire
        because Staff Sergeant Skinner is a person in penal 
	authority over Sergeant Deane in the circumstances 
	then maybe that&#146;s what I would have to do.  But I 
	would have thought that the relationship between 
	Staff Sergeant Skinner and Sergeant Deane and statements
        made certainly over the communication system at that point,
        they&#146;ve got nothing to do with a criminal investigation 
	with respect to the charge that now before this Court&#133;</pre>
    <pre>The Defence replied:
        
        Sir with respect, there&#146;s a very, very big difference
        between what is going on in the res gestae in the actual 
	scene and where the prosecutor is now moving because his 
	whole tone and thrust is the question&#133; I think there&#146;s 
	an operational need to know and it&#146;s all part of the res 
	but once the event was clearly over and once there is a 
	reporting to a superior officer after the event is done, 
	there is the fundamental distinction in both police and 
	the military law of the need to know in the chain of
        command versus the reporting that would later be used 
	for a self criminatory purpose and that can be the only 
	purpose that my friend is now bringing this in under&#133; it&#146;s 
	clearly into Charter country.  It&#146;s not a question of 
	relevance or probative.  It&#146;s a question of whether it&#146;s 
	self criminatory and needs a voir dire.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The Crown acknowledged that there was a meeting of minds
with respect to two specific statements made by the appellant,
one to the SIU and another to both the OPP and the SIU.  He
stated: &#147;[t]his is a very different thing we&#146;re dealing with
right now&#133;&#148;.   The Crown submitted:

          &#133; I would say we&#146;re still dealing with part of
	  the narrative at this stage.  And&#133; in any event,
	  Staff Sergeant Skinner, Inspector Carson 
	  notwithstanding the fact that they had superior
          rank to Sergeant Deane don&#146;t fit into the category
	  of the need for a voir dire because they&#146;re not in
	  penal authority over Sergeant  Deane at the time
	  these conversations take place.  These conversations
	  did not take place in any sense of the word when
	  there was an investigation going on in the activities
	  of Sergeant Deane&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Defence counsel persisted:

          Sir it&#146;s not a case of penal authority.  It&#146;s not
	  a case of whether these are police officers
	  investigating a crime.  It&#146;s whether there&#146;s a
	  duty to report and if there&#146;s a duty to report
          it triggers the issue if common-law and in Charter
	  of whether what is being said is free and voluntary&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[25] The trial judge concluded that defence counsel was
maintaining that there should be a voir dire and recessed to
consider the objections and the ruling.  Upon returning the trial
judge stated:

          The ruling is such that there is no requirement
	  for a voir dire on this evidence.  That the statements
	  were not made to someone in a position to control or
	  influence this judicial proceeding.  Furthermore I
	  find that the line of questioning is relevant.  The
	  matter of weight to be given, will need to be
          determined by the Court at the end of the day.  That
	  is my ruling.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Crown counsel continued to cross-examine the appellant using
Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes as evidence of the appellant&#146;s statements.
[27] When Sgt. Skinner was called by the defence, he stated as
follows in cross-examination by the Crown [emphasis added]:

          A.   On their way back to the TOC Sergeant
               Deane communicated to me over the radio,
               over several transmissions, a sequence
               of events that happened at the scene.
          Q.   This is over the communications?
          A.   Yes.
          Q.   And tell us about that?
          A.   He informed that the CMU had advanced to
               the park.
          Q.   Yes.
          A.   He informed me they had retreated.
          Q.   Yes.
          A.   I recall him informing me they advanced
               again.  He then told me about the bus
               and car coming through.
          Q.   Yes.
          A.   And about them being fired upon.
                                &#133;
          Q.   But he doesn&#146;t mention anything at that
               point about muzzle flashes?
          A.   No not that I recall.</pre>
    <pre>[28] Inasmuch as muzzle flashes represented the existence of
gunfire, the fact that the appellant mentioned being fired upon
as opposed to the existence of muzzle flashes was, arguably, a
distinction without a difference.  The perception created by the
cross-examination of the appellant was an entirely different one.
[29] Sgt. Skinner did not recall the appellant telling him about
muzzle flashes.  In cross-examination by the Crown, Sgt. Skinner
agreed with the suggestion that if he had heard information about
muzzle flashes he would have noted it.  Sgt. Skinner was not
asked whether his notes of what the appellant said at the TOC
site contained any reference to gunfire.
[30] In his examination-in-chief, Sgt. Skinner testified that, at
the TOC site, the appellant told him that he &#147;had discharged his
weapon at an armed individual&#148; who fell down and was carried into
the Park.   In cross-examination, Sgt. Skinner equivocated as to
whether he reported these statements by Deane to Inspector
Carson.  Essentially, he only recalled reporting that Deane
discharged his weapon.
[31] Sgt. Skinner began his notes about 9 p.m. on the evening of
the events in question.  He did not make careful notes when he
spoke with the appellant at the TOC site because he had other
duties to attend to.  It was not his duty to investigate.  He
wrote his notes of what happened at the TOC site the next day,
September 7.
[32] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in ruling
that Staff Sgt. Skinner was not a person in authority and submits
that a voir dire of the statements made during the three time
periods should have been held.  Inasmuch as no voir dire was held
the appellant requests a new trial.
DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[33] The test to be applied by an appellate court in determining
whether, on an objective review of the evidence, the trial
judge&#146;s obligation to conduct an inquiry was triggered is found
in Hodgson, supra, at 472-5.  Cory J. made these points:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre> The test to be applied by an appellate court is different
 from the test applicable on a voir dire.  The test on the
 voir dire is whether the accused reasonably believed the
 receiver of the statement to be a person in authority and
 whether the statement was made voluntarily.  It is important
 not to confuse this latter test with the question of whether
 the trial judge had an obligation to conduct a voir dire.
 On a voir dire the accused&#146;s subjective view is important.
 However, unless a voir dire has been held, the subjective
 view of the accused might not have been ascertained.  The
 question as to whether the trial judge had an obligation
 to conduct a voir dire is consequently an objective one.
 Evidence as to the subjective view of the accused concerning
 whether he thought he was making a statement to a person in
 authority is not necessarily required when, for example, the
 receiver of the statement is a conventional person in authority.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> Unless a voir dire has been waived, the trial judge has an
 obligation to hold a voir dire of his or her own motion,
 notwithstanding the absence of any request by counsel, wherever
 the Crown seeks to adduce a statement made by an accused to a
 person in authority.  If a waiver has been given, it is
 unnecessary to hold a voir dire.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> The trial judge&#146;s obligation is triggered only where the
 evidence makes the need for a voir dire clear.  When the receiver
 of the statement is a &#147;conventional&#148; or ordinary person in
 authority, such as a police officer or prison guard not acting in
 an undercover capacity, the connection to the authorities is
 apparent and the trial judge clearly has an obligation to hold a
 voir dire.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> On the other hand, when the receiver of the statement is not
 a &#147;conventional&#148; person in authority the defence has an
 evidential burden to discharge.  That burden is to place the
 trial judge on notice that the receiver of the statement is
 alleged to be a person in authority and that a voir dire is
 required.  The evidential burden may be discharged by evidence
 that the receiver of the statement is closely connected to the
 authorities.  This is particularly so when the evidence discloses
 a close connection with the authorities before the statement is
 made as well as a close connection in time with the authorities
 after its receipt.  When the evidence discloses such
 circumstances, the trial judge should inquire whether the defence
 is prepared to discharge its evidential burden on the person in
 authority issue or whether a voir dire is waived.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> The effect of the trial judge&#146;s failure to hold a voir dire
 is dependent on whether defence counsel has an evidentiary burden
 to object to the admissibility of the statements.  If the defence
 has an evidentiary burden to discharge, and has not  discharged
 that burden, the failure to hold a voir dire will not amount to
 reversible error.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>Was the trial judge obliged to conduct a voir dire as to whether
Sgt. Skinner was a person in authority and, if so, at what stage?</pre>
    <pre>[34] Reference to the content of the appellant&#146;s statements and
the alleged omission from the statements of any reference to
muzzle flashes first arose during the Crown&#146;s cross-examination
of the appellant at trial.  Inasmuch as no voir dire had been
held to establish whether Sgt. Skinner was a person in authority
or whether the statements were voluntary, the Crown&#146;s conduct was
improper.  An accused person&#146;s statements to a person in
authority cannot be used in cross-examination unless they have
first been ruled to be voluntary.  In R. v. B.G. (1999), 174
D.L.R. (4th) 301, 135 C.C.C. (3d) 303 at 318-20, Bastarache J.
stated :

          This question [whether the Crown can challenge the
          credibility of an accused by cross-examining him on
	  a prior statement without a voir dire] has been
	  examined by Canadian courts on a number of occasions,
	  and in particular by this Court in Hebert v. The
	  Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 120, 113 C.C.C. 97, as early as
	  1954.  In that case, the Crown had sought to cross-
          examine the accused on a statement he had made to the
	  police, without a voir dire being held, to establish
	  its voluntariness.  With regard to this practice,
	  Estey J. stated at p. 134:

                A cross-examination upon such a statement,
		by the great weight of authority in our
		provincial courts, as well as in the
                court of criminal appeal in England, has
		been condemned.

          His colleague, Fauteux J., dealt specifically with the
	  issue of credibility as follows at p. 147:

               [Translation] Moreover, did the Crown
               not seek to justify the introduction of this
               evidence in the record both at trial and in
               this Court merely through the provisions of
               sections 10 and 11 of the Evidence Act, which
               permit the credibility of witnesses to be
               challenged by cross-examining them on their
               prior statements which are inconsistent with
               their testimony.  The issue of whether,
               during the cross-examination of an accused
               heard as a witness, the Crown may refer to
               statements made by him or her to the police,
               before it is determined whether the
               statements were made freely and voluntarily,
               has been considered in several cases.  My
               colleague Cartwright J. referred to these
               decisions in his reasons and, like him, I am
               of the view that in the instant case, the
               Crown cannot further justify the position it
               has taken at trial and before this Court on
               this basis.  The tendering of this evidence
               was therefore completely unlawful such that
               in my view it would have warranted, if not
               required, the declaration of a mistrial.</pre>
    <pre>[35] More recently, this Court again dealt with the issue,
although incidentally, in R. v. Calder, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 660.  In
that case, Sopinka J. considered the admissibility of evidence
under s. 24(2) of the Charter, drawing an analogy to the
confessions rule.  He put the question with regard to an
involuntary confession as follows, at 673:

          Is the distinction between use of a statement for
	  all purposes rather than for the limited purpose of
	  impeaching credibility a valid one in the application
	  of s. 24(2)?  The respondent draws an analogy with
	  the practice relating to confessions.  An involuntary
	  confession could not be used for any purpose. [Emphasis
	  added.]</pre>
    <pre>Citing Monette v. The Queen, [1956] S.C.R. 400, he added, at 673:

          The authority of this case has not been questioned.
          Moreover, it is acknowledged by the appellant that
	  involuntary statements may not be used by the Crown
	  for any purpose&#133;.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[36] I do not believe that there can now be any doubt about the
state of the law on this issue in Canada.  Although it is
possible, in certain circumstances, to distinguish between the
use of evidence to challenge the credibility of an accused and
its use on the merits, that is not the case with the confessions
rule.  The voluntariness of a statement does not depend on the
use made of it.  It is established only on the basis of the
circumstances at the time the statement was made.
[37] The fact that the alleged statements of the appellant were
themselves exculpatory and not inculpatory makes no difference to
the requirement to hold a voir dire.  A voir dire  must be held
before either an inculpatory or exculpatory statement by an
accused to a person in authority may be admitted into evidence:
R. v. Piche, [1971] S.C.R. 23.
[38] A voir dire  should have been held as to whether it was
reasonable for the appellant to believe that Sgt. Skinner was a
person in authority and whether the statements were voluntary as
soon as the Crown attempted to cross-examine the appellant on
what he had said to Sgt. Skinner.  On an objective view of the
evidence, I cannot, however, say that the trial judge&#146;s
obligation to conduct an inquiry on his own motion into whether
Sgt. Skinner was a person in authority was triggered at this
point.  This is because, at the outset of trial, counsel told the
trial judge that a voir dire would not be needed with respect to
certain statements.  A later excerpt in the transcript makes it
clear that counsel were talking about the appellant&#146;s statements
to the SIU but when cross-examination of the appellant began the
trial judge would not have known this.  The fact that the trial
judge did not, on his own motion, hold a voir dire did not amount
to reversible error at this stage of the proceedings.  At this
stage, having regard to the comments of counsel at the beginning
of the trial, the defence bore an evidentiary burden and was
required to ask the trial judge for a voir dire into whether Sgt.
Skinner was a person in authority and whether the statements were
voluntary.
[39] Early in the Crown&#146;s cross-examination of the appellant,
however, the defence made an objection on the basis that the
Crown was using Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes as a statement of the
appellant without establishing that they were sufficiently
reliable in the sense of reflecting the entire conversation.
This objection was the focus of much argument on this appeal.  In
this regard, I note that there appears to have been a significant
gap in time between the time when some of the statements were
made and when they were recorded.  The statement made by the
appellant to Sgt. Skinner at the TOC, for example, were not
recorded until the following day.  In addition, the appellant
testified that he did not see Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes prior to the
trial.  It would appear that the appellant did not have the
opportunity to read or initial the notes at the time they were
made to confirm that he agreed he had made the statements.
[40] The requirement that a confession be voluntary has two
roots.  One is a concern that only reliable evidence be admitted
and the other is a concern for the administration of justice and
principles of fairness; in particular, the principle against self-
incrimination:  Hodgson, supra, at 461.  In relation to the
reliability aspect, the appellant argues that the delay in Sgt.
Skinner&#146;s recording of what the appellant said to him, as well as
his inability to recall with accuracy the statements made by the
appellant, should result in the exclusion of the statements.
[41] The decision of Lessard v. The Queen (1982), 10 C.C.C. (3d)
61 (Que. C.A.), cited with approval by Lacourcière J.A. in R. v.
Lapointe and Sicotte (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 366 at 380 (Ont.
C.A.), aff&#146;d., 35 C.C.C. (3d) 287 (S.C.C.), stands for the
proposition that the accuracy of particular statements does not
relate to their admissibility.  I note, however, that Kaufman,
The Admissibility of Confessions, 3rd ed. (1979), at 139, states
that &#147;&#133; failure to recollect the complete conversation may
jeopardize an otherwise acceptable confession, but once again
this is a matter of appreciation for the judge&#148;.  Kaufman
mentions R. v. Belanger (1978), 40 C.C.C. (2d) 335 (Ont. H.C.J.)
as an example of a case where the court concluded that the
accused&#146;s statement should not be admitted because, although the
police officers acted in good faith and did not deliberately edit
or try to recall only the incriminating comments made by the
accused, they could not recall &#147;the entire conversation with any
certainty&#148;.  As a result the trial judge was unable to determine
if the statement was voluntary.  Here, Sgt. Skinner acknowledged
that his notes did not record the entire conversation he had with
the appellant.
[42] Another decision that makes the same point is R. v. Stefiuk
et al. (No.1) (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 268 at 271 (Man. Co. Ct.),
where an incomplete statement was also excluded.  In Hodgson,
supra, at 462-3, Cory J., in discussing the requirement that an
accused&#146;s statement be voluntary, commented:

          This approach [the focus on voluntariness over
	  truth] to the rule determining the admissibility
	  of a statement of the accused also accords with
	  the view that the quality, weight or reliability
	  of evidence is a matter for the jury, and that the
          admission of evidence which may be unreliable does
	  not per se render a trial unfair: see, e.g., R. v.
	  Buric (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 737, 106 C.C.C. (3d) 97;
	  affirmed [1997] 1 S.C.R. 535, 114 C.C.C. (3d) 95,
	  and R. v. Charemski, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 679, 123
          C.C.C. (3d) 225, 157 D.L.R. (4th) 603.  The
	  confessions rule does not force a trial judge to
	  exclude &#147;unreliable&#148; evidence that is highly
	  probative of guilt.  Rather it focuses on putative
          reliability, by analysing the circumstances
	  surrounding the statement and their effect on
	  the accused, regardless of the statement&#146;s accuracy.
	  Thus the &#147;reliability&#148; rationale and the &#147;fairness&#148;
	  rationale for the confessions rule blend together, so
          as to ensure fair treatment to the accused in the
	  criminal process by deterring coercive state tactics.</pre>
    <pre>[43] Here, there is an issue as to whether a very important
statement made during the fall back was the statement of the
appellant.  In particular, this is the testimony of Sgt. Skinner
that he heard, on the radio, a report that: &#147;we&#146;re being fired
upon&#148;.  The appellant could not recall making this statement.  No
one asked Sgt. Skinner whether the appellant made the statement
although the statement appeared in his notes and was apparently
attributed to the appellant.  It was the existence of gunfire (as
represented by muzzle flashes in the dark) on which the appellant
allegedly formed the basis of his belief that the person he had
seen move from the sandy berm had a weapon.  Because no voir dire
was held, Sgt. Skinner was not called by the Crown to establish
that his notes represented the statements of the appellant or
what those statements were alleged to be.  The defence called
Sgt. Skinner on the trial proper and, because of this, the
defence had no opportunity to cross-examine him.  Had there been
a voir dire, the Crown would have been obliged to call Sgt.
Skinner and the defence could have cross-examined him as to
whether he attributed the statement, &#147;We&#146;re being fired upon&#148;, to
the appellant.
[44] When defence counsel objected that Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes did
not represent the appellant&#146;s statements, the trial judge should
have been alerted to the necessity of enquiring whether the
waiver given at the outset of trial pertaining to &#147;certain
statements made by the appellant&#148; pertained to these statements
and whether a voir dire  was required.  For the purposes of this
analysis, however, I will assume that the trial judge was still
entitled at this stage to proceed on the understanding that a
waiver had been given.  Consequently,  there was an evidential
burden on the defence to put the trial judge on notice that Sgt.
Skinner was alleged to be a person in authority and that a voir
dire was required.
[45] Defence counsel did not alert the trial judge to the
necessity for a voir dire until the Crown sought to introduce the
third set of statements made by the appellant to Sgt. Skinner at
the TOC.  Defence counsel stated that he had not objected to the
first two sets of statements by the appellant because they were
part of the res gestae.  He appears to have been under the
misconception that, if an accused person&#146;s statements are made
during the course of events, a voir dire need not be held.  In
fact, this is not the case.  As with all statements by an
accused, statements that form part of the res gestae are subject
to the general requirement of voluntariness and a voir dire must
be held: see Erven v. The Queen (1978), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 76 at 94.
[46] In relation to the third set of statements made to Sgt.
Skinner at the TOC, defence counsel stated in part &#147;&#133; it triggers
the issue in common law and in Charter of whether what is being
said is free and voluntary&#148;.  The trial judge understood the
request as a request for a voir dire.  The trial judge&#146;s
obligation to conduct a voir dire into whether the appellant
reasonably believed Sgt. Skinner to be a person in authority was
triggered at this point.
[47] The trial judge refused to hold a voir dire on the basis
that Sgt. Skinner was not a person in authority.  He appears to
have accepted Crown counsel&#146;s submission that because Sgt.
Skinner was not engaged in the investigation, arrest, or
detention of the appellant, he could not be a person in
authority.  In so doing the trial judge overlooked the fact that
Sgt. Skinner was closely allied with those conducting the
investigation.  There is also a close connection in time between
when the appellant made his statement to Sgt. Skinner and Sgt.
Skinner&#146;s statements to his superiors and the SIU.
[48] Ordinarily a &#147;person in authority&#148; refers to those persons
formally engaged in the arrest, detention, examination or
prosecution of the accused:  Morris v. The Queen (1979), 47
C.C.C. (2d) 257 (S.C.C.); R. v. Jesty (1996), 155 N.S.R. (2d) 186
(N.S.C.A.).  Persons in authority are also those persons whom the
accused reasonably believes are in a position to influence or
control the proceedings against him: Hodgson, supra, at 467-9.
In reporting to his superior that he had shot a man, the
appellant was certainly aware that an investigation would be
conducted.  I would expect that the appellant would also be aware
that Sgt. Skinner would be making a report that would have some
influence with respect to the investigation.  When the maker of
the statement believes the recipient of the statement can
influence or control the proceedings against him or her, or when
the maker believes the receiver is closely connected with the
state authorities, the recipient is a person in authority: R. v.
Hodgson, supra, at 468-69.
[49] The appellant was never given an opportunity to present
evidence on the issue of whether he believed Sgt. Skinner was a
person in authority at the time he made his statements to him.
The question of whether or not a person is a person in authority
is a subjective one, provided there is a reasonable basis for the
belief: Hodgson, supra, at 468.  The duty of the trial judge is
not to first decide whether there is a reasonable basis for the
appellant&#146;s belief, and then proceed to a voir dire on the
determination that the belief is indeed reasonable: Hodgson,
supra.1  Once the circumstances surrounding the subjective belief
are known, they will have an impact on the decision of whether
the accused&#146;s subjective belief was reasonable.  When the issue
of whether Sgt. Skinner was a person in authority arose, the
trial judge ought to have heard evidence of the appellant&#146;s
subjective belief on the issue before making his ruling.
[50] The trial judge pre-empted any inquiry into the appellant&#146;s
subjective view by his ruling that Sgt. Skinner was not a person
in authority and that a voir dire need not, therefore, be held.
He did not give the defence the opportunity of discharging its
evidentiary burden that the appellant reasonably believed Sgt.
Skinner to be a person in authority.  In my opinion, this was a
reversible error.  If the defence had had the opportunity to
satisfy its evidentiary burden and had met it, the onus would
have shifted to the Crown to show that the statements met the
voluntariness and fairness requirements of the confessions rule.
[51] The respondent suggests that, even assuming Sgt. Skinner was
a person in authority, a voir dire was not required because the
appellant&#146;s statements were obviously voluntary and did not
require a voir dire.  The Crown&#146;s submission overlooks the
existence of the protocol requiring the appellant to make a
statement to Sgt. Skinner.  The Crown&#146;s submission is also
untenable in law.  The decision in Erven, supra, rejects the
position that a voir dire is not required if the statement is
&#147;obviously volunteered&#148;.  Dickson J. stated at 91:

          Nor can I accede to the&#133; proposition&#133; that a voir
	  dire is unnecessary where a statement is &#147;obviously
	  voluntary&#148; or &#147;volunteered&#148;, or where the
	  voluntariness of a statement is &#147;apparent from
	  the circumstances under which it was made&#148;, or
          when it can be &#147;abundantly established in some
	  other way&#148;, absent a voir dire: see R. v. Spencer,
	  supra; R. v. Sweezey, supra; R. v. Toulany (1973),
	  16 C.C.C. (2d) 208, 6 N.S.R. (2d) 566 (N.S.S.C.A.D.).

          No doubt the &#147;obviously voluntary&#148; test
          derives from a desire to encourage practical
          efficiency in the conduct of trials.  On that
          point alone, there are grounds for some doubt
          as to the efficacy of the test.  However,
          there are also other interests which must be
          weighed in the balance along with efficiency
          - (i) the assurance of a full hearing of the
          evidence of both sides on the issue of
          voluntariness; (ii) the maintenance of the
          rights of the accused, and (iii) the
          integrity of the functional distinction
          between the voir dire and the trial itself.
          It is in the light of each of these
          interests, as well as that of trial economy,
          that the proposed test for a voir dire ought
          to be measured.</pre>
    <pre>And at 95:

          If a statement is, in fact, &#147;volunteered&#148;, this
	  means merely that voluntariness is easier to
	  establish than in other cases. It does not mean
	  there is a different procedure to determine
          voluntariness.  The voir dire in such a case may
	  take only a few minutes.  On the other hand, where
	  the initial impression is that the statement was
	  voluntary, other evidence on the voir dire may
          point to quite the opposite conclusion.  Either
	  way, the rights of the accused will be protected
	  and the efficient administration of justice
	  enhanced by the holding of a voir dire.
          </pre>
    <pre>He concluded at 97:

          In my opinion, it is always necessary to hold
	  a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of
	  a statement made by an accused out of Court to
	  a person in authority.  Only in this way can
	  fairness to the accused be assured.  To require
	  a voir dire only if doubt is cast on the
	  voluntariness of a statement by the circumstances
          under which it was made, as determined from
	  evidence given in the trial proper, would not
	  only shift a burden to the accused but also,
	  in other respects, cause him significant prejudice&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[52] The respondent also submits that a voir dire was not
required in the circumstances of this case for three reasons:
lack of objection by the defence to the statements being admitted
as voluntary, waiver, and adoption of the statements by the
defence.
[53] In Powell v. The Queen (1976), 28 C.C.C. (2d) 148, the
Supreme Court expressly rejected the contention that a voir dire
was only needed where the defence objected to the admission of
the statements.  In any event, the defence did object to the
admissibility of the statements made at the TOC.
[54] The waiver given at the outset of trial did not apply to the
appellant&#146;s statements to Sgt. Skinner.  The fact that, during
the Crown&#146;s improper cross-examination of the appellant, defence
counsel wanted all of the statements recorded in Sgt. Skinner&#146;s
notes, during both the engagement and the fall-back, to be put to
the appellant for the sake of completeness, did not amount to a
waiver.  The request was made after the Crown began to improperly
cross-examine the appellant on his alleged statements to Sgt.
Skinner.   There was no express waiver and a waiver of a voir
dire must be express:  R. v. Park (1981), 59 C.C.C. (2d) 385
(S.C.C.) at 393.  The appellant is not estopped from asserting
that a voir dire  should have been held into whether Sgt. Skinner
was a person in authority and whether the appellant&#146;s statements
to him were voluntary.
[55] The third reason put forward by the respondent, for
asserting that a voir dire was unnecessary, is that the appellant
adopted the statements recorded in Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes in his
evidence-in-chief when he said he told Sgt. Skinner &#147;what had
transpired&#148;.  The appellant did not, in his evidence-in-chief,
adopt the alleged statements recorded in Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes.
The reference by the appellant in his examination-in-chief to
having told Sgt. Skinner &#147;what had transpired&#148; did not
incorporate, by reference, the contents of Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes.
The appellant had never seen the notes.  In his examination-in-
chief, the appellant was not asked, nor could he state, the
content of his statement to Sgt. Skinner.  To do so at that stage
would have been a violation of the rule against giving evidence
of prior consistent statements.  At the end of the appellant&#146;s
examination-in-chief, it was not reasonable for the appellant to
expect that the Crown would suggest that the appellant&#146;s
testimony as to seeing muzzle flashes was fabricated.  That
evolved extemporaneously during the cross-examination of the
appellant.  The appellant&#146;s comment that he had told Sgt. Skinner
what had transpired was not a rebuttal in anticipation of the
allegation of recent fabrication.  Consequently, the submission
that the appellant adopted Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes as his statement
fails.
[56] I would reject the submissions of the Crown that, even if
Sgt. Skinner was a person in authority, it was not necessary to
hold a voir dire.
[57] In many cases, such as this one, the guilt of the accused
will depend solely on his or her credibility and on that of the
other witnesses.  A trial judge has a common law duty to prevent
the admission of evidence that would cause a trial to be unfair:
R. v. Harrer (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 205 (S.C.C.); R. v.
White (1995), 135 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 292 (S.C.C.).  If a voir
dire had been held and Sgt. Skinner had been found to be a person
in authority, the trial judge would have had to decide whether
the statements recorded in Sgt. Skinner&#146;s notes fairly
represented the accused&#146;s statements.  Only if the Crown
discharged its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that
the notes fairly represented the statements of the accused such
that an adverse inference arising from the accused&#146;s silence as
to the existence of gunfire or muzzle flashes might be drawn
could the trial judge admit the notes as the accused&#146;s statement.
It would then have been for the judge on the trial proper to
decide, whether, in all the circumstances, the inference should
be drawn.</pre>
    <pre>Should the curative provision in s.686 (1)(b)(iii) be applied?</pre>
    <pre>[58] The test for applying the curative proviso can be found in
R. v. Wildman, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, where Lamer J. stated at 328:

          As regards resort by a Court of Appeal to the proviso of
	  s. 613(1)(b)(iii) [now s. 686 (1)(b)(iii)] the law has 
	  been clearly laid down by this Court in Colpitts v. The
	  Queen, [1965] S.C.R. 739.  Cartwright J.&#146;s formulation 
	  of the test was as follows, at p. 744:

               &#133; once error in law has been found to
               have occurred at the trial, the onus resting
               upon the Crown is to satisfy the Court that
               the verdict would necessarily have been the
               same if such error had not occurred.  The
               satisfaction of this onus is a condition
               precedent to the right of the Appellate Court
               to apply the terms of the subsection at all&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[59] Some examples of cases where the curative proviso has been
applied when a voir dire into statements by the accused was not
held include:  R. v. Morris, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 1041 and R. v.
Drakes (1991), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 274.  In each of these cases, no
objection was made at trial to the admissibility of the
statements and this factor weighed in the decision of the
appellate court.  On the other hand, in R. v. Wells, [1998] 2
S.C.R. 517, the Court held that the trial judge erred in failing
to direct a voir dire of his own motion to determine whether
statements made to the father of one of the complainants were
voluntary, and refused to apply the curative proviso.  In so
doing, the Court held that the evidence adduced was sufficient to
have alerted the trial judge to the need for a voir dire as to
whether the father of the complainant was a person in authority.
These decisions tend to exemplify the Supreme Court&#146;s decision in
Hodgson, supra, to the effect that it is only where the trial
judge should have been alert to the necessity of a voir dire that
reversible error may occur.  Here the trial judge was alerted to
the necessity for a voir dire into the question of whether Sgt.
Skinner was a person in authority and whether the statements were
voluntary.
[60] Another consideration in deciding whether to apply the
curative proviso is whether the statements would inevitably have
been ruled admissible if a voir dire had been held.  If so, it
can be said that the verdict would have been the same.  The trial
judge ruled that Sgt. Skinner was not a person in authority.  Had
the appellant been given the opportunity to present evidence on
the issue, I am of the opinion that it is entirely possible that
Sgt. Skinner would have been considered to be a person in
authority, if not during the actual engagement, then at the time
the appellant made his statements during the fall-back and at the
TOC.  As such, it is by no means clear that the Crown would have
been able to discharge its burden of proving beyond a reasonable
doubt that the statements were admissible.  The statements made
during the fall-back and at the TOC are closely connected in
time.  I cannot say that the statements would inevitably be held
to be voluntary.  An appreciation of the police protocol
requiring the appellant to make a report and its effect on him at
the time he made the statements is needed before a determination
as to voluntariness can be made.  There is also the very real
issue as to whether the notes can fairly be said to represent the
statements of the accused.  On a broader basis, the court would
have to consider whether the admission of the statements would
operate unfairly against the appellant.  I cannot say that the
verdict would inevitably have been the same.
[61] The application of the curative proviso also entails a
review of the properly admitted evidence to determine the effect
of the trial judge&#146;s error on the result at trial and to assess
the way in which the error may have prejudiced the appellant&#146;s
ability to have a fair trial.  See the comments of Doherty J.A.
in R. v. Jackson (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.) at 413.
In Erven, supra, at 161, the trial judge used the appellant&#146;s 
statements to decide an important issue of credibility against 
him and Dickson J. held that in light of this the curative 
proviso could not be applied.  He stated:

           I do not believe this to be a proper
           case for the application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii)
           [now s. 686 (1)(b)(iii)].  That is not to say
           that the failure to hold a voir dire will in
           every case provide grounds for ordering a new
           trial.  As with every other case where
           inadmissible evidence is admitted at trial,
           consideration has to be given to the
           importance of the evidence improperly
           admitted in light of the whole of the case.
           When one considers, however, the the function
           of a voir dire, and the interests at stake in
           the holding of a voir dire, it will be but
           rarely that the admission of such statements
           will have caused no substantial wrong or
           miscarriage of justice, such that the
           appellate Court may apply s. 613 (1)(b)(iii).</pre>
    <pre>[62] In the case at hand, it might be argued that, because the
statements were exculpatory in nature, no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice resulted from their admission into
evidence.  An exculpatory statement may have the same effect on
the outcome of the proceedings as an inculpatory statement.
Although the statements made were exculpatory, they were used to
decide an important issue of credibility against the appellant.
[63] In his reasons, the trial judge reviewed portions of the
evidence at trial.  In reference to Sgt. Deane&#146;s evidence, he
stated, in part:

          &#147;Later in cross-examination Sergeant Deane
	  testified that he did tell Staff Sergeant
	  Skinner about the muzzle flashes, about
          firing upon the muzzle flashes and further
	  that he told him about the shooting of an
	  individual.  He was later then questioned by
          the Crown Attorney with regard to the first
	  person that he told about shooting an individual.
	  We have the following exchange.
         
          Question by Mr. Scott:  &#147;And you told us
          that you told Sergeant Skinner (a) that there
          were muzzle flashes, and (b)  that you shot
          and perhaps killed somebody in this
          operation, correct?&#148;
     
          Answer:  &#147;I&#146;m not, I told him there were
          muzzle flashes.  I told him that I had
          returned fire on the muzzle flashes.  I
          further told him that I had shot an
          individual that had been scanning our
          position with a rifle.  This individual
          faltered, fell to the ground and got back up
          again and then was assisted back into the
          park.&#148;

          Question:  &#147;Is that the first time that
          you ever told anybody?&#148;

          Answer:  &#147;I don&#146;t think I had mentioned that
          on the way back from the sand covered
          roadway.&#148;

          Question:  &#147;Pardon me?&#148;

          Answer:  &#147;I would have told Sergeant Skinner
          and only him.  He would have been the first
          person.&#148;
                                &#133;

          On re-examination by defence counsel the
          accused was questioned regarding his
          attendance on September 8th, 1995 at an
          interview with investigators from the O.P.P.
          and the S.I.U.  He confirmed that during that
          tape recorded interview he described the fact
          that he had seen muzzle flashes, he described
          the fact that he had returned fire.  He
          described where he had first seen Dudley
          George.  He described where Dudley George had
          come from, what he had done and described
          seeing Dudley George scanning the police with
          a weapon.</pre>
    <pre>[64] The trial judge also reviewed the evidence of Sgt. Skinner.
After reviewing Sgt. Skinner&#146;s evidence that he would not have
expected Sgt. Deane to advise him over the radio communications
of the history of what had happened respecting the shooting of
the deceased, the trial judge reviewed the cross-examination of
Sgt. Skinner.  He stated:

          On cross-examination Staff Sergeant Skinner
	  was questioned about his meeting with Sergeant
	  Deane at the tactical operation centre.

          Question:  &#147;If we move to the next point
          then in time, once Officer Deane was back,
          did you have [a] conversation with him?&#148;
          
          Answer:  &#147;Yes.&#148;

          Question:  &#147;What do you recall him
          telling you?&#148;

          Answer:  &#147;Sergeant Deane told me when he
          came back, he told me he had discharged his
          weapon at an armed individual.  That he saw
          that person fall down.  His first reaction he
          told me was to want to go forward to assist
          but realized he could not because of the
          situation.  He told me that person was then
          carried back in the park.&#148;
          
          Later on Sergeant Skinner testified that
          he had no recollection of Sergeant Deane
          saying anything over the communication system
          that he saw muzzle flashes and that he had no
          note of any reference to muzzle flashes.  He
          also testified that he recalled being told by
          Sergeant Deane that he had shot an armed
          person and agreed that he did not include
          that point in his notes.  (Emphasis added.)</pre>
    <pre>[65] The trial judge said:

          I find that Anthony O&#146;Brien (Dudley) George
	  did not have any firearms on his person when
	  he was shot.  I find that the accused
          Kenneth Deane knew that Anthony O&#146;Brien Dudley
	  George did not have any firearms on his person
	  when he shot him.  That the story of the rifle
	  and the muzzle flash was concocted ex post facto
	  in an ill fated attempt to disguise the fact that
	  an unarmed man had been shot.

          The accused testified that the Court heard
          essentially the same version of events that
          was given to the Ontario Provincial Police
          and the Special Investigations Unit in
          September 1995.

          I find sir that you were not honest in
          presenting this version of events to the
          Ontario Provincial Police investigators.  You
          were not honest in presenting this version of
          events to the Special Investigation&#146;s [sic]
          unit of the Province of Ontario.  You were
          not honest in maintaining this ruse while
          testifying before this Court.  (Emphasis
          added.)

The trial judge&#146;s findings were based on his review of the
evidence.  In that review of the evidence, Sgt. Deane&#146;s testimony
at trial as to what he said he told Sgt. Skinner, and his
statements to the O.P.P. and SIU were contrasted with Sgt.
Skinner&#146;s evidence as to the alleged omission of any reference to
muzzle flashes at the TOC.  The trial judge apparently accepted
Sgt. Skinner&#146;s testimony that, if the appellant had said anything
to him about seeing muzzle flashes at the TOC, he would have made
a note of it.   It was a factor in the trial judge&#146;s conclusion
that the evidence of muzzle flashes was concocted ex post facto.
Having regard to the importance of this evidence in the trial
judge&#146;s conclusion respecting the appellant&#146;s credibility, it
cannot be said that the admission of the statements had no effect
on the outcome of the proceedings.  Even if the appellant&#146;s
statement met the traditional criteria for admission under the
confessions rule, if a voir dire had been held, the trial judge
would have had to consider whether to exercise his residual
discretion to exclude the evidence concerning the absence of
muzzle flashes because its admission might be given weight out of
proportion to its reliability.  In R. v. Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R.
9 at 21, Sopinka J. at 610-11 stated (albeit in the context of 
expert evidence):

          Evidence that is otherwise logically relevant 
	  may be excluded on this basis, if its probative
	  value is overborne by its prejudicial effect, &#133;
	  or if it is misleading in the sense that its 
	  effect on the trier of fact, particularly a jury,
	  is out of proportion to its reliability.</pre>
    <pre>The same principle is applicable here.  Because no voir dire was
held, the trial judge did not even advert to this consideration.
It cannot be said that the verdict would inevitably have been the
same.</pre>
    <pre>[66] Finally, in order to apply the curative proviso, the Crown
must prove that the trial judge&#146;s error in failing to hold a voir
dire and in admitting evidence that might otherwise have been
excluded would not have provided the accused with an opportunity
to conduct a different strategy at trial.  As Lamer J. stated in
Kopornay v. Canada (AttorneyGeneral), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41 at 57:</pre>
    <pre>          &#133;The question therefore, as regards the
          application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii), is whether
          the Crown has discharged the burden of
          satisfying the court that even if the accused
          had known that the finding would be adverse
          to him his defence would have been
          necessarily the same&#133;</pre>
    <pre>I am not satisfied the Crown has discharged its burden in this
regard.
</pre>
    <pre>[67] In the result, I do not believe this to be a proper case for
the application of s.686(1)(b)(iii).
[68] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the
conviction, and order a new trial.

    <pre>
<strong>CARTHY J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[69]  I  am  unable to agree with Weiler J.A.  as  to  the  issue
surrounding the failure to hold a voir dire, and, since I find no
other  valid  grounds  of  appeal, conclude  that  it  should  be
dismissed.  In my view, the failure to hold a voir dire  did  not
affect  the verdict and the appellant could not hope to be  in  a
better  position at a new trial, given a favourable ruling  on  a
voir dire as to what was stated at the T.O.C.</pre>
    <pre>[70] Weiler J.A. has recited the factual and procedural
background of this appeal and I will therefore turn directly to
the issues.</pre>
    <pre>[71]  The evidence at trial indicated that when a member  of  the
O.P.P.  Tactics  and Rescue Unit (&#147;T.R.U.&#148;)  knows  he  has  shot
someone,  he is to inform his commander, who in turn informs  the
incident  commander,  who reports to the  Special  Investigations
Unit  (&#147;S.I.U.&#148;)  On this occasion Sergeant Deane was  acting  in
accordance  with that protocol when he reported to his commander,
Staff   Sergeant  Skinner,  at  the  Tactical  Operations  Centre
(&#147;T.O.C.&#148;).   In  due  course  the S.I.U.  was  informed  of  the
incident  and  commenced its investigation.  Sergeant  Deane  was
interviewed by the S.I.U. and related the same version of  events
as  he  presented  at trial.  A determination of whether  Deane&#146;s
report to Skinner at the T.O.C. is admissible evidence without  a
voir dire has ramifications affecting every police shooting event
that leads to a trial against a police officer, and, viewing such
a  finding as unnecessary in the present case, I choose to  side-
step the issue.
[72] For the purposes of these reasons, I make the assumption
that a voir dire was necessary and that the evidence respecting
Deane&#146;s statements to Skinner should not have been admitted
because they were made to a person in authority.
[73] On that premise, a full analysis of the evidence satisfies
me that nothing inculpatory from such statements was extracted by
the Crown from Mr. Deane or other evidence led by the Crown and,
in fact, the accused benefitted from what occurred at trial by
being given the opportunity he would not otherwise have had to
give exculpatory evidence as to what was said to Skinner.  This
whole issue was complicated by the actions and inaction of
defence counsel and requires detailed analysis of the progress of
the evidence to illuminate what facts were proven and what the
trial judge relied upon.
[74] The first witness called by the defence was the appellant,
Deane. Deane was second in command of the T.R.U. on the evening
of September 6, 1995, acting under orders from Staff Sergeant
Skinner. He recounted in chief his role as leader of the field
group of the T.R.U. whose function was to support the Crowd
Management Unit (C.M.U.) by responding if that unit was
threatened with gunfire.  The appellant described the events as
they developed in the field, much as related by other witnesses,
and then seeing two distinct muzzle flashes aimed toward him from
the area of a sandbar outside the park.  As soon as he saw the
muzzle flashes he discharged four rounds from his gun. He
observed a car careening out of the park striking C.M.U. members
and then saw a man crouching with a rifle aimed at his position.
Fearful that the man would shoot, the appellant discharged three
rounds from his carbine. He saw the individual falter and throw
away his rifle.  Thereafter, both units moved back to the command
centre, which was a trailer in a parking lot about a half mile
away.
[75] Deane&#146;s evidence in chief concludes with his statement that
he then spoke with his team leader (Skinner) and &#147;just told him
what had transpired&#148;, after which he co-operated with the S.I.U.
[76] This final remark about reporting what had transpired to
Skinner does not, in itself, constitute a waiver against any
rights he had to protection against incrimination, but it did
create a setting for what followed.
[77] The cross-examination began with questions concerning the
communication system used in the tactical operation. Deane was
equipped with a head-set and microphone which he could activate
manually and which enabled him to speak to the T.O.C. and the
other members of his unit.  He stated that the muzzle flashes
represented a threat to him and others in the unit, but that he
did not communicate the incident because he didn&#146;t have time to
activate his communication system.  He conceded that he moved 20
metres before the next incident without reporting the muzzle
flashes.  Deane was then asked whether he reported muzzle flashes
to Skinner when he returned to the T.O.C. and he responded &#147;yes,
I did&#148;.  No objection was taken to that question, presumably
because the answer was exculpatory.
[78] Deane was then questioned about spotting the man with a
rifle and, again, he stated that he did not have time to report
this on the communication system.  His testimony was that he
spoke over his radio at a later time requesting an ambulance for
an individual who was &#147;down&#148;.  The appellant&#146;s evidence was that
at this time, he did not report that he had just shot a man with
his rifle.
[79] It should be noted that a recording is normally made of
voice transmissions from the field.  On this evening an error was
made and the recorder not activated.  Thus, Crown counsel
introduced the subject of Skinner&#146;s notes of these transmissions
and stated that he intended to review them with Deane pursuant to
s.11 of the Canada Evidence Act, as a prior oral inconsistent
statement and, if necessary, call Skinner to prove what was said.
This is clearly in the context, at that time, of the field
communications which were not at trial or on appeal the subject
of objection as requiring a voir dire.  This was a perfectly
proper approach under s.10 and s.11 of the Canada Evidence Act,
R.S.C. 1985, Chap.c-5.  The witness is confronted with the
alleged statement and agrees or disagrees with the content. If an
inconsistent statement is disputed by the witness the Crown may
later call evidence to support the alleged prior statement.  If
the witness agrees with the previous statement there is no need
for further evidence and, importantly for this appeal, if the
Crown does not follow with contradictory evidence, the witness
stands unrefuted before the trier of fact and the questions and
suggestions concerning the alleged statement are not evidence of
anything.
[80] The cross-examination continued with a lengthy review of
Skinner&#146;s notes of the radio transmissions which are generally
accepted by Deane as accurate. Finally, Deane was confronted with
the proposition that it seemed strange that neither in the notes
nor in his testimony was there any mention of a report of muzzle
flashes threatening his men or the fact that he shot a man and
thought he might have killed him.
[81] At this point defence counsel objected that it was not
proper to use s.11 of the Evidence Act to take Skinner&#146;s notes
and seek to prove the negative of what was not said.  The Crown&#146;s
reply was that he wasn&#146;t proving anything through the notes.  He
stated that his obligation under s.11 to call the maker of the
notes would only arise in the event of an inconsistency.  Mr.
Scott pointed out that thus far, the appellant had agreed with
everything that he had said and, therefore, there was no
inconsistency.
[82] I agree with his position. At this point in the trial the
evidence was clear and uncontested that neither the muzzle fire
nor the fact that Deane saw a man with a gun and shot him had
been reported on the radio.
[83] Defence counsel then made a statement which tended to steer
the cross-examination:

          MR. PEEL:    Sir I think it&#146;s the whole tenure[sic]
	  of an inference that the best evidence here is
	  these notes and if the issue is a question of the
	  flow and the path, I think there is a duty on this
	  prosecutor to not just be talking and focusing on a
          time and a point when a crisis is still going on. 
	  I think there&#146;s a duty to put the whole picture
	  before the Court of the move back and whether
	  there&#146;s clarification of those issues on the way
	  back.
          
          MR. SCOTT:   Well   Your   Honour   I      am
          more  than prepared to go through these notes
          line  by  line but I&#146;m only as good as  these
          notes.  I don&#146;t have anything more than these
          notes  and  I&#146;ve  undertaken if  there&#146;s  any
          issue  to call Staff Sergeant Skinner and  he
          can explain why if important things were said
          they&#146;re not in his notes.  But right  now  in
          my  respectful  submission  this  is  classic
          cross-examination    on    a    prior    oral
          inconsistent  statement  which  is  permitted
          under  Section 11 of the Canada Evidence  Act
          and  frankly  so  far I don&#146;t  even  have  an
          inconsistency.</pre>
    <pre>[84] A few questions later Crown counsel puts this question:

           Q.  All right now to be fair to you I want to go
               through the rest of the notes, for the Court,
   	       because of my friend&#146;s objection that I 
 	       haven&#146;t painted the entire narrative here.
               The next note is &#147;CMU retreats to TOC.&#148; Is
	       that right?

           A.   Yes.</pre>
    <pre>[85] There was then an interchange in which the Crown sought to
eliminate any ambiguity about what was said over the radio and
this exchange took place:

          Q.   Well I think I asked you before did you
	       do it over the communication system or
	       did you do it face to face. Now what&#146;s
   	       your evidence on this point?

          A.   I know I told him about the bus and the
	       car over the com system.

          Q.   Okay.

          A.   And I&#146;m not sure if I told him
               the  same thing about the muzzle flashes
               or  myself  shooting.  I know  for  sure
               that I talked to him face to face, as to
               the whole incident.

          Q.   Okay  well let&#146;s go through this  slowly
               then.  Is it now your evidence that  you
               did    not   say   anything   over   the
               communication   system   about    muzzle
               flashes or the native with the long arm?

          A.   I&#146;m not positive.  I&#146;m not sure if
               I said that or not.

          Q.   Okay so you don&#146;t know, is the
               best answer you can give on that.

          A.   Yes.

          Q.   All right but what you&#146;re now
               telling  is that you did have a face  to
               face  conversation with  Staff  Sergeant
               Skinner?

          A.   Yes.

          Q.   And  you  told  him,   you
               remembered, having memory of telling him
               about  muzzle  flashes in the  bush,  is
               that right?

          A.   Yes.
          
	  Q.   Is that a conversation  that
               you  had  at  the TOC centre immediately
               after the incident?
          
          A.   Yes it was.</pre>
    <pre>[86] And later:

          Q.   Well did you say to Staff Sergeant
               Skinner &#147;I shot a man out there.&#148;
          A.   I believe I did yes.</pre>
    <pre>[87]  This  latter  evidence  was  repeated  and,  as  the  Crown
persisted with questions emphasizing the seriousness of the event
of  a  shooting,  defence counsel finally  interjected  with  his
objection. He requested that a voir dire be held to determine the
admissibility of statements made to Skinner at the T.O.C., on the
grounds  that Deane was reporting to a person in authority.  This
led  to  the  ruling  by the trial judge that  a  voir  dire  was
unnecessary because &#147;the statements were not made to someone in a
position to control or influence this judicial proceeding&#148;.
[88] In order to understand the impact of this ruling, as late as
it came in the proceedings, it is worth looking back on the
evidence to that point.
[89] Aside from any evidentiary legalities the events in the
field and the telephone communications flowed seamlessly into the
report to Skinner at T.O.C.  This was the obvious belief of
counsel as questioning moved from one area to the other.  It was
highlighted by defence counsel&#146;s statement &#147;I think there&#146;s a
duty to put the whole picture before the Court of the move back
[to T.O.C.] and whether there&#146;s clarification of those issues on
the way back.&#148;
[90] This is not to say that the legal ruling as to the voir dire
has  no  significance  because it was too late  or  that  defence
counsel invited the questions and thus cannot complain.   I  have
assumed that a voir dire should have been held and a ruling  made
concerning inculpatory statements.
[91] The fact is that no inculpatory statements came into
evidence to that point in the trial. Defence counsel may not have
been inclined to object because his client was reaping nothing
but benefit from the review of Skinner&#146;s notes.  Notably, he was
able to put into evidence the self-serving statement that he
reported the muzzle flashes and the shooting to Skinner &#150;
something that he admittedly was unsure of doing while on the
radio transmissions. Any suggested blanks in the notes and the
inference, if any, to draw from them, was not evidence and would
have to await Skinner&#146;s evidence, if he was called by the Crown
to prove an inconsistency.
[92] Another point of significance at this stage of the trial is
that neither then nor on appeal was an exception taken to cross-
examination on the content of the radio transmissions, they being
considered part of the res gestae.  It was that cross-examination
by the Crown that raised the issue of recent fabrication (which
may have been one reason the defence later called Skinner as a
witness) and that suggestion of recent fabrication arising out of
the radio communications made it very helpful to the defence to
be able to establish through Deane&#146;s testimony the otherwise
inadmissible evidence that he reported the full story to Skinner
at T.O.C.
[93] Returning to the progress of the trial, following the voir
dire ruling there was only one question  of Deane concerning his
statement to Skinner and the answer was a simple summary of what
he had said earlier. The situation facing the defence was
identical to that before the ruling.  Insofar as the statements
to Skinner at T.O.C. were concerned the evidence was clear and
entirely exculpatory.  There is not even a mention in evidence
that Skinner&#146;s notes were contradictory or lacked reference to
such statements (although omissions later proved to be the fact
and counsel would have known this at the time).  We are concerned
only with the evidence as it stood, as was the trial judge, and
it remained at that point to be seen whether the Crown would
pursue evidence of a contradiction.
[94] Prior to Deane leaving the stand the Crown and defence
agreed that because recent fabrication had been raised it was
proper for Deane to testify that he had reported all the events
to the S.I.U. a day or so after the incident and in the same
terms as at trial. Deane testified accordingly.
[95] Toward the end of the defence evidence Detective Skinner was
called by the defence to testify.  It was argued on appeal that
this was necessitated by the erroneous voir dire ruling and the
need to meet the allegation of recent fabrication.  I have made
the point earlier that this reasoning was untenable and if in
fact that was defence counsel&#146;s purpose, it was misguided.  The
only evidence before the court was that Deane had reported
everything of significance to Skinner at the T.O.C.  There  were
issues to clarify as to the radio transmissions going to recent
fabrication but not as to the later conversation.  Counsel had
Skinner&#146;s notes and, one would assume had interviewed him.
[96] One argument favouring the appellant, Deane, on this appeal
is that he can fairly state that  with a voir dire ruling in his
favour he could have called Skinner without fear that he could be
cross-examined as to the discussion at the T.O.C.  It remains to
be seen what impact that had upon the evidence and the reasoning
of the trial judge.
[97] Skinner confirmed in chief that Deane had reported to him at
the T.O.C. that he had shot an armed man.  No specific question
was put as to muzzle fire.  In cross-examination he confirms
Deane&#146;s evidence that he did not refer to muzzle flashes over the
radio and then the only reference to muzzle flashes being
referred to at the T.O.C. is:

                  Q.   Now I&#146;m going to suggest to
                  you sir, he never said anything in
                  that conversation face to face
                  about muzzle flashes, right?

                  A.   I don&#146;t recall him saying that
                  about muzzle   flashes at that
                  time, no sir.</pre>
    <pre>[98]  That  answer stands as the sole piece of  evidence  in  the
entire  trial  which  flows from the  voir  dire  ruling  and  is
contrary to the interests of the defence.  The overall effect  of
Skinner&#146;s  evidence on what flows from the voir  dire  ruling  is
that  the  defence was supported with a specific confirmation  of
Deane  reporting the shooting of an armed man countered by a more
vague failure to recollect a report of muzzle flashes.
[99] By way of observation, muzzle flashes reported during the
action would be significant and memorable.  Muzzle flashes
referred to in an ultimate report of the shooting of a armed man
would tend to be of less significance and make a lesser
impression on the memory. Perhaps that is why, as will be seen,
the trial judge makes no reference in his reasons to this segment
of the Crown&#146;s cross-examination.
[100]     The general rule in a case such as this, depending on
findings of credibility, is that the trial will be considered
unfair if any significant evidence going to credibility is
improperly introduced &#150; particularly if the trial was by jury
where the basis for the findings is unknown.  The obvious reason
for the necessity of a new trial is that the accused will be in a
better position on the issue of credibility if the trier of fact
does not consider the impugned evidence.
[101]     The fundamental question is whether the result would
necessarily be the same if the impugned evidence had not been
admitted.  In this case, I see an ancillary and complementary
question.  Has there been a substantial wrong or miscarriage of
justice, (s.686 (1)(b)(iii) of Code), if the credibility of the
appellant would not be enhanced by a favourable voir dire ruling
at a new trial?
[102]     In my view, the circumstances here are unusual in that,
upon full analysis, and despite the conceded error, the
appellant, Deane, cannot expect a fairer trial than he has
received.  If at such a trial  he asserts successfully the same
position on the voir dire the evidence against his credibility
will be stronger than at this trial.  I am also satisfied that
the evidence concerning the reporting of muzzle fire at the
T.O.C. was of such modest significance in the context of the
entire body of evidence, that it played no part in the trial
judge&#146;s conclusion, as reflected in his reasons.  See R. v.
Jackson (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont. C.A.).
[103]     Let me explain the first proposition. At a new trial,
Deane cannot avoid his admitted failure to report either muzzle
flashes or the shooting of an armed man over the radio during the
action.  Therefore, recent fabrication will be an issue.  He can
meet that issue in part, as he did at this trial, by establishing
that he recounted the full details to the S.I.U.  But this leaves
an unfilled gap on the recent fabrication issue because it is a
known fact that he reported something at the T.O.C. to Skinner.
It would not be known what he reported but the gap would exist
and the trier of fact could not fill it in with something
favourable to Deane on the question of recent fabrication. On
that scenario he would be in a more vulnerable position
respecting credibility than at this trial where it was
established that he did report the shooting of an armed man and,
on his testimony, the muzzle flashes, offset only by Skinner&#146;s
evidence that he made very sketchy notes and had no recollection
of muzzle flashes.
[104]     The reality is that at a new trial defence counsel
would probably react as defence counsel did in this trial and
push the Crown to expand the evidence from how Deane reacted in
urgent and pressured circumstances to include what was stated in
the calm of the T.O.C. quarters.  In other words, to improve his
evidentiary position on credibility to the very level it was at
in this trial.
[105]     In sum, this trial was fair because the overall
evidence of Deane&#146;s credibility was as favourable as it could be
and that credibility would undoubtedly be diminished by exclusion
of what was said to Skinner at the T.O.C.
[106]     I will now turn to the trial judge&#146;s reasons for
conviction as a reflection of the significance of the evidence as
to reporting muzzle flashes at the T.O.C.  The reasons open with
a review of the evidence, particularly that of the accused, with
lengthy excerpts from a transcript extending over 23 pages.  With
the exception of two short references to Deane&#146;s evidence as to
reporting to Skinner in the T.O.C. the balance of the references
are to Deane&#146;s actions during the exercise in the field and his
radio transmissions.  The review of the evidence of other defence
witnesses concentrates on what occurred in the field. With
respect to Skinner&#146;s evidence, the trial judge refers to the
report by Deane in this excerpt:

          Question: &#147;What do you recall him telling you?&#148;

          Answer:   &#147;Sergeant  Deane   told   me   when
          he  came  back, he told me he had  discharged
          his  weapon at an armed individual.  That  he
          saw   that  person  fall  down.   His   first
          reaction he told me was to want to go forward
          to  assist but realized he could not  because
          of  the situation. He told me that person was
          then carried back in the park.&#148;
               Later on Sergeant Skinner testified that
          he  had  no  recollection of  Sergeant  Deane
          saying anything over the communication system
          that he saw muzzle flashes and that he had no
          note of any reference to muzzle flashes.   He
          also testified that he recalled being told by
          Sergeant  Deane  that he had  shot  an  armed
          person  and  agreed that he did  not  include
          that point in his notes. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[107]      It  is worth noting that the only inculpatory evidence
against  Deane  which  arose from the voir  dire  ruling  &#150;  that
Skinner  didn&#146;t  remember him reporting  muzzle  flashes  at  the
T.O.C.  &#150;  is  not  mentioned by the trial judge  in  these  very
extensive and detailed reasons.
[108]     The reasons then continue with a long recital of the
trial judge&#146;s skepticism as to the defence witnesses&#146; version of
what happened during the field exercise, without any mention of
reporting events at the T.O.C.  It is apparent that the trial
judge&#146;s total focus is upon the evidence bearing directly on
field events.  He concludes:

               There were no Crown witnesses or defence
	  witnesses that saw any weapons in the hands 
	  of the First Nations people except for Sergeant
	  Deane and except for Constable Chris Cossett. 
	  And at this point perhaps I will comment on the
	  testimony of Constable Cossett.  The Crown
	  called his testimony amusing which is one word.
	  I might choose others.  Rather than scrutinize
	  Constable Cossett&#146;s testimony for any grains of
	  truth that might fall out, I have dismissed it
	  entirely as being clearly fabricated and
          implausible.
                 I   accept   Sergeant  Hebblethwaite&#146;s
          evidence  that  he saw a man  turned  in  the
          direction  of the park after he got  up  from
          his  one knee, that he was bent at the  waist
          and   facing   the   park,  before   Sergeant
          Hebblethwaite turned his attention elsewhere.
                In  the  Court&#146;s view  this  is  not  a
          situation of honest but mistaken belief.  The
          accused has maintained throughout that Dudley
          George  was armed.  And the accused was  able
          to  even describe some of the features of the
          rifle that he saw Dudley George holding.
                I  find  that Anthony O&#146;Brien  (Dudley)
          George  did  not  have any  firearms  on  his
          person  when  he was shot.  I find  that  the
          accused   Kenneth  Deane  knew  that  Anthony
          O&#146;Brien  Dudley  George  did  not  have   any
          firearms  on  his person when  he  shot  him.
          That  the  story of the rifle and the  muzzle
          flash  was concocted ex post facto in an  ill
          fated  attempt to disguise the fact  that  an
          unarmed man had been shot.
                The  accused testified that  the  Court
          heard  essentially the same version of events
          that  was  given  to  the Ontario  Provincial
          Police and the Special Investigations Unit in
          September 1995.
                I  find sir that you were not honest in
          presenting  this  version of  events  to  the
          Ontario Provincial Police investigators.  You
          were not honest in presenting this version of
          events to the Special Investigation&#146;s unit of
          the Province of Ontario.  You were not honest
          in  maintaining  this ruse  while  testifying
          before  this Court. I have considered all  of
          the  evidence presented in this case, and  on
          the   basis  of  the  evidence  that  I  have
          accepted, I find you Kenneth Deane guilty  as
          charged.</pre>
    <pre>[109]      Apart altogether from my previously stated  view  that
the trial was fair despite the voir dire ruling, I cannot see any
possibility that this trial judge would have come to a  different
conclusion if he had excluded from his mind the evidence of  what
was  said at the T.O.C.  Overall that evidence weighed in  favour
of the accused, as did his full relation of events to the S.I.U.,
but was not sufficient to overcome what the trial judge found was
overwhelmingly convincing evidence of what occurred in the field.
The  rifle  that  Dudley George was said to be  holding  was  the
primary focus of attention and the trial judge was unimpressed by
Skinner&#146;s evidence that the appellant reported shooting an  armed
man.  A mere inability on the part of Skinner to remember whether
muzzle  fire  was reported would not be of significance  in  that
context.
[110]     I would therefore not accede to this ground of appeal
because the trial was as fair, or fairer to the appellant, than a
new trial would be and because there is no reasonable possibility
that the verdict would have been different had the error at issue
not been made.  See R. v. Bevan, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599.</pre>
    <pre>Appeal from Application for Mistrial</pre>
    <pre>[111]      One month after the conviction, defence counsel  moved
before  the trial judge for a mistrial on the ground of a  breach
by  the  Crown of a pre-trial agreement. After argument  of  this
motion  and  a  request to lead evidence  on  the  issue  of  the
agreement,  the  trial judge found that no prima facie  case  was
presented to justify further inquiry and dismissed the motion for
a mistrial.
[112]      The  allegation of defence counsel was that the  Crown
had  agreed prior to trial that there would be no contest by  the
Crown  as  to  the fact of muzzle flashes being seen  during  the
skirmish.
[113]     It is my conclusion that the suggestion of such an
agreement is untenable against the trial record.  To refer to
only some of the references from the record cited on the appeal
by Crown counsel:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (1)  The pre-trial agreement was meticulously negotiated and
          reduced to writing and contains not even an oblique
	  reference to muzzle flashes.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (2)  On the evidence known to the Crown of no sighting of muzzle
          flashes by other witnesses it would be irresponsible to
          acknowledge their existence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (3)  Defence counsel in closing argument stated:

          &#133; and so it is against that backdrop that I must then
          submit to the Court that if one stares squarely in the
          face the accusation of the prosecution, the most
          pivotal accusation, it is that some time from some
          point right around when the bus is leaving and the car
          is leaving because by any measure there are no more
          gunshots after that time, by anybody&#146;s evidence after
          they are leaving, that some time in there and before
          morning when Officer Deane makes his notes that he
          fabricates a lie because, says Crown, what has happened
          is he has randomly shot at a person he saw who was
          defenceless and he&#146;s fabricated a lie that that man had
          a gun, fabricated a lie that he shot at muzzle flashes,
          and in order to urge the Court to find such fabrication
          the prosecution centres 90 percent of its attack of
          Officer Deane at the beginning and at the end of the
          critical incident that by any measure must have taken
          about 30 seconds.</pre>
    <pre>[114]      My   conclusion  is  that  defence  counsel,  in   his
disappointment over the verdict, rationalized a variation  on  an
understanding  he had reached with the Crown &#150;  that  the  charge
would not be directed to the shots aimed at the muzzle flashes  &#150;
into an agreement that the muzzle flashes occurred.
[115]     There is in my view no merit in this ground of appeal.
There was no basis laid for calling evidence and the application
was properly dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>Fresh Evidence</pre>
    <pre>[116]     The appellant presented a voluminous carton of evidence
which he proposed to have considered by this court.  Most of  the
evidence  was  conceded to have been available  at  the  time  of
trial,  which led counsel for the appellant to argue  that  trial
counsel may have been incompetent in presenting a defence by  not
calling these witnesses.
[117]     The basic argument was that a miscarriage of justice
would result if this evidence was not introduced at a trial.
[118]     As described to the panel the evidence included that of
neighbours  who  would  testify as to  gunfire  in  the  area  on
occasions  prior  to  the one in question; the  deceased,  Dudley
George,  being seen on prior occasions with a gun and &#150; the  only
evidence not available with reasonable diligence to the defence &#150;
testimony of a neighbour who was listening on a police scanner on
September  6th  and heard someone say &#147;they&#146;re  shooting  at  us,
return fire.&#148;
[119]     There was evidence adduced at trial by the defence as
to the expectancy that the natives were armed and more of the
same would not alter the finding, based on the evidence that on
this occasion they were not armed.  The evidence of what was
heard on the police scanner was hearsay and did not bear upon any
evidence given by defence witnesses, who did not testify that any
such communication affected their conduct.
[120]     The balance of the fresh evidence related to the
alleged agreement between counsel, and as I have already
concluded, the record did not justify a hearing on this issue.
[121]     I therefore conclude that there is no merit in this
ground of appeal.  The appeal against conviction is therefore
dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>Crown Appeal Against Sentence</pre>
    <pre>[122]      The Crown appeals against the conditional sentence  of
two  years  less  a day to be served conditionally  and  seeks  a
penitentiary term. The emphasis of the argument was on the length
of the sentence rather than the fact that it was conditional.  Of
course, a longer sentence could not be served conditionally.
[123]      The sentence was imposed on July 3, 1997 and  has  now
been served in full, including 180 days of community service.  If
a  longer sentence is imposed by this court credit would have  to
be  given for having served two years less a day, even though not
served in an institution.  If a sentence of three years had  been
imposed  at  trial  he  would by now have reached  his  statutory
release date.
[124]     The trial judge gave very careful attention to the
considerations bearing upon sentence in this case, his reasons
running some 25 pages, and he emphasized the unique circumstances
presented to him.
[125]     If I had been the sentencing judge I might well have
been persuaded that a penitentiary term was justified but, giving
very special deference to this trial judge&#146;s conscientious
analysis, and the other factors I have referred to, I would not
interfere.
[126]     The sentence appeal should be dismissed.

L&#146;Heureux Dubé J. reached the conclusion, at 495-6, that the
trial judge&#146;s duty to hold a voir dire &#147;is triggered where the
evidence shows the reasonable possibility that the accused&#146;s
statement was made to a person in authority&#148;.  This formulation
differs from the reasons of Cory J., and from the one that I have
adopted here.  Cory J. concluded at 472:

     &#133; the test for holding a voir dire is assessed by an
     appellate court&#146;s objective review of the evidence in the
     record to determine whether something should have triggered
     the trial judge&#146;s obligation to conduct an inquiry.  This
     test is different from the test applicable on the voir dire,
     which requires the trial judge to undertake an examination
     of the reasonable belief of the accused and the
     circumstances surrounding the making of the statement to
     determine&#133; whether the receiver is a person in authority&#133;.</pre></td>
