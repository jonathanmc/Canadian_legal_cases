    <pre>HEARD:         January 13, 2000
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice MacKenzie dated July 3,
1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   We agree with MacKenzie J. that the appellant does not meet
either  of  the  two  requirements  in  Barclays  Bank  Ltd.   v.
Quistclose  Investments Ltd., [1968] 3 All ER  651  (H.L.).   The
monies were advanced by the appellant as a deposit and were  used
for  that very purpose.  Moreover, the respondents had no  notice
at  the time the monies were given purportedly as a deposit  that
they  were impressed with a trust imposing any obligation on  the
respondents  to  repay  the money if the  transaction  failed  to
close.   To  give effect to the appellant&#146;s argument  that  later
notice  would be effective to impose a trust in this  case  would
engage the very policy concerns to which MacKenzie J. referred in
his reasons for judgment.
[2]  Accordingly the appeal is dismissed with costs.
