    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Epstein J. dated May 18, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

</strong>[1]  The appellant trustee appeals the decision of Epstein J.
(the &#147;motions judge&#148;) dismissing the trustee&#146;s application for an
order approving three proposed assignees as fit and proper
persons to be put in possession of leased premises pursuant to
the Commercial Tenancies Act, s. 38(2).
[2]  The facts in this matter are not in dispute.  The appellant
trustee sold the bankrupt&#146;s assets, which included the leases in
question, to Suny&#146;s Energy Inc. (&#147;New Suny&#148;).  New Suny is
controlled and operated by Cango Inc. (&#147;Cango&#148;).  New Suny was
incorporated specifically to acquire the assets of the bankrupt
entity which had also been known as Suny&#146;s.  While the financial
status of Cango is to some extent disputed by the respondents on
the ground that they claim to have received insufficient
information, there is no doubt but that Cango is an established
business in the retail gas industry.  The proposed assignees are
recently incorporated numbered companies specifically
incorporated to assume the leases at issue.  In an affidavit
filed by the president of Cango and president of each of the
numbered companies, the reason for structuring the transaction in
this manner is explained.  Cango knew little about the lease
arrangements for the sites, the individual profitability of the
sites, and nothing about the environmental status of the sites.
Accordingly, Cango determined &#147;that each lease should be assigned
to a separate company.  As a result we incorporated forty
separate numbered companies to individually take title to the
owned and leased sites&#148;.
[3]  In reaching her decision that the proposed assignees should
not be approved, the motions judge considered the proper test
applicable to this issue, namely, would the proposed tenants be
motivated and able to honour the covenants in the lease, and
would they make proper use of the premises.  See Darrigo
Consolidated Holdings Inc. (Trustee of) v. Norfinch Construction
Toronto) Ltd. (1987), 63 C.B.R. (N.S.) 216 (Ont. H.C.); Micro
Cooking Centres (Canada) Inc. (Trustee of) v. Cambridge
Leaseholds Ltd. (1988), 68 C.B.R. (N.S.) 60.
[4]  The respondent landlords object to the approval of the
numbered companies as fit and proper persons on the grounds that
they are mere shell corporations, specifically created by Cango
to insulate Cango from liability.  In a response to that
objection, Cango and New Suny have offered to provide guarantees
of the obligations to be undertaken by the proposed assignees.
[5]  At the time the matter came before the motions judge, the
proposed assignees had, in fact, been in possession of the leased
premises.  There is no issue but that rent has been paid in a
timely fashion and that the premises have been operated in
accordance with the terms of the lease.  However, the assignees
themselves have not been paying the rent.  Rent has been paid by
the parent corporations.
[6]  In her reasons for judgment, the motions judge stated that
she could not take into consideration the security offered by New
Suny and Cango to assess the fitness of the assignees.  In our
view, that cannot be accepted as a generally applicable statement
of the law.  Where an assignee is a corporate entity, it will
almost always be necessary to consider those behind the
corporation in determining the fitness of the entity.  Moreover,
it is not the law that a newly incorporated entity cannot be
approved as a fit and proper person assuming that it has
appropriate backing: See Darrigo Consolidated Holdings Inc.,
supra.
[7]  However, we are not persuaded that the determination of the
motions judge dismissing the trustee&#146;s application should be
interfered with by this court.  As the motions judge indicated,
the fatal flaw in the trustee&#146;s application is that it seeks to
treat New Suny  and/or Cango as if they were, in fact, the
assignees.  We agree with the conclusion of the motions judge
that the landlords are entitled to look to their tenants as the
primary party responsible for the terms of the lease.  On this
record, it was clearly open to the motions judge to conclude that
the assignees simply did not have the wherewithall to meet those
obligations as they were specifically designed as shell
corporations to insulate the real tenants, New Suny and Cango
from liability.  It was noted by the motions judge that the
operation of these premises is a potentially hazardous
undertaking and the issue of immediate liability is a significant
one. In our view, it was open to her to conclude that a shell
corporation is not a fit and proper person within the meaning of
s. 38(2).
[8]  Accordingly this appeal is dismissed with costs.
                                                                 </pre>
