    <pre><b>On appeal from conviction by Mr. Justice Ewaschuk, sitting with a
jury, on June 13, 1996 and from sentence on August 2, 1996 in the
case of A. Bau Diu.</b></pre>
    <pre><b>
SHARPE J.A.</b></pre>
    <pre><b>                         OVERVIEW</b></pre>
    <pre>[1]  On December 18, 1993, the appellants Diu and Lam went to a
massage parlour. While there, Diu stole possessions belonging to
a group of four other patrons of the massage parlour.  When these
four men realized their possessions were missing, they confronted
the appellants. The situation grew increasingly tense.  The four
men called for reinforcements and were joined by three friends.
Shortly after the reinforcements arrived a shooting took place.
[2]  Three weapons were involved in the shooting: Diu fired a
Colt .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun (the &#147;Colt .45&#148;); Lam
fired a Para-ordinance .45 caliber semi-automatic handgun (the
&#147;Para-ordinance&#148;); one of the other seven men fired a .32 caliber
handgun.  Ten .45 caliber bullets and one .32 caliber bullet were
fired during the shooting.
[3]  When the shooting stopped the appellants stood uninjured.
However, two of the other seven men were dead and two others were
seriously injured.
[4]  Diu and Lam were charged jointly on two counts of first
degree murder and three counts of attempted murder.  The
appellants were tried jointly by a court composed of a judge and
jury, Ewaschuk J. (&#147; the trial judge&#148;) presiding. On June 13,
1996, after a forty-four day trial, they were found guilty of
certain offences.  The jury convicted Diu of three offences:</pre>
    <pre>          1. second degree murder of Van Thai Nguyen (&#147;Thai&#148;);
          2. attempted murder of Van Hue Bui (&#147;Bui&#148;); and
          3. attempted murder of Lai Pham (&#147;Pham&#148;).     </pre>
    <pre>The Jury convicted Lam of four offences:</pre>
    <pre>          1. second degree murder of Minh Chau Nguyen (&#147;Chau&#148;);
          2. second degree murder of Thai;
          3. attempted murder of  Pham; and
          4. attempted murder of Khoan Dao  (&#147;Dao&#148;).</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The appellant Diu was sentenced to life imprisonment without
parole for fifteen years for the second degree murder conviction.
For the two attempted murder convictions, Diu was sentenced to
life imprisonment and twenty-five years concurrent. The appellant
Lam was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole for fifteen
years for the second degree murder convictions and eighteen years
concurrent for the attempted murder convictions.  Both Diu and
Lam also received lifetime firearms prohibitions.
[6]  The appellants appeal their convictions.  Diu also appeals
his sentence.  The appeals were heard together.</pre>
    <pre><b>THE FACTS</b></pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellants Lam and Diu spent most of Friday, December
17, 1993 and Saturday morning drinking beer and taking drugs at
Diu&#146;s residence.  They left for the massage parlour at
approximately 6 a.m. Saturday and, according to Diu, purchased
more drugs on their way.  They were still at the massage parlour
when, at approximately 1:30 p.m., Thai, Chau, Pham and Nhu Vu
Tien (&#147;Tien&#148;) arrived.  The four men placed their possessions in
lockers and went for steam baths and massages.
[8]  The appellant Diu stole money and other possessions while
the four men were away from the locker room.  The four men
returned and discovered the theft.  They claimed that Diu had
stolen some $3,000 from them and waited to speak to the owner of
the massage parlour.  There was evidence that, while in the
locker area, Diu pulled a gun and pointed it at Pham.  Diu denied
this allegation.
[9]  At one point, Diu left the massage parlour for a short
period of time but returned.  Shortly thereafter, three other men
arrived at the massage parlour.  Bui and Dao arrived together.
Pham Trung Xuan (&#147;Xuan&#148;) arrived separately and left shortly
thereafter. Although the evidence varied as to why these three
men came to the massage parlour, the clear implication was that
they had been called to come to assist Thai, Chau, Pham and Tien,
the four men whose possessions had been stolen.
[10] Sometime around 4 p.m., the appellants and the remaining six
men were together on the ground floor of the massage parlour when
the shooting occurred.
[11] There was evidence that a total of eleven shots had been
fired. Diu fired two shots from the Colt .45 and Lam fired four
shots from the Para-ordinance.  Four additional shots were fired
from a .45 caliber gun but the bullets found at the scene could
not be positively linked to either .45 caliber gun.  There was
some dispute as to which appellant fired the four unattributed
shots.  There was evidence that the .32 caliber gun initially
jammed. One of the other six men cleared the jam and fired the
gun once.  A .32 caliber shell casing and a live round of .32
caliber ammunition were found at the scene.
[12] Four of the six men were shot. Chau and Thai died from
gunshot wounds to the head and chest. Two other men were shot,
but survived. Bui was shot in the chest and Pham received gunshot
wounds to the face and right hand.
[13] Diu was arrested at his residence the following morning and
Lam was apprehended in April 1994, nearly four months after the
shooting.</pre>
    <pre><b>THE THEORY OF THE CROWN</b></pre>
    <pre>[14] It was the Crown&#146;s position that the appellants had been
having a drug party since the night before the shooting.  They
went to the massage parlour and stole money and possessions from
the lockers in order to buy more drugs.  When the theft was
discovered, they attempted to intimidate Thai, Chau, Pham and
Tien into leaving.  The appellant Diu pointed the Para-ordinance
at Pham in the locker room.  When it became apparent that the
four men were not going to leave without a resolution of the
situation, the appellants formed a common intention to kill the
four men if it became necessary.  Diu slipped the Para-ordinance
to the appellant Lam and left the massage parlour to retrieve the
Colt .45 from Lam&#146;s jeep.
[15] After Bui and Dao arrived, Lam demanded that Chau give the
appellants his rings.  The appellants then began shooting and
were jointly responsible for all charges.  It was the Crown&#146;s
position that, aside from the appellants, Dao was the only person
armed at the time of the shooting. Dao carried the .32 caliber
gun that initially jammed but was eventually fired once as the
appellants were fleeing the premises.
[16] The Crown submitted that the claim for self-defence and
provocation, in addition to being inherently implausible, was
contradicted by surviving witnesses, the ballistics evidence and
the nature of the injuries.</pre>
    <pre><b>THE THEORY OF THE APPELLANT DIU</b></pre>
    <pre>[17] Diu admitted that he was armed with a Colt .45, which he was
carrying for protection when buying drugs early that morning.  He
maintained that the gun belonged to the appellant Lam.
[18] Diu admitted stealing money and possessions from the four
other patrons, without Lam&#146;s knowledge.  The four men claimed to
be out far more money than Diu had taken.  He left the massage
parlour to look for the owner or for someone who might lend him
money to give to the victims of his theft and then returned.
Tensions escalated when the four men called for reinforcements to
assist them.  Shortly after Bui and Dao arrived, Bui pointed his
gun at Diu and Diu pulled out his Colt .45 and fired twice in
self-defence.  One shot hit Pham by accident and the other hit
Bui.  He fired two other shots without hitting anyone else.
[19] Diu claimed that he did not shoot either of the two men who
were killed, namely, Chau and Thai.  These men were shot by Lam.
Diu said he was not aware that Lam had a gun.
[20] Diu also claimed that the ballistics evidence supported his
testimony.</pre>
    <pre><b>THE THEORY OF THE APPELLANT LAM</b></pre>
    <pre>[21] It was the position of Lam that he did not know that Diu had
committed the theft until after the shooting.  He did not have a
gun in his possession nor was he aware that Diu was armed until
Diu pointed the gun at Pham in the locker area. Lam also
testified that he had never seen the gun before and did not know
where Diu got the gun.
[22] The situation intensified when the four men called for
additional men and guns as back-up.  Bui pulled a gun to shoot
Diu and Thai pulled the Para-ordinance and threatened to kill
Lam.  Lam scuffled with Thai and Chau.  Lam grabbed the Para-
ordinance and fired at Chau in self-defence. Lam fired two more
shots in panic and two other shots to prevent one of the other
four from firing the .32 caliber gun. He was not certain which
shots hit Thai.  He then fled the scene.
[23] Lam maintained that the physical evidence of a scuffle and
the ballistics evidence supported his version of events.</pre>
    <pre><b>THE VERDICT</b></pre>
    <pre>[24] The jury rejected the appellant Diu&#146;s defence of self-
defence in relation to Bui and Pham and found him guilty on two
counts of attempted murder.  The jury also found him guilty of
the second degree murder of Thai.  However, the jury acquitted
Diu on the charge of the first degree murder of Chau and on the
charge of attempted murder of Dao.
[25] The jury rejected Lam&#146;s defences of self-defence and
provocation and found him guilty of the second degree murder of
Chau and Thai and guilty of the attempted murder of Pham and Dao.
However, the jury acquitted Lam of the attempted murder of Bui.</pre>
    <pre><b>THE ISSUES</b></pre>
    <pre>[26] The appellants raised four common grounds of appeal on their
convictions:
     </pre>
    <pre>     1.   Did the trial judge err by admitting evidence of the
          peaceful dispositions of the deceased men Thai and
          Chau?</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Did the trial judge err by admitting Dao&#146;s videotaped
	  statement for the truth of its contents?</pre>
    <pre>     3.   Did the trial judge err by allowing the videotape and
          transcript of Dao&#146;s statement to go to the jury room?</pre>
    <pre>     4.   Did the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury
          on the permissible uses of evidence of the appellants&#146;
          after-the-fact conduct?</pre>
    <pre>[27] The appellant Diu raised four additional issues:</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Did  the trial judge err in refusing to order severance
          in  view  of  the evidence led by Lam as to  Diu&#146;s  bad
          character?</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Did  the  trial judge err in his charge to the jury  on
          the permissible use of evidence of Diu&#146;s bad character?</pre>
    <pre>     3.   Did the trial judge err in his charge to the jury  on
          the issue of self-defence?</pre>
    <pre>     4.   Was the jury&#146;s verdict that Diu was guilty of the second
          degree murder of Thai unreasonable?     </pre>
    <pre>     5.   Was Diu&#146;s sentence unreasonable?</pre>
    <pre>[28] The appellant Lam raised four additional issues:</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Did the trial judge err by giving a limiting instruction
          to the jury respecting the discreditable conduct of Diu?     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   Did the trial judge err by refusing to admit the videotaped
          statement of Tien for the truth of its contents?     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   Did the trial judge err by telling the jury that Lam &#147;asked&#148;
          to have the defence of provocation put to the jury?</pre>
    <pre>     4.   Did the trial judge err by informing the jury that  he
          offered Lam the right to reopen his case?</pre>
    <pre>[29] The respondent raises the following issue:</pre>
    <pre>     1.   If this Court concludes that the trial judge erred on any or
          all of the grounds raised by the appellants, did such error 
	  or errors give rise to a substantial wrong or miscarriage of 
	  justice or may the proviso be applied?</pre>
    <pre><b>ANALYSIS
</b></pre>
    <pre><b>I.   Did the trial judge err by admitting evidence of the
     peaceful dispositions of the deceased men Thai and Chau?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     (a) Facts</b></pre>
    <pre>[30] During the Crown&#146;s case in chief, counsel indicated that he
intended to introduce evidence that neither Thai nor Chau had
criminal records.  The stated purpose of such evidence was to
rebut the defence of self-defence by showing that both Thai and
Chau were of peaceful disposition and that it was therefore less
likely that they had brought the Para-ordinance or had otherwise
acted as the aggressors.
[31] The trial judge refused to allow the evidence relating to
the lack of criminal records, but indicated that he would allow
the Crown to call character evidence relating to Thai and Chau.
The trial judge suggested that a family member might be called.
He indicated, however, that the evidence could not be called as
part of the Crown&#146;s case in chief, but that it could only come by
way of reply, and then, only if the appellants provided a basis
for the defence of self-defence.
[32] Counsel for Lam objected vigourously to the proposed
evidence, but also took the position that if it were to be
admitted, it should be called as part of the Crown&#146;s case and not
by way of reply.  Counsel for Lam submitted it was evident from
the way the trial had gone and the way Crown witnesses had been
cross-examined that self-defence was a live issue and
accordingly, that any evidence the Crown had to rebut that
defence should be called then rather than later in reply. The
trial judge rejected that submission.
[33] After the defence had closed its case, again over the
objection of the appellants, the Crown called Thai&#146;s mother and
Chau&#146;s father. They both testified that they had never known, or
heard from others, of their sons getting into fights in Vietnam,
in refugee camps or in Canada. These were the last witnesses
heard by the jury.
[34] The trial judge referred to this evidence at several points
in his charge to the jury. At one point he stated as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It would be a drastic coincidence, beyond 
conjectural imagination, to believe that someone 
in a white, darkly tinted car, which no person 
beside Lam saw, delivered the twin .45 caliber 
firearms to Thai Nguyen, a person of previous 
peaceful disposition.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[35] Later, after referring to the &#147;peaceful Thai Nguyen&#148;, he
stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>[T]he fact that Chau and Thai Nguyen were both 
unarmed &#133; is even a more important factor to be 
considered in determining whether the accused 
Lam acted under reasonable apprehension or
belief that he would die or be seriously harmed 
by the two unarmed men of previous peaceful 
disposition.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[36] In dealing with the matter specifically, he stated as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>General reputation for peaceful disposition. The 
Crown called My Thi Doan and Tho Huu Nguyen to 
give evidence of the general reputation for 
peaceful disposition in the Vietnamese community 
of the deceased Chau and Thai Nguyen.  My Doan is 
Chau Nguyen&#146;s mother, and Thai Nguyen&#146;s aunt. Tho 
Nguyen is Chau Minh Nguyen&#146;s father and Thai 
Nguyen&#146;s uncle.  Each witness testified that he or 
she had never seen or even heard of either Chau 
Nguyen or Thai Nguyen being involved in a fight. 
From this testimony it is open to you to infer 
that Chau and Thai Nguyen had a general
reputation for peaceful disposition in the 
Vietnamese community.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>     <b>(b) Analysis</b></pre>
    <pre>[37] The appellants&#146; primary submission is that evidence of
peaceful disposition is not admissible to rebut the defence of
self-defence unless the accused has affirmatively attacked the
character of the deceased.  The appellants further submit that
even if the evidence was admissible, the trial judge erred in
allowing it to be called in reply. Finally, it is submitted that
the evidence ought to have been excluded on the ground that it
had virtually no probative value, and that its prejudicial effect
was significant.
[38] The respondent submits that the trial judge did not err in
admitting the evidence and that, even if he did, no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted from its admission.
[39] In general, the character of the victim of crime is
irrelevant and neither the accused nor the Crown may lead such
evidence. A related principle precludes &#147;oath-helping&#148; evidence
from a party to bolster the character of a witness absent an
attack on the witnesses&#146; character by the other side to impeach
credibility: see R v. Clarke (1998), 112 O.A.C. 233 (C.A.).
[40] There are, however, circumstances in which the character or
disposition of the victim of a crime may be relevant.  It has
been found, in some cases, that evidence of the disposition of
the deceased may be relevant to a charge of murder where the
accused relies on self-defence.   A useful starting point in this
area is the judgment of Martin J.A. in R. v. Scopelliti (1981),
63 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (Ont. C.A.). In that case, the accused,
relying on self-defence, introduced evidence of his own peaceful
disposition and of the violent disposition of the two deceased.
Martin J.A. held that the accused had opened the door and that
the Crown was entitled to lead evidence that the deceased were of
peaceful disposition. In the course of his reasons, Martin J.A.
observed, at p. 493, that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133;the admission of such evidence accords in principle 
with the view expressed by this Court that the 
disposition of a person to do a certain act is 
relevant to indicate the probability of his having 
done or not having done the act. The law prohibits 
the prosecution from introducing evidence for the 
purpose of showing that the accused is a person who 
by reason of his criminal character (disposition) is 
likely to have committed the crime charged, on 
policy grounds, not because of lack of relevance.
There is, however, no rule of policy which excludes 
evidence of the disposition of a third person for 
violence where that disposition has probative value 
on some issue before the jury. [Citations omitted.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>However,  Martin  J.A. went on to caution against  the  potential
dangers  posed by disposition evidence, and added at p. 496  that
&#147;great  care  must  be  taken to ensure that  such  evidence,  if
admitted, is not misused&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[41] While not dealing with evidence of disposition in this
precise context, R. v. Watson (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 310 at 327-
8 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Sims (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 402 at 421
(B.C.C.A.); and MacMillan v. The Queen, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824 at
827 confirm the basic point, explained by Martin J.A., that there
is no rule excluding evidence of the disposition of the deceased
or a third party where such evidence is relevant, provided the
trial judge concludes that the probative value of such evidence
is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.
[42] In R. v. Soares (1987), 34 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (Ont. C.A.), the
accused raised the defences of self-defence and accident to a
charge of murder. The accused did not call evidence to suggest
that the deceased had a violent disposition. There was, however,
evidence that the deceased was intoxicated at the time he met his
death, and the Crown called the deceased&#146;s father to testify as
to the normal behaviour of the deceased when intoxicated.  Morden
J.A., at pp. 429-431, provided a helpful review of the
authorities and arguments on the admissibility of character or
propensity evidence in cases of self-defence. Morden J.A.
referred to Wigmore on Evidence (Tillers Rev.), vol. 1A (1983),
pp. 1369 and 1372-3, arguing in favour of a rule that would allow
the prosecution to introduce evidence of the victim&#146;s good
character in any case in which the issue of self-defence is
raised.  That text notes that while some American jurisdictions
have adopted this rule, most have not.  Some have adopted the
intermediate position, reflected by the Federal Rules of
Evidence, permitting the prosecutor to lead evidence of the
victim&#146;s peaceful disposition where the accused offers evidence
to show the victim was the aggressor, but only in homicide cases.
[43] Morden J.A. also quoted the Report of the Federal/Provincial
Task Force on Uniform Rules of Evidence (1982), favouring the
approach in the U.S. Federal Rules of Evidence (at p. 91):</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>[S]hould the Crown be allowed to adduce evidence
of the victim&#146;s character to rebut a defence of self-
defence when the accused makes no attack upon the
disposition or general character of the victim for
violence? In the opinion of the Task Force, the
defence of self-defence by necessary implication
involves an allegation that the victim was the
aggressor. In homicide cases the victim will not be
there to deny it, and reputation evidence as to his
peaceable nature is therefore an important factor in
determining what weight to give to the evidence of the
accused. The Task Force therefore unanimously agrees
that reputation evidence as to the character of the
victim should be admissible at the instance of the
Crown in homicide cases where the accused offers a
defence of self-defence. The same rule should apply to
assault cases not involving homicide if the victim is
unavailable as a witness due to death or serious
mental or physical illness that precludes him from
testifying.          </pre>

    </blockquote>
    <pre>Morden J.A. concluded as follows:          </pre>
    <pre>          On the basis of the reasoning in the foregoing
          passages it may be that the calling of character 
	  evidence of peaceable disposition of the deceased 
	  in a homicide case should not be confined to cases 
	  where the accused has adduced character evidence 
	  respecting the deceased but should also be allowed 
	  where the accused adduces evidence that he was 
	  acting in self-defence on the occasion in question. 
	  Assuming this to be the law, and assuming also
          that it is applicable to a case where the defence 
	  evidence is that the deceased was the first aggressor 
	  but the defence is not self-defence but accident, its 
	  application to the particular pieces of evidence in 
	  question in this case raises some uncertainties and 
	  difficulties to which I now turn.</pre>
    <pre>[44] Morden J.A. concluded, however, that the Crown&#146;s evidence in
Soares was not of sufficient probative value on any issue to
warrant a finding of admissibility.
[45] Soares then leans in the direction of admissibility, but
does not decide the point.  The case does emphasize that,
assuming such evidence is not excluded, it should only be
admitted after careful consideration of whether it has sufficient
probative value.
[46] The issue was also canvassed in  R. v. Dejong (1998), 125
C.C.C. (3d) 302 (B.C.C.A.). The accused, charged with murder,
testified that the deceased had pointed a gun at him and that in
response, he had acted in self-defence. There was evidence that
the deceased was in the habit of carrying a starter pistol. The
Crown led evidence in rebuttal of the deceased&#146;s peaceful
disposition. The British Columbia Court of Appeal held that the
evidence should not have been admitted and ordered a new trial.
Writing for the court, Rowles J.A. observed that the only
relevance the evidence of peaceful disposition could have was
with respect to the defence of self-defence. After reviewing the
authorities, including Scopelitti and Soares, supra, Rowles J.A.
stated as follows at p. 323:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>R. v. Soares, supra, highlights one of the 
difficulties with the recommendation of the 
Canadian Task Force. It is not every case 
where self-defence is raised that evidence 
of the deceased&#146;s &#147;peaceable character&#148; is 
going to have probative value in relation 
to a fact in issue. Having an inflexible 
rule governing the admissibility of such 
evidence would eliminate the discretion to
exclude evidence where its probative value 
is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Rowles  J.A. considered the evidence in the light of  the  issues
raised and in the end concluded at pp. 325-6 that the evidence:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>should not have been admitted because whatever 
probative value it may have had (and I am 
inclined to the view that it had virtually none) 
was substantially outweighed  by its prejudicial
effect.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[47] The appellants rely on R. v. Wood (1951), 35 Cr. App. R. 61
(Cir. Ct.) and R. v. Johnson (1965), 49 C.R. 176 (N.S.S.C.).
These cases are said to stand for the proposition that the
defence must first attack the credibility of the party in
question before the Crown can adduce evidence of his or her
peaceful disposition or good character.  However, in Wood, the
court was not dealing with self-defence in a murder trial.  Thus,
the proposed character evidence was properly excluded as &#147;oath-
helping&#148; since the victim could testify.  Likewise, it is unclear
that self-defence was even an issue in Johnson.
[48] It may be said that restricting evidence of peaceful
disposition to cases where the accused has attacked the character
of the victim is consistent with the similar rule arising from
the rule against &#147;oath-helping&#148; evidence.  While this argument
may well apply in cases other than murder, i.e. where the victim
of an assault is available to testify, the argument is not
compelling in a murder case as the deceased cannot testify and
there is no oath to help.
[49] My review of the authorities has led me to conclude that no
clear rule has been laid down with respect to evidence of
peaceful disposition.  It is, however, well established as a
general proposition that there is no rule excluding evidence of
the disposition of a third party, provided such evidence is
relevant.  Once that basic proposition is accepted, it seems to
me that the question becomes one of assessing the relevance of
the disposition evidence to the issues raised, and if the
evidence is relevant, ensuring that its probative value outweighs
its prejudicial effect.
[50] Whether the evidence is relevant will depend upon the issues
raised by the case: &#147;Relevance must be determined not in a vacuum
but in relation to some issue in the trial&#148;: R. v. Seaboyer
(1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 390 (S.C.C.).   The test for
relevancy is not high.  In Clarke, supra, at pp. 241-42,
Rosenberg J.A. explained:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>[T]he test of relevancy in the law of evidence 
is not an exacting one and is not dependent upon 
scientific proof.  In R. v. B. (L); R. v. G. (M.A.) 
(1997), 102 O.A.C. 104; 116 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (C.A.) 
at 492 [C.C.C.], Charron J.A. quoted Paciocco &amp;
Stuesser, Essentials of Canadian Law:  The Law of 
Evidence (1996), at p. 19.  The authors explained 
that evidence will be deemed relevant &#147;where it has 
some tendency as a matter of logic and human 
experience to make the proposition for which it is
advanced more likely than that proposition would 
appear to be in the absence of that evidence&#148;.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[51] As already noted, it has been found that evidence of
peaceful disposition may be relevant where the accused has
attacked the character of the deceased.  I can see no reason to
adopt the strict exclusionary rule advocated by the appellants
precluding the receipt of such evidence in all other
circumstances.  However, I hasten to add that, as has been
repeatedly observed in the cases dealing with evidence of
propensity, there are obvious inherent dangers involved in its
use.  In my view, this is an area where trial judges must
scrutinize the evidence with particular care to ensure that its
probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect.  Thus, while I
accept the logic of the arguments that persuaded Wigmore and the
Federal/Provincial Task Force to recommend admissibility, it is
my view that evidence of this kind poses dangers of misuse and
that trial judges should be alive to such dangers.
[52] The power of the trial judge to exclude relevant evidence on
the basis that its prejudicial effect outweighs its probative
value is well-established: see e.g. Seaboyer, supra, at pp. 390-
92; Clarke, supra. As I have already noted, this power has been
applied with some frequency to exclude evidence of propensity in
situations similar to those posed by the case at bar: see Soares
and DeJong, supra.
[53] In the circumstances of the present case, I accept that
evidence tending to show that given their dispositions, Thai and
Chau were unlikely to have brought the Para-ordinance or to have
been the aggressors on the day of the shooting, was relevant to
the defence of self-defence.  However, the trial judge appears
not to have turned his attention to the potential misuse of the
evidence in the case at bar. In my view, he ought to have done
so.  The evidence led by the Crown had virtually no probative
value.  A mother or a father is not well-placed to give evidence
of their son&#146;s reputation for violence.  It is difficult to see
how, in the circumstances of this case, the evidence from the
parents of the victims could have assisted the jury.
[54] Not only did the evidence have little or no probative value;
the danger that it would be misused by the jury was also
considerable. Evidence from the parents of the deceased was bound
to evoke sympathy.  The very nature of the witnesses made the
evidence highly prejudicial. In this case the prejudice is clear
&#150; there was a danger that the evidence would arouse the jury&#146;s
emotions of sympathy towards the victims and their families and
hostility towards the appellants.
[55] The prejudicial effect was significantly amplified by the
learned judge&#146;s decision to allow the two witnesses to be called
in reply. In my view, if the evidence was to be admitted at all,
it should have come as part of the Crown&#146;s case in chief. It was
clear from the way the trial proceeded that self-defence was a
live issue before the close of the Crown&#146;s case. There was no
element of surprise.  Nor was the Crown unable to anticipate that
the evidence might be needed. In the words of the Supreme Court
of Canada, this was not a &#147;new matter or defence which the Crown
has had no opportunity to deal with and which the Crown . . .
could not reasonably have anticipated&#148; but rather a matter that
tended to &#147;merely confirm or reinforce earlier evidence adduced
in the Crown&#146;s case which could have been brought before the
defence was made&#148;: see Krause v. The Queen (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d)
385 at 391 (S.C.C.). Indeed, the Crown sought to introduce the
evidence as part of its case and did not do so only because the
trial judge insisted that it come by way of reply.  I note that
the Federal/Provincial Task Force recommended that such evidence
be adduced in chief by the Crown rather than by way of reply.  I
would add that even if it fell within the discretion of the trial
judge to allow the evidence to be led in reply, in weighing
prejudicial effect against probative value, the timing of
presentation of the evidence was an important factor. The last
testimony that the jury heard was evidence from the family
members of the deceased.  This raised the danger that the jury
would convict the appellants out of sympathy for the deceased
rather than on the basis of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (c) Conclusion</b></pre>
    <pre>[56] Accordingly, I conclude that the trial judge erred in
admitting the evidence of the peaceful disposition of Chau and
Thai.</pre>
    <pre><b>II.  Did  the  trial  judge  err  by admitting  Dao&#146;s  videotaped
     statement for the truth of its contents?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     (a) Facts</b></pre>
    <pre>[57] Dao was the only Crown witness who had seen the shootings
but had not been shot himself. At trial, Dao testified that
although he was in the massage parlour at the time of the
shooting and heard gun shots and yelling, he did not see who had
the guns or who did the shooting.  Indeed, he testified that he
did not see the two appellants in the massage parlour at all.
This evidence was inconsistent with the version he had given the
police by way of a videotaped statement the day after the
shooting.  In that statement, he gave a version of the facts that
was highly damaging to both appellants.  The version given by Dao
in his videotaped statement was that the appellants were the
aggressors and that they had not acted in self-defence. In
particular, Dao stated that Diu had been the first to show his
gun, that the appellants had pulled their guns on the other men
in the lounge, that Lam had demanded that Chau give him two
diamond rings and that when Chau refused, Lam shot him in the
head.  Dao stated that Diu shot at Chau twice after Chau fell to
the ground. He also stated that he saw Diu shoot Bui and Pham.
[58] Due to the fact that Dao retracted significant aspects of
his videotaped statement, the respondent sought a ruling that the
videotaped statement be admitted into evidence for the truth of
its contents on the authority of R.v. B (K.G.) (1993), 79 C.C.C.
(3d) 257 (S.C.C.).  The circumstances surrounding the taking of
the videotaped statement, as revealed by the evidence led on the
voir dire to determine its admissibility, were as follows.
[59] The shootings took place at the massage parlour at about
4:00 p.m.  Shortly after the shootings, the police took Dao to
the police station.  By 7:00 p.m. Saturday, Dao gave an
audiotaped statement to the police. The statement was not under
oath. Dao remained in the custody of the police and at 1:40 a.m.
the next morning he made a videotaped statement. The videotaped
statement was not under oath. The police officers who took the
statement testified on the voir dire that they had called a
Justice of the Peace to administer an oath, but he did not appear
and the officers proceeded to take the statement unsworn.
[60] At the beginning of the interview, the officer conducting
the interview explained to Dao that he needed him to tell the
truth and that if he did not tell the truth he could be charged
with the offences of fabricating evidence, obstructing justice or
public mischief.  Neither the elements of those offences nor the
sanctions were explained.
[61] During cross-examination in the voir dire on the
admissibility of the videotape statement, Dao testified that he
did not understand that he was going to be charged with a
criminal offence if he lied because that was not fully explained
to him. Crown counsel did not cross-examine on this point.     </pre>
    <pre><b>     (b) The Trial Judge&#146;s Ruling on Admissibility</b></pre>
    <pre>[62] The trial judge found that the Crown had satisfied the
burden of establishing that Dao&#146;s videotaped statement met the
criteria of necessity and reliability mandated by R. v. B.
(K.G.), supra, and allowed the Crown&#146;s application to admit Dao&#146;s
videotaped statement for the truth of its contents.
[63] As it was clear that Dao had retracted significant aspects
of his videotaped statement, there was no issue as to necessity.
[64] The trial judge found that the lack of an oath was not fatal
to the Crown&#146;s application.  He found that the police told Dao,
and Dao understood, that he must tell the truth. The police
&#147;detailed&#148; the three criminal charges that he could face if he
lied. As a result the trial judge found as a fact that Dao
understood the solemnity of the situation and that he knew he had
a duty to tell the truth and that he would be punished if he did
not.
[65] The trial judge noted that there was an urgent need for the
police to take Dao&#146;s statement for four reasons: Dao was
Vietnamese and, according to the trial judge, the Vietnamese &#147;are
notoriously hostile to giving statements to the police&#148;; Dao was
afraid; Dao was, at the time, uncontaminated by outside sources;
and there was a need to take Dao&#146;s statement before his sense of
civic duty to cooperate and tell the truth waned.
[66] The trial judge found the statement to be reliable and
circumstantially trustworthy because it was confirmed in material
respects by evidence already tendered at trial and any
inconsistencies with the rest of the evidence could be pointed
out on cross-examination.
[67] The trial judge further found that despite Dao&#146;s trial
evidence that he could recall very little about the shootings, he
could still be effectively cross-examined. He noted that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>While the witness Dao now purports to remember little 
about the shootings, he does nonetheless purport to 
remember many details.  It is available to defence 
counsel to cross-examine Dao on the details as to the 
source of the particular evidence and to point out to 
Dao the improbability of that evidence through various 
items of contradictory evidence.     </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre><b>     (c) Analysis</b></pre>
    <pre>[68] Until recently, prior inconsistent statements were only
admissible for the purpose of impeaching the credibility of a
witness.  Unless the witness adopted the statement at trial, the
prior statement was not admissible to establish the truth of its
contents.  The basis for the exclusionary rule was that the prior
statement is hearsay. The evidentiary dangers associated with
hearsay statements are the absence of oath or affirmation, the
inability to assess the declarant&#146;s demeanor, and the lack of
contemporaneous cross-examination. It is now firmly established
that where the prior statement meets the twin tests of necessity
and reliability, the dangers of hearsay evidence may be avoided
and the statement may be received for the truth of its contents:
B. (K.G.), supra. The reliability inquiry turns from a
recognition of the dangers inherent in hearsay evidence to a
search for indicia of reliability which provide a sufficient
safeguard of the trustworthiness of the statement to overcome the
concerns arising out of those dangers: R. v. Tat (1997), 117
C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 509 (Ont. C.A.).
[69] In the leading case, B. (K.G.), supra, at p. 294, Lamer
C.J.C. set out a list of circumstances that a court could
consider when determining whether a prior inconsistent statement
is sufficiently reliable to admit it for the truth of its
contents:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Therefore, the requirement of reliability will be 
satisfied when the circumstances in which the prior 
statement was made provide sufficient guarantees of 
its trustworthiness with respect to the two hearsay 
dangers a reformed rule can realistically address: 
if (i) the statement is made under oath or solemn
affirmation following a warning as to the existence 
of sanctions and the significance of the oath or 
affirmation, (ii) the statement is videotaped in its 
entirety, and (iii) the opposing party, whether the 
Crown or the defence, has a full opportunity to 
cross-examine the witness respecting the statement, 
there will be sufficient circumstantial guarantees 
of reliability to allow the jury to make substantive 
use of the statement. Alternatively, other 
circumstantial guarantees of reliability may suffice to
render such statements substantively admissible, 
provided that the judge is satisfied that the 
circumstances provide adequate assurances of reliability 
in place of those which the hearsay rule traditionally 
requires.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[70] In a later decision, Lamer C.J.C. observed that the court
should take a flexible, case-by-case approach when assessing the
necessity and reliability of the prior statement.  The principled
approach to exceptions to the hearsay rule should not mimic the
rigid pigeon-holing of the rule&#146;s traditional exceptions: R. v.
U. (F.J.) (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 108 (S.C.C.).  Instead,
the court should consider all the circumstances of each case and
not rely on a fixed checklist.
[71] B (K.G.), supra, is one of a line of cases in which the
Supreme Court of Canada has transformed the common law relating
to hearsay evidence: see R. v. Khan (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 92
(S.C.C.); R. v. Smith (1992), 75 C.C.C. (2d) 257 (S.C.C.). While
the Court applied the same principle of reliability in B (K.G.)
as in the earlier cases, it is apparent that the test for
reliability is more stringent in the case of a prior inconsistent
statement than for other forms of hearsay. The reason the search
for reliability is particularly acute in these circumstances is
that a prior inconsistent statement is proffered to contradict
the truth of the declarant&#146;s sworn testimony at trial: B. (K.G.),
supra, at p. 288; Tat, supra, at p. 510.
[72] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in several
ways in ruling that Dao&#146;s videotaped statement should be admitted
for the truth of its contents.  The respondent submits that the
trial judge properly admitted the statement, and that in any
event, if he did err, there was no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice and the proviso should be applied.     </pre>
    <pre>     <b>(i)  Did the trial judge fail to consider the absence of a
          warning as to the penalty for failing to tell the
          truth?</b></pre>
    <pre>[73] The police officers who took the statement told Dao that he
could be charged with fabricating evidence, obstructing justice,
and public mischief.  However, the police did not explain to Dao
the requisite elements of these offences, nor did they warn him
of the possible penalties that could result if he were convicted
of any of these offences.
[74] The appellants rely on the reasons of Lamer C.J.C. in B.
(K.G.), supra, at pp. 290-1 in support of the proposition these
failures undermine the reliability of the statement:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Of course, the incentives provided by the declarant&#146;s
exposure to prosecution under ss.137, 139 and 140 in 
relation to the first statement, and his or her fear 
of a perjury prosecution in relation to testimony 
given at trial, will only be effective if these 
sanctions are made known to the declarant. For this
reason, the witness should be warned by the person 
taking the statement that the statement may be used 
as evidence at a subsequent trial if the witness 
recants (thereby engaging s.137), and also that severe 
criminal sanctions will accompany the making of a 
false statement. This warning should refer specifically 
to ss.137, 139 and 140 of the Criminal Code, and repeat 
the elements of and sanctions for those offences.  As 
does the formal swearing of the witness in the trial 
process, this warning and the administration of the 
oath should serve to bring home to the witness the 
gravity of the situation and his duty to tell the
truth. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[75] The respondent submits that the failure to inform Dao about
the sanctions for these offences does not mean that Dao did not
understand the gravity of the situation or the duty to tell the
truth. However, it must not be forgotten that Dao&#146;s
uncontradicted testimony on the voir dire was that he did not
understand that he could be charged with a criminal offence if he
lied.
[76] By simply telling Dao that he could be charged with
fabricating evidence, obstructing justice, and public mischief,
the police officers taking the statement failed to comply with
the recommended warning in B. (K.G.), supra.  As stated by this
court in R. v. Conway (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 579 at 587, Dao should
have been warned that, if he recants, &#147;the statement may be used
as evidence at a subsequent trial and also that severe criminal
sanctions will accompany the making of a false statement&#148;.  Here,
the police officers merely recited the possible offences and made
no effort to impress upon Dao the serious consequences that would
flow in the event he failed to tell the truth.  The failure to
follow the warning recommended by the Supreme Court of Canada in
B. (K.G.) must be considered together with the absence of an oath
in determining whether the solemnity of the occasion was brought
home to Dao before he made his statement.     </pre>
    <pre>     <b>(ii) Did the trial judge err by discounting the significance 
	  of the oath in general and in particular to persons of 
	  Vietnamese heritage?</b></pre>
    <pre>[77] The trial judge admitted the videotaped statement despite
the fact that it was not made under oath. It is clear that the
trial judge discounted the significance of the oath with respect
to Dao.  In his ruling, he stated that the Vietnamese &#147;are
notoriously hostile to giving statements to the police&#148;. Similar
comments were made by the trial judge during the course of
argument regarding assumed attitudes of Vietnamese to the oath.
At one point, the trial judge stated &#147;I&#146;m sure in Vietnam there&#146;s
no oath, so it&#146;s foreign to them&#148;.
[78] To the extent that these comments are indicative of the
adoption of a racial stereotype as to the attitudes of persons of
Vietnamese origin to the police or to telling the truth, they are
plainly unacceptable.
[79] An oath or affirmation is not an absolute requirement for a
finding of reliability.  There will be situations where an
appropriate substitute for the oath may be established and,
notwithstanding the absence of the oath, the statement may be
found to be reliable.  However, as Lamer C.J.C. stated in B.
(K.G.), supra, at p. 291 &#147;these occasions may not be frequent&#148;.
In the present case, the absence of an oath must be taken
together with the failure of the police to explain in an adequate
fashion the potential legal consequences of failing to tell the
truth.     </pre>
    <pre><b>     (iii) Did the trial judge err by finding that that there
           existed a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine Dao?</b></pre>
    <pre>[80] The most significant danger associated with the admission of
hearsay evidence is the absence of contemporary cross-
examination: B. (K.G.), supra, at p. 293; Tat, supra, at p. 511,
Conway, supra, at p. 589. In the case of a prior inconsistent
statement, the problem can frequently be remedied by cross-
examination of the witness at trial. However, where the recanting
witness cannot recall making the prior statement or has no
present recollection of the facts related in the prior statement,
cross-examination at trial will only test the witness&#146;
credibility, not the reliability of the statement itself.
Although Dao testified at trial that some parts of his videotaped
statement were true, and that parts were lies, he consistently
failed to recall key elements of his videotaped statement that
were damaging to the appellants.  During the course of his cross-
examination on the contents of his videotaped statement, Dao
claimed that he could not remember over 70 times.  The appellants
submit that Dao&#146;s stated lapse of memory effectively deprived the
appellants of any opportunity to cross-examine him on the version
of the shootings he gave in his videotaped statement.
[81] Lamer C.J.C. dealt with this issue in U. (F.J.), supra, at
p. 119:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The first factor contributing to reliability is the 
cross-examination of the witness. If the witness 
provides an explanation for changing his or her story, 
the trier of fact will be able to assess both 
versions of the story, as well as the explanation. 
However, where a witness does not recall making an
earlier statement, or refuses to answer questions, 
the trial judge should take into account that this 
may impede the jury&#146;s ability to assess the ultimate 
reliability of the statement.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[82] In view of Dao&#146;s professed inability at trial to recall any
of the significant details of the shootings that he had related
in his videotaped statement, it is clear that the trial judge
erred in his assessment of the effectiveness of cross-examination
of Dao as an indicator of the reliability of the prior
inconsistent statement. Conway states that where cross-
examination is ineffective, the other indicia of reliability
become more important. In the present case, however, there are
few, if any, sufficient indicators of reliability.     </pre>
    <pre>     <b>(iv) Did the trial judge err by relying on confirmatory evidence
          from trial to establish the threshold reliability of the
          statement?</b></pre>
    <pre>[83] The trial judge did not have the benefit of three decisions
of this Court holding that confirmatory evidence from other
sources is irrelevant to the threshold reliability inquiry. R. v.
Merz (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 161 at 175, Conway, supra, at p. 593.
Tat, supra, at pp. 512-513. Those decisions establish that the
question of threshold reliability is to be assessed on the basis
of the circumstances in which the prior statement was made that
tend to diminish the danger of admitting out of court statements.
As was stated by Doherty J.A. in Merz, supra, at p. 175:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The reliability inquiry, when made in the context of
determining the admissibility of a hearsay statement, 
looks to those factors surrounding the making of the 
statement which tend to diminish the risks associated 
with the admission of out-of-court statements.  
Evidence from other witnesses which is consistent with 
the substance of an out-of-court statement is not a 
circumstance surrounding the making of that statement 
and cannot generally be seen as diminishing the risks 
associated with the admission of hearsay evidence.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[84] The respondent concedes that the trial judge erred by
relying on confirmatory evidence from the trial when deciding the
question of threshold reliability.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (v)  Did the trial judge err by treating urgency and the
          good faith of the police officers who took Dao&#146;s
          statement as indicia of reliability?</b></pre>
    <pre>[85] As noted, the trial judge considered the good faith of the
police officers conducting the interview, and the urgent need to
conduct the interview as indicia of the statement&#146;s reliability.
With respect, these factors had no bearing on the issue of
reliability.  The evidentiary dangers associated with hearsay
evidence are the absence of oath or affirmation, the inability by
the court to assess the declarant&#146;s behaviour and the lack of
contemporaneous cross-examination. It is difficult to see how the
urgency, or lack thereof, felt by the police officers conducting
the interview, in any way diminishes the risks associated with
admitting the statement for the truth of its contents.  The good
faith of the officers is similarly irrelevant to the trial
judge&#146;s consideration of whether the statement meets the
threshold test for reliability and admissibility. While it is
conceivable that an interview conducted in bad faith could affect
the voluntariness of the statement, and thus its admissibility,
it is difficult to see how an officer&#146;s good faith diminishes the
traditional hearsay dangers associated with a prior statement.
[86] The requirement for an oath is not onerous.  Police officers
should have no difficulty finding someone to put the declarant
under oath.  Dao was at the police station for several hours.
Recognizing &#147;good faith&#148; efforts as a substitute for the oath in
these circumstances would turn the following observation of Lamer
C.J.C. in B. (K.G.) supra, at p. 291 on its head:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Were the oath an absolute requirement for a finding 
of reliability, the only prior inconsistent statements 
which could be received would be statements made in 
circumstances where the person receiving the statement 
is authorized to administer the warning and the oath 
or affirmation. Thus, statements made to family 
members or friends would generally not comply, unless 
the witness then repeats the statement for 
appropriately authorized persons.  In the case of 
police interviews, this would likely present no real 
difficulty, since each police station will usually 
have a justice of the peace present or readily available
for interim release hearings. The justice could then 
administer the warning before the statement is made, and 
the oath after the statement is made. Similarly, police 
officers on duty as the officer in charge could be made 
commissioners for the taking of oaths in the province, 
and administer the warning and oath in the justice&#146;s 
absence.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>     <b>(vi) Did the trial judge err in finding that the fact that the
          statement was made immediately following the events rendered
	  it more reliable?</b></pre>
    <pre>[87] The trial judge concluded that the fact that the statement
was taken within 24 hours of the shooting, and before Dao had
&#147;spoken to any outside contaminating sources&#148;,  was an indicator
of reliability.
[88] The respondent submits that the fact that the statement was
made relatively soon after the event is an important circumstance
in assessing the reliability of the statement. In support of this
position, the respondent cites Tat, supra, at p. 510, where
Doherty J.A. stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>What circumstances surrounding the taking of the 
January 5th, statement compensate for three inherent 
[hearsay] dangers outlined above? I can find only two. 
The statement was made relatively soon after the event 
described in the statement and Q. had no personal 
stake in making the identifications.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[89] However, Doherty J.A. did not find that this factor
&#147;compensated for the inherent dangers&#148; of admitting the hearsay
statement. In fact, Doherty J.A. found that the statement should
not have been admitted for the truth of its contents.
[90] As Labrosse J.A. noted in Conway, supra, at p. 591, except
in the case of small children, the timing of the statement is a
neutral factor in the assessment of threshold reliability:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Finally, the trial judge relied on the timing of the
statement. As noted in KGB, a statement is neither 
more nor less likely to be true based solely on a 
consideration of when it was made (p. 276 C.C.C.). 
(This is not the same situation as referred to by 
McLachlin J. in R. v. Khan,  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531, 
where because of the special consideration that comes 
into play in the case of a child of tender years, the 
timing between the alleged assault and the spontaneous 
declaration may be relevant to the issue of 
reliability.)</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[91] Moreover, as pointed out by the appellants, the videotaped
statement was not the first statement Dao gave to the police and
it was made over eight hours after he was first taken to the
police station.  The fact that Dao&#146;s statement was given before
discussing the events with anyone may make it more credible, but
in the circumstances of this case, the timing of this statement
cannot by itself provide a sufficient indicator of reliability to
justify the admission of the videotape for the truth of its
contents.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (d) Conclusion</b></pre>
    <pre>[92] It is clear from B. (K.G.) and U. (F.J.) that a flexible,
case-specific approach is to be taken with respect to the
determination of the reliability factor. However, viewed as a
whole, it is my view that given the accumulation of errors, the
ruling of admissibility cannot be sustained.  The mere recitation
of the names of the three offences that Dao could be charged with
if he lied on the statement was insufficient to diminish the
traditional hearsay dangers associated with out of court
statements.  The trial judge erred in discounting the absence of
an oath as an indicator of reliability. In view of Dao&#146;s
professed failure to recall the events of the shooting at trial,
there was no meaningful opportunity to cross-examine him on the
truth of his out of court statement. This failing is particularly
serious given the absence of other indicia of reliability. The
trial judge based his ruling on a number of factors that have no
bearing on the question of threshold reliability. He erred by
relying on the fact that other evidence in the trial confirmed
parts of the statement.  Neither the urgency of the need to take
Dao&#146;s statement, nor the good faith of the police officers
involved are relevant to the decision on the statement&#146;s
reliability.
[93] I conclude, therefore, that the trial judge erred in
admitting Dao&#146;s videotaped statement for the truth of its
contents.</pre>
    <pre><b>III. Did  the  trial  judge  err by allowing  the  videotape  and
     transcript of Dao&#146;s statement to go to the jury room?</b></pre>
    <pre>[94] In view of my conclusion that Dao&#146;s videotaped statement
should not have been admitted into evidence, it is unnecessary to
consider this ground of appeal as it is apparent from the
conclusion I have reached on admissibility that none of this
material should have been left with the jury.</pre>
    <pre><b>IV.  Did  the trial judge err by refusing to admit the videotaped
     statement of Tien for the truth of its contents?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     (a) Facts</b></pre>
    <pre>[95] On October 1, 1995 in Vancouver, almost two years after the
shooting took place, and after Tien had spoken with other
witnesses to the shooting, Tien gave a videotaped statement to
the police. The statement was made under oath, and Tien was
warned of the consequences of not telling the truth, including
prosecution under the Criminal Code. During the interview,
Constable Poranganal asked Tien questions that Constable Thai
translated into Vietnamese.  Constable Thai also translated
Tien&#146;s answers into English.  Because Constable Thai was forced
to translate quickly, the Crown had another version prepared by a
translator, Ms. Wan Ngo, for use at the trial.
[96] The crucial issue related to Tien&#146;s description of the
interaction between the appellant Lam and the deceased Thai.
There appears to be no doubt that during his videotaped
statement, Tien used the Vietnamese words &#147;giang co&#148;. That is
where the certainty ends.  On the videotape, Constable Thai
translated these words as &#147;and there was an argument broke out&#148;.
Ngo translated these words as &#147;then there was a shoving match
about something&#148;.
[97] At trial, Tien, testifying through a Vietnamese interpreter,
denied that there was a shoving, tugging or pulling match. The
description of the interaction between Thai, Chau and Lam was of
particular significance to Lam&#146;s defence.  Lam asserted that Thai
was the one who brought the Para-ordinance gun to the massage
parlour and that there had been a struggle between these men over
the weapon. Tien&#146;s videotaped statement supported Lam&#146;s version,
while Tien&#146;s trial evidence did not.
[98] When Lam&#146;s trial counsel indicated that he might bring a
K.G.B. application to admit parts of Tien&#146;s prior statement for
the truth of its contents, the trial judge indicated his concerns
with the quality of the translation of the prior statement. The
trial judge suggested that Lam&#146;s counsel bring in a &#147;university
professor&#148; to provide a better translation of the contentious
material.  Accordingly, the Crown retained Dr. Tung Ngo Pham to
review the translation.
[99] A voir dire was held to determine whether the videotaped
statement should be admitted for the truth of its contents.  In
Dr. Pham&#146;s opinion, Ms. Ngo&#146;s translation was 90 per cent
accurate. However, Dr. Pham believed that the phrase &#147;giang co&#148;
was more correctly translated as &#147;tugging match&#148;. In response to
a question from the trial judge, Dr. Pham testified that &#147;I think
it mean[s] one man is trying to grab at something, and the other
man try to hold on to this.&#148;  Dr. Pham rejected the suggestion of
Crown counsel that it could mean an argument because the word
clearly meant a physical struggle over something, not a verbal
interaction. All counsel agreed that they could live with Dr.
Pham&#146;s interpretation for the purposes of the voir dire.  Dr.
Pham was the only witness called on the voir dire.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (b) Trial Judge&#146;s Ruling</b></pre>
    <pre>[100]     The trial judge denied the application to have the
videotape introduced for the truth of its contents.  The trial
judge concluded that the statement was not necessary because Tien
could be cross-examined on the very words he used on the tape.
He also found that the tape was not reliable since the statement
was given two years after the incident and after Tien had spoken
with Pham.</pre>
    <pre>     <b>(c) Evidence led after the ruling and the trial judge&#146;s
         instruction to the jury
</b>     
[101]     After the trial judge dismissed the application, the
defence was allowed to reopen its cross-examination of Tien.  The
videotape was played back and Tien was asked if he had said &#147;then
there was a tugging match.&#148;  Tien reiterated, &#147;My meaning is
different from what you are saying.&#148;  However, Tien did accept
the fact that he said giang co in his prior statement. He also
admitted that it was possible that giang co could mean tugging
match or argument.
[102]     Dr. Pham was called to give evidence in the presence of
the jury. He rejected Constable Thai&#146;s translation entirely.  Dr.
Pham stated that Ngo&#146;s translation was closer, but that &#147;shoving
match&#148; should have been translated as &#147;a pulling match involving
a struggle&#148;: &#147;You have something and you want to keep it and I
try to grab it from you. You would say giang co.&#148;  Dr. Pham also
testified that the words were very common &#147;like bread or rice.&#148;
Dr. Pham also concluded the words were being used as a transitive
verb, referring to a non-verbal confrontation of some sort.
However, on cross-examination, Dr. Pham admitted that the words
giang co could have different meanings depending on the context
and the intent of the speaker, and that a possible meaning was
that something was &#147;unsettled&#148;.
[103]     Midway through counsel for Lam&#146;s address to the jury,
after reference had been made to Tien&#146;s evidence, the trial judge
instructed the jury that Tien&#146;s out of court statement could not
be used for the truth of its contents.
[104]     In his charge, the trial judge stated that the jury was
free to believe all the evidence given by a witness, part of that
evidence, or none of it.  He also informed the jury that where a
witness adopted an out of court statement, that adoption
constituted evidence for all purposes:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Finally, I again mention that where the witness at 
this trial adopted the prior statement, that adoption 
constitutes proper evidence at this trial on the issue 
of the guilt or innocence of the accused, as well as 
on the issue of the witness&#146; credibility.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[105]     However, this general instruction was severely limited
by the trial judge with respect to the evidence of Dr. Pham. The
trial judge stated that Dr. Pham&#146;s evidence only related to a
possible inconsistency between Tien&#146;s videotaped statement and
his trial testimony. The trial judge then instructed the jury
that although at trial Tien admitted using giang co, he did not
testify at trial that there was a pulling match. Thus, &#147;his
hearsay statement&#148; could not be used to prove that there was a
pulling match:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr. Pham was called only to assist you in 
	  determining the correct English translation of 
	  what Vu Tien said on his videotape statement.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Please  keep in mind that what Tien said
          in  his videotape statement is not admissible
          to prove the truth of what he said, unless he
          adopted the particular matter as true at this
          trial.  He  gave  that statement  in  October
          1995, well after the events.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The evidence of Dr. Pham only related to
          a  possible finding of inconsistency  on  the
          part of Tien from his testimony at trial  and
          from  his  videotape statement. That  relates
          only to the question of Tien&#146;s credibility as
          a witness here at trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The    first    potential  inconsistency
          relates  to  whether an argument  broke  out,
          whether it was a shoving match, or whether it
          was  a  pulling  match for  some  unspecified
          thing.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Dr.  Pham  testified  that  the  literal
          meaning  of the word Tien used related  to  a
          pulling  match,  even though figuratively  it
          could refer to an argument. The witness  Tien
          admitted he used the word and meant by it  an
          argument was taking place.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Again I  remind you that since Tien  did
          not testify at trial that there was a pulling
          match  over  a concrete object,  his  hearsay
          statement cannot be used to prove that  there
          was    a   pulling   match   over   anything,
          particularly not a gun.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (d) Analysis</b></pre>
    <pre>[106]     The principles governing the admissibility of prior
inconsistent statements for the truth of their contents have
already been discussed with respect to Dao&#146;s videotaped
statement.
[107]     I disagree with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that
Tien&#146;s videotaped statement did not meet the test for
reliability.  Tien&#146;s statement was made under oath and he was
clearly warned of the consequences of lying. He was available for
cross-examination at trial and the truth of what he said in his
videotaped statement could be thoroughly and effectively tested.
In my view, the possibility of Tien&#146;s statement being tainted
because of contact with Pham went to its weight not to its
threshold reliability.  Similarly, the mere fact that many months
had elapsed between the event and the statement should not
prevent the admissibility of the prior statement any more than it
would preclude trial testimony.
[108]     However, I agree with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that
the videotaped statement did not meet the necessity requirement,
although I arrive at that conclusion for somewhat different
reasons.  In B (K.G.), supra, at p. 296, Lamer C.J.C. discussed
the necessity test in the context of prior inconsistent
statements.  Lamer C.J.C. noted that in the case of prior
inconsistent statements, the court could not expect the viva voce
evidence to be of the same value as the prior statement. This was
because the witness held the prior statement &#147;hostage&#148; by
refusing to adopt the statement on the stand:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In the case of prior inconsistent statements, it is 
patent that we cannot expect to get evidence of the 
same value from the recanting witness or other 
sources: as counsel for the appellant claimed, the 
recanting witness holds the prior statement, and
thus the relevant evidence, &#147;hostage&#148;. The different 
&#147;value&#148; of the evidence is found in the fact that 
something has radically changed between the time 
when the statement was made and the trial and, 
assuming that there is a sufficient degree of
reliability established under the first criterion, 
the trier of fact should be allowed to weigh both 
statements in light of the witness&#146; explanation 
of the change.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[109]     In my view, a distinction must be drawn between the
Vietnamese words used by Tien on the videotape and the
translations provided by Constable Thai, Ms. Ngo, and Dr. Pham.
The only thing Tien could &#147;hold hostage&#148; was whether he did or
did not use the words giang co.  Tien did not deny using those
words and he therefore did not retract his statement.  The issue
was what those words mean in English.
[110]     As there was no retraction, the necessity test was not
met and the trial judge did not err in refusing to admit Tien&#146;s
videotaped statement for the truth of its contents.
[111]     However, the conclusion that the necessity test was not
met leads to a further problem, namely, the trial judge&#146;s
explicit direction to the jury, both during counsel for Lam&#146;s
closing address and in the trial judge&#146;s final instructions, that
the jury could not find, on the basis of Tien&#146;s evidence, that
there was a tugging or shoving match.  In my view, there was
admissible evidence from which the jury could conclude that there
was a tugging or shoving match.  In his evidence at trial, Tien
admitted that in his prior statement, he said &#147;giang co&#148;. There
was the evidence of two interpreters that this meant tugging or
shoving match.  It was certainly open to the jury to conclude on
the evidence that Tien had adopted his prior statement, and that,
on the evidence of the interpreters, the words he used meant that
there was a tugging or shoving match.  In the final analysis, the
trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the necessity test was not met was
inconsistent with his instruction to the jury that there was no
evidence of a tugging or shoving match. It follows that the trial
judge erred by instructing the jury that they could not use
Tien&#146;s &#147;hearsay statement&#148; to prove there was a tugging match. As
Tien adopted the words giang co at trial, those words were no
longer a hearsay statement and are admissible for all purposes.
The meaning of those words was a matter for the jury to decide
based on the various interpretations of those words by Tien,
Constable Thai, Ms. Ngo, and Dr. Pham.  Therefore, there was
evidence before the jury that they could use to conclude that
there was a &#147;tugging match&#148;.
[112]     I conclude, therefore, that the trial judge erred in
instructing the jury that Tien&#146;s statement could not be used to
prove that there was a pulling or shoving match between Lam and
Thai.</pre>
    <pre><b>V.   Did  the trial judge err in his instructions to the jury  on
     the  permissible uses of evidence of the appellants&#146;  after-
     the-fact conduct?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     (a) Facts</b></pre>
    <pre>[113]     At trial, the Crown relied upon evidence of after-the-
fact conduct by both appellants.  With respect to Diu, the
evidence led by the Crown included the following: (a) his flight
from the scene; (b) his concealment of the weapons; (c) the fact
that he did not readily surrender himself to the police; and, (d)
his initial statements to the police that he had not been the
shooter.  With respect to Lam, the evidence led by the Crown
included the following: (a) the flight from the massage parlour;
(b) sending two different people to retrieve his jeep; (c)
ridding himself of the clothes he wore during the shooting; (d)
putting the two guns into a bag for disposal; and (e) hiding from
the police for several weeks until his arrest.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (b) The trial judge&#146;s charge</b></pre>
    <pre>[114]     The trial judge&#146;s initial charge to the jury on the
issue of after-the-fact conduct was relatively brief, and is set
out below in full:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133; The doctrine of consciousness of guilt is 
inappropriately titled and it should instead be 
entitled consciousness or awareness of fault.  In 
this case, the Crown relies on various items of 
evidence in respect of both accused to establish
consciousness of guilt. I start by cautioning you 
that no one item or even the items taken 
collectively, itself or themselves, establish guilt. 
The item only constitutes an item of evidence
which, when weighed together with all the other 
evidence, may establish guilt. Consciousness of 
guilt may occur when an accused acts in a manner 
which is consistent with conduct expected of a
guilty person and inconsistent with conduct expected 
of an innocent person. In other words, the accused 
acts in a manner that indicates he was aware he had 
acted unlawfully, as opposed to being aware that he 
had acted in self-defence or in defence of others or 
under provocation.</pre>
        <pre>Furthermore, you may act on the particular item of 
evidence of after fact circumstantial evidence only 
if you reject as untrue or invalid the accused&#146;s 
explanation for his conduct.   As well, if you act 
on the particular item, it may tend to prove only 
that the accused acted unlawfully and did not have
a valid defence.  It does not prove that the accused 
had any particular state of mind at the time of the 
offence.</pre>
        <pre>The Crown relies on the following items of evidence 
against the accused Lam as being capable of 
constituting consciousness of guilt.  First, Lam&#146;s 
flight from the massage parlour.  Second, Lam 
sending both Emily Ngo and Andy Nguyen at separate
times to retrieve his jeep. Third, Lam ridding 
himself of the clothes he wore during the shootings.  
Fourth, Lam putting the twin .45 caliber guns into 
an opaque plastic bag for disposal, and fifth, Lam 
hiding from the police until his arrest on April 
5th, 1994.</pre>
        <pre>The accused Lam offered various explanations for 
his conduct, most based on stupidity, ignorance and 
fright.  Most of all, he did not want to lose his 
liberty.</pre>
        <pre>The Crown relies on the following items of evidence 
against the accused Diu as being capable of 
constituting consciousness of guilt.  First, Diu&#146;s 
flight from the massage parlour.   Second, Diu&#146;s 
hiding the gun in the ceiling and the stolen keys 
in the couch.  Third, Diu&#146;s not surrendering to the
police at the front door when aware that the police 
were there to arrest him. Fourth, Diu&#146;s false 
statement that he didn&#146;t shoot, and fifth, Diu&#146;s 
further false statement that the other person was 
the shooter, the sole shooter.</pre>
        <pre>The accused Diu offered various explanations for 
his conduct, some based on language problems and 
some based on stupidity.  Furthermore, he denied 
putting the keys in the couch.  Again, I remind you 
that these items do not prove guilt and are only 
capable of strengthening the Crown&#146;s case.  
Obviously you may not act on any particular item 
unless you reject as untrue or invalid the 
accused&#146;s explanation for that  particular conduct.</pre>
        <pre>Finally, I should add that none of the items indicate
planning or intent to kill. At most the items may 
suggest that the particular accused acted unlawfully 
at the massage parlour in shooting the four Vietnamese 
and had no valid defence for  his unlawful conduct.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[115]     In his submissions regarding the charge, counsel for
Diu asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that there was an
alternate explanation for the fact that Diu fled the massage
parlour, namely, that Diu took the first viable opportunity to
retreat.  The trial judge accepted this submission, and also
agreed to re-charge the jury to the effect that Diu was in
possession of illegal narcotics and an unregistered handgun when
he left the massage parlour.  Counsel for Lam sought a &#147;no
probative value&#148; charge with respect to Lam&#146;s after-the-fact
conduct on the grounds that Lam had raised the defence of self-
defence.  The trial judge rejected that submission and refused to
recharge on that issue.
[116]     In the portion of his recharge dealing with the issue
of after-the-fact-conduct, the trial judge instructed the jury as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133; In respect of the accused Diu&#146;s explanation for 
having left the massage parlour, you will recall 
that he had the unlawful possession of heroin and 
crack cocaine and the unlawful possession of the 
unregistered .45 caliber Colt, as well as what he 
had stolen from the lockers.  Obviously those 
offences do not relate in any way to the accused 
Diu having engaged in any unlawful acts during the 
shootings.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[117]     After the re-charge, the trial judge decided to clarify
his instruction on &#147;consciousness of guilt&#148;.  The trial judge
essentially repeated his earlier instruction and added:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Furthermore you may act on the particular item of 
after-the-fact circumstantial evidence only if you 
reject as untrue or invalid the accused&#146;s 
explanation for his conduct.</pre>
        <pre>Finally, the particular item of evidence must relate 
to the charges, including lesser and included 
offences, before the court.  In the end, the 
particular item of evidence must be capable of 
tending to prove that the accused acted after the 
fact in a manner consistent with conduct expected of 
a guilty person knowing that he had acted unlawfully 
and without a valid defence to the charges before the 
court.</pre>

    <pre>[118]     The appellant Diu submits that the trial judge erred in
failing to instruct the jury that as self-defence and provocation
had been raised, the evidence of after-the-fact conduct had
limited probative value in relation to the shooting of Bui and
Pham.  The appellant Diu also takes the position that the trial
judge should have given a &#147;no probative value&#148; instruction in
relation to the death of Thai and, more generally, that the trial
judge erred in failing to explain to the jury that there could be
other explanations for the after-the-fact conduct, including fear
or panic and the commission of other offences.  The appellant Lam
adopts these submissions and argues that as each appellant
admitted to shooting one or more persons, the evidence of after-
the-fact conduct had no probative value.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (c) Analysis</b></pre>
    <pre>[119]     It has long been recognized that in certain
circumstances, the conduct of an accused after a crime has been
committed may provide circumstantial evidence of the accused&#146;s
culpability with respect to that crime: R. v. White (1998), 125
C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 397 (S.C.C.). See also R. v. Peavoy (1997),
117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 at 238 (Ont. C.A.): &#147;Evidence of after-the-
fact conduct is commonly admitted to show that an accused person
has acted in a manner which, based on human experience and logic,
is consistent with the conduct of a guilty person and
inconsistent with the conduct of an innocent person.&#148;
[120]     However, it has also been repeatedly recognized that
evidence of after-the-fact conduct is often highly ambiguous.  As
Martin J.A. stated in R. v. Minhas (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at
222 (Ont. C.A.), &#147;there is ample room for an erroneous inference
as to a consciousness of guilt from the accused&#146;s conduct.&#148;
There is often a serious risk that the jury may fail to consider
alternative explanations for the after-the-fact conduct and
erroneously infer guilt: White, supra, at p. 398; R. v.
Arcangioli (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 299 (S.C.C.); R. v.
Jenkins (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 440 at 471 (Ont. C.A.). It is,
therefore, important for the trial judge to ensure, by careful
jury instructions, that the jury does not misuse the evidence.
Accordingly, there is a well-developed body of jurisprudence to
the effect &#147;that juries be carefully instructed that there may be
alternative explanations for the accused&#146;s conduct and that, in
such cases, the accused&#146;s conduct is not capable of supporting an
inference of consciousness of guilt.&#148;  See Jenkins, supra, at p.
471.
[121]     In general, the trial judge should instruct the jury
that the evidence of the accused&#146;s after-the-fact conduct has
only an indirect bearing upon the issue of guilt, and that the
jury should exercise caution in inferring guilt because the
conduct might be explained in an alternative manner: Arcangioli,
supra, at pp. 299-300, citing Gudmondson v. The King (1933), 60
C.C.C. 332 (S.C.C.). The trial judge should also instruct the
jury that the evidence of the accused&#146;s after-the-fact conduct
can only be used to support an inference of guilt where they have
rejected any innocent explanation for the conduct: Peavoy, supra,
at p. 238.
[122]     In some cases, the trial judge should provide specific
instructions on the use of evidence of after-the-fact conduct.
The specific instruction will depend on the facts of each case
and the position advanced by the accused during the trial. There
is no clear rule to determine the circumstances in which evidence
of after-the-fact conduct may be used to support an inference of
guilt.  It is, in the end, a question of relating the evidence of
after-the-fact conduct to the issues raised and determining the
extent to which, if at all, it is logically probative of the
issues.
[123]     It has been found in several cases that evidence of
after-the-fact conduct may be relevant to the issue of guilt in
cases where self-defence is raised. In White, supra, the accused
admitted the act but asserted he had acted in self-defence. Major
J., writing for a unanimous court, stated at p. 403, that post
offence conduct could be used to support an inference of guilt
where the accused has &#147;admitted to committing a physical act but
asserts that the act was justified in some way; in those
circumstances &#133; the jury could infer that the accused was
conscious that he or she had committed a culpable act and had
not, for example, acted in self-defence.&#148; In Peavoy, supra,
Weiler J.A. faced a similar situation where the accused had
admitted killing the victim, but relied on self-defence. Weiler
J.A. concluded at p. 241 that &#147;the after-the-fact conduct was
some evidence from which, along with other evidence, the jury
could infer that the appellant was aware he had committed a
culpable act and had not acted in self-defence.&#148;  However, as
already stated, there are no categoric rules in this area, and in
other cases where self-defence is raised, it may well be that
that after-the-fact conduct has no probative value with respect
to the issue of culpability: see Jenkins, supra.
[124]     After-the-fact conduct is problematic where more than
one offence has been committed or where the issue is the level of
culpability. The leading case is Arcangioli, supra, where the
accused admitted committing a common assault but denied that he
had committed aggravated assault.  The Supreme Court of Canada
held that in such a case, evidence of after-the-fact conduct had
no probative value.  The Court held, (at pp. 300-301) that where
the accused has admitted committing the actus reus of a criminal
act but denied a specific level of culpability for that act, or
has denied committing some related offence arising from the same
operative set of facts, it will be appropriate for the trial
judge to instruct the jury that the evidence has no probative
value with respect to any particular offence.
[125]     The sufficiency of the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury
with respect to the appellants&#146; after-the-fact conduct must,
then, be assessed on the basis of the issues raised by the
evidence and the defences advanced by the appellants.
[126]     With respect to the charges of first degree murder,
evidence of after-the-fact conduct was equally consistent with
the accused committing manslaughter or second degree murder as it
is with first degree murder.  Accordingly, the evidence of after-
the-fact conduct could not be used as proof of intent to commit
murder.  The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that the
after-the-fact conduct did not support a finding of planning or
intent to kill.
[127]     Lam and Diu both admitted to having committed the actus
reus of various offences.  Specifically, Lam admitted to shooting
Thai once and Chau twice, and to shooting in the direction of
Pham; Diu admitted to shooting both Bui and Pham.  However,
neither Lam nor Diu admitted culpability with respect to their
admitted acts.  Both relied upon the defence of self-defence.  In
my view, on the authority of White and Peavoy, supra, it was open
to the trial judge to conclude on these facts that the evidence
of after-the-fact conduct could be left with the jury on the
basis that it was relevant to the issue of whether Lam and Diu
had truly acted in self-defence, or whether Lam and Diu had
committed culpable homicides.  The jury was entitled to consider
whether Lam&#146;s after-the-fact conduct was consistent with the
conduct of a person who believed he had acted in self-defence in
shooting two people and firing shots at a third.  Similarly, the
jury was entitled to consider whether Diu&#146;s after-the-fact
conduct was consistent with the conduct of a person who believed
he had acted in self-defence in shooting two people.
Accordingly, the trial judge did not err in instructing the jury
that after-the-fact conduct might indicate the accused&#146;s
awareness that he had acted &#147;unlawfully and without valid
defence&#148;.
[128]     However, as indicated by the Supreme Court of Canada in
White, supra, at p. 404, even where after-the-fact conduct is
relevant, the trial judge should still provide the jury with an
instruction regarding the proper use of that evidence.  In my
view, the more difficult issue in the circumstances of the
present case is the extent to which a specific instruction was
required in light of the multiple charges faced by the
appellants.  The appellants were charged with five separate
offences: two murders and three attempted murders.  The case was
far from an &#147;all-or-nothing&#148; situation in which the jury was
bound to conclude that either or both of the appellants were
simply guilty or not guilty of all the offences charged. There
were live issues as to which appellant had shot which victim and
whether, in relation to each victim, the act of shooting was
justified.  The evidence of the appellants&#146; after-the-fact
conduct provided no basis for distinguishing between the five
offences.
[129]     While I do not agree that the circumstances called for
a &#147;no probative value&#148; instruction in relation to after-the fact
conduct, it is still necessary to consider whether the trial
judge erred in failing to give a limiting instruction. In my
view, given the complexity of the issues with which the jury was
presented, something by way of a limiting instruction was
required.  Each accused was charged with five counts, and each
accused admitted to having committed the physical act of some,
but not all, of the counts.  While after-the-fact conduct might
provide a basis for inferring guilt for one of the offences
charged, it does not follow that it provided a logical basis for
inferring guilt for all of the offences charged.
[130]     Although the facts of the present case are not
identical to those on Arcangioli, supra, at pp. 300-01, the
applicable underlying principle is the same.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>[E]vidence [of after-the-fact-conduct] can serve 
the function of indicating consciousness of guilt 
only if it relates to a particular offence. 
Consequently, where an accused&#146;s conduct may be 
equally explained by reference to consciousness of 
guilt of two or more offences, and where an 
accused has admitted culpability in respect of one 
of more of those offences, a trial judge should 
instruct a jury that such evidence has no probative
value with respect to any particular offence.  
[Emphasis added].</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>The same point was made by this Court in R. v. Wiltse (1994), 19
O.R. (3d) 379 at 384-5 where Doherty J.A. stated:          </pre>
    <pre>               [The  appellant&#146;s]  conduct   after  the 
	  homicide might also  have  been  explained by 
	  reference  to  his  participation in unlawful
          conduct   other  than  the  killing  of   the 
	  deceased. His acts may have rendered [him] an 
	  accessory after the fact to the murder,  even 
	  if he was not a party to the murder.          </pre>
    <pre>                In  my view, the jury should have  been
          instructed as to the limited use of  evidence
          of consciousness of guilt in determining [the
          appellant&#146;s]  culpability  in  the  homicide.
          The  jury also should have been told that the
          evidence  had no probative value  unless  the
          jury was satisfied that the consciousness  of
          guilt  reflected  by  those  acts  was   with
          respect  to  the killing of the deceased  and
          not  some  other conduct of [the  appellant].
          [Citations omitted.]</pre>
    <pre>[131]     Of particular concern is the relevance of after-the-
fact conduct to Diu&#146;s culpability for the murder of Thai.  Diu
denied shooting Thai.  If the charge of murdering Thai stood in
isolation, Diu&#146;s after-the-fact conduct could be used to
determine Diu&#146;s culpability for the murder of Thai.  However, Diu
admitted to shooting Bui and Pham.  In light of that admission,
Diu&#146;s after-the-fact conduct might well be explained by his
culpability for the attempted murder of either Bui or Pham.  The
jury should have been given a limiting instruction that caution
was required in relation to what could be inferred from the after-
the-fact conduct. In my view, the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that Diu&#146;s after-the-fact conduct was of
limited probative value in determining his culpability for the
murder of Thai, particularly if the jury concluded (as it did)
that Diu had not shot Bui and Pham in self-defence.  A similar
limiting instruction should have been given with respect to the
use of Lam&#146;s after-the-fact conduct.
[132]     I conclude, therefore, that the trial judge erred in
the manner he dealt with evidence of after-the-fact-conduct in
his instruction to the jury.</pre>
    <pre><b>VI.  Did  the  trial judge err in refusing to order severance  in
     view of the evidence led by Lam as to Diu&#146;s bad character?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     Did  the  trial judge err in his charge to the jury  on  the
     permissible use of evidence of Diu&#146;s bad character?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     Did the trial judge err by giving a limiting instruction  to
     the jury respecting the discreditable conduct of Diu?</b></pre>
    <pre>[133]     As these three issues are closely related, they can
conveniently be dealt with together.</pre>
    <pre>     <b>(a) Facts</b></pre>
    <pre>[134]     In cross-examining Diu, Lam&#146;s counsel led several
pieces of evidence of bad character and disposition to commit
weapons offences that would not have been admissible if led by
the Crown: see R. v. Laurier (1983), 1 O.A.C. 128 (C.A.) and R.
v. Corbett, (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.).  This evidence
included:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>the facts underlying a 1988 conviction for use of an
unregistered restricted weapon, which included details 
of the use of a .22 pistol.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>at the time of his arrest a .38 caliber bullet was found
at Diu&#146;s home.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>a grenade was found stuck to the ceiling of Diu&#146;s house.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>at the time he brought the gun to the massage parlour, Diu
was subject to a firearm&#146;s prohibition.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>the facts underlying a 1991 conviction for aggravated
assault, which included the fact that he assaulted someone
with a tire iron.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>the facts underlying a 1991 guilty plea for assault causing
bodily harm, which included the fact that he had attacked 
someone with a metal bar.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Diu&#146;s brother had fired shots from a .45 semi-automatic
weapon around the time he might have been living with Diu
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><b>     (b) Trial Judge&#146;s Mid-Trial Instruction and Charge to the
         Jury</b></pre>
    <pre>[135]     After the cross-examination by Lam&#146;s counsel, the trial
judge gave the jury a mid-trial instruction on the use of bad
character evidence:          </pre>
    <pre>               You  have  heard  evidence  of   criminal 
	  misconduct  on  the  part  of both accused.  I 
	  want   to   instruct  you  of this fundamental
          principle.    Evidence   of   prior   criminal 
	  misconduct   by   an   accused  is   generally 
	  admissible  only  as   to   the credibility or 
	  believability of the witness, the accused as a 
	  witness.          </pre>
    <pre>               Prior criminal misconduct may indicate a
          lack    of    moral    trustworthiness     or
          responsibility on the part of the accused  as
          a  witness  to  tell  the truth.  I&#146;ll repeat 
	  that....          </pre>
    <pre>               However,  this case must not be  decided
          on the basis of what the accused have done in
          the  past.   Thus, prior criminal  misconduct
          must  not be used, not, I stress, to be  used
          to  infer  that either accused has a  general
          propensity  or  tendency to commit  crime  in
          general.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[136]     In his final instructions to the jury, the trial judge
had the following to say on the use of bad character evidence:          </pre>
    <pre>               Turning  to  the  criminal records of the 
	  accused.  Both  have  a  criminal  record.  In 
	  addition,  the accused themselves led evidence
          that  they  were  involved  in  other criminal 
	  conduct  relating  to  possession of drugs and 
	  relating to either or both  having  possession 
	  of  that .45 Colt firearm, and also theft from 
	  lockers.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  fact  that  an  accused  has  been
          convicted  or  admitted to  a  crime  may  be
          considered by you for only one purpose,  that
          is  to  judge the credibility or truthfulness
          of  the  accused as a witness.  The  fact  of
          such   a   conviction  does  not  necessarily
          destroy or impair his or her credibility, but
          it  may indicate, as I&#146;ve said before, a lack
          of  moral  responsibility to tell the  truth.
          It  is  simply one of the circumstances  that
          you  may  take into consideration in weighing
          his trustworthiness as a witness.          </pre>
    <pre>               Obviously you should consider the nature
          and  date  of  the  conviction.   Convictions
          relating  to  dishonesty tend  to  bear  more
          directly upon the accused&#146;s credibility  than
          do   crimes   not  relating  to   dishonesty.
          Similarly,  older convictions may  have  less
          bearing  upon  the accused&#146;s  testimony  than
          more recent convictions.          </pre>
    <pre>               Finally I must warn you, you may not use
          the  prior convictions or admitted crimes  as
          evidence that the accused committed the crime
          with  which he is now charged.  You must  not
          conclude  that  because an accused  has  been
          convicted  or  has committed or has  admitted
          committing  other  crimes  that  he   has   a
          propensity  to  commit  further  crimes,  and
          specifically not the crimes with which he  is
          charged at this time. The law does not permit
          you  to  draw that inference.  You  can  only
          consider  the prior convictions  or  admitted
          offences,  as  I have said, in  deciding  the
          credibility  of  the  accused  and  you  will
          decide  what weight, if any, should be  given
          to the prior criminal record and the admitted
          offences of the accused on the charges before
          the court.  [Emphasis added.]     </pre>
    <pre><b>     (c) Analysis</b></pre>
    <pre>[137]     So-called &#147;cut-throat&#148; defences, where co-accused
attack each other, create a difficult situation.  The court has
to balance the fair trial right of the accused who has been
attacked with the right of the co-accused to make a full answer
and defence.  It has been held that even where the Crown could
not adduce evidence of an accused&#146;s bad character, a co-accused
may do so where it would be relevant to the defence of that co-
accused: R. v. Kendall &amp; McKay (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 105 (C.A.).
The issue has been dealt with in three recent judgments of this
Court: R. v. Suzack, [2000] O.J. No. 100 (C.A.); R. v. Valentini
(1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Farrell [2000]
O.J. No. 1376 (C.A.), all handed down after the trial in the case
at bar.  Prejudice to the co-accused against whom the evidence is
led, is to be dealt with by a careful instruction to the jury on
the use that may be made of the evidence by the accused who led
it and by the Crown.  The trial judge gave the usual criminal
record instruction.  The appellants submit that this was
inadequate.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (i) Severance</b></pre>
    <pre>[138]     Suzack, supra, holds that severance is not the
appropriate way to deal with this issue.  While counsel for Diu
did not abandon the point, he conceded that for the purposes of
severance, he could not distinguish Suzack.  Accordingly, I would
dismiss that ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (ii) Appropriate jury instruction</b></pre>
    <pre>[139]     Suzack and Valentini, supra, establish that where bad
character evidence is adduced by one accused to show propensity
(i.e. that the co-accused is the type of person more likely to
have committed the crime), the trial judge must include a special
instruction in the charge to the jury.  This instruction should
contain both a positive and negative aspect, which are equally
important, telling the jury the use the jury may make of the
evidence of propensity and the use the jury may not make of such
evidence. The positive aspect is that evidence of bad character
can be used by the accused leading the evidence (Lam) to raise a
reasonable doubt as to that accused&#146;s guilt on the basis that the
bad character of the other accused (Diu) suggests a propensity of
that accused to commit the offence.  The negative aspect is that
bad character evidence cannot be used by the jury when
considering whether the Crown has proved its case against the
other accused (Diu). In other words, it was incumbent on the
trial judge to instruct the jury that it might consider evidence
of  Diu&#146;s disposition in deciding whether it had a reasonable
doubt that Lam committed the crime, but that the jury must not
use evidence of the Diu&#146;s disposition to find Diu guilty. Counsel
asked the trial judge to instruct the jury in these terms, but
the trial judge, who did not have the benefit of the judgments in
Suzack and Valentini, refused to do so.  In my view, in the light
of Suzack and Valentini, the trial judge erred.
[140]     The first error is the failure to give the positive
portion of the instruction. Nowhere in the charge is there any
mention of the use that Lam can make of the evidence.  This
omission clearly prejudiced Lam who was entitled to have the jury
consider the evidence of Diu&#146;s propensity when deciding whether
the Crown had proved its case against Lam beyond a reasonable
doubt. The respondent concedes this error, but submits that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice resulted and that the
proviso ought to be applied, a point which I will consider in due
course.
[141]     It is also submitted by the respondent that no
prejudice resulted to Diu.  The respondent contends that the
instruction was unduly favourable to Diu as the jury was told
that it could not take the evidence of propensity into account at
all in determining guilt.  I do not accept this submission.  The
failure to provide the jury with guidance as to the appropriate
use of the evidence left the jury in a vacuum. The evidence had
been admitted and the jury should have been clearly told what use
it could make of it.  The positive part of the instruction was
relevant to the situation of Diu as it would help to ensure that
the jury would not use the evidence in an impermissible way:  see
Valentini, supra.
[142]     The second error is that the trial judge failed to give
the correct negative instruction.  He stated that the jury could
use the bad character evidence &#147;in deciding the credibility of
the accused&#148;. The respondent contends that once the bad character
evidence was admitted, the jury was entitled to use it in
assessing credibility.  In my view, this proposition cannot be
accepted.  The trial judge should have made it clear that this
bad character evidence could not have been used to further the
Crown&#146;s case at all, even on the issue of credibility. This error
squarely affected the fair trial right of Diu.
[143]     The point is implicit from Suzack, supra.  Doherty J.A.
stated, at para. 97, that the trial judge is required to instruct
the jury in such a way as to permit the use of the propensity
evidence by the defence while at the same time preventing the
misuse of the evidence as part of the case for the Crown.
Doherty J.A. adopted the model charge of the Ontario Specimen
Jury Instruction Project which states the following (at para.
127):</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It is up to you to determine whether the 
disposition evidence, alone, or together with 
other evidence, raises a reasonable doubt that 
(NOA1) committed the offence charged.  However 
you must not use the disposition evidence in
any way when you consider whether Crown counsel 
has proven the case against (NOA2).  No one can 
be convicted of a crime just for being the sort 
of person who might have committed it. [Emphasis
added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[144]     In my view, limiting the use of bad character evidence
in the circumstances presented here is consistent with basic
principles of evidence law.  As the appellant Diu submits, &#147;use
follows admissibility&#148;.  If Diu alone was on trial, the Crown
could not adduce the underlying facts of a conviction or other
evidence of bad character: see R. v. Laurier, supra.  The same
principle should apply where Diu faces trial with a co-accused.
Since only Lam could have this evidence admitted, only Lam could
use this evidence to further his case.  Since the Crown could not
ask to have the evidence admitted, the Crown cannot use this
evidence, even though it may be admitted and used by Lam.
[145]     Similarly on the trial of a single accused, the Crown
may only adduce bad character evidence to refute a good character
allegation made by an accused, see R. v. McNamara (No. 1) (1981),
56 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Ont. C.A.). The same rule should apply in a
trial with joint accused. Where Diu has not put his character in
issue vis--vis the Crown, the Crown should not have the benefit
of the evidence adduced by Lam.  To hold otherwise, would be to
afford the Crown an unfair advantage by proceeding with a joint
trial.
[146]     The trial judge should still give the classic
instruction on the use of an accused&#146;s criminal record.  However,
this must be followed by the &#147;positive&#148; and &#147;negative&#148;
instruction on the use of bad character evidence that makes it
clear what can be used by the co-accused and what can be used by
the Crown.  Since this was not done, Diu&#146;s right to a fair trial
was prejudiced as was Lam&#146;s right to make full answer and
defence.
[147]     I conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge erred in
the manner in which he instructed the jury with respect to the
permissible and impermissible uses of the evidence of Diu&#146;s bad
character.</pre>
    <pre><b>VII.  Did  the trial judge err in his charge to the jury  on  the
      issue of self-defence?</b></pre>
    <pre>[148]     The trial judge instructed the jury to consider the
application of the self-defence provisions under s.34(2) of the
Criminal Code.  This subsection provides a defence where the
accused was unlawfully assaulted and caused death in repelling
the assault, if the accused was under a reasonable apprehension
of death or grievous bodily harm from the original assault and he
believed, on reasonable grounds, that he could not otherwise
preserve himself from such harm.
[149]     Diu argues that the trial judge made two errors in this
self-defence instruction.  First, he should have emphasized that
s.34(2) is available even where the accused is the initial
aggressor.  Failing that, he should have also put the self-
defence provisions of s.35 to the jury.  Second, Diu submits that
the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that an
accused&#146;s belief in imminent danger may be mistaken but
reasonable.
[150]     Section 35 specifically provides for self-defence where
the accused is the initial aggressor.  It states:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>35.  Every one who has without justification 
assaulted another but did not commence the assault 
with intent to cause death or grievous bodily harm, 
or has without justification provoked an assault on 
himself by another, may justify the use of force 
subsequent to the assault if</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>          (a)  he uses the force            </pre>
    <pre>            (i)  under reasonable apprehension of death or
            grievous bodily harm from the violence of the
            person whom he has assaulted or provoked, and            </pre>
    <pre>            (ii)   in the belief, on reasonable grounds, 
	    that it is necessary in order to preserve himself 
	    from death or grievous bodily harm;          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  he did not, at any time before the necessity of
          preserving himself from death or grievous bodily harm
          arose, endeavour to cause death or grievous bodily
          harm; and          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  he declined further conflict and quitted or
          retreated from it as far as it was feasible to do so
          before the necessity of preserving himself from death
          or grievous bodily harm arose.</pre>
    <pre>[151]     It has been established that s.34(2) also applies where
the accused was the initial aggressor, even where the accused
does not meet the requirements of s.35: R. v. MacIntosh  (1995),
95 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.). Diu submits that it is possible that
the jury would have found that he was the initial aggressor as a
result of flashing his gun in the locker room, but that in so
doing, he did not intend to cause death or grievous bodily harm
within the meaning of s.35(b), that Bui&#146;s use of the .32 was in
response and caused Diu to apprehend death or grievous bodily
harm (s.35(a)(i)), and that Diu shot Bui to prevent this
(s.35(a)(ii)).
[152]     In R. v. Jenkins and Jenkins (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d)
440 (Ont. C.A.) at 452, leave to appeal dismissed, [1996]
S.C.C.A. No. 583 (Q.L.), Laskin J.A. stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It is an error in law to expressly tell the jury 
that an accused who provokes an assault cannot 
rely on s.34(2).  Whether it is an error in law 
not to tell the jury that even an accused who does 
provoke an assault can rely on s.34(2) depends on 
the rest of the instructions on self-defence.  If 
the instructions as a whole reasonably could have 
misled the jury into believing that an accused who 
provokes an assault is deprived of the defence of
self-defence under s.34(2), then the non-direction 
on provocation is an error of law.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>(See also R. v. Nelson (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 461 (Ont.
C.A.); R. v. Elkins (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.)).</pre>
    <pre>[153]     In my view, there is nothing in the trial judge&#146;s
explanation of self-defence that  would lead the jury to believe
that s.34(2) was not available to Diu even if he was an initial
aggressor.  I conclude, accordingly, that there was no reversible
error with respect to s.34(2).  To paraphrase the words of
Doherty J.A. in Elkins, supra, at pp. 169-70, given the evidence
presented in this case and the instructions of the trial judge, I
do not accept that a reasonably intelligent lay person,
unschooled in the remarkable subtleties and ambiguities of the
law of self-defence, would conclude that the defence of s.34(2)
was not available to Diu because he showed his gun to Pham in the
locker room.
[154]      In any event, the application of s.35 to Diu was
problematic, and to put that section and all of its requirements
to the jury might well have led to confusion and even prejudice
to Diu.  In refusing to put s.35 to the jury, the trial judge
expressed the view that Diu was better off with s.34 alone. In
the circumstances of this case, the trial judge was entitled to
take the &#147;functional approach&#148; and restrict the charge to
s.34(2): R. v. Pintar (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.).
[155]     For s.35 to apply, the jury would have to consider a
number of points not required for the s.34(2) defence: that Diu
did not commence the assault with intent to cause death or
grievous bodily harm; that Diu did not endeavour to cause death
or grievous bodily harm before the necessity of preserving his
own life arose; and the issue of &#147;retreat&#148; under s.35(c).  There
would be the added issue of applying s.35 in view of the fact
that Diu pulled his gun on Pham and the subsequent acts involved
Diu and Bui.  The s.34(2) instruction left the defence open even
if the jury found that Diu had pulled his gun in the locker room
and without the need to consider all these additional factors.
To have charged on s.35 would only have complicated the matter
with no perceivable benefit to Diu.
[156]     In his charge, the trial judge failed to deal with the
issue of mistaken belief. However, when that omission was brought
to his attention he dealt with the issue in his re-charge.
[157]     In my view, this instruction was sufficient, especially
in light of the fact that Diu&#146;s position at trial was that he did
not have a mistaken belief.  On Diu&#146;s evidence, Bui fired at him
and there was no room for mistake.
[158]     I conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge did not
err with respect to his instructions to the jury on the defence
of self-defence.</pre>
    <pre><b>VIII.  Did  the trial judge err by telling the jury that  Lam
       &#147;asked&#148; to have the defence of provocation put to the jury?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     (a) Facts</b></pre>
    <pre>[159]     During the trial, the appellant Lam relied upon self-
defence and made no reference to provocation.  Lam did not
testify that he was provoked, nor did his counsel allude to
provocation in his address.
[160]     Prior to the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury, counsel
for both of the appellants made submissions in which they
addressed the defence of provocation.  Both counsel specifically
requested that the defence of provocation be put to the jury as
it was available on the evidence.
[161]     The trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury with respect to
the defences available to Diu and Lam was as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In this case we have the defence of self-defence 
raised by Mr. Diu in relation to Mr. Bui and 
shooting Lai Pham; and we have the defence of 
self-defence raised by the accused Mr. Lam in
relation to the deaths of Chau Nguyen and Thai 
Nguyen.</pre>
        <pre>We also have the defence of defence of others, 
although it is expressly denied by Mr. Diu, raised 
in respect of his shooting Chau Nguyen.  You haven&#146;t 
heard this as yet, but [counsel for Lam] asked me to 
put it and I will put it to you, this is the defence 
of provocation which reduces murder to manslaughter.</pre>
        <pre>Those then are the three defences raised in this case.  
Self-defence, defence of others and provocation. 
[Emphasis added.]
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[162]     The trial judge later reviewed the three defences with
the jury in detail.
[163]     Counsel for the appellant Lam objected to the manner in
which the trial judge charged the jury on the defence of
provocation.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>There&#146;s a way of putting it without suggesting it 
is Mr. Lam&#146;s position.  It can be said as follows.  
The accused Lam is to be acquitted of murder if the 
Crown does not prove beyond a reasonable doubt the 
following things, and then mention the concepts of 
provocation without suggesting that Lam is sitting on
the fence on those issues.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[164]     The trial judge failed to address counsel&#146;s concerns in
his recharge to the jury.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (b) Analysis</b></pre>
    <pre>[165]     A trial judge has a duty to leave every defence to the
jury for which the evidence provides an air of reality.  The
issue of how to deal with a defence that arises on the evidence
but that is not raised by the accused was dealt with in Peavoy,
supra.  The accused was charged with second degree murder.  The
accused admitted to having stabbed the deceased, and relied on
the defence of self-defence.  Defence counsel did not want the
defence of provocation left with the jury, believing that it
would undermine the principal defence of self-defence.  Weiler
J.A., writing for the court, addressed the issue at p. 242:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>A trial judge is required to leave every defence to 
the jury for which there is an air of reality on the 
evidence.  In his instructions, it would have been 
highly preferable for the trial judge to explain to 
the jury that provocation was not a position being 
advanced by the defence but one about which he felt 
he was required to charge them.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[166]     Peavoy, supra, was considered by this court in R. v.
Tombran, [2000] O.J. No. 273 (C.A.) at paras. 51-52 where again
it was pointed out that in some circumstances, an accused is
entitled to have a defence put to the jury without having the
defence attributed to a request from the accused.
[167]     It is clear that in the present case, the trial judge
was required to put the defence of provocation to the jury.  It
is not disputed that there was an evidentiary basis to support
the defence. Moreover, counsel for both accused specifically
requested the trial judge to charge the jury on the defence of
provocation. I repeat what was said by this Court in both Peavoy
and Tombran, supra: it would clearly have been preferable for the
trial judge not to have stated that the appellant Lam requested
that the defence of provocation be left with the jury. Where the
trial judge puts a defence that has not been raised by the
accused before the jury, the trial judge should ordinarily
instruct the jury that the defence was not raised by the accused,
but is one that he considers necessary to put to them. An
instruction stating that the defence is being put at the request
of the accused might well have the effect of undermining the
defence advanced at trial by suggesting that the accused was
advancing alternative defences.  I reject the proposition put by
the trial judge to counsel for Lam: &#147;That&#146;s the danger you run.
You wanted me to put it.&#148;  Lam was entitled, as a matter of law
to have the defence put to the jury, and it is wrong to suggest
that somehow, there was a price to be paid for insisting upon
that right.
[168]     I conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge erred by
telling the jury that Lam asked that the defence of provocation
be considered.</pre>
    <pre><b>IX.  Did  the  trial  judge err by informing  the  jury  that  he
     offered Lam the right to reopen his case?</b></pre>
    <pre><b>     (a) Facts</b></pre>
    <pre>[169]     Lam called his defence first and testified on his own
behalf. Lam testified that he did not have a gun at the massage
parlour and did not know that Diu had a gun with him until Diu
brandished it at Pham. Counsel for Diu briefly cross-examined
Lam, but did not ask Lam any questions regarding the ownership of
the Colt .45 handgun.
[170]     Diu testified that Lam owned the Colt .45 and had left
the gun at Diu&#146;s house two or three days before the shooting. Diu
further testified that he and Lam used heroin together on the day
of the shooting and that after the shooting Lam had placed both
the Para-ordinance and the Colt in a plastic bag on Diu&#146;s porch.
These statements were not consistent with Lam&#146;s evidence in chief
and they were not put to Lam by Diu&#146;s counsel in cross-
examination.
[171]     When counsel for Diu advanced this evidence, counsel
for Lam objected on the ground that his client had not been given
an opportunity to meet this attack on cross-examination.  He
asked for a severance. The trial judge agreed that counsel for
Diu should have cross-examined Lam on these points on the basis
of the rule in Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 L.R. 67 (H.L.).  However
he refused severance and held that the appropriate remedy was to
allow Lam to reopen his case to reply to the new matters raised
by Diu. The trial judge ruled that any further cross-examination
of Lam would be limited to the new matters testified to by Lam.
[172]     At the conclusion of Diu&#146;s defence, the trial judge
asked Lam&#146;s counsel in the absence of the jury if he had
&#147;anything to say about me asking you in front of the jury whether
or not you want to call evidence in response to the new matters.&#148;
Lams counsel stated that he would not call further evidence, but
he asked the trial judge not to raise the issue in front of the
jury, relying on  the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, C-5,
s.4(6):</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The failure of the person charged, or of the 
wife or husband of that person, to testify shall 
not be made the subject of comment by the judge 
or by counsel for the prosecution.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[173]     The trial judge rejected that submission, recalled the
jury and posed the following question:
          </pre>
    <pre>               THE COURT:    Mr. Silverstein, I want to 
	  ask  you  whether  you  wish  to call further 
	  evidence on behalf of the accused Chinh Lam.
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  particular, Mr. Marko unfortunately
          failed  to cross-examine the accused  Lam  on
          various  matters later testified  to  by  the
          accused  A.  Bau Diu. Among the  matters  not
          cross-examined  upon include the  testimonial
          allegations by Diu that the .45 caliber  Colt
          belonged  to  Lam; that he and  Lam  consumed
          heroin together; and that Lam put the two .45
          caliber  guns into an opaque plastic bag  and
          placed  that  bag  on Diu&#146;s porch  the  night
          following   the  shootings  at  the   massage
          parlour.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Mr.  Silverstein, do you wish  to  call
          evidence  now in response to the  allegations
          made  by the accused Diu against your client,
          Chinh Lam? Obviously you don&#146;t have to.
          </pre>
    <pre>                MR.  SILVERSTEIN:   I have  no  further
          evidence my Lord.</pre>
    <pre>[174]     During the submissions regarding whether he should
offer Lam the opportunity to reopen in the presence of the jury,
the trial judge asked Diu&#146;s counsel whether he would make any
comment regarding Lam&#146;s decision not to take up the offer. Diu&#146;s
counsel advised the trial judge that he would make no comment on
the issue. Nevertheless, prior to closing arguments, Diu&#146;s
counsel asked for and received permission to comment on Lam&#146;s
decision to not call additional evidence. During his closing
arguments, he stated that Lam&#146;s counsel had declined the
invitation to call further evidence.
[175]     In his charge to the jury, the trial judge commented on
the failure of Diu&#146;s counsel to cross examine Lam on the
contentious points.  He then reminded the jury that Lam&#146;s counsel
had been given the opportunity to call further evidence.  He
continues as follows:          </pre>
    <pre>               The question remains as to what effect the 
	  failure  of  [counsel  for Diu]  to have cross-
	  examined on the matters has  on  the  testimony 
	  of Lam and Diu.  I  would  think that it should 
	  have little effect on their testimony. To start 
	  with, you need not  accept Diu&#146;s evidence about 
	  the allegations if you do not find  them  to be 
	  credible,  even  though  there is  no denial of 
	  them.  In fact, it appears that Lam did deny in 
	  cross-examination by the  Crown  that  the Colt 
	  was his and  did deny  that he ever  smoked  or
          used heroin.
          </pre>
    <pre>                As  for  Lam,  he was not  required  to
          testify   a   second   time   to   deny   the
          allegations, some of which, as  I  have  just
          stated, he denied during cross-examination by
          Crown  counsel. It seems to me that the fault
          was  that of [counsel], and his sins must not
          be  visited on his client, the accused A  Bau
          Diu.</pre>
    <pre><b>     (b) Analysis</b></pre>
    <pre>[176]     It was within the discretion of the trial judge to
permit counsel for Diu to elicit Diu&#146;s testimony despite the
violation of the rule in Browne v. Dunn, supra.  The decision to
remedy the situation by permitting Lam to reopen his case and
call further evidence was also within the discretion of the trial
judge.  In my view, this ruling represented a reasonable attempt
to balance the rights of Lam and Diu in the circumstances.
[177]     The more difficult issue is whether the trial judge
erred by calling the jury&#146;s attention to the fact that Lam had
the right to reopen and chose not to exercise it.  Lam relies on
the Supreme Court of Canada decision in R. v. G. (S.G.) (1997),
116 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 211-212 as authority for the proposition
that requiring an accused to reopen his or her case causes
prejudice.  Lam also submits that the trial judge violated s.4(6)
of the Canada Evidence Act.
[178]     I agree with the submission of the respondent that the
circumstances of G. (S.G.), supra are distinguishable.  There,
the Crown was permitted to call an additional witness after both
the Crown and the defence had closed. The trial judge permitted
the Crown to reopen and permitted the defence to reopen in reply.
The Supreme Court held that, in the circumstances presented, the
Crown should not have been permitted to reopen as the effect was
to give the Crown the unfair advantage of splitting its case.  It
was in that context that the Court held that an accused will
almost invariably be prejudiced when re-opening his or her case
will require the accused to take the stand for a second time and
undergo a second round of cross-examination.  In the case at bar,
it was the co-accused Diu, not the Crown, who caused the
prejudice to Lam and the issue of the Crown splitting its case
does not arise.
[179]     The manner in which the trial judge dealt with the
issue did not violate the provisions of s.4(6) of the Canada
Evidence Act.  While that provision constitutes a &#147;blanket
prohibition against comments&#148; on the failure of the accused to
testify: R. v. Miller (1998), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 141 at 146 (Ont.
C.A.), the Supreme Court of Canada has held that the provision is
to be interpreted purposively not literally: R. v. Potvin,
(1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 312, McConnell and Beer v. The
Queen, [1968] 4 C.C.C. 257. In McConnell and Beer, supra, at p.
263, Ritchie J. held that the purpose of the section was to
prevent an accused from having his right not to testify being
presented in a manner suggesting his silence was a cloak for
guilt:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I think it is to be assumed that the section in 
question was enacted for the protection of the 
accused persons against the danger of having 
their right not to testify presented to the jury
in such fashion as to suggest their silence is 
being used as a cloak for their guilt.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Here, Lam had already chosen to testify.  In deciding not to call
reply evidence, he plainly was not exercising his right to
silence nor could it be said that he was hiding behind that right
&#147;as a cloak for [his] guilt&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[180]     However, that does not conclude the matter.  The trial
judge made it clear to the jury that Diu&#146;s counsel had violated
the rules and pointed out to the jury that Lam had testified on
cross-examination by the Crown regarding the heroin use and the
ownership of the gun.  In my view, the preferable course would
have been to make no further comment to the jury on this matter.
[181]     In a recent judgment of this court, released after the
appeal was argued R.v. McNeill, [2000] O.J. No. 1357 (C.A.),
released after this appeal was argued, Moldaver J.A., at para.
47, considered the appropriate jury instruction where the rule in
Browne v. Dunn had been violated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In cases such as this, where the concern lies in a 
witness&#146;s inability to present his or her side of the 
story, it seems to me that the first option worth 
exploring is whether the witness is available for 
recall.  If so, then assuming the trial judge is
otherwise satisfied, after weighing the pros and cons, 
that recall is appropriate, the aggrieved party can 
either take up the opportunity or decline it.  If the 
opportunity is declined, then, in my view, no special 
instruction to the jury is required beyond the normal 
instruction that the jury is entitled to believe all,
part or none of a witness&#146;s evidence, regardless of 
whether the evidence is uncontradicted.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[182]     I agree with this approach.  In the present case, it
seems to me that the approach taken by the trial judge served
only to exacerbate the prejudice to the appellant Lam caused by
the failure of Diu&#146;s counsel to cross-examine him on the points
at issue.  It is difficult to see why it was necessary to call to
the jury&#146;s attention the fact that Lam had declined to go back
into the witness box.  The trial judge should not have required
counsel for Lam to make his election not to call further evidence
on the point in the presence of the jury, nor should the trial
judge have made any reference to Lam&#146;s election not to re-take
the stand in his first instruction.
[183]     I conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge erred by
informing the jury that he offered Lam the right to reopen his
case.</pre>
    <pre><b>X.   Was the verdict against Diu for the death of Thai unreasonable?</b></pre>
    <pre>[184]     In my view, it cannot be said that the jury&#146;s verdict
against Diu for the second-degree murder of Thai was unreasonable
in light of the ballistics evidence and the evidence from
surviving witnesses and Lam.
[185]     Thai was shot once in the mouth with a bullet fired
from a .45 Para-ordinance and once in the chest with a bullet
fired from a .45 caliber weapon which could not be positively
identified.  The medical evidence indicated that the chest wound
was likely fatal even if treated and that the shot to the mouth,
while likely not fatal on its own, contributed to the cause of
death. There was no evidence about which shot occurred first. The
shot to Thai&#146;s mouth was fired from a range of 24-30 inches.  The
firing range of the shot to Thai&#146;s chest could not be determined
but might have been fired from a distance given that no gunpowder
stippling was found.
[186]     Diu&#146;s submission that the verdict against him for the
murder of Thai was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence
may be summarised as follows:</pre>
    <pre>    Given that the shot to Thai&#146;s mouth was fired by a .45 Para-
     ordinance (which is the gun Lam used), the jury's verdict must 
     be based on Diu firing a slug from the .45 Colt into Thai&#146;s chest.</pre>
    <pre>    Four slugs might have been responsible for Thai&#146;s chest
     wound. Two of these four slugs were positively identified to be
     fired from the .45 Para-ordinance (i.e. the gun shot by Lam).</pre>
    <pre>    The other two slugs were fired from a .45 caliber weapon;
     which make could not be positively identified. These two slugs
     could not have been fired by Diu given: (i) the trajectories of
     these bullets; and (ii) that the number of .45 Colt casings found
     at the scene established that the .45 Colt was only fired four
     times and these four shots are accounted for by the two shots Diu
     fired at Bui and Pham and the other two shots Diu fired over the
     television and near the speaker.</pre>
    <pre>    Slug 31, which the ballistics experts testified might have
     caused Thai&#146;s chest wound, could only have done so if Diu had
     been standing closer to the bar than Thai. Virtually none of the
     witnesses placed Diu in this location. As well, the location of
     the .45 Colt casings suggest that this gun was fired from a
     location considerably further south than the bar area.</pre>
    <pre>[187]     While the ballistics evidence was not conclusive about
who fired the shot to Thai&#146;s chest, the ballistics evidence also
did not, in my view, eliminate the possibility that Diu shot
Thai.  The ballistics evidence established the minimum number of
shots fired by each weapon, based on the number of casings found,
but such evidence is not conclusive about the actual number of
shots fired because not all casings may have been found. Further,
the experts who testified were reluctant to say that the guns
were fired from the area where the casings were found because
casings can bounce or may have been kicked around. The trajectory
evidence was not conclusive because such evidence was dependent
on where the parties were relative to each other during the
shooting and such positions could not be determined with any
precision.
[188]     On the other hand, there was some evidence that clearly
implicated Diu in the death of Thai. Pham testified that he saw
Diu shoot Thai, and Tien testified that he saw Thai fall after he
heard a gunshot from the doorway where Diu had been standing. Lam
testified that Thai was shot from a distance which supported the
verdict that Diu shot Thai. The evidence that the shot to Thai&#146;s
chest may have been fired from a distance and the evidence that
the bullet entered Thai&#146;s chest from the side also supports the
conclusion that Diu rather than Lam shot Thai in the chest.
[189]     In light of this evidence, it cannot be said that the
verdict against Diu for the murder of Thai was unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre><b>XI.  If this Court concludes that the trial judge erred on any
     or all of the grounds raised by the appellants, did such
     error or errors give rise to a substantial wrong or 
     miscarriage of justice or may the proviso be applied?</b></pre>
    <pre>[190]     The respondent submits that this is an appropriate case
in which to apply the proviso, s.686(1)(b)(iii), essentially on
the basis that the ballistics evidence is so overwhelming against
both appellants that, despite any errors made by the trial judge,
we should find that there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage
of justice and uphold the convictions .
[191]     The fact that, as revealed by the ballistics evidence,
the appellants fired their guns nine times while being fired at
only once, certainly weakens the defence of self-defence.  While
the verdicts were consistent with the ballistics evidence, I am
not persuaded that the ballistics evidence conclusively resolves
the issue of self-defence. In my view, that issue cannot be
resolved without coming to grips with the credibility of the
appellants and the surviving witnesses.
[192]     In determining whether there has been no substantial
wrong or miscarriage of justice, as a result of an error at
trial, an appellate court is to ask whether &#147;the verdict would
necessarily have been the same if such error had not occurred&#148;:
Colpitts v. The Queen, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 146 at 149; or &#147;whether
there is any reasonable possibility that the verdict would have
been different had the error at issue not been made&#148;: R. v. Bevan
(1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 310 (S.C.C.) at 328-9. Section
686(1)(b)(iii) does not allow an appellate court to &#147;retry the
case to assess the worth of the residual evidence after the
improperly adduced evidence has been extracted from the record&#148;;
John v. The Queen (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 326 (S.C.C.) at 330.
[193]     In my view, the errors I have found were highly
prejudicial to both accused.  It is difficult to assess the
impact on the jury of the reply evidence from the parents of the
two deceased, but I cannot say with any degree of certainty that
it would have been insignificant.  Dao&#146;s improperly admitted
videotaped statement identified both appellants as the
aggressors.  It implicated Diu in the death of Thai and was
particularly damaging to Lam with respect to the death of Chau.
Tien&#146;s excluded description of a struggle between Lam and Thai
would have supported Lam&#146;s version of the events.  The treatment
of the bad character and propensity evidence against Diu and the
evidence of after-the-fact conduct could well have had an impact
upon the manner in which the jury assessed the credibility of the
appellants.
[194]     While it might have been possible to apply the proviso
with respect to some of the errors I have identified had they
occurred in isolation, when the cumulative effect of the errors
is fairly considered, the inevitable conclusion is that a new
trial is required.
[195]     Accordingly, I conclude that s.686 (1)(b)(iii) should
not be applied and that a new trial for both accused on all
charges is required.</pre>
    <pre><b>XII. Was Diu&#146;s sentence unreasonable?</b></pre>
    <pre>[196]     As I have concluded that a new trial is required, it is
unnecessary to address this ground of appeal.
</pre>
    <pre><b>CONCLUSION
</b></pre>
    <pre>[197]     For these reasons, I would set aside the convictions
and order a new trial.</pre>
