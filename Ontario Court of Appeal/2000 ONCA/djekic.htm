  </span> The appellant pleaded guilty on November 24, 1998 to one count of welfare 
  fraud over $5,000.00.  She wishes to withdraw that plea on the basis that it 
  was not made voluntarily but was made under pressure and in circumstances which 
  vitiated the voluntariness of the plea.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On May 14, 1998 the case was set for a preliminary hearing on December 
  1, 1998.  In October of that year, Officer Kerr obtained information that the 
  appellant was tampering with the witness and intended to charge her with obstructing 
  justice.  Officer Kerr informed appellant’s counsel of this in November and 
  as a result, counsel had the case brought forward for a judicial pre-trial on 
  November 23.  The appellant was not in court on that date and the pre-trial 
  was put over to the next day.  At that time defence counsel, Crown counsel, 
  the officer and the judge held the judicial pre-trial.  The Crown suggested 
  a sentence of two years on a guilty plea while the pre-trial judge proposed 
  that on a plea of guilty, a one-year sentence would be appropriate and that 
  in those circumstances, no obstruct justice charge should be laid.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After the pre-trial, the appellant, who had attended court with her 
  infant, was told about the pre-trial discussion and the fact that the officer 
  intended to arrest her that day, and charge her with obstruct justice and hold 
  her in custody pending a show cause hearing.  The officer called the Children’s 
  Aid Society to look after the infant and the appellant called her mother for 
  the same purpose.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was upset and was under pressure to decide whether to 
  plead guilty in accordance with the pre-trial discussion or to be arrested that 
  day on the new charge.  She had trouble deciding what to do but eventually agreed 
  to plead guilty.  However, while she was considering what to do, the case was 
  called and the presiding judge said the following to the appellant in open court:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>THE COURT:  Yes.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE> MR. Grummett,  you’re acting on this matter or not?</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>MR. GRUMMETT: Well, I haven’t been able to get any instructions, 
  Your Honour.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>THE COURT:  Well, Miss. Djekic, I understand that this matter 
  is up today, I understand you have a preliminary hearing coming in just a few 
  days and once that starts and there's a – and I am also given to understand 
  there’s another charge waiting for you, so what are you going to do with all 
  this?</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>MISS DJEKIC:  I don’t know, I’m just waiting for my mom 
  to come.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>THE COURT:  All right.  And do you think you’ll be in a 
  better position to instruct counsel after you’ve talked to her and have someone 
  to look after the child?                                      </p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>MISS DJEKIC:  Yeah.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>THE COURT:  Do you want me to stand it down for a little 
  while?</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>MISS DJEKIC:  Please.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>THE COURT:  Will you wait Mr. Grummett?</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>MR. GRUMMETT:  Yes, I will.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>THE COURT:  All right.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>Try -- ma’am, I – I - I can see that you’re upset, but I 
  also --  I - I have not only a responsibility to be fair to you and I’m going 
  to try to do that as best I can, but I’ve also got a whole day of court time 
  coming up and at the moment I don’t know how to say this politely, we had a 
  pretrial, we discussed the issue with the Crown Attorney and your lawyer, who’s 
  very experienced, and we persuaded -- your lawyer and the Crown lawyer with 
  a little bit of help at the pretrial persuaded an officer not to arrest you 
  just yet in the hope that we could work out something, but there’s a charge 
  there that is going to have to be dealt with unless we can work it out, today.  
  So, you have got to get yourself under control and give some hard thought….</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>MISS DJEKIC:  Well, I didn’t know I was coming here today 
  for this.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>THE COURT:  Well, you were lucky not to be coming in custody.  
  So, I think you need to go and get under control and speak to your mother, get 
  somebody to look after the child and give some really hard thought to this, 
  today.  All right?  Thank you.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>MR. GRUMMETT:  Thank you, Your Honour.</p>

  </span> Following the plea the case was put over for sentencing to the end of 
  January, but the appellant was not sentenced until May as the judge was ill.  
  However, the appellant advised both the pre-sentence reporter and her new counsel 
  that she wished to withdraw her plea and to plead not guilty.  Unfortunately, 
  her second counsel advised her to wait to raise the issue on appeal rather than 
  before sentencing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This Court set out the law with respect to withdrawal of a guilty plea 
  in the case of <i>R. v. T. (R.)</i> (1992), 17 C.R. 247.  To  be valid, a guilty 
  plea must be made voluntarily and unequivocally.  On an appeal the appellant 
  has the onus of showing that the plea was invalid.  The plea will be presumed 
  voluntary unless the contrary is shown.   At p. 253 the Court set out some of 
  the factors which may affect the voluntary nature of the plea:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>Several factors may affect the voluntariness of a guilty 
  plea.  None are present in this case.  The appellant was not pressured in any 
  way to enter guilty pleas.  Quite the contrary, he was urged by duty counsel 
  not to plead but to accept an adjournment.  No person in authority coerced or 
  oppressed the appellant.  He was not offered a “plea bargain” or any other inducement.  
  He was not under the effect of any drug.  There is no evidence of any mental 
  disorder which could have impaired his decision-making processes.  He is not 
  a person of limited intelligence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant had not given any instructions to her counsel to discuss 
  a guilty plea on her outstanding charge and was confronted on her arrival on 
  November 24 with a <i>fait accompli</i> arranged without any authorization by 
  her and sanctioned by a judge. She now faced not only with the prospect of being 
  arrested and held in custody on a new charge, but of having to make a decision 
  about her pending charge, which she did not know was going to be dealt with 
  at all on that day.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Our concern is that in those circumstances the pre-hearing judge, clearly 
  a person in authority, spoke to the appellant in a way which put significant 
  pressure on her to make a decision about her case on that day when she had to 
  consider the immediate needs of her child, all the circumstances of the new 
  charge she would be facing, as well as the considerations relating to the existing 
  charge. Although he no doubt had the best interest of the appellant in mind, 
  it was unfortunate and inappropriate for the presiding judge to speak  to the 
  appellant about those issues in the circumstances.  It was the role of her counsel 
  to do that and to advise her with respect to her choices and the timing of those 
  choices.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given the comments made by the presiding judge in this situation, we 
  are satisfied the appellant’s guilty plea was not made voluntarily.  She was 
  emotionally distraught, as the judge observed , she had to deal with her child, 
  the issue of a potential penitentiary sentence if she did not accept a plea, 
  as well as the fact that she had not attended court on that date prepared to 
  consider the full disposition of her charge.  In those circumstances she was 
  told by the trial judge that she was “lucky not to be coming into custody”.  
  This would certainly put significant pressure on a person to follow the suggestion 
  of the judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the guilty plea and sentence must be set aside in this 
  case and a trial ordered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal is therefore allowed.</p>
