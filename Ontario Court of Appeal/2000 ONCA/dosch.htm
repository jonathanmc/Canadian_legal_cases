    <pre><strong>CHARRON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an  application by the Crown for an  order  under
s.  525(5)  of  the Criminal Code revoking Mr. Dosch&#146;s  bail  and
issuing  a warrant for his arrest. The application was heard  and
granted on April 6, 2000. In a brief endorsement, this court held
that  the Crown met the criteria under s. 525(5) and ordered that
a warrant for the arrest of Mr. Dosch be issued.
[2]  The parties at the hearing requested that this court deal
further with the question of any future release, as if Mr. Dosch
had been arrested and brought before the court under s. 525(7).
On this question, this court held that Mr. Dosch failed to meet
the onus on him under s. 525(7) to show why his detention is not
justified. Consequently, his bail pending appeal was revoked
without prejudice to his right to bring a fresh application for
his release based on new evidence, if so advised.
[3]  Counsel at the hearing raised a question on the
interpretation of s. 525(5) and, consequently, I indicated that
further reasons would follow on this matter. These are those
reasons.
[4]  Subsection 525(5) reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
          s.525(5) Where  a judge  having  jurisdiction  in 
	  the  province  where  an  order under  subsection
	  (4) for the  release of an  accused has been made
	  is satisfied that  there  are  reasonable grounds
	  to believe that the accused
 
            (a) has contravened  or is about to  contravene
	        the undertaking or recognizance upon  which
  	        he has been released, or</pre>
    <pre>            (b) has, after his release from custody on  his
	        undertaking or recognizance,  committed  an
	        indictable offence, he may issue a  warrant
	        for the arrest of the accused.</pre>
    <pre>	  Subsection 679(6) provides that s. 525(5) applies
	  with  such  modifications  as  the  circumstances
	  require  in  respect  of  a  person  who has been
	  released on bail pending appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]   The question for determination is whether this court, under
s.  525(5), can issue a warrant for the arrest of an appellant on
the  basis of violations of an order other than that under  which
the appellant is currently released at the time.
[6]  It is common ground between the parties that Mr. Dosch
committed further offences (some of which are indictable) during
the month of January 2000 at a time when he was bound by the
terms of a recognizance entered into pursuant to an order of this
court dated December 21, 1999. An issue arises because the
December 21, 1999 order is no longer in effect since it was
subsequently superseded by a further release order dated January
17, 2000.
[7]  Counsel for Mr. Dosch takes the position that this court
cannot issue a warrant for the arrest of her client based on
violations in contravention of an order that is no longer in
effect. Counsel relies on R. v. Stoltz (1993), 84 C.C.C.(3d) 422
(B.C.C.A.) in support of this position. In Stoltz, the British
Columbia Court of Appeal, in confirming an order made by Wood
J.A. in Chambers, agreed with the following reasoning of the
applications judge:</pre>
    <pre>               From  the  material before me I am satisfied
	  that there are reasonable grounds to believe that
	  on or  about the  dates, times and places alleged
	  in the  three counts charging him with failing to
	  comply  with  the conditions of his recognizance,
	  the  appellant  violated  those  conditions   and
	  therefore  violated  the  recognizance  then   in
	  effect.  The  problem is that those recognizances
	  are  no  longer  alive.  All have been vacated by
          orders   subsequently  made  and   replaced    by
	  recognizances  subsequently entered into, and the
          power I have to issue a  warrant under  s. 525(5)
	  (a)  is  predicated  on  there  being  reasonable
	  grounds  to  believe  that   the  appellant   has
	  violated, or is about to violate, the undertaking
	  or recognizance on which he has been released.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Crown counsel argues that Stoltz can be distinguished on its
facts  since Mr. Dosch never signed a fresh recognizance pursuant
to  the  terms  of the later order dated January 17,  2000  until
after  the  Crown  brought  this application.  Counsel  therefore
argues  that, because Mr. Dosch was still bound by the  terms  of
the  order  dated December 21, 1999 both at the time he  breached
its terms and at the time the Crown brought this application, the
issue  in  Stoltz  does not arise. Alternatively,  Crown  counsel
urges this court not to follow the reasoning in Stoltz.
[9]  Crown counsel is correct in stating that Mr. Dosch was still
bound by the terms of the earlier order at the time this
application was served on him. The release order dated January
17, 2000 provides that &#147;the Release Order dated December 21, 1999
be varied upon entering into new recognizance&#133; &#148;. Since this new
recognizance was not entered into until after this application
was brought, the December 21, 1999 order was still in effect both
at the time Mr. Dosch breached its terms and at the time the
Crown brought this application.  However, I am not persuaded that
Stoltz can be distinguished on these facts since, upon Mr. Dosch
signing the fresh recognizance, the December 21, 1999 order was
effectively superseded by the later order. Therefore, to borrow
the language in Stoltz, the recognizance that was breached is &#147;no
longer alive&#148;.
[10] It is my view, however, that the fact that the recognizance
has been superceded by a subsequent order does not deprive the
court of its jurisdiction to issue a warrant for the arrest of
the violator.  I respectfully disagree with the reasoning of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal and find that there is no reason
to interpret s. 525(5) so as to restrict its application to the
time frame within which the recognizance whose terms have been
breached is still in effect. Mr. Dosch&#146;s appeal is still pending
before this court and his release pending the hearing of his
appeal is still subject to an order of this court. So long as the
criteria under s.525(5) are met, it is my view that this court
can still issue a warrant for his arrest so as to bring him back
before the court to show why his detention in custody is not
justified pursuant to the provisions of s.525(7).
[11] In order to establish the necessary grounds to obtain an
arrest warrant, it is sufficient for the Crown to show under
s. 525(5)(a) that Mr. Dosch has contravened the recognizance upon
which he was under release at the time of the violations, or,
under s. 525(5)(b), to show that he has committed an indictable
offence after his release on his recognizance. This has clearly
been established in this case. The fact that the recognizance in
question may have been superseded by a later order may provide
good reason in some cases for the court to refuse to exercise its
discretion to issue a warrant for the arrest of the appellant,
but, in my respectful view, it does not deprive the court of its
power to do so in an appropriate case.  In this case, there are
no factors that militate against the court exercising its
discretion.
[12] It is for these reasons that I granted the application.</pre>
