    <pre><b>On appeal from the decision of Ross J. dated February 20, 1997.</b></pre>
    <pre><b>MACPHERSON J.A.:</b></pre>
    <pre><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   One  of  the  features of modern Canadian  society  is  the
prominent  place  in  the  legal system of  so-called  regulatory
statutes.    These  laws  are  designed  to  protect   both   the
environment and the people who live, work and play in  it.   Laws
of  this type were well-described some years ago by Blair J.A. of
this  court in R. v. Cotton Felts Ltd. (1982), 2 C.C.C. (2d)  287
at 294:
</pre>
    <pre>          [There  is]  a large family  of  statutes
          creating what are known as public welfare
          offences  &#133;   Examples of  this  type  of
          statute  are legion and cover all  facets
          of  life ranging from safety and consumer
          protection  to  ecological  conservation.
          In   our  complex  interdependent  modern
          society  such  regulatory  statutes   are
          accepted  as  essential  in  the   public
          interest.    They  ensure  standards   of
          conduct,  performance and reliability  by
          various  economic groups  and  make  life
          tolerable for all.
          </pre>
    <pre>[2]   Two  of  the  most  important and  well-known  examples  of
regulatory   laws  are  environmental  protection  statutes   and
occupational  health  and  safety  statutes.   Occasionally,  the
public  welfare  offences  created by  these  statutes  have  the
potential  to  overlap.  An example would be the discharge  of  a
contaminant into the air which injures a worker employed  by  the
company  that  discharged the contaminant.  In such a  situation,
what  are  the  company&#146;s  obligations  under  the  environmental
protection  and  the  occupational health and  safety  laws?   In
essence, that is the core issue raised by this appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>A.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>(1)  The parties and the events
</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The parties signed an Agreed Statement of Facts for purposes
of this appeal.  Because it is admirably concise, I set it out in
full:
</pre>
    <pre>     1.   The Respondent corporation operates a 
	  chemical manufacturing complex in the
	  City of Sarnia. One product produced is 
	  called propylene oxide, whose manufacturing
	  process involves the use of chlorine.

     2.   On November 8, 1991 at about 7:30 p.m., an
	  uncontrolled emission of chlorine gas
	  discharged from the portion of the
          Respondent&#146;s complex where propylene oxide
	  was manufactured.  The chlorine gas vented
	  through a piping array under which an
          employee of the Respondent was working on
	  the roof of a six storey building.

     3.   The employee was working on the roof  at
          the  time,  checking valves  for  proper
          set.  The chlorine gas, which is heavier
          than  air enveloped the worker, blinding
          and  choking  him; he became disoriented
          and  could not make his way out  of  the
          immediate area; he stumbled and  fell  a
          couple  of times, but eventually managed
          to  get down a ladder to the ground.  He
          sought help and required both First  Aid
          and  overnight hospitalization  for  his
          injuries.
</pre>
    <pre>     4.    The Trial Court has found as follows:</pre>
    <pre>           The   volume  and  nature  of   that
           chlorine  was  not as  described  by
           Mr.   Frank  but  it  was  at  least
           sufficient   to  disable   him,   to
           disorient  him and cause him  to  be
           traumatized.    As   a   result   in
           attempting  to escape the  area,  he
           incurred  going  down  the   various
           steps    and   ladders   significant
           physical  injuries.  He did  not  in
           significant  manner  disclose  these
           to   the  company.   They  were  not
           found  at  the  time  of  his  brief
           hospitalization  in  the   emergency
           unit.   I  further find  that  there
           was  an  aspect of denial  of  these
           injuries   by   him,  for   whatever
           reason,  and  that he  continued  in
           his  regular  shifts including  some
           120   hours  of  overtime  over  the
           ensuing   months.   These   injuries
           ultimately  could  not  be   further
           denied  and  began  to  affect   his
           performance      commencing      the
           following  January  and   for   many
           months   thereafter  and  they   are
           largely   detailed  in  the  medical
           reports that I have referred to  and
           are before the court.
          </pre>
    <pre>                  Reasons  for Judgment  at
                  Trial Appeal  Book, Tab 5,
		  pp. 14-15
                  </pre>
    <pre>     5.   The  Trial Court found, and the  parties
          accept,  that  chlorine  was  discharged
          into   the   &#147;natural  environment&#148;   as
          defined  in the Environmental Protection
          Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.19 as amended.
     </pre>
    <pre>     6.   On the issue of the quantity of chlorine
          gas  which  escaped,  the  Appeal  Court
          Judge  said, and the parties accept  his
          finding:</pre>
    <pre>           The  Trial  Judge  found  the  other
           employees   could  not  detect   any
           significant  release of chlorine  in
           the   vicinity  of  the  unit.    As
           earlier  mentioned, the evidence  of
           Mr.  Top  was accepted by the  Trial
           Judge in determining the quantity of
           chlorine  which  had been  released.
           Mr.  Top&#146;s  evidence indicates  that
           the   chlorine  did  not  reach  the
           boundaries  of  the  unit   in   any
           quantity   to  cause  the   boundary
           analyzers   to   even   detect   its
           presence.    Basically   the   Trial
           Judge&#146;s findings in my view lead  to
           the conclusion that there was no off
           site  impact, nor any on site impact
           except for the effect the gas had on
           Mr. Frank.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 Reasons for Judgment on Appeal
                 Appeal Book, Tab 6, pp. 52-53
                                </pre>
    <pre>     
     7.   The  Occupational Health and Safety Act,
          R.S.O.  1990,  c. 0.1,  (&#147;OHSA&#148;)  has  a
          reporting requirement which is  set  out
          in  Section 5(3) of Regulation 851.   In
          this   particular  case,  Sheldon  Frank
          returned  to work on his next  scheduled
          work  day  and Section 5(3) was complied
          with  by  the company in completing  and
          keeping a record of the injury,  as  set
          out in Section 5(4) of Regulation 851.
</pre>
    <pre>     8.   When  Sheldon  Frank came  back  to  the
          nursing   station  in   January,   1992,
          complaining  of injuries  a  report  was
          sent  to the Workers&#146; Compensation Board
          by Dow, as it was sent on two subsequent
          occasions   when  Frank  complained   of
          injuries.
     </pre>
    <pre>     9.   No  charges were laid under the OHSA  in
          respect of this incident.
</pre>
    <pre>     10.  It   is  accepted  that  the  injury  to
          Sheldon   Frank   would  constitute   an
          adverse   effect  if  the  Environmental
          Protection Act applies.
     </pre>
    <pre>     11.  Counsel have agreed to the facts as  set
          out  herein and neither the Exhibits nor
          the  evidence  are reproduced  for  this
          Appeal, by consent of counsel.
</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The litigation
</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  respondent,  Dow  Chemical Canada  Ltd.  (&#147;Dow&#148;),  was
charged with two offences under the Environmental Protection Act,
R.S.O. 1980, c. 141 (&#147;EPA&#148;), namely:
</pre>
    <pre>          Discharging   a   contaminant,    namely
          chlorine    gas,   into   the    natural
          environment, contrary to section  13(1);
          and
          </pre>
    <pre>          Failing   to   report   such   discharge
          forthwith contrary to section 14(1).
          
In fact, these provisions were renumbered as ss. 14(1) and 15(1):
Environmental Protection Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 19.  The parties
and  judges below agreed that nothing turned on the mis-numbering
in  the  information.  I will, therefore, refer  to  the  correct
sections throughout these reasons.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Sections 14(1) and 15(1) of the EPA provide:
</pre>
    <pre>            14. (1) Despite any other provision of
            this   Act  or  the  regulations,   no
            person  shall discharge a  contaminant
            or cause or permit the discharge of  a
            contaminant    into    the     natural
            environment that causes or  is  likely
            to cause an adverse effect.
      </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>      
 	    15. (1) Every person who discharges  a
            contaminant  or causes or permits  the
            discharge  of a contaminant  into  the
            natural environment out of the  normal
            course  of  events that causes  or  is
            likely  to  cause  an  adverse  effect
            shall forthwith notify the Ministry.
      </pre>
    <pre>[6]  It can be seen that both of these sections refer to &#147;adverse
effect&#148;. These words are defined in the EPA:
</pre>
    <pre>          1.(1)     In this Act,
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#147;adverse effect&#148; means one or more of,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  impairment of the quality of the natural
	       environment for any use that can be made of it,</pre>
    <pre>          (b)  injury or damage to property or to plant or animal life,</pre>
    <pre>          (c)  harm or material discomfort to  any person,

          (d)  an adverse effect on the health of any person,</pre>
    <pre>          (e)  impairment  of  the safety  of  any
               person,
          
          (f)  rendering any property or plant or animal life unfit for
               human use,

	  (g)  loss of enjoyment of normal use of property, and</pre>
    <pre>          (h)  interference with the normal conduct of business;
               (&#147;conséquence préjudiciable&#148;)
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  trial  was conducted by His Honour A.L.  Eddy  of  the
Ontario  Court  (Provincial Division).   Judge  Eddy&#146;s  essential
finding was:
</pre>
    <pre>          I  find that the release of chlorine was
          not  totally  within  the  building  but
          clearly was to the natural atmosphere in
          the  vicinity  of Mr. Frank  as  he  was
          working in the area of venting pipes and
          that  he  was significantly affected  by
          the same.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
Based  on  this  finding, the trial judge convicted  Dow  of  the
offence  in s. 14(1) of the EPA.  Since Dow had not reported  the
incident  to the Ministry of the Environment, he also  entered  a
conviction  pursuant  to s. 15(1) of the Act.   The  trial  judge
imposed  fines  against  Dow in the amounts  of  $5,000  for  the
unlawful  discharge and $3,000 with respect  to  the  failure  to
report.
[8]   Dow  appealed  from both convictions.  The  Crown  appealed
against  the sentences imposed.  The appeal was heard by Ross  J.
of the Ontario Court (General Division).  He allowed Dow&#146;s appeal
from  both  convictions and dismissed the Crown&#146;s appeal  against
the sentences.
[9]   In  allowing  the  appeal  with  respect  to  the  unlawful
discharge  offence,  the appeal judge drew a distinction  between
direct  and  consequential effects.  He expressed the distinction
in this fashion:</pre>
    <pre>               
          The  distinction I would draw is between
          a direct and a consequential effect.  It
          would   be   my  view,  restricting   my
          comments  and  reasons strictly  to  the
          discreet factual situation in this case,
          that it is this consequential effect  to
          which  the  E.P.A. is  directed  by  its
          declared  purpose  and  not  the  direct
          effect.    In   other  words   the   Act
          contemplates  an  &#147;adverse  effect&#148;   be
          produced because the natural environment
          has been significantly impaired and that
          impairment  has  produced  the   adverse
          effect.  What is sought to be prohibited
          is  the  impairment or pollution of  the
          natural environment, which in turn or as
          a   consequence  of  such  pollution  or
          impairment causes or is likely to  cause
          an adverse effect.
          </pre>
    <pre>[10] Having articulated this definition, the appeal judge applied
it to the matter before him:
</pre>
    <pre>          The findings of the trial judge which  I
          have  previously summarized  established
          the release of a relatively small amount
          of  the  contaminant sufficient to  harm
          Mr.  Frank, which in the facts  of  this
          case  I view as a direct application  of
          the  contaminant to his  person,  rather
          than a state of pollution of the natural
          environment which consequently  produced
          his injury.  As I have stated earlier  I
          would  draw  a distinction  between  the
          direct   effect   as  opposed   to   the
          consequential effect of the contaminant.
          The  situation  involving  Mr.  Frank  I
          would  think was direct whereas  I  view
          the  E.P.A.  to  have a  larger  purview
          dealing   with   the   adverse    effect
          resulting from or consequential  to  the
          pollution  or impairment of the  natural
          environment.
          </pre>
    <pre>[11] It followed from this analysis that Dow had not committed an
offence under s. 14(1) of the EPA.  Similarly, since there was no
unlawful  discharge, there was no obligation  to  report  to  the
Ministry pursuant to s. 15(1) of the Act.
[12]  Although agreeing with Dow&#146;s position that no  offence  had
been  committed,  the appeal judge did not accept  one  of  Dow&#146;s
submissions in support of its position.  Dow contended  that,  on
the facts of the case, it was obligated to report to the Ministry
of  Labour  under the OHSA; since it had done this, an additional
report under the EPA was not required.
[13] The appeal judge rejected this submission.  He stated:</pre>
    <pre>          I  would  not,  for example,  adopt  the
          proposition that an injury to  a  worker
          in  the  workplace, because of  workers&#146;
          health  and  safety regulatory  schemes,
          automatically exclude the application of
          the EPA&#133; .
          </pre>
    <pre>          One  can envision situations wherein the
          discharge  of  a  contaminant  into  the
          natural  environment causing  impairment
          to the natural environment is sufficient
          to  cause or likely to cause an  adverse
          effect.   Simply  because  a  worker  or
          employee  is somehow affected would  not
          in  all cases automatically exclude  the
          application of the E.P.A.
          </pre>
    <pre>[14] The Crown sought leave to appeal to this court only from the
respondent&#146;s   acquittal  for  the  offence  of   discharging   a
contaminant.   The Crown did not seek leave to  appeal  from  the
respondent&#146;s acquittal for the offence of failing to  report  the
discharge.  Nor did the Crown seek leave to appeal the matter  of
sentence.  The respondent sought to have an additional ground  of
appeal  added,  dealing with that component of the trial  judge&#146;s
decision in which he reasoned that the application of the EPA  to
the facts of this case was not ousted by the OHSA.
[15] On April 18, 1997, Robins J.A. granted leave to the Crown to
appeal  regarding  the  acquittal for discharging  a  contaminant
contrary   to  s.  14(1)  of  the  EPA.   He  also  granted   the
respondent&#146;s  request in respect of the issue of the relationship
between the EPA and the OHSA.
</pre>
    <pre>B.   ISSUES
</pre>
    <pre>[16]  The formal issue on this appeal is whether the appeal judge
erred  in  allowing the appeal from conviction under s. 14(1)  of
the EPA.  This formal issue gives rise to two legal issues:
</pre>

C.   ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>(1)  The Interpretation of Section 14(1) of the EPA


[17]  In  R.  v.  Canadian Pacific Ltd.,  [1995]  2  S.C.R.  1031
(&#147;Canadian  Pacific&#148;), the Supreme Court of Canada considered  an
earlier  version  of  the Ontario EPA.  In  that  case,  Canadian
Pacific  Ltd. (&#147;CP&#148;) had conducted controlled burns  of  the  dry
grass   and  weeds  on  its  railway  right-of-way.   The   burns
discharged  a  significant  amount  of  thick  dark  smoke  which
adversely  affected the health and property of nearby  residents.
In his reasons for a majority of the court, Gonthier J. described
the effects in these terms, at pp. 1061-62:</pre>
    <pre>          One  resident suffered an asthma  attack
          in  his driveway after being exposed  to
          the smoke.  The smoke filled the home of
          another man, with the result that he had
          to   clean   the  interior   walls   and
          furniture thoroughly.  Another  resident
          discovered  that the shrubs,  grass  and
          trees  in her backyard had been  damaged
          by the fire and smoke.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The   smoke  from  the  April  11,  1988
          controlled  burn was not only  injurious
          to  the  health and property of  several
          Kenora   residents,  but  also  hampered
          visibility on a 200-foot stretch  of  an
          adjacent road.  One driver was forced to
          engage  his  vehicle lights  and  brakes
          because  the smoke was so heavy that  he
          was  unable to see the other side of the
          road.
          </pre>
    <pre>[18] CP was charged with committing an offence under the then  s.
13(1)(a) of the EPA which provided:
</pre>
    <pre>                13. (1) Notwithstanding  any  other
                provision  of  this  Act  or   the
                regulations,   no   person   shall
                deposit, add, emit or discharge  a
                contaminant  or  cause  or  permit
                the  deposit,  addition,  emission
                or   discharge  of  a  contaminant
                into   the   natural   environment
                that,
          </pre>
    <pre>                (a)  causes or is likely to cause
	        impairment of the quality of the natural
	        environment for any use that can be made
	        of it.1               </pre>
    <pre>               
[19] Before the Supreme Court of Canada, the principal issue  was
whether  the  words &#147;for any use that can be made of  it&#148;  in  s.
13(1)(a) were unconstitutionally vague or overbroad and therefore
infringed  s.  7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and  Freedoms.
The   court   unanimously  held  that   s.   13(1)(a)   was   not
unconstitutionally  vague or overbroad.   Gonther  J.  wrote  the
majority  judgment on behalf of six judges; Lamer  C.J.  wrote  a
concurring  judgment  which  was  joined  by  two  other  judges.
Although  the analysis in the judgments was directed  principally
to  the constitutional issues, both judges made statements  about
the  interpretation of s. 13(1) of the EPA (now s. 14(1)).  Those
statements  are  directly  relevant to  the  resolution  of  this
appeal.
[20]  In  his  concurring reasons, Lamer  C.J.  stated  that  the
&#147;starting-point of the interpretive process is the plain  meaning
of the statute&#146;s terms&#148; (at p. 1049).  In the present appeal, the
provisions which must be interpreted are the offence section,  s.
14(1), and the definition section, especially s. 1(1)(c),(d)  and
(e).  For ease of reference, I set them out again:
</pre>
    <pre>            14. (1) Despite any other provision of
            this   Act  or  the  regulations,   no
            person  shall discharge a  contaminant
            or cause or permit the discharge of  a
            contaminant    into    the     natural
            environment that causes or  is  likely
            to cause an adverse effect.
      </pre>
    <pre>        1.(1)    In this Act,
      </pre>
    <pre>         &#147;adverse effect&#148; means &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  harm or material discomfort to any person,</pre>
    <pre>          (d)  an adverse effect on the health of any person,
          
          (e)  impairment of the safety of any person&#133; .

[21]  On  the basis of the Agreed Statement of Facts, the parties
agree  that there was a prima facie violation of s. 14(1) by  the
respondent.   The definition of &#147;contaminant&#148; in s. 1(1)  of  the
EPA includes &#147;any &#133; gas&#148;. Chlorine is a gas, indeed a potentially
lethal  gas.   The  parties  also  agree  that  Dow  caused  &#147;the
discharge&#148; of the chlorine and that the discharge was  &#147;into  the
natural  environment&#148;.   Finally, the  parties  agree  that  &#147;the
injury to Sheldon Frank would constitute an adverse effect if the
Environmental  Protection  Act applies.&#148;   This  is  a  fair  and
obvious conclusion; the trial judge&#146;s description of the chlorine
incident  and its immediate impact and long-term effects  on  Mr.
Frank  establish conclusively that he suffered harm  or  material
discomfort,  an adverse effect on his health, and  impairment  of
his safety.
[22]  In  spite of these points of agreement between the parties,
Dow  submits  that  the plain meaning of the statute&#146;s  terms  is
only,  as  Lamer C.J. said, a &#147;starting-point&#148;.   In  this  case,
contends  Dow, the starting point cannot be the finish line.   In
support of this position, Dow develops two lines of argument.   I
would  label  one &#145;the contextual argument&#146; and  the  other  &#145;the
absurdity argument&#146;.

(f)  The contextual argument
          </pre>
    <pre>[23] Dow contends that s. 14(1) is not infringed if the discharge
of  a contaminant into the natural environment has no, or only  a
transient  or  trivial,  impact on the natural  environment.   In
advancing  this  argument, Dow does not rely on  the  distinction
between  direct  and  consequential effects  articulated  by  the
appeal judge.  Such forbearance is wise, in my view, because  the
distinction  is not an appropriate one, at least in  the  fashion
stated by the appeal judge.
[24] The distinction between direct and consequential effects  is
not expressed in s. 14(1) of the Act.  Nor is there, as far as  I
am aware, any support for it in the case law in the environmental
protection  domain.  Indeed, the appeal judge cited no  authority
for  it.  Moreover, in the leading case, Canadian Pacific, supra,
one of the results of the controlled burn was an attack of asthma
for  a  man who was exposed to smoke in his driveway.  The  smoke
clearly  had  a direct adverse effect on him, yet this  posed  no
problem for the Supreme Court of Canada.
[25]  Dow&#146;s  contextual  argument is  anchored  in  some  of  the
language,  especially  in  Gonthier J.&#146;s  judgment,  in  Canadian
Pacific.   In a passage where he discussed all of the  components
of &#145;adverse effect&#146;, Gonthier J. stated, at p. 1081:

          It   is   apparent   from   these   other
          enumerated impacts that the release of  a
          contaminant which poses only a trivial or
          minimal threat to the environment is  not
          prohibited  by  s. 13(1).   Instead,  the
          potential  impact  of a contaminant  must
          have  some significance in order  for  s.
          13(1) to be breached.
          </pre>
    <pre>[26]  Later  in his judgment, and referring only to s.  13(1)(a),
Gonthier J. said, at pp. 1082-83:
</pre>
    <pre>          Where an accused has released a substance
          into  the natural environment, the  legal
          debate must focus on whether an actual or
          likely &#147;use&#148; of the &#147;natural environment&#148;
          has  been &#147;impaired&#148; by the release of  a
          &#147;contaminant&#148;.   This  legal  debate   is
          clearly facilitated by the application of
          generally      accepted      interpretive
          principles.     In   particular,    these
          principles  demonstrate that s.  13(1)(a)
          does  not  attach  penal consequences  to
          trivial  or  minimal impairments  of  the
          natural   environment,   nor    to    the
          impairment  of  a  use  of  the   natural
          environment  which is merely  conceivable
          or imaginable.  A degree of significance,
          consistent   with   the   objective    of
          environmental protection, must  be  found
          in  relation to both the impairment,  and
          the  use  which  is impaired.   [Emphasis
          added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[27] Relying on these passages, Dow contends that there can be no
offence  under  s.  14(1)  of  the Act  if  the  discharge  of  a
contaminant  poses  only  &#147;a trivial or  minimal  threat  to  the
environment&#148;,  irrespective of its effect  on  persons  like  Mr.
Frank.
[28]  I do not agree with this argument.  It needs to be recalled
that the issue in Canadian Pacific was the interpretation of  one
of  the  statutory definitions of &#147;adverse effect&#148;,  specifically
the  current  paragraph (a): &#147;impairment of the  quality  of  the
natural  environment for any use that can be made of  it.&#148;   When
Gonthier  J.  employed  the qualifying language  of  &#147;trivial  or
minimal&#148;  or a &#147;degree of significance&#148;, he linked these  phrases
to  the specific words in paragraph (a).  Thus, it is &#147;trivial or
minimal&#148;  impairments  of the natural environment  that  are  not
covered  by  s.  14(1)  of  the EPA.  And  it  is  a  &#147;degree  of
significance&#148;  in relation to both the impairment,  and  the  use
which is impaired that gives rise to an infringement of s. 14(1).
[29]  Paragraph (a) is just one of eight defined adverse effects.
It  relates to the natural environment, which is defined  in  the
Act  as  &#147;the  air, land and water&#148; (s. 1(1)).  The  other  seven
paragraphs set out other forms of adverse effect.  Some relate to
plants  and  animals  (paragraphs (b) and (f));  some  relate  to
people   (paragraphs  (c),  (d)  and  (f))  and  their   property
(paragraph (g)) and business (paragraph (h)).
[30] In my view, it makes sense, both in logic and in policy,  to
import the language Gonthier J. used to qualify the definition of
adverse effect with respect to paragraph (a) into paragraphs (b)-
(h) of the same section.  However, that importation of qualifying
language does not help Dow in this case.
[31]  The  adverse  effect  of the chlorine  discharge  on  Dow&#146;s
employee,  Mr.  Frank,  caused him harm and  material  discomfort
(paragraph  (c)),  it  adversely affected his  health  (paragraph
(d)),  and it impaired his safety (paragraph (e)). In the  Agreed
Statement of Facts, the parties set out this description from the
trial judge&#146;s reasons:
</pre>
    <pre>          The  volume  and nature of that  chlorine
          was not as described by Mr. Frank but  it
          was  at least sufficient to disable  him,
          to  disorient  him and cause  him  to  be
          traumatized.   As a result in  attempting
          to  escape  the  area, he incurred  going
          down   the  various  steps  and   ladders
          significant physical injuries.
          

In my view, this description makes it clear that there was
nothing trivial or minimal about the effects of the discharge on
Mr. Frank.
[32] There is a second, albeit in my view not as compelling,  way
to  interpret  the passages from Gonthier J.&#146;s judgment  set  out
above.   This alternative interpretation would be anchored  in  a
single sentence from these passages, at p. 1081:

          It   is   apparent   from   these   other
          enumerated impacts that the release of  a
          contaminant which poses only a trivial or
          minimal threat to the environment is  not
          prohibited by s. 13(1) [now s. 14(1)].
</pre>
    <pre>[33] In this sentence, Gonthier J. referred to s. 13(1), not just
s.13(1)(a).  It could be contended, therefore, that the  &#147;trivial
or  minimal&#148; qualification applies not just to the words &#147;adverse
effect&#148;  in  s.  14(1),  but also to the words  &#147;discharge  of  a
contaminant into the natural environment&#148;.
[34]  In  my  view, this alternative interpretation  of  Canadian
Pacific is not as persuasive as the one I set out above which  is
grounded  in an interpretation of Gonthier J.&#146;s entire  judgment.
However,  if I am wrong in this conclusion &#150; if, for  example,  a
chlorine  explosion  which killed several  people  but  dispersed
almost  immediately and had no impact on the natural  environment
is not captured by s. 14(1) &#150; then the alternative interpretation
does  not  assist Dow in this case.  That is because the chlorine
discharge in this case was not trivial or minimal.  Indeed, Dow&#146;s
counsel  conceded that the discharge was not trivial and that  it
had  some  impact  on  the environment.  In light  of  the  trial
judge&#146;s  description of the nature and scope  of  the  discharge,
this was a fair concession.
[35] On this point, I observe that the contaminant in issue in
this case is chlorine, a potentially deadly gas.  In Canadian
Pacific, Gonthier J. said, at p. 1075:</pre>
    <pre>          Recent environmental disasters, such as
          the Love Canal, the Mississauga train
          derailment, the chemical spill at Bhopal,
          the Chernobyl nuclear accident, and the
          Exxon Valdez oil spill, have served as
          lightning rods for public attention and
          concern.
          </pre>
    <pre>[36]  I note that two of the five examples cited by Gonthier  J.,
the  Mississauga  train  derailment and  the  chemical  spill  at
Bhopal,  involved  chlorine.  In one of  the  incidents,  Bhopal,
several  thousand people were killed.  Recalling these incidents,
and bearing in mind that the purpose of the EPA is to protect the
environment  and people, in my view it would be a  rare  case  in
which  any  discharge  of chlorine into  the  open  air  from  an
industrial  plant  would  warrant  the  adjectives  &#147;trivial   or
minimal&#148;,  provided  the discharge caused  one  of  the  &#147;adverse
effects&#148; set out in the statute.
[37] In summary on this issue, giving the words of ss. 14(1)  and
(1)(1)  of the EPA their plain meaning, Dow committed an  offence
under  s.  14(1).  Dow discharged a contaminant into the  natural
environment  which had an adverse effect on Mr.  Frank.   If  the
&#147;trivial or minimal&#148; language from Canadian Pacific is applied to
either  or  both the words &#147;adverse effect&#148; and &#147;discharge  of  a
contaminant into the environment&#148;, the result is the  same.   The
effect  of the discharge on Mr. Frank was very serious.  And  the
actual  discharge of a potentially deadly gas into the  open  air
from an industrial plant was also serious.</pre>
    <pre>(b)  The absurdity argument
      
[38]  Dow&#146;s second argument against its conviction under s. 14(1)
of  the  EPA  is  one grounded in absurdity.  Dow  sets  out  its
argument on this point in paragraph 9 of its factum:
</pre>
    <pre>        9.   The problem comes most clearly
	from cases where the emission of a 
	solid (which is within the definition 
	of contaminant) to the natural environment 
	results in personal injury.  If a flying
        piece of rock was emitted to the air and 
	resulted in injury to a person, it is 
	submitted, that a conviction would not be 
	entered pursuant to the qualifications set 
	out in the Canadian Pacific case, where the 
	only impact on the environment was the rock
        flying through the air and then hitting a person.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[39]  The  appeal  judge in this case also discussed  potentially
absurd consequences that might flow from a literal interpretation
of  s.  14(1).   He  referred to an injury  caused  by  a  person
spraying  the  contents of an aerosol can into  another  person&#146;s
eyes  or  nose, or someone dropping a hammer onto another person,
or  even  someone shooting waterfowl during hunting season.   The
plain  meaning of s. 14(1) might support charges with respect  to
all of these incidents.
[40]  The court in Canadian Pacific was also concerned about  the
possibility of absurd results under the current s. 14(1)  of  the
EPA.  Lamer C.J. gave a vivid example, at p. 1056:

          Thus,   for  example,  under   a   &#147;plain
          meaning&#148;  interpretation of  s.  13(1)(a)
          all  Ontario residents who in  wintertime
          place  sand on the icy sidewalks in front
          of  their  houses to lessen the  risk  of
          passers-by    injuring   themselves    by
          slipping  and falling would seemingly  be
          subject  to prosecution and imprisonment:
          city  sidewalks are clearly part  of  the
          &#147;natural  environment&#148; as defined  in  s.
          1(1)(k)  of the E.P.A., and the spreading
          of sand can render them less suitable for
          use  as  cross-country ski trails (making
          sand a &#147;contaminant&#148;, and triggering  the
          operation of s. 13(1)(a)).
          
[41] There are two responses to Dow&#146;s absurdity argument.  First,
the  potentially absurd consequence is not this case.  This  case
involves the discharge of a serious contaminant (chlorine) by  an
industrial  company (Dow) into the open air and an immediate  and
serious  injury  to  a  person who came  into  contact  with  the
chlorine.   If  you asked a person in the street to  describe  an
environmental  protection incident, the response  might  well  be
something close to: &#147;Deadly gas escapes industrial plant, travels
through air, and hurts or kills people.&#148;  In short, the facts  of
this   case  are  the  paradigmatic  facts  of  an  environmental
protection case.
[42] Second, the courts (not to mention government administrators
and  prosecutors)  are  used to dealing with  potentially  absurd
results  of  literal  interpretations of  the  law.  In  Canadian
Pacific,  Gonthier J. made an express reference to this  problem,
at p. 1082:

</pre>
    <pre>          Where a provision is open to two or  more
          interpretations, the absurdity  principle
          may be employed to reject interpretations
          which  lead to negative consequences,  as
          such  consequences are presumed  to  have
          been  unintended by the legislature.   In
          particular,  because the  legislature  is
          presumed  not to have intended to  attach
          penal  consequences to trivial or minimal
          violations of a provision, the  absurdity
          principle allows for the narrowing of the
          scope of the provision.  In this respect,
          the   absurdity  principle   is   closely
          related  to  the  maxim, de  minimis  non
          curat  lex  (the  law  does  not  concern
          itself with trifles).
          </pre>
    <pre>[43]  In  summary,  the  facts of this  case  do  not  present  a
potentially absurd interpretation of s. 14(1) of the EPA.     The
fact  that  Dow  can  conjure up examples of  potentially  absurd
results  does  not detract from the reality that its  conduct  in
this  case,  and the consequences of that conduct, are  precisely
the matters s. 14(1) is intended to address.  Just as the spectre
of  absurd results did not deflect the court in Canadian  Pacific
from  interpreting  s.  13(1)  to  cover  the  incident  and  its
consequences (thick smoke, through the air, causing  injuries  to
people,  property  and  plants), so should  it  not  deflect  the
Ontario courts from applying the current s. 14(1) to the facts of
this  case  (chlorine,  through the air, causing  injuries  to  a
person).
</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The Relationship between the Environmental Protection Act
     and the Occupational Health and Safety Act
</pre>
    <pre>[44] Dow advances an alternative argument against the application
of  the  EPA  in this case.  Dow contends that the EPA  does  not
apply  where  the  discharge of a contaminant  into  the  natural
environment gives rise to an adverse effect limited to  a  worker
in  the  workplace.  In such a situation, submits Dow,  the  OHSA
applies  exclusively.  In this case, Dow made  a  report  to  the
Ministry  of  Labour  as required by the OHSA.   Accordingly,  it
fully complied with the only law applicable to the situation.
[45]  In  support of this argument, Dow relies on the  fact  that
both  the  EPA and the OHSA in force at the time of the  chlorine
incident contained paramountcy provisions.  The EPA provided:

</pre>
    <pre>               179. (1) Where  a conflict   appears
               between  any provision of  this  Act
               or  the  regulations and  any  other
               Act   or   regulation  in  a  matter
               related  to  the natural environment
               or  a matter specifically dealt with
               in  this Act or the regulations, the
               provision   of  this  Act   or   the
               regulations shall prevail.
          
</pre>
    <pre>The OHSA contained a similar provision:</pre>
    <pre>               2. (2) Despite anything in any general
               or  special   Act,  the provisions  of
               this   Act   and    the    regulations
               prevail.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[46]  Dow submits that these provisions indicate that an  overlap
or  duplication  in  the coverage of the  EPA  and  OHSA  is  not
permitted and that in this case the OHSA applies because the only
adverse  effect  of the chlorine discharge was the  injury  to  a
worker on site at its plant.  Dow summarizes its argument in  its
factum in this fashion:

             23.  It is submitted   that  it can be 
	     seen on a review of both Statutes that
	     the   Environmental   Protection   Act
             would  have  only a disruptive  effect
             on   industry  and  make  for  useless
             reporting  if  the provisions  of  the
             E.P.A.   applied   to   releases    of
             contaminants limited to  a  worker  in
             the  workplace  which does  not  cause
             and  is  not  likely to cause  an  off
             site impact.
          </pre>
    <pre>[47]  This  issue  was not argued before the  trial  judge.   Dow
raised it before the appeal judge, who did not accept it:</pre>
    <pre>          I  would  not,  for  example,  adopt  the
          proposition that an injury to a worker in
          the workplace, because of workers&#146; health
          and     safety    regulatory     schemes,
          automatically exclude the application  of
          the EPA&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          One  can envisage situations wherein  the
          discharge  of  a  contaminant  into   the
          natural environment causing impairment to
          the natural environment is sufficient  to
          cause  or  likely  to  cause  an  adverse
          effect.   Simply  because  a  worker   or
          employee is somehow affected would not in
          all   cases  automatically  exclude   the
          application of the E.P.A.
          </pre>
    <pre>[48]  I  agree  with the appeal judge&#146;s conclusion.   It  is  not
unusual  for there to be a good deal of overlap between statutes.
This  is almost a sine qua non of a federal system of government.
Federal  and provincial laws often cover the same people,  events
and  transactions.   So,  too, with  laws  enacted  by  a  single
provincial  legislature.  Many of those laws  will  overlap,  and
occasionally even duplicate each other.
[49]  The  EPA  and the OHSA  are a clear example of  laws  which
overlap in an entirely permissible fashion.  The purpose  of  the
EPA  is  to  protect the natural environment and the  people  who
live, work and play in it.  The purpose of the OHSA is to protect
work  sites  and  workers.  Incidents occur which implicate  both
statutes.  An easy example would be a large plant located near  a
school.   If there was a serious chlorine explosion at the  plant
which  killed  several  workers but did  not  harm  any  children
because  the wind was blowing the other way, obviously  the  OHSA
would  apply  because of the tragic deaths of the  workers.   But
could  it  be  seriously argued that the  EPA  would  not  apply?
Surely,  those concerned with the administration and  enforcement
of  the  province&#146;s  environmental  protection  laws  would  (and
should)  be  deeply interested in what went wrong at  the  plant.
They  would  want to ensure that the cause of the  explosion  was
identified so that remedial steps could be taken to protect  non-
workers  (e.g. the school children) from the dangers  of  another
explosion on a day when the wind was blowing towards the school.
[50]  It  follows  that  I do not accept  the  on  site/off  site
distinction  proposed  by Dow.  An incident  with  only  on  site
effects  today  can  become one with off site  effects  tomorrow.
Thus, in many cases both the EPA and OHSA  could apply, and those
responsible for the administration and enforcement of  both  laws
would have a legitimate interest in knowing about the incident.
[51]  The paramountcy provisions in the EPA and the OHSA  do  not
assist  Dow.  They are relevant when there is a conflict  between
statutes.   There is no conflict between the EPA  and  the  OHSA.
There is an overlap, perhaps even a duplication.  But overlap and
duplication are different from conflict.  As expressed by Dickson
J.  in Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161 at
190,  &#147;duplication is &#133; &#145;the ultimate in harmony&#146; &#148;.  Dickson  J.
continued, at p. 191:
</pre>
    <pre>          In  principle, there would seem to be  no
          good reasons to speak of paramountcy  and
          preclusion except where there  is  actual
          conflict   in  operation  as  where   one
          enactment  says &#147;yes&#148; and the other  says
          &#147;no&#148;;  &#147;the same citizens are being  told
          to  do  inconsistent things&#148;;  compliance
          with one is defiance of the other.
         
[52]  Multiple Access talked about duplication, overlap, conflict
and  paramountcy in the context of a federal law and a provincial
law  in  the  same  domain.  However, Dickson J.&#146;s  reasoning  is
equally  applicable  in  the  context  of  two  provincial   laws
potentially  applying to the same incident and people.   Applying
Dickson  J.&#146;s language to the present case, there is  no  &#147;actual
conflict in operation&#148; between the EPA and the OHSA.  The  former
is  designed to protect the natural environment and people in it;
the  latter  is  designed  to  protect  workers  and  their  work
environment.  The two laws can stand together.
[53] Sometimes, as in this case, both laws will apply to a single
incident.   Dow admits that the OHSA applies; indeed it  complied
with  its  reporting  obligations under the OHSA.   However,  Dow
complains  that  the application of the EPA &#147;would  have  only  a
disruptive effect on industry and make for useless reporting&#148;.
[54]  I  do not agree with Dow&#146;s complaint.  Bearing in mind  the
important  public  purposes of both the EPA  and  the  OHSA,  and
recalling  the actual consequences (serious injury to  a  worker)
and  potential  consequences (chlorine discharged into  the  open
air)  of  the  incident,  the  alleged   &#147;disruptive  effect   on
industry&#148;  and  &#147;useless reporting&#148; are truly trivial  offsetting
consequences.   Moreover,  the trivial consequences  to  Dow  are
reduced  even farther by the fact that Dow could not be  punished
for   offences   under  both  statutes.   Section   26   of   the
Interpretation Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.11, provides:
</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>26.  Where an act or omission constitutes an 
offence under two or more Acts, the offender, 
unless the contrary intention appears, is 
liable to be prosecuted and punished under 
either or any of those Acts, but is not liable 
to be punished twice for the same act or omission.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[55]  I realize that this interpretation of the interplay between
the  EPA and the OHSA will create some uncertainty for companies.
The  on  site/off  site  distinction has the  merit  of  ease  of
application.  However, in my view, the purposes of  the  EPA  are
important  and do not permit an interpretation that excludes  the
Act  from  operating at work sites.  In Canadian Pacific,  supra,
Gonthier J. said, at p. 1068:
</pre>
    <pre>          What  is clear from this brief review  of
          Canadian pollution prohibitions  is  that
          our legislators have preferred to take  a
          broad  and  general  approach,  and  have
          avoided  an  exhaustive  codification  of
          every circumstance in which pollution  is
          prohibited.  Such an approach  is  hardly
          surprising  in the field of environmental
          protection, given that the nature of  the
          environment (its complexity, and the wide
          range  of  activities which  might  cause
          harm  to  it) is not conducive to precise
          codification.   Environmental  protection
          legislation has, as a result, been framed
          in  a  manner capable of responding to  a
          wide  variety of environmentally  harmful
          scenarios, including ones which might not
          have been foreseen by the drafters of the
          legislation.        </pre>
    <pre>         
[56]  Companies will have to exercise their judgment  when  faced
with  an incident that might implicate both the EPA and the OHSA.
They  will  have to be guided by the wording of the statutes  and
relevant  judicial  interpretations  such  as  Canadian  Pacific.
Sometimes they will not have to report an incident under the  EPA
because  it  was, viewed from the perspective of the purposes  of
the  EPA, &#147;trivial or minimal&#148;.  Dow&#146;s example of a hammer  being
dropped and striking a co-worker comes to mind.
[57]  However,  in other cases the line will be crossed.   In  my
view,  this case falls into that category.  Given the contaminant
in issue (chlorine), the nature and scope of the actual discharge
(a  substantial quantity in the open air), and the  fact  that  a
person  was  seriously  injured by  the  chlorine,  the  EPA  was
implicated, as well as the OHSA.
[58]  For  these  reasons,  I  conclude  that  Dow&#146;s  alternative
argument  fails.   The  application of the EPA  to  the  chlorine
discharge  at Dow&#146;s plant was not excluded by the application  of
the  OHSA to the same incident.  Both laws could, and did, apply.
Accordingly, the charge under the EPA was a lawful charge.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>          
[59]  I  would  allow  the appeal.  The conviction  and  sentence
imposed  by  the  trial judge for violation of s.  14(1)  of  the
Environmental Protection Act should be restored.

1  It  can  be  seen that this provision is very similar  to  the
current  s. 14(1) of the EPA.  The structural change is that  the
former  s. 13(1) has been divided into two parts: first, the  new
s.  14(1) with its new phrase &#147;adverse effect&#148;; and, second,  the
definition  of  &#147;adverse  effect&#148;  in  s.  1  (1).  One  of   the
definitions, namely (a), is almost identical to paragraph  (a) of
the former s. 13(1).</pre></td>
