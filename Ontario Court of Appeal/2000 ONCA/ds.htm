    <pre><strong>HEARD:         June 28, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Baldock J. dated March 10,
2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The Crown, through inadvertence, failed to disclose to  the
sentencing  judge  the appellant&#146;s breach of recognizance.   That
breach went to a crucial issue on sentence: whether the appellant
continued to pose a danger to the safety of young children.
[2]  The fresh evidence filed by the Crown, outlining the breach
of recognizance, together with the other aggravating factors in
this case persuades us that a conditional sentence of 6 months
was unfit.  The other aggravating factors include the following:
the appellant was in a position of trust when he committed the
offence; the sexual abuse was invasive as it involved fellatio;
and the abuse has seriously affected the young victim.
[3]  Although there were some mitigating factors including the
appellant&#146;s plea of guilty and his disclosure of the second
incident, they do not diminish the need for a custodial sentence.
Rehabilitation was an important consideration in this case but,
in our view, the paramount sentencing principles were
denunciation and deterrence.
[4]  The appellant has already served 3-1/2 months of his
conditional sentence for which the Crown acknowledges that the
appellant should receive some credit.  The Crown asked for a
sentence of 3 to 4 months&#146; imprisonment from today&#146;s date.
[5]  We are of the view that the Crown&#146;s position at trial, which
the Crown on appeal, fairly, has reflected in his position before
us, was unduly lenient.  But for the Crown&#146;s position, we would
have imposed a longer jail term for the appellant&#146;s conduct.
However, in light of the Crown&#146;s position, we impose a sentence
of 4 months imprisonment effective today.  We note that a 4-month
term will not materially interfere with the appellant&#146;s treatment
program.
[6]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal
is allowed and the 4-month term of imprisonment is imposed
effective today.</pre>
