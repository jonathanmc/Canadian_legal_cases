</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice J. Hamilton, sitting
without a jury, on June 30, 1993.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CHARRON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following a trial before Hamilton J. sitting without a jury,
the appellant was convicted of sexual assault and robbery on June
30,  1993. On June 21, 1995, he was declared a dangerous offender
and  sentenced  to  an  indeterminate  sentence.   The  appellant
appeals  against  his  convictions, the  finding  that  he  is  a
dangerous offender, and sentence.
[2]  Crown counsel provides a useful overview of the case in his
factum as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          i)   The offence of July 16, 1990</pre>
    <pre>          On  July  16,  1990,  the  appellant followed
          a  business  woman  from  the  lobby  of  the
          downtown  Toronto Chelsea Hotel to her  room.
          He pretended to be room service, which caused
          her  to  open her door, whereupon  he  forced
          himself  into the room, gagged her, tied  her
          up,  and  savagely raped her.  The  Appellant
          was   convicted   on   the   basis   of   the
          complainant's identification of the Appellant
          as  the  perpetrator  of  the  offence.   The
          learned trial judge also accepted the results
          of  the  forensic  testing which  established
          that  the DNA in the spermatozoa matched  the
          Appellant's DNA to the extent that  only  one
          person  in  approximately fifty  possess  the
          same  DNA profile (based on a one probe match
          at   D17S79).   However,  in  assessing   the
          significance  of that forensic evidence,  the
          trial  Judge  simply found that it  &quot;did  not
          exclude&quot;   the   Appellant   as   being   the
          perpetrator.          </pre>
    <pre>          ii)  The dangerous offender application</pre>
    <pre>          Following   conviction,  the   Crown  brought
          an   application  for  a  dangerous  offender
          application.  The Crown adduced evidence that
          on  June  19, 1990, the Appellant followed  a
          business  woman to her room in  the  downtown
          Toronto Sheraton Hotel.  As she was about  to
          close the door, the Appellant forced his  way
          in,  broke her nose, savagely raped her,  and
          tied her up.  By the time of the trial in the
          within case, the Appellant had been convicted
          of that offence and had been sentenced to six
          years in the penitentiary.</pre>
    <pre>          There  was   also  evidence  of  prowling  on
          two  other  occasions: On July 27, 1990,  the
          Appellant prowled for about two hours in  the
          downtown   Toronto   Sheraton   Hotel.     On
          August 12, 1990, the Appellant prowled in the
          downtown  Toronto  Holiday  Inn.   The  trial
          Judge found that on both those occasions  the
          Appellant was looking for another victim.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  Crown adduced psychiatric evidence  that
          the Appellant is a psychopath with a sadistic
          sexual paraphilia.  If released, there  is  a
          very  high  likelihood that  he  will  commit
          further  violent sexual offenses of the  type
          for   which  he  has  been  convicted.    His
          condition is incurable, and there is no  real
          prospect  of  treatment.   Even  the  defence
          psychiatrist  acknowledged that  there  is  a
          &quot;high  risk&quot;  (or a &quot;significant likelihood&quot;)
          that, if released, the Appellant would commit
          further  violent offenses, of  the  type  for
          which  he has been convicted, and that  there
          was no real prospect of treatment.</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The  appellant  raises several grounds in  support  of  his
appeal. In my view, there is no reason to interfere with  any  of
the trial judge&#146;s findings or his conclusions. Hence, each ground
of appeal can be disposed of summarily.</pre>
    <pre><em>     1.   Right to counsel</em></pre>
    <pre>[4]   Upon  arrest, the appellant was advised that he  was  under
arrest  for  sexual assault, he was cautioned and was  instructed
that he had a right to counsel. He was also informed that he  was
entitled  to free legal advice. Upon being asked if he wished  to
call a lawyer, the appellant indicated that he did not.
[5]  Some time later at the police station, during the course of
an interview with the police, the appellant was given further
details about the alleged offence. At that point, the appellant
did not make any substantive comment about the incident except to
proclaim his innocence. The officers then left the room and upon
their return some forty minutes later, the appellant was again
cautioned. When asked whether he wished to call a lawyer, he
indicated that he wanted to speak to his lawyer, Robert
Kellerman. The appellant was given a telephone book which he
appeared to thumb through randomly and he did not locate
Mr. Kellerman&#146;s number. Detective Wilson also tried to find the
number but to no avail. He then went to look for a lawyers&#146;
directory but could not locate one. It was agreed at trial that
Mr. Kellerman&#146;s name and number are in the phone book and that
Mr. Kellerman was available at the time.
[6]  The police placed a request for duty counsel and held off
questioning the appellant further. Duty counsel called  a short
while later and the appellant spoke to him for about twelve
minutes. The appellant did not make any complaint or objection
about speaking to duty counsel. Moreover, he did not reiterate
his wish to speak to Mr. Kellerman nor did he indicate that he
wished to speak to any other lawyer. Following his conversation
with duty counsel, the appellant did not make any further
statement to the police. He did, however, agree to give samples
of hair and saliva. Later, he provided a sample of his blood.
[7]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
concluding that the appellant was provided with his right to
counsel. He submits that he was not provided with the proper
information that would have enabled him to contact his lawyer of
choice and argues that the trial judge improperly put an onus on
him to locate his counsel of choice.
[8]  The trial judge&#146;s conclusion on this issue is entirely
dependant on the facts as he found them. In my view, there was an
ample basis to conclude that the appellant had been properly
informed of his rights under s.10(b) of the Charter, that he had
been given a reasonable  opportunity to exercise his rights and
that he appeared to accept duty counsel as an alternative to Mr.
Kellerman. Some of the critical findings include the facts that
the appellant had merely thumbed through the telephone book in a
manner that was carefree, that he had made no earnest attempt to
locate Mr. Kellerman, and that he never pursued his request.
While counsel for the appellant is correct in his submission that
the police could have made greater efforts to locate Mr.
Kellerman, this fact does not detract from the trial judge&#146;s
findings with respect to the appellant&#146;s own lack of diligence in
his attempts to consult with counsel of his choice.
[9]  The trial judge properly instructed himself according to the
principles in R. v. Leclair and Ross (1989), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 129
(S.C.C.), and his findings of fact are supported by the evidence.
Hence I see no reason to interfere with the finding that
Mr. Eakin&#146;s right to counsel was not breached.</pre>
    <pre><em>     2.   Right to be informed of the offence</em></pre>
    <pre>[10]  The appellant submits that his initial waiver of his  right
to  counsel  was not valid because he was not given a  sufficient
basis  to  make an informed decision. Although the appellant  was
informed  that  he  was under arrest for sexual  assault  and  he
understood  that this was a serious offence, he  argues  that  he
should have been given more information to enable him to identify
the   occurrence  in  question.  As  matters  stood,  it  is  the
appellant&#146;s  position that he believed he was  under  arrest  for
events  that  were alleged to have occurred on  the  day  of  his
arrest  rather  than some weeks before. Since  he  had  not  done
anything wrong on that day, he saw no reason to speak to counsel.
It  is only later during the course of the interview when he  was
confronted  with  the  allegations  in  question  that   he   was
sufficiently informed to request to speak to counsel.
[11] I see no merit to the appellant&#146;s submission on this point.
In my view, the trial judge was correct in finding that the
appellant was sufficiently informed of the reason for his arrest
to enable him to make an informed decision whether he wished to
exercise his right to counsel. Having been informed that he was
under arrest for sexual assault, the appellant realized that he
was arrested for a serious offence. The trial judge found him to
be sophisticated, articulate and very familiar with the system.
As stated in R. v. Smith (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 313 at 323
(S.C.C.), &#147;the degree of awareness which the accused may be
reasonably assumed to possess in all the circumstances may play a
role in determining whether what the police said was sufficient
to bring home to him the extent of his jeopardy and the
consequences of declining his right to counsel.&#148; It is further
noteworthy that the appellant was aware that he had recently been
found prowling in one of the local hotels and confronted by
security personnel and, as later found by the trial judge, that
he was on the lookout for another victim at the time.  In all the
circumstances, it can reasonably be inferred that what the police
told him was sufficient to permit the appellant to make an
informed waiver.</pre>
    <pre><em>     3.   Consent to giving a blood sample</em></pre>
    <pre>[12]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding
that he had voluntarily provided a blood sample to the police and
that there was no violation of his s. 8 rights under the Charter.
The  appellant  submits  that, because he  did  not  receive  the
benefit  of counsel of his choice and did not know that he  could
refuse to provide a blood sample, it cannot be said that he  gave
an  informed  waiver  of  his  right  to  be  protected  from  an
unwarranted search and seizure.
[13] In my view, this argument must fail. The trial judge
instructed himself according to R. v. Wills (1992), 70 C.C.C.
(3d) 529 (Ont. C.A.) at 546 on the prerequisites for a lawful
search and seizure based on consent and based his conclusion on a
number of key findings that accord with the requirements set out
in that decision. More particularly, the trial judge relied on
the nurse&#146;s testimony where she expressed the opinion that the
appellant had given his consent to the taking of blood and that,
if it had been otherwise, she would not have taken the sample.
The trial judge also found that the appellant knew that he could
refuse to provide a sample of blood. Although the trial judge
found that the police did not formally tell the appellant that he
could refuse to provide blood, he found as a fact, based on all
the evidence including the appellant&#146;s demeanour in testifying,
that the appellant  &#147;was aware he need not cooperate with the
police at any time&#148;. Hence, I see no basis to interfere with the
trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the appellant voluntarily provided
a blood sample to the police.</pre>
    <pre><em>     4.   Identification evidence</em></pre>
    <pre>[14]  The  appellant  submits  that  the  trial  judge  erred  in
concluding  that  the identification evidence of the  complainant
was  reliable given the fact that she did not describe a mole  on
the appellant&#146;s face and a distinctive tattoo on his forearm.
[15] The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence bearing on
the significance, or lack thereof, of the complainant&#146;s failure
to describe these two identifying features. In my view, his
conclusion that these matters did not affect the reliability of
her testimony is reasonable and supported by the evidence. It is
also apparent from the trial judge&#146;s reasons that he carefully
considered all of the relevant circumstances bearing on the
identification evidence and that he correctly instructed himself
as to the applicable law. There was an ample basis upon which to
conclude that the identification evidence was reliable.</pre>
    <pre><em>     5.   DNA evidence</em></pre>
    <pre>[16]  The  appellant  argues that the DNA evidence  was  of  such
limited  value  that it should have been rejected  entirely  from
consideration.
[17] I see no merit to this argument. The trial judge did not in
any way misapprehend this evidence or its limited value. It was
entirely open to him to consider it as one item of circumstantial
evidence and to weigh it in the balance as he did.</pre>
    <pre><em>     6.   Finding of dangerous offender</em></pre>
    <pre>[18]  The  appellant takes the position that  the  trial  judge&#146;s
finding  that the appellant was a dangerous offender  within  the
meaning  of  s.  753  of the Criminal Code  is  unreasonable.  He
submits that the application of the dangerous offender provisions
is  to  be confined to a small class of individuals who not  only
can be classified as dangerous but also as habitual criminals and
argues  that  the  evidence does not support a finding  that  Mr.
Eakin is an habitual criminal.
[19] In my view, this argument is ill-founded. The same argument
was advanced at trial and was correctly rejected by the trial
judge. The trial judge held that while the term &#147;habitual
criminal&#148; had played a significant role in the evolution of the
dangerous offender legislation, the relevant question was whether
the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that the
appellant was a dangerous offender within any one of the
provisions of s. 753 of the Criminal Code. In this case, the
trial judge found that the test was met under both
s. 753(1)(a)(i) and s. 753(1)(b). These findings were amply
supported by the evidence.</pre>
    <pre><em>     7.   Appellant&#146;s failure to accept responsibility</em></pre>
    <pre>[20]  Finally,  it  is submitted that the trial  judge  erred  in
considering  the appellant&#146;s failure to accept responsibility  as
an  important factor in determining both that he was a  dangerous
offender  and  that an indeterminate sentence was appropriate  as
opposed to a definite period of incarceration. It is argued  that
this  consideration, in circumstances such  as  these  where  the
offender  has  defended the case, offends general  principles  of
sentencing and breaches his right to fundamental justice pursuant
to s. 7 of the Charter.
[21] Counsel for the appellant is quite correct in stating that
an offender&#146;s decision to plead not guilty and defend the matter
cannot be considered as an aggravating factor in sentencing.
However, it is my view that the trial judge did not treat the
appellant&#146;s failure to acknowledge responsibility as an
aggravating factor. The appellant&#146;s failure to acknowledge his
responsibility for the offences and his lack of remorse had an
important bearing on the psychiatric opinions of the experts
called by both the Crown and the defence. It was relevant to the
appellant&#146;s present and future dangerousness to the public and to
his prospects for treatment.  The trial judge considered this
factor in the context of assessing this evidence. In my view, it
was not only proper but necessary for him to do so.
[22] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
