    <pre><strong>On appeal from the orders of Sharpe J. dated January 19, 1998 and
December 3, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>FINLAYSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants appeal from the judgment of the Honourable
Mr. Justice Sharpe dated January 19, 1998 wherein he granted a
motion pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure,
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, striking out the Statement of Claim as
against the respondent Law Society of Upper Canada (&#147;Law
Society&#148;) as failing to disclose a cause of action against it.
[2]  The Statement of Claim is a proceeding commenced under the
Class Proceedings Act, 1992, S.O. 1992, c.6, on behalf of up to
260 individuals who claim to have lost money in a fraudulent gold
scheme.  The motion to certify the class has not yet been held.
The appellants propose to represent by way of this proceeding all
individuals who deposited money from May 1989 to July 1990 into
the trust account of the law firm Palmer Mills, under the
management and control of the late John Mills.  The moneys were
to be held in trust against the delivery of gold by a company
incorporated in Ontario called Sisto Consultants Inc. (&#147;Sisto&#148;)
pursuant to the terms and conditions of Gold Delivery Contracts.
These contracts were delivered to Sisto which acted purportedly
as an agent for various gold producers.  The appellants made
their funds payable not to Sisto, but to the client trust account
of Palmer Mills.  The investment program was that the plaintiffs
could purchase gold at a discount if they agreed to pay up-front
and wait 90 days for the gold.  At the end of the allotted time,
and despite repeated requests, the plaintiffs did not receive any
gold; in fact no mines or gold existed.  Mills, it is alleged,
was using his trust account to provide banking services for this
venture.  He held the appellants&#146; money in trust for the
appellants and others in their proposed class pending receipt by
them of the gold called for in the contracts and deducted certain
amounts for expenses and commissions prior to such delivery.
[3]  The appellants allege that they were victimized by a fraud
organized and facilitated by certain of the defendants other than
Mills but which was permitted to continue by the negligence and
breach of duty of Mills and the Law Society.  Each of the members
of the proposed class seeks: the return of funds deposited in
trust with Mills and Palmer Mills; damages; and an accounting of
the trust funds held by Mills as trustee in the Palmer Mills
trust accounts from the date the account was created to
approximately May 15, 1990, when the trust funds were seized by
the Ontario Securities Commission.  The amounts of the individual
class member deposits range from $1,733 U.S. to $303,110 U.S.
[4]  Mills had referred two individuals who wished to become
involved in some undefined way with Sisto to another law firm
because, as the solicitor for Sisto, he felt that he could not
act for them.  On September 1, 1989, Mills received a letter from
a senior member of the law firm which he in turn forwarded to the
Law Society with his own covering letter.  The letters are not
set out in full in the Statement of Claim, but the parties agreed
to make them available to the court.  Since they were referred to
in some detail in the pleading they can be considered by the
court on a motion under Rule 21: see Web Offset Publications
Limited et al. v. Vickery et al. (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 802 at 803
(C.A.).
[5]  As it turned out, the solicitor to whom Mills had referred
the two persons had a conflict of interest in his own firm and
could not act.  However, as he put it, &#147;the matters which came to
our attention in the course of familiarizing ourselves with the
terms of the transaction have created grave concerns about the
propriety of the operations of Sisto Consultants Inc.&#148;  He then
summarized them as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <ol>
        <li><pre>The method of distribution of gold-related securities to
investors appears not to be in compliance with applicable
securities legislation including the registration and 
prospectus requirements thereof.  We would have anticipated 
that the forward sale of gold, backed subsequently by a 
performance bond from Sisto International Inc., would be 
construed as the distribution of an investment contract, 
and not a commodity.</pre>
        </li>
        <li><pre>The use of your firm&#146;s trust account as the &#147;bank&#148; for the
operations of Sisto Consultants Inc., even though intended
as a temporary measure since May, appears to contravene the 
rules governing the use of solicitors&#146; trust accounts in 
Ontario, which are not used for the conduct of business 
enterprises.  The paying of commissions and expenses out of 
such trust account upon confirmation that the investor has 
received the performance bond in our view goes beyond what 
is necessary to preserve your client&#146;s interests on a 
temporary basis.  The position is exacerbated by the fact 
that investors may well seek to claim over against your firm 
in the event that delivery of the gold, or payment under the 
performance bond, is not effected.  This practice may well 
expose your firm, and the compensation fund, to needless 
risk.</pre>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[6]  The letter concluded that the writer felt under an
obligation to report the matter to the Law Society unless Mills
took such action himself.  As indicated, Mills forwarded the
letter to the Law Society the same day.  In his covering letter,
he stated that he thought the writer of the letter was mistaken
in his conclusions but closed by saying that &#147;I will be very
pleased to settle this matter on my return [from Huntsville] and
will make our books and records available to your staff if you
call on or after September 12&#148;.
[7]  One of the issues in this case, which was not fully
addressed by counsel, is the impact of the nature of the
relationship between Mills and the appellants on the duty of
care, if any, that the Law Society owes to the appellants.  It is
not expressly alleged that the appellants, or any members of the
class that they propose to represent, were clients of Mills in
the traditional sense.  The closest they come is the allegation
that they are &#147;persons from whom or on whose behalf a member of
the Law Society in connection with his practice receives money&#148;
and are therefore &#147;clients&#148; within the definition for accounting
purposes set out in s.13(a) of Regulation 573, R.R.O. 1980 under
the Law Society Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8.  As I understand their
position, the appellants take a larger view of the duty of the
Law Society and allege that it goes beyond a concern for the
protection of clients in the traditional sense and extends to the
public generally.  In particular, in their Statement of Claim,
the appellants plead:
          </pre>
    <pre>         32. The Law Society commenced an investigation
	     based on Mills&#146; disclosure in respect of
	     the use of his trust account.  However, the
             Law Society failed to take any effective
	     steps to ensure that Mills was operating
	     his trust account in the prescribed manner.
	     Mills and the Law Society knew or ought to
             have known that trust funds in Mills&#146; client
	     trust account were being used in an
	     unauthorized manner and that the Gold Delivery
             Contracts and Class members&#146; funds were being
	     disbursed in a scheme contrary to Ontario
	     securities laws, contrary to the terms
             of the trust and in furtherance of a fraud.
          </pre>
    <pre>         33. The plaintiffs plead that, once the
             Law Society received the complaint
             against Mills, it owed a duty to the
             plaintiffs and the Class as clients of a
             member of the Law Society and
             beneficiaries of a trust held by a member
             of the Law Society to ensure that Mills
             was operating his trust account in a
             manner consistent with its requirements
             and to ensure that he was not connected
             with the operation of a scheme in
             violation of applicable Ontario laws and
             his fiduciary duties as a trustee and
             solicitor.  The plaintiffs plead that the
             Law Society conducted an inadequate
             investigation of the complaint, contrary
             to the provisions of the Law Society Act
             R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8, and, in particular,
             Regulation 573, section 9(1) thereof.  As
             a result, the Law Society breached its
             duty of care owed to the plaintiffs and
             the Class.  The plaintiffs plead that
             they and the Class are the very persons
             the Law Society is empowered and obliged
             to protect with its regulatory,
             licensing, disciplinary and investigatory
             powers.  The Law Society had a duty to
             ensure that Mills operated his trust
             account according to regulations or
             alternatively to warn the plaintiffs and
             the Class that it had chosen to abandon
             its supervisory jurisdiction to allow the
             plaintiffs and the Class to take steps to
             protect their own interests.
          </pre>
    <pre>         34. The plaintiffs plead that they
             would not have suffered the losses
             alleged herein or to the extent alleged
             herein had the Law Society fulfilled its
             obligation to reasonably investigate the
             complaint made against Mills and warn the
             plaintiffs and members of the Class.
             Members of the Class were an identifiable
             group who might reasonably suffer harm as
             a result of the disclosed and
             unrestrained activities of Mills and
             Palmer Mills in that members of the Class
             were the beneficiaries of a trust that
             the Law Society knew or ought to have
             known was wrongfully used and Mills was
             acting for clients with conflicting
             interests without advising them of the
             conflicts or that their interests were
             not protected.  The Law Society had a
             sufficient relationship of proximity with
             members of the Class that it was or ought
             to have been within the reasonable
             contemplation of the Law Society that
             carelessness on its part would likely
             cause damage and loss to the Class.  The
             plaintiffs plead that their damages were
             caused or contributed to by the failure
             of the Law Society to take any effective
             steps to protect the plaintiffs and the
             Class from Mills&#146; negligence, breach of
             trust and breach of contract.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellants thereupon pleaded that the Law Society is
liable for the negligence, breach of trust and breach of contract
of Mills and was negligent in its own right in that it failed to
do a number of things which are detailed in the Statement of
Claim.  On analysis, the particulars pleaded are not allegations
of misfeasance or non-feasance on the part of the Law Society but
rather a recital of all the things that it was empowered to do in
response to a complaint.  For instance, the appellants allege
that the Law Society commenced an investigation with respect to
the use of Palmer Mills&#146; trust account by Mills, but that it
negligently failed to take any effective steps to ensure that he
was operating his account according to Law Society rules and that
the Law Society owed a duty to the appellants as clients of a
member of the Law Society to ensure that Mills was operating his
trust account properly.  However, counsel for the appellant very
candidly stated to this court that he had no idea what the Law
Society did or did not do in response to the letter of Mills and
its enclosure.  He hoped to find this out on discovery.  His
ultimate position was that the Law Society&#146;s &#147;inadequate&#148;
investigation was contrary to the Law Society Act and, in
particular, to s.9(1) of Reg. 573, R.R.O. 1980.  It provides as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>9.  (1) Where information comes to the notice of the
Society that indicates that a member may have been 
guilty of professional misconduct or of conduct 
unbecoming a barrister and solicitor, the Secretary 
shall make such preliminary investigation of the 
matter as he considers proper, and where in his 
opinion there are reasonable grounds for so doing, he 
shall refer the matter promptly to the Committee or 
the chairman or vice-chairman for further directions.
[Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[9]  The regulation then goes on to state that the Secretary
shall, &#147;subject to the directions of the Committee, the chairman
or the vice-chairman&#148; prepare and complete under oath a complaint
and serve it on the member whose conduct is being investigated.
Since there is no pleading that a complaint was ever sworn, we
must assume that the investigation alleged to have been commenced
by the Secretary fell somewhere short of formalizing the
complaint and engaging the full disciplinary process.  The
pleadings are also silent as to what response, if any, the Law
Society made to Mills&#146; letter of September 1, or to the
solicitors&#146; letter which was enclosed.  The persons named in the
letter of complaint do not appear to be within the aggrieved
class that the appellants propose to represent.
[10] The allegation in the Statement of Claim that the Law
Society was liable for the negligence of Mills and for his breach
of trust was not argued before us and does not appear to have
been argued before the motions judge.  Certainly there is no
provision in the Law Society Act or at common law which would
make the Law Society vicariously liable for the misconduct of one
of its members: see Carnegie v. Rasmussen Starr Ruddy et
al.(1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 272 at 279 (Gen. Div.).  Rather the
position of the appellants is that the Law Society has the
responsibility to control and discipline its members and that
this responsibility creates a duty of care to all members of the
public that deal with members of the Law Society, such that
negligence in carrying out this responsibility exposes the Law
Society to a claim for damages at the suit of the injured member
of the public.</pre>
    <pre><em>The Anns/Kamloops Test</em></pre>
    <pre>[11] The case relied upon by the appellants as determining that
the Law Society, as a government agency or body, owes a private
law duty of care to members of the public having dealings with
member lawyers is City of Kamloops v. Nielsen et al. (1984), 10
D.L.R. (4th) 641 (S.C.C.).  In that case, the defendant city,
although aware through its building inspector of the defect,
failed to prevent the construction of a house with defective
foundations and its occupation by the people for whom the house
had been built, a city alderman and his wife.  After they had
occupied it for three years, the original owners sold the house
to the plaintiff who brought suit against the city for the cost
of repairs.  Writing for the majority of the Court, Wilson J.
adopted the reasoning of Lord Wilberforce in Anns v. Merton
London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728 (H.L.).  Specifically,
Wilson J. adopted the two-step test used by Lord Wilberforce to
determine whether or not a private law duty of care existed:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(i)  Is there a sufficiently close relationship between the
parties so that, in the reasonable contemplation of the public
body, carelessness on its part might cause damage to that 
person?

(ii) If so, are there any considerations which ought to negative
or limit the duty?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12] Wilson J. also agreed with Lord Wilberforce that this
analysis must include (presumably in the second part of the test)
a consideration of whether the powers exercised by the body from
which liability is claimed to arise can be termed &#147;policy&#148; as
opposed to &#147;operational&#148; decisions.  At p. 661 of the judgment in
Kamloops, Wilson J. cited this passage from p. 754 of Anns:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Most, indeed probably all, statutes relating to 
public authorities or public bodies, contain in 
them a large area of policy.  The courts call 
this &#147;discretion&#148; meaning that the decision is 
one for the authority or body to make, and not for
the courts.  Many statutes also prescribe or at 
least presuppose the practical execution of 
policy decisions: a convenient description of 
this is to say that in addition to the area of
policy or discretion, there is an operational area.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[13] It is instructive to examine how Wilson J. applied these
principles in Kamloops. She first examined the statute that
authorized the city council to regulate construction (the
Municipal Act of British Columbia), and found that it stated that
the council &#147;may&#148; regulate construction and require building
permits.  The council decided to exercise its regulatory power
and passed a by-law that prohibited construction without a
building permit, provided for inspection at various stages of
construction, prohibited occupancy without an occupancy permit
and imposed on the building inspector the duty to enforce its
provisions.  According to Wilson J., this meant that the city was
acting in its operational sphere, as opposed to its policy
sphere, when it allowed the house to be built because its policy
or discretionary decision was exercised when the council decided
to use the B.C. legislature&#146;s grant of authority to regulate
construction.  When the city failed to respond to its building
inspector, it was then acting in the operational sphere or, in
other words, in the implementation of its earlier higher-level
policy decision to regulate.  In discharging this operational
duty, the city was under a duty of care to the plaintiffs and
could therefore be held liable in negligence.
[14] The Supreme Court&#146;s latest applications of Kamloops have
greatly assisted in clarifying the test.  In Ryan v. Victoria
(City) (1999), 168 D.L.R. (4th) 513 (S.C.C.), the Court was
dealing with the effect of statutory authority on the civil
liability of railways.  Major J., speaking for the Court stated
(at p.524) that the duty of care owed by a railway with respect
to public crossings is determined, as it is for other private and
public actors, under the two-step test in Anns as adopted by the
Court in Kamloops &#147;and numerous subsequent decisions&#148;.  He then
stated that the first step of the Anns/Kamloops test presented a
relatively low threshold, namely whether a relationship of
Sproximity&#148; existed between the parties such that it was
reasonably foreseeable that a careless act by the railway could
result in injury to the plaintiff.
[15] The second step is an analysis of the duty of care
established in the first step to determine if any factors exist,
such as statutory or judicial impediments, which should eliminate
or limit the duty found under the first branch of the test.  As
Major J. stated at p.525:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The existence of a duty of care must be considered in 
light of all relevant circumstances, including any 
applicable statutes or regulations.  Thus a 
legislative exemption from liability can negate a 
duty of care in circumstances where that duty would
otherwise arise.  The same holds true for immunities 
created by the courts.  A policy decision is made in 
such cases to prevent the law of negligence from 
regulating certain relationships or relieving certain 
injuries, notwithstanding a finding of proximity 
between the parties. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[16] In the most recent case of Ingles v. Tutkaluk Construction
Ltd., 2000 SCC 12, Bastarache J. for the Supreme Court of Canada
(at para. 16) stated that the Court affirmed in Ryan v. Victoria
(City) that the two-part Anns/Kamloops test is the appropriate
test for determining whether a private or public actor owes a
duty of care such that the law can impose on the public authority
a private law liability in a civil suit for breach of that duty.
In Ingles, a municipality had been sued for negligent inspection
of buildings.  Bastarache J. found sufficient proximity and then,
because he was dealing with an inspection scheme, went on to
examine the statute to find whether the scheme represented a
policy decision or the implementation of a policy decision at the
operational level.  He found it to be the latter and therefore
found that the municipality owed a duty of care.
[17] Accordingly, the Anns/Kamloops analysis calls for two
findings: (1) proximity and (2) an absence of factors such as
statutory or judicial immunity which would negative or limit
liability.  The motions judge in appeal found that there was a
judicial immunity to suit in negligence against the Law Society
and this holding was central to the argument in appeal.  However,
it may well be that proximity is a live issue as well because the
appellants in this case do not appear to have been involved with
Mills in a traditional lawyer-client relationship, but rather
dealt with him as part of an investment scheme.  Although the
plaintiffs plead at para. 33 of their statement of claim that
they are owed a duty of care &#147;as clients of a member of the Law
Society&#148;, as I earlier indicated, I do not think that the facts
as pleaded bear out the casting of the relationship in that
light.  Mills served as the repository and trustee of their
money, but does not appear to have acted as a solicitor in
dispensing legal advice.  This, to my mind, weakens any claim
that the plaintiffs may have because it seems reasonable to argue
that, at the very least, the Law Society should not serve as the
insurer for every person that is swindled by a lawyer in any
fashion.  However, assuming proximity exists, there are good
reasons to negate a duty of care in the circumstances of this
case.</pre>
    <pre><em>Judicial Immunity for the Discipline Process</em></pre>
    <pre>[18] The provisions of the Law Society Act and the regulations
passed thereunder confer upon the Law Society the power to
regulate the profession in the public interest: see Re Klein and
Law Society of Upper Canada, (1985), 50 O.R. (2d) 118 (Div. Ct.)
where in dissent  (but not on this point) Henry J. stated, at
p.132:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Whatever the original position of the Law Society, 
the contemporary enactment of the Law Society Act 
brought the Society into the public domain by 
conferring on it the authority to regulate the 
profession.  The statute does not confer rights; it
confers powers (and corresponding duties) to 
regulate the profession in the public interest. Its 
powers to make regulations are the delegation of 
legislative authority which is subject to the 
approval of the Lieutenant-Governor in Council. Its 
disciplinary powers are subject to the procedural 
safeguards in the Statutory Powers Procedure Act, 
R.S.O 1980, c.484.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] The power to regulate includes the power to discipline
members of the Society.  The discipline process and the hearings
that may flow from them are presently subject to the Law Society
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8; Regulation 708, R.R.O. 1990; and the
Statutory Powers Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.22.  While
there have been some changes in the Law Society Act and its
regulations from the dates that are material to this action, I do
not regard them as having any significance to the issues that
this court has to decide.
[20] The provisions relating to discipline are very detailed and
provide for procedural fairness at both the investigative stage
and at any hearings following the filing of a complaint under
oath in the office of the Secretary. The nature of these
proceedings is described by Hockin J. in Lalonde v. Law Society
of Upper Canada (1998), 27 C.P.C. (4th) 196 (Ont. Gen. Div.) in
the following language: &#147;[t]he ability of the Law Society to
investigate and discipline its members is a judicial power since
it consists of the independent and impartial application of
predetermined rules and standards.&#148; (at para.24)  This finding
follows an established body of case law that the disciplinary
proceedings of the Law Societies of Canada are judicial or at
least quasi-judicial in nature and that, in relation to them, the
Law Society is immune from negligence suits.
[21] The Supreme Court held in Harris v. Law Society of Alberta,
[1936] 1 D.L.R. 401, that a statutory professional body (i.e.,
the Law Society) could not be liable for damages for wrongful
disbarment because the investigative and decision-making function
was &#147;not merely ministerial, but discretionary and judicial&#148; (at
p.414).  The only claim for damages that could be made would be
one based on bad faith or malice.
[22] The leading Ontario case for this proposition is French v.
Law Society of Upper Canada (1976), 9 O.R.(2d) 473 (C.A.), in
which this court held at pp.476-77:
          </pre>
    <pre>            We are all satisfied that the acts of the
	  Society&#146;s functionaries, complained of as
	  being tainted with negligence, were part of
	  the performance of a quasi-judicial function
	  of the respondent Society.  As Chief Justice
	  Laskin said in  his dissenting judgment: 
	  [(1974), 49 D.L.R. (3d) 1 at 6]</pre>
    <pre>               That the Discipline Committee in the
               exercise of its statutory function was an
               adjudicative body is clear from the governing
               statute.  Equally apparent from that statute
               is that Convocation was engaged in a judicial
               exercise in its consideration of the report,
               findings and recommendations of the
               Discipline Committee.          </pre>
    <pre>            The investigative function of the Law Society
	  and the preparation and swearing of the
	  complaints against the appellant solicitor were
	  discretionary and quasi-judicial acts pursuant
	  to a statutory duty and called for the exercise
	  of discretion and judgment on the part of the
 	  officials concerned.</pre>
    <pre>[23] This case was applied by Cromarty J. in Voratovic v. Law
Society of Upper Canada (1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 214 (H.C.J.), where
Voratovic had sued the Law Society for mental anguish arising out
of the Law Society&#146;s decision to take no steps beyond
investigating another lawyer (against whom Voratovic had filed a
complaint with the Law Society).  After citing French, Cromarty
J. held at p.217:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In the case at bar the Secretary in investigating
Voratovic&#146;s complaint and in deciding not to take 
further proceedings, was exercising a quasi-judicial 
discretion.  The Law Society is not liable for the 
erroneous exercise of its discretion so long as it 
acted bona fide and without malice; it could not be 
sued for negligence.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[24] A similar argument was accepted in Calvert v. Law Society of
Upper Canada (1981), 32 O.R. (2d) 176 (H.C.J.), in which the
plaintiffs brought suit against the Law Society for negligence in
permitting their lawyer to practice law.  The clients had
entrusted money to their lawyer, and he had fraudulently not
repaid them in full.  The claim against the Law Society was based
on the fact that the lawyer was admitted to the bar despite
allegations of impropriety, and that the Law Society failed to
investigate further allegations of impropriety after the lawyer
was called to the bar.  Steele J. allowed the Law Society&#146;s
motion to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no
reasonable cause of action.  In assessing the claim, Steele J.
stated the following, at p.182:          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It may be that there is a duty owed to the plaintiffs 
by the Law Society for its negligence in not properly 
undertaking its function of investigating complaints 
and making a decision or in failing to exercise such 
duty to the public and to these plaintiffs in a bona 
fide manner: Anns [citation omitted]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[25] Steele J. went on, however, to agree with the statement in
Voratovic that liability would only attach to acts done by the
Law Society in bad faith rather than merely negligent acts and he
dismissed the claim because no bad faith was alleged. While it
does pre-date Kamloops, this case specifically considered and
rejected the idea that the principles in Anns changed the common
law rule as to the Law Society&#146;s immunity from suit. It stands
for the proposition that the principles in that case do not open
the Law Society to liability for mere negligence arising out of
its investigative function.
[26] It is also important to note that immunity to civil suit is
codified in s.9 of the Law Society Act. While it applies only to
actions against officials of the Society and not the Law Society
itself, the Legislature is presumed to know the law and must be
taken to have recognized that the Society itself has been
traditionally immunized from civil actions by the common law.
Section 9 reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>9.   No action or other proceedings for damages 
shall be instituted against the Treasurer or 
any bencher, official of the Society or person 
appointed in Convocation for any act done in
good faith in the performance or intended 
performance of any duty or in the exercise or 
in the intended exercise of any power under this 
Act, a regulation or a rule, or for any neglect 
or default in the performance or exercise in good 
faith of any such duty or power.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27] It would be easy to dismiss the above authorities as being
pre-Kamloops and, therefore, out of date, but this line of cases
has been applied up to nearly the present day.  In Lee v. Law
Society of Upper Canada, [1994] O.J. No. 1468 (Gen. Div.), for
example, Chilcott J. held that &#147;in the absence of bad faith or
malice, the Law Society of Upper Canada cannot be sued for the
negligent exercise of an investigation into the conduct of a
solicitor.&#148;  This decision did not mention Kamloops.
[28] In Lalonde v. Law Society of Upper Canada, supra, Lalonde
was Hastings&#146; client in relation to a sale of real estate, and
had instructed Hastings to keep the net proceeds of the sale in
Hastings&#146; trust account.  When Lalonde requested the funds,
Hastings did not have them.  When Lalonde discovered that
Hastings had been the subject of an ongoing Law Society
investigation arising out of previous fraud charges, he brought
suit against the Law Society claiming that it failed to exercise
its duty to warn him about Hastings.  The argument before Hockin
J. on behalf of Lalonde was made on the basis that the Law
Society was so grossly negligent that the negligence amounted to
bad faith.  Hockin J. found that the Law Society had exercised
its discretion correctly in this case and that there was no
evidence of a lack of good faith.  He therefore dismissed the
claim as providing no genuine issue for trial.  Hockin J. did
cite both French and Voratovic, but he did not mention Kamloops.
[29] This same analysis in which the distinction is made between
quasi-judicial functions and operational or administrative ones
has been made by the Supreme Court of Canada with respect to
other public bodies.  In Welbridge Holdings Ltd. v. Greater
Winnipeg (1970), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 470 at 478 (S.C.C.), Laskin J.
held that a municipality could be liable in tort or contract
(including in negligence) when it exercised its administrative or
ministerial powers, but not when it exercised legislative or
quasi-judicial powers.  In this case, the municipality was
rehearing a zoning application.  Speaking for the Court, Laskin
J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          A municipality at what may be called the
	  operating level is different in kind from
	  the same municipality at the legislative or
	  quasi-judicial level, where it is exercising
	  discretionary statutory authority.  In
	  exercising such authority, a municipality
	  (no less than a provincial Legislature or the
          Parliament of Canada) may act beyond its
	  powers in the ultimate view of a Court, albeit
	  it acted on the advice of counsel.  It would
	  be incredible to say in such circumstances that
	  it owed a duty of care giving rise to liability
	  in damages for its breach.&#133;
                                </pre>
    <pre>                              . . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                Moreover, even if the quasi-judicial
          function be taken in isolation, I cannot
          agree that the defendant in holding a public
          hearing as required by statute comes under a
          private tort duty, in bringing it on and in
          carrying it to a conclusion, to use due care
          to see that the dictates of natural justice
          are observed.  Its failure in this respect
          may make its ultimate decision vulnerable,
          but no right to damages for negligence flows
          to any adversely affected person, albeit
          private property values are diminished or
          expense is incurred without recoverable
          benefit.</pre>
    <pre>[30] This jurisprudence clearly establishes a judicial immunity
from negligence for the Law Society&#146;s discipline process,
including the investigative function at the front end.  The Law
Society&#146;s disciplinary powers must respond to its statutory
mandate and the requirements of due process, not to a private law
duty of care.  In the case in appeal, the status of the
appellants in the disciplinary process is not at all clear.  The
lis is between the Law Society and the solicitor whose conduct is
called into question. The concern of the courts is that the
member be treated fairly in a judicial setting.  There is no role
for the appellants.  We do not even know when they became aware
of the complaint.  The notion that they have some stake in the
investigation of the specific complaint and that the Law Society
was obliged to keep their interests in mind in dealing with Mills
is foreign to the judicial process.  The Law Society should not
feel obliged to press forward with a prosecution to protect the
appellants and others, rather, its concern should be to ensure
fairness to Mills in the investigative process and natural
justice in any hearing that became necessary.</pre>
    <pre><em>The Operational /Policy Dichotomy</em></pre>
    <pre>[31] However, as I understand the focus of the complaint of the
appellants, it relates not to the hearing process, which is
clearly quasi-judicial if not judicial, but to the conduct of the
Secretary in not following through on the complaint received by
the Law Society. It is asserted that since Kamloops, the
Secretary cannot shelter under s.9 of the Law Society Act, supra,
or find protection in the language of French, supra, as a
&#147;functionary&#148; whose acts &#147;were part of the performance of a quasi-
judicial function of the respondent Society&#148;. It is said that the
Secretary had a discretion (as a matter of policy) whether to
commence an investigation, but once he started it, no matter how
limited its scope, he had no discretion to discontinue it.  He
was now in an operational, rather than a policy, area.
[32] The difficulty with this approach is illustrated by one of
the specific acts of negligence alleged against the Secretary.
It is said that a properly conducted investigation at his level
would have included an ex parte application to a judge of the
Superior Court of Justice under s. 42(1) of the Law Society Act
(as it then was) for an order freezing the Palmer Mills trust
account, thereby avoiding at least future harm.  But, before he
can undertake such a significant interference with a member&#146;s
practice, the Secretary must meet the requirement of s.42(1) that
he have &#147;reasonable cause to believe that [the]  member has been
or may be guilty of misconduct in connection with any property in
the member&#146;s possession or under the member&#146;s control&#148;.
[33] I find troublesome the concept that Anns/Kamloops requires
the court to disassociate the functions of the Secretary in the
discipline area from that of the Benchers who conduct the
hearings.  If Convocation has judicial immunity to a civil suit
in negligence, I do not see how an Anns/Kamloops analysis can
ignore the statutory immunity provided by s. 9 of the Law Society
Act to the Society&#146;s employees who are charged with the
responsibility of investigating and processing the complaints
that end up in the discipline arena.   In the case of the
Secretary, his functions in this area are circumscribed by s.
9(1) of Reg. 573, supra, and he is protected under s.9 of the Act
&#147;for any act done in good faith in the performance or intended
performance of any duty or in the exercise or intended exercise
of any power under this Act, a regulation or a rule. . .&#148;. Under
s. 9(1) of the regulation, where information is brought to the
attention of the Secretary that a member of the Society has
committed misconduct, the Secretary &#147;shall make such preliminary
investigation of the matter as he considers proper&#148; and he shall
only refer the matter to the Discipline Committee where &#147;in his
opinion there are reasonable grounds for so doing&#148;.  The next
step is under s.9(2) where the Secretary is instructed by the
Chairman of the Committee to prepare a complaint under oath and
serve it on the member under investigation.  This triggers the
full panoply of protection for the member against whom an
allegation of impropriety has been made to ensure that he will be
dealt with fairly.
[34] While arguably a careless investigation leading to a failure
to seek a freeze order is not aptly described as a quasi-judicial
act requiring insulation from a duty of care to the public, I am
reluctant to accept the notion that this elaborate procedure
preceding the formal institution of a complaint is &#147;operational&#148;
as opposed to &#147;discretionary&#148;, within the meaning of Kamloops.
The Secretary is dealing with an investigation that impacts on
the reputation and livelihood of a member of an honourable
profession, not the pocket books of municipalities where damages
are allegedly arising out of some problem in the inspection and
maintenance of highways: see Just v. British Columbia (1989), 64
D.L.R. (4th) 689 (S.C.C.).  Even &#147;an invitation to attend&#148; for
what are described in s.10 of the regulations as &#147;a minor breach
of discipline&#148; requires a preliminary investigation by the
Secretary.  The appellants made much of the power of the
Discipline Committee to require an investigation to be made of
the books and records of a member under s.18(1) of Reg. 573 but
they omitted reference to s.18(2) which requires &#147;prima facie
evidence that a ground of complaint exists&#148; before such power can
be exercised.
[35] The problem of the limits that policy can impose on a duty
of care was addressed in a slightly different context by the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in Cooper v. British Columbia
(Registrar of Mortgage Brokers), [2000] B.C.J. No. 426 (C.A.)
reversing the Chambers judge below ((1999), B.C.L.R. (3d) 274).1
The question in that case was whether the Registrar owed a
private law duty of care to members of the investing public for
alleged negligence in failing to properly oversee the conduct of
an investment company licensed by the regulator.  The court found
that no such duty existed because there was not a sufficiently
proximate relationship between the Registrar and investors and,
even if there was, policy concerns dictated that the Registrar
should not be subject to indeterminate liability.  The following
passage from the reasons of Newbury J.A. for the majority of the
court (at para. 53) is instructive.  Having stated that the
statutory scheme constituting the Mortgage Brokers Act and
Regulations thereto did not create a private law duty but seeks
to improve and maintain the standard of offering in the market
generally, she then stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>If it were otherwise, the potential liability would 
be virtually indeterminate, given that the Act 
imposed no limitation on, and the Registrar had no 
means of controlling, the number of persons who 
would invest or lend money via a mortgage broker or
the amount of money that could be advanced.  The 
defendants would effectively become guarantors of 
the losses of an indeterminate class of persons for 
an indeterminate amount.  It simply cannot be, in 
my view, a &#147;matter of simple justice&#148; [citation 
omitted] that investors should be entitled to look 
to the Province to make good risks which they 
undertook voluntarily and without relying in any 
real sense on a regulator who did not control the 
day-to-day activities of the broker.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[36] This reference by Newbury J.A. to &#147;an indeterminate class of
persons for an indeterminate amount&#148; is taken from the language
of La Forest J. in Hercules Management Ltd. v.  Ernst &amp; Young,
[1997] 2 S.C.R. 165.  Here, La Forest J., for the Court, applied
the two-part Anns/Kamloops test to determine the liability of
accountants who had audited financial statements for a company
that were relied on by the plaintiffs in deciding to invest in
the company.  He first found that there was a prima facie duty of
care owed by the accounting firm to shareholders of two corporate
clients arising out of the corporate audit and then applied a
policy consideration to negate that duty of care. That policy
consideration centred on the possibility that the accounting firm
might be exposed to a &#147;liability of indeterminate amount for an
indeterminate time to an indeterminate class&#148;.
[37] Returning to Cooper, supra, I find that the reasoning of
Huddart J.A. in her concurring opinion is applicable to this
appeal. She follows on the comments of Newbury J.A. regarding the
responsibilities of the Registrar and states (at para. 62):
          </pre>
    <pre>          These responsibilities require him to make
          difficult discretionary decisions in the
          public interest, some of which are suggested
          by Madam Justice Newbury in her reasons.  The
          public interest is not synonymous with the
          interest of investors.  The very nature of
          the marketplace the Registrar is given some
          power to regulate requires his decisions to
          be multi-factorial.</pre>
    <pre>[38] In Cooper, the respondent had submitted in its factum that
the Registrar had a duty of care in language that is quite
similar to that used by the appellant in this case:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Despite owing a duty to persons such as the
          plaintiff, Hobart [the Registrar] did not
          take steps to properly investigate Eron [an
          investment company] and its principals or
          warn the public about Eron and its
          principals.</pre>
    <pre>[39] The response of Huddart J.A. is as follows (at paras. 65 and
72):
          </pre>
    <pre>          It is well to recall that the wisdom or
          reasonableness of the exercise of a statutory
          discretion by an officeholder with
          regulatory, quasi-judicial powers has not
          traditionally been considered to be a
          justiciable question.  In appropriate
          circumstances a superior court might issue a
          prerogative writ to such an officeholder in
          the exercise of its supervisory power, or
          more recently, an order under the Judicial
          Review Procedure Act, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 241,
          to ensure legality and fairness.  If an
          office was exercised for an improper purpose,
          the court would intervene in an action for
          abuse of office, as that concept was
          explained by various members of the Supreme
          Court of Canada in Roncarelli v. Duplessis,
          [1959] S.C.R. 121.  Otherwise an officeholder
          answered only to the Crown who could deprive
          him of his office, at pleasure until
          recently:  Wells v. Newfoundland (1999), 177
          D.L.R. (4th) 73 (S.C.C.).</pre>
    <pre>                                &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The courts should not view the private
          duty of care as floating above such an
          officeholder, to be crystallized whenever
          harm comes to an individual that might have
          been prevented had the officeholder exercised
          a discretion differently.  If that were so,
          the courts would be using the remedy of tort
          law to exercise the discretion itself rather
          than supervising its exercise, since some
          individual interest will almost certainly be
          harmed.</pre>
    <pre>[40] Following on from the above remarks of Huddart J.A., it
seems to me that there are very sound policy reasons for not
burdening this judicial or quasi-judicial process with a private
law duty of care.  The public is well-served by refusing to
fetter the investigative powers of the Law Society with the fear
of civil liability.  The invocation by the plaintiffs of the
&#147;public interest&#148; role of the Law Society seems to be
misconceived as it actually works to undermine their argument.
This &#147;public interest&#148; role was stressed by both Henry J. for the
minority in Klein, supra, and Callaghan J. for the majority (at
p.157).  As I earlier indicated, the Law Society cannot meet this
obligation if it is required to act according to a private law
duty of care to specific individuals such as the appellants.  The
private law duty of care cannot stand alongside the Law Society&#146;s
statutory mandate and hence cannot be given effect to.  In my
opinion, the motions judge in the case in appeal accurately
stated the policy considerations for this immunity to suit as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>A body charged with the exercise of quasi-judicial 
powers must act in the public interest and must take 
into account a number of factors, only one of which 
will be the private interest of individuals such as 
the plaintiff.  The threat of a suit for damages by 
a disgruntled individual would not leave the body 
free to exercise its discretion in the manner it 
considers to comport with the broader public interest.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[41] A lack of bona fides on the part of the Law Society has not
been pleaded in the case in appeal.  The above passage reinforces
the conventional proposition that the appellants would have to
plead a total misuse of the Law Society&#146;s discretion to follow up
on the complaint it received amounting to bad faith before being
able to claim damages against the Law Society for its failure to
shut down the operations of its member Mills.  That leads to the
conclusion that this claim, which neither explicitly nor
implicitly pleads bad faith, does not disclose a cause of action.</pre>
    <pre><em>Conclusion</em></pre>
    <pre>[42] The Anns/Kamloops formulation, in my view, does not purport
to impose an overarching private law duty of care on public
bodies.  It simply propounds a two step test to determine if the
statute creating or controlling the public body permits a finding
that there is a private law duty of care.  The first step is to
determine proximity and the second is to determine if the duty of
care created by that proximity has been restricted by statute or
judicial exemption or should be restricted for other reasons.  I
think it is very clear that judicial or quasi-judicial functions
are subject to judicial exemption. The suggestion that the second
part of the test is restricted to breaking down the functions of
the public body into policy and operational spheres to determine
if a given action is discretionary or not is overly simplistic.
It is clear from Kamloops and the cases in the Supreme Court of
Canada that have followed, that whether the function is
operational or not, it may still be discretionary and as such
negate any private law duty of care.
[43] Over and above all the legal arguments that I have touched
on above, I am very reluctant to impose an exposure to civil suit
for negligence upon a regulatory body that is acting in good
faith and within its statutory parameters.  While we are only
concerned in this case with the disciplinary function of the Law
Society, the Law Society Act and the Regulations enacted
thereunder authorizes a far broader mandate.  The Law Society is
responsible for the admission standards of the profession, the
continuing education of its members, and the formulation and
enforcement of a code of professional ethics. It protects the
public generally by continuing to maintain a Compensation Fund to
relieve or mitigate loss sustained by any person in consequence
of dishonesty on behalf of a member. It has established
arrangements for its members respecting indemnity for
professional liability including prescribing levies for the
payment of the premiums thereof. The Society is governed by
members of the profession elected at large and by lay members
appointed by the government of Ontario.  In the exercise of its
powers it is subject to the Statutory Powers Procedure Act,
supra, and the Judicial Review Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990 c. J.1.
[44] In all of its activities, the Law Society&#146;s decision making
process is multi-factorial, to borrow the phrase of Huddart J.A.
in Cooper, supra, and it is an inappropriate exercise to attempt
to isolate individual initiatives and categorize them as policy
or operational. Almost all of them will have elements of both, as
Kamloops acknowledges.  For example, and utilizing the example of
Lord Wilberforce in Anns, the Secretary in our situation must
determine how far to take an investigation and this involves an
implicit decision as to allotment of the Law Society&#146;s time and
money.  More important, the activities of the Secretary and the
Chair and vice-Chair of the Discipline Committee and the Benchers
in Convocation involve the quasi-judicial element of
investigating and adjudicating the actions of an individual for
breach of standards of conduct.  This is done in the context of a
self-governing profession and has unique considerations that
simply do not arise in, for example, carrying out the tasks of
physically maintaining roads and highways or inspecting
buildings: see Just and Ingles, supra.
[45] In my opinion, the best way in which the Law Society can
serve the public in carrying out its mandate to govern the
profession in the public interest is to deal fairly and
appropriately with its member lawyers.  In other words, the
public interest is served by the proper carrying out of its role
in disciplining and governing the profession.  As is inherent in
any judicial hearing, the issue is between the Law Society and
one of its members to determine if that member has violated the
rules of the Law Society.  The outcome of the judicial process is
the product of many considerations, making it quite unlike the
decision to put up a guardrail on a mountain road.  It is
adjudication by the member&#146;s peer group.  If the Law Society
fails to carry out its duty to conduct its investigation and
hearings properly, this failure may make its ultimate decision
against Mills vulnerable to attack by Mills, but it does not
expose the Law Society to a suit for damages in negligence: see
Welbridge Holdings, supra.  The appellants have no right to
expect as a matter of law that the complaint on behalf of two
strangers to them would have produced a given result which, if
timely, would have alerted them to re-examine their relationship
with Mills.
[46] Finally, the appellants argue that the Law Society cases
referred to above should be revisited in the light of Kamloops
and that this proposition is at least novel enough to take them
past the pleadings stage.  Counsel appears to be of the view that
cases involving the liability of Law Societies across Canada are
out of step with a more modern concept of the duty of care that
the Societies hold to the public generally.  However, as the
motions judge observed, the courts have consistently applied the
same standard to other professional organizations where they are
dealing with internal disciplinary processes: see Schilling v.
Certified General Accountants Assn. of British Columbia (1996),
135 D.L.R. (4th) 669 (B.C.C.A.); application for leave to appeal
dismissed [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 397 and Harrison v. Camgoz (1996),
7 C.P.C. (4th) 331 (Sask. Q.B.).  The duty of care to the public
is accepted in these cases, but the quasi-judicial nature of the
investigative/disciplinary function creates immunity to suits in
civil negligence.</pre>
    <pre><em>Disposition</em></pre>
    <pre>[47] The motions judge accepted that the test to be applied on a
Rule 21 motion is whether it is plain and obvious or beyond
reasonable doubt that the Statement of Claim disclosed no
reasonable cause of action: see R. D. Belanger &amp; Associates Ltd.
v. Stadium Corp. Ltd. (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 778 (Ont. C.A.); Hunt
v. Carey Canada Inc., (1990), 74 D.L.R. (4th) 321 (S.C.C.).  For
the reasons stated above, I agree with his decision that the
Statement of Claim in this case disclosed no reasonable cause of
action against the Law Society.  The investigative and
disciplinary functions of the Law Society are inherently judicial
or at least quasi-judicial and, absent an allegation of bad faith
or malice, do not expose the Law Society to liability for
negligence. Accordingly I would dismiss this appeal.</pre>
    <pre><em>Costs</em></pre>
    <pre>[48] The trial judge addressed the cost issue at length after
inviting and receiving submissions on the subject.  As it affects
this appeal, he ordered costs against the appellants payable to
the Law Society on a party and party basis.  Included among those
who made submissions was The Law Foundation of Ontario, a
corporation created and governed by the Law Society Act Amendment
Act (Class Proceedings Funding), 1992, S.O. 1992 c.7 (ss.59.1-
59.5).  One of the objects of the Law Foundation is to provide
costs assistance to parties to class proceedings and to
proceedings commenced under the Class Proceedings Act, 1992 to be
financed from a Class Proceedings Fund.  In this case, the
Plaintiffs/Appellants received the necessary approval from the
Class Proceedings Committee and hence support from the Class
Proceedings Fund.  This not only allows funding in the discretion
of the Committee to the Plaintiffs/Appellants to support the
class action suit, it makes the Law Foundation liable to pay a
costs award made to a successful defendant against the plaintiff
in the class proceedings.   In the result, the Law Foundation is
liable to pay the costs awarded by the trial judge in dismissing
the action against the Law Society.  The Law Foundation has
intervened in this appeal to support the appellants&#146; position
that no costs should have been awarded below.  In the event that
this court was to dismiss the appeal, it asks that the same
submissions be applicable to an award of costs in this court.
[49] Costs, of course, are in the discretion of the court
awarding them &#147;and the court may determine by whom and to what
extent the costs shall be paid&#148;: see s.131(1) of the Courts of
Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.43, as amended and rule 57 of the
Rules of Civil Procedure.  Additionally, and most relevant to
these proceedings, is s.31(1) of the Class Proceedings Act.  It
states:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In exercising its discretion with respect to costs 
under subsection 131(1) of the Courts of Justice Act, 
the court may consider whether the class proceeding 
was a test case, raised a novel point of law or 
involved a matter of public interest.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[50] The trial judge gave careful reasons as to why he would not
give relief to the appellants under any of these three heads.  I
can see no error in principle in his treatment of these criteria
or in the exercise of his overall discretion.  I would add that
this is far from a test case or one that is in the public
interest.  The class represents a limited number of persons who
allege that some gold merchants scammed them with the assistance
of a particular lawyer who is alleged to have been dishonest.  It
is a stand-alone action and has no public interest dimension.  As
it affects the Law Society, it is in the nature of a fishing
expedition.  The appellants require the assistance of the
discovery process to determine what happened after the Secretary
received the letter of complaint in question.
[51] The trial judge was correct, also, in holding that the case
did not raise a novel point of law.  Stripped to its essentials,
the appellants are asking the court to over rule an established
line of authority reaching to the Supreme Court of Canada
declaring, absent a showing of bad faith, that the Law Society is
immune from civil suits for damages.  The Anns/Kamloops vehicle
the appellants chose for this purpose excludes statutory and
judicial immunity from its analysis. The appellants are threshing
old straw.
[52] An additional argument was raised before the trial judge but
not, as I recall, in this court.  The trial judge was asked by
the Law Foundation to consider the effect of what would be a
substantial cost award on the viability of the Class Proceedings
Fund.  In my opinion, the trial judge was correct in following
what was said by Winkler J. in Garland v. Commercial Gas Co.,
(1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 767 at 772 to the effect that this was a
consideration for the Committee recommending funding, not one for
the court in deciding to award costs to an otherwise deserving
defendant.
[53] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appellants&#146; appeal against
the cost award of the trial judge.  In this court, costs should
simply follow the event and be payable by the appellants to the
respondent Law Society on a party and party basis.

    <pre>_______________________________
1 The appellate judgment was released following the argument in
this court.  Counsel for the appellants had relied upon the
judgment in the lower court but largely in support of the
proposition that the issue of whether a duty of care should be
limited by policy considerations is best left to the trial judge.</pre></td>
