    <pre><strong>On appeal from the Order of Sharpe J. dated March 11, 1998, 39
O.R. (3d) 10 (Gen. Div.) and the further Order of Sharpe J. dated
December 3, 1998 with respect to costs.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>GOUDGE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  In this action, the appellants seek to recover for the
losses they say they suffered investing in a scheme for the
purchase of gold delivery contracts. They intend that this be a
class action on behalf of all investors in the scheme. To date,
although the pleadings are complete, there has as yet been no
certification motion.
[2]  The respondents Beverly Hoover and James Mills are the
executors of the deceased solicitor John Mills. The appellants
plead a solicitor-client relationship with John Mills. They
allege inter alia that the funds they invested were placed
originally in his trust account and then paid out by him
fraudulently and in breach of trust for the benefit of himself
and others.
[3]  This action was commenced on February 18, 1994, more than
two years after the death of John Mills on May 21, 1990.
[4]  Pursuant to Rule 21, the executors moved before Sharpe J.
for an order that as against them, the action is barred by the
two-year limitation period in s.38(3) of the Trustee Act, R.S.O.
1990, c.T.23.
[5]  They also moved, pursuant to Rules 20 and 21, for a
determination of a question of law, namely, that the action
should be dismissed as against them on the ground of plene
administravit.
[6]  Sharpe J. found that to the extent this action falls within
the saving provisions of ss.43 and 44 of the Limitations Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c.L.15, it is not barred by the limitation period in
s.38(3) of the Trustee Act. However, he found that apart from
some $7,138 in cash, the only remaining asset available to the
estate of Mr. Mills, namely his entitlement to professional
liability insurance, did not provide coverage for fraud and hence
was unavailable to respond to the claims that were saved by the
Limitations Act. He therefore applied the doctrine of plene
administravit to dismiss the action as against the executors,
except for the claim for $7,138, because to the extent that the
action was not time barred, the estate was without assets.
[7]  For the reasons that follow, I agree with Sharpe J. that so
far as this action is saved by ss. 43 and 44 of the Limitations
Act, it is not statute barred, although I do so for somewhat
different reasons. However, I do not think the doctrine of plene
administravit can be applied at this early stage of the
proceedings. On this basis, I would therefore allow the appeal
and permit the action against the respondents to proceed.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE LIMITATION ISSUE</strong></pre>
    <pre>[8]  Two statutes are relevant to this question. The first is the
Trustee Act. Subsection 38(2) of that Act entitles the appellants
to maintain an action against the respondents as executors for
the wrong done by the deceased solicitor. Subsection 38(3)
provides a two-year limitation period for actions brought under
s.38(2). These provisions read as follows:</pre>
    <pre>	        38.(2) Except in cases of libel and slander, if a
        deceased person committed or is by law liable for a wrong 
	to another in respect of his or her person or to another 
	person&#146;s property, the person wronged may maintain an action 
	against the executor or administrator of the person who 
	committed or is by law liable for the wrong.</pre>
    <pre>                (3)  An action under this section shall not be 
	brought after the expiration of two years from the death 
	of the deceased.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The second is the Limitations Act, particularly ss.43 and
44. These provisions are relevant to the claim founded on the
conduct of the deceased solicitor as trustee. They read in part
as follows:</pre>
    <pre>	        43(2)  In an action against a trustee or a 
	person claiming through a trustee, except where the claim 
	is founded upon a fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to 
	which the trustee was party or privy, or is to recover 
	trust property or the proceeds thereof, still retained by 
	the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and 
	converted to the trustee&#146;s use, the following paragraphs 
	apply:
          </pre>
    <pre>         1.   All rights and privileges conferred by any 
              statute of limitations shall be enjoyed in the 
	      like manner and to the like extent as they would 
 	      have been enjoyed in such action if the trustee 
	      or person claiming through the trustee had not 
	      been a trustee or person claiming through a trustee.</pre>
    <pre>                               . . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                44(2)  Subject to section 43, no claim of the 
	beneficiary of a trust against the trustee for any 
	property held on an express trust, or in respect of 
	any breach of such trust, shall be held to be barred  
	by any statute of limitations.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Sharpe J. applied the guide to interpretation provided in
Murphy v. Welsh; Stoddard v. Watson, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 1069 and
concluded as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>By expressly stating in s.44 [of the Limitations Act] 
that certain claims are not to be barred by any 
statute of limitations, the  legislature has given a 
clear and explicit direction that this specific 
saving provision is to prevail over all other 
statutory limitation provisions. Murphy v. Welsh;
Stoddard v. Watson holds that there is a presumption 
of coherence and that findings of inconsistency should 
be avoided unless the competing provisions cannot 
stand together. In my view, s.38(3) of the Trustee 
Act can stand together with ss. 43 and 44 of the
Limitations Act. The two year limitation provision 
prescribed by s.38(3) applies generally to actions 
against executors for wrongs committed by the deceased, 
while the explicit saving provision of ss.43 and 44 of 
the Limitations Act applies to claims falling within 
the specific description of those sections [emphasis in
original].</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[11] I fully agree.
[12] Like Sharpe J., I would distinguish the cases relied on by
the respondents, namely  Swain Lake Estate v. Lake of the Woods
District Hospital (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 74 (C.A.) and Smith Estate
v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (1998), 41 O.R.
(3d) 481 (C.A.). In those cases the two-year limitation period
was found to apply to claims brought by executors. However, in
neither case was this court faced with s. 44(2) of the
Limitations Act and its clear legislative intent that in
specified kinds of claims against trustees, there should be no
statutory limitation period at all.
[13] The legislative intent of s.44(2) of the Limitations Act is
to free actions against trustees from all statutory limitation
periods where they fall within the kinds of action specified in
s.43(2) of that Act. That intent would be frustrated if the death
of the trustee triggered the limitation period in s.38(3) of the
Trustee Act. Hence the types of claims against a trustee
specified in s.43(2) may be maintained against his or her
executors under s. 38(2) of the Trustee Act, unaffected by the
two-year limitation period in s.38(3) of the Trustee Act.
[14] Thus, to the extent the appellants&#146; action does not fit
within the specified exceptions in s.43(2), it is out of time
because s.43(2)(1) combined with s.38(3) of the Trustee Act
imposes a two-year limitation period. Because s.44(2) is made
subject to section 43, the relief from all statutory limitation
periods provided by that section is unavailable, and the two-year
limitation period applies.
[15] Moreover, Sharpe J. found that there is no basis shown here
for the application of the discoverability principle to alleviate
this two-year proscription period, since at least by the summer
of 1991, two and one one-half years before the action was
started, the appellants were aware of the alleged wrongdoing of
the deceased solicitor. I agree. More importantly, this court has
recently decided that the discoverability principle does not
apply to the limitation period in s.38(3) of the Trustee Act. See
Waschkowski v. Estate of Rosalie Hopkinnon, [2000] O.J. 470
(C.A.).
[16] On the other hand, so far as the action does come within the
kinds of cases specified in s.43(2), it is freed by s.44(2) from
s.38(3) of the Trustee Act, and is not out of time.
[17] On a motion under Rule 21, the &#147;plain and obvious&#148; test
applies. Hence the claims as pleaded against the respondents are
not time barred unless it is plain and obvious that they cannot
fit within the exceptions specified in s.43(2) of the Limitations
Act.
[18] As pleaded, the appellants&#146; action against the respondents
is founded in part on a claim of fraud and fraudulent breach of
trust by the deceased solicitor. It appears that before Sharpe
J., only this aspect of the action was argued to escape the two-
year limitation period. He found that this claim fell within the
exceptions listed in s.43(2) and was not time barred. I agree.
[19] In addition, the appellants argued in this court that the
action against the respondents seeks to recover trust property
held by the estate of the deceased solicitor when the action was
commenced. This claim is also clearly of a type specified in
s.43(2) and can proceed. The fact that these funds have since
been paid into court by the respondents does not prevent the
appellants from proceeding to claim them by means of this action.
[20] Finally, the appellants claim that the monies held in trust
by the deceased solicitor were dispersed by him to the benefit of
himself and others in violation of the terms of the trust. As a
corollary, the appellants seek an accounting of these funds and
an order tracing them. Whether these actions were done
negligently or innocently or in breach of contract, this claim is
arguably one to recover trust property previously received by the
trustee and converted to his use. It is not plain and obvious to
me that the claim cannot be so described. It is therefore not
statute barred.
[21] As this action proceeds, it will ultimately be up to the
trial judge to apply s.43(2) if it is said that discrete claims
emerge which fall outside those specified in that section.
However, it cannot now be said to be plain and obvious that the
claims I have recited do not fit within the list contained in
that subsection. Hence they are not statute barred.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE PLENE ADMINISTRAVIT ISSUE</strong></pre>
    <pre>[22] The doctrine of plene administravit was described by this
court in Commander Leasing Corp. v. Aiyede (1983), 44 O.R. (2d)
356 at 358:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It has long been established that if an executor or
administrator has no assets to satisfy the debt upon 
which an action is brought, in the absence of a plea 
of no assets or plene administravit, he will be taken 
to have conclusively admitted that he has assets to 
satisfy the judgment and will be personally liable 
for the debt and costs if they cannot be levied on the
assets of the deceased. If the executor has some, but
insufficient, assets to satisfy the judgment and costs, 
a plea of plene administravit praeter will render him 
liable only to the amount of assets proved to be in 
his hands as executor: See Re Marvin, [1905] 2 Ch. 
490; Marsden v. Regan, [1954] 1 All E.R. 475; 
Schneitzer v. Breckon, [1921] 20 O.W.N. 22.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[23] The respondent executors pleaded this defence and then, as I
have said, moved for a determination of a question of law,
namely, that on the basis of this doctrine, the action as against
them should be dismissed because of the lack of assets in the
estate of the deceased solicitor.
[24] While the respondents sought this order under both Rule 20
and Rule 21, they explicitly sought a determination of this
question of law and Sharpe J. dealt with it on that basis. Rule
21 was therefore the relevant rule.
[25] Sharpe J. determined that since the estate had funds of only
$7,138, the executors were entitled to have the action dismissed
against them except for a claim limited to $7,138. He concluded
that while the deceased solicitor&#146;s professional liability
insurance policy provided coverage after his death, it was
unavailable to respond to the appellants&#146; claims. He found that
while the claims against the deceased solicitor for fraudulent
breach of trust were not barred by any statutory limitation
period, they were not covered by the policy because of its
exclusion of coverage for dishonest or fraudulent acts. Apart
from this policy, the estate&#146;s only assets were the funds
amounting to $7,138.
[26] With respect, I have come to a different conclusion.
[27] The respondent executors pleaded in their statement of
defence that there were no assets or alternatively insufficient
assets in the estate to pay the claims alleged by the appellants.
They explicitly pleaded the doctrine of plene administravit. In
the motion before Sharpe J. seeking an order that as a matter of
law the action should be dismissed on this basis, the respondents
established that the only funds held by the estate amounted to
$7,138.
[28] To obtain the order sought, the respondents must show that
it is plain and obvious that there are no other assets that the
appellants could look to to respond to their claims. I do not
think the respondents can successfully do this.
[29] The appellants responded to the assertion of the plene
administravit doctrine by pleading in their reply that there was
an unrealized liability insurance policy in favour of the estate
of the deceased solicitor covering the allegations in the
statement of claim. The respondents, however, took the position
that because this policy contained an exclusion for &#147;any
dishonest, fraudulent, criminal or other malicious act&#148; of the
deceased solicitor, it simply could not cover the appellants&#146;
claims.
[30] I do not agree. The appellants&#146; claim that the deceased
solicitor disbursed trust monies to the benefit of himself and
others in breach of his duty to the beneficiaries could fall
within the terms of the policy if the solicitor was acting
negligently but not fraudulently. Even the claim for fraudulent
breach of trust could reach the policy, despite the wording of
the exclusion, if, for example, it should turn out at trial that
the conduct of the insurer prevented it from relying on the
exclusion. Finally, the tracing remedy sought by the appellants
would take them to assets beyond the $7,138 in the hands of the
estate.
[31] Therefore, I do not think it is plain and obvious that only
$7,138 is available to pay the claims alleged by the appellants.
The action should therefore not be dismissed at this stage &#150;
either in whole or except for a claim for the $7,138 &#150; as against
the respondents on the basis of the doctrine of plene
administravit.
[32] I would allow the appeal from the order of Sharpe J. and
order that the respondent&#146;s motion seeking to dismiss the action
either as being out of time or based on plene administravit be
dismissed with costs.
[33] At the same time as he dealt with the main motion brought by
the respondents, Sharpe J. disposed of two related motions. These
orders were also part of this appeal.
[34] The first of these was the respondents&#146; motion seeking to
strike four paragraphs from the appellants&#146; reply in which they
pleaded that if a limitation period applied, they should be
excused from it because their delay in launching the action was
due to the way in which the Law Society of Upper Canada dealt
with their claim for compensation. The motions judge ordered
these paragraphs struck because the alleged conduct of the Law
Society is irrelevant to the limitation issue. It could not serve
as an excuse for the appellants, if as this litigation proceeds
it should appear that a statutory limitation period does apply. I
agree, and would dismiss the appeal from this order.
[35] In the other motion, the appellants sought to strike out the
affidavit filed by the respondents in support of the main motion
because the deponent refused to answer certain questions when
cross-examined on the affidavit. Sharpe J. dismissed this motion
because of the marginal relevance of the questions and because
the appellants had taken no steps to compel answers prior to the
return of the main motions. I see no basis to interfere with this
exercise of his discretion and would dismiss the appeal from this
order as well.
[36] Since the appellants John Edwards and Nancy Edwards have
succeeded in reversing the order that their action be dismissed
as against the respondents, they should have their costs here and
below.</pre>
