    <pre><strong>On appeal from the Divisional Court (Flinn, Kent and Feldman JJ.)
dated February 6, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LASKIN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>Introduction</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   In  1992  the appellant Imperial Oil Limited  instituted  a
comprehensive alcohol and drug testing policy (the “Policy”)  for
its  employees at its two Ontario refineries.  The main  question
on   this  appeal  is  whether  the  provisions  of  the   Policy
discriminate on the ground of handicap or whether they  are  bona
fide occupational requirements.
[2]  The respondent Martin Entrop suffered from alcohol abuse in
the early 1980s.  Although he had not had a drink for over seven
years, because he worked in what Imperial Oil classified as a
safety-sensitive job, the Policy required him to disclose his
previous alcohol abuse problem to management.  When he disclosed
it, he was automatically reassigned to another job.  Although he
was eventually reinstated to his former position, he filed a
complaint with the respondent the Ontario Human Rights Commission
(the “Commission”), alleging that Imperial Oil discriminated
against him in his employment because of his handicap contrary to
s.5(1) of the Ontario Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, as
amended (the “Code”).  On the Commission’s recommendation, the
Minister of Labour appointed a Board of Inquiry to hear the
complaint.
[3]  The Board chair, Constance Backhouse, (the “Board”)
broadened the scope of the inquiry to deal not just with Entrop’s
specific complaint but with all aspects of alcohol and drug
testing under the Policy.  In a series of decisions she concluded
that the challenged provisions of the Policy were prima facie
discriminatory and could not be justified as bona fide
occupational requirements.  She awarded Entrop damages in the
amount of $21,241.93, including $10,000 for mental anguish.  An
appeal from her decision was dismissed by the Divisional Court.
[4]  Imperial Oil appeals to this court with leave.  It submits
that the provisions of the Policy are not discriminatory, that
the Board had no jurisdiction to expand the scope of the inquiry
into all aspects of alcohol and drug testing under the Policy,
and that the award of damages to Entrop for mental anguish is not
supportable.</pre>
    <pre><strong>II.  The Alcohol and Drug Policy</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]   Following a number of incidents, such as the  Exxon  Valdez
oil  spill in Alaska, in which alcohol and drugs were thought  to
be  contributing  factors,  Imperial Oil  became  concerned  that
substance  abuse  threatened the safety  of  its  employees,  the
public   and   the  environment.   It  decided  to  implement   a
comprehensive  alcohol  and  drug  policy  at  its  two   Ontario
refineries.   In  developing the Policy, Imperial  Oil  consulted
widely  with its employees and with experts in alcohol  and  drug
addiction  and  occupational  health  and  safety.   The   stated
objective  of  the Policy was “to minimize the risk  of  impaired
performance due to substance abuse.”  The Policy was announced to
the  employees on October 19, 1991 and implemented on January  1,
1992.
[6]  The Policy principally targeted employees in safety-
sensitive positions, about ten per cent of Imperial Oil's
workforce.  Safety-sensitive positions “have a key and direct
role in an operation where impaired performance could result in a
catastrophic incident affecting the health or safety of
employees, sales associates, contractors, customers, the public
or the environment”; and “have no direct or very limited
supervision available to provide frequent operational checks.”
[7]  Under the Policy, as amended in February 1992, the following
key work rules applied to employees in safety-sensitive
positions:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>No  presence  in the body of illicit  drugs  or  their
metabolites, nor a blood-alcohol concentration exceeding 
.04 per cent (.04 grams per 100 millilitres) while at work.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Unannounced random alcohol and drug testing, alcohol testing
by breathalyzer and drug testing by urinalysis.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>On a positive test or other Policy violation, automatic
dismissal.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>To remain in or qualify for a safety-sensitive position,
completion of a certification process, including a medical
examination, a negative test for alcohol and drugs, and a 
signed acknowledgement of compliance with the Policy.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Mandatory disclosure to management of a current or past
“substance abuse problem”.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>On disclosure of a substance abuse problem, reassignment to
a non-safety-sensitive position.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Reinstatement to a safety-sensitive position  only  on
completing a company approved two-year rehabilitation program
followed  by five years of abstinence, and on  signing  an
undertaking to abide by specified post-reinstatement controls.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[8]   Although the Policy mainly focused on employees in  safety-
sensitive  positions, it also provided for mandatory alcohol  and
drug  testing  for  all job applicants and all employees  in  the
following circumstances:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>Pre-employment testing for specified drugs for all job
applicants, as a condition of employment.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Testing for alcohol and specified drugs for all employees:</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>     
       -  after a  significant work accident, incident or near
       miss (“post-incident”)</pre>
    <pre>       -  where reasonable cause existed to suspect alcohol or
       drug use (“for cause”)</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>On a positive test, progressive discipline up to and
including dismissal could be imposed.     </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre><strong>III.  The Facts Giving Rise to the Complaint Before the Board</strong></pre>
    <pre>[9]   Martin  Entrop has worked for Imperial Oil  at  its  Sarnia
Refinery  since  the mid-1970s.  In 1987 he was promoted  to  the
position  of  senior  control  board  operator,  responsible  for
controlling various oil refining processes.
[10] Entrop is a recovered alcoholic.  He testified that he had a
previous alcohol abuse problem but that he had not had a drink
since 1984.  The Board accepted his testimony.
[11] In October 1991 Imperial Oil announced its Policy.  As I
have said, the Policy required employees in safety-sensitive
positions to disclose to management a past or current substance
abuse problem.  Entrop’s position, senior control board operator,
was classified as a safety-sensitive position.  On October 26,
1991, in accordance with the provisions of the Policy, Entrop
notified management that he had previously been an alcoholic and
that he had been sober continuously since 1984.  Imperial Oil
immediately reassigned him to a non-safety-sensitive position at
the same rate of pay.  Entrop claimed that his new position was
“less desirable”.
[12] On January 16, 1992, he filed with the Commission a
complaint of discrimination alleging that “his right to equal
treatment in employment without discrimination has been infringed
because of my handicap and perceived handicap contrary to s.5(1)
of the Ontario Human Rights Code.”
[13] Shortly after Entrop filed his complaint, Imperial Oil
amended its Policy to permit employees with past substance abuse
problems to be reinstated to safety-sensitive positions under
specified conditions.  In March 1992 Entrop applied for
reinstatement.  He underwent several medical evaluations, all of
which showed that his alcohol dependence was in remission and
that he had no psychological or psychiatric problems preventing
him from resuming his old job.  On May 15, 1992, Imperial Oil
agreed to reinstate Entrop to his former position as senior
control board operator if he signed “an undertaking regarding
post-reinstatement controls.”  The undertaking required Entrop to
agree to unannounced alcohol tests and to comply with and be
subject to the Policy.  Entrop signed the undertaking on May 26,
1992 and he was then reinstated.
[14] In March 1995 after Entrop had continuously tested negative,
Imperial Oil removed several of the post-reinstatement controls.
However, on June 1, 1995, after his hearing before the Board of
Inquiry had started, Entrop amended his complaint to include an
allegation that Imperial Oil had engaged in a series of reprisals
against him for initiating his complaint to the Commission,
contrary to s.8 of the Code.
[15] On June 2, 1995, in her fifth interim decision, the Board
permitted Entrop to further amend his complaint to allege that,
when Imperial Oil distributed the Policy to its employees and
circulated “educational awareness materials” to explain how the
Policy operated, it violated s.13(1) of the Code, because it
published a notice that indicated an intention to infringe a
right under the statute.  A new “amended amended complaint”
containing an allegation that Imperial Oil had breached s.13(1)
was filed on December 7, 1995.</pre>
    <pre><strong>IV.  The Decision of the Board of Inquiry</strong></pre>
    <pre>[16]  The  “Decision” of the Board of Inquiry consisted of  eight
interim  decisions delivered over a two-year period  from  August
25,  1994  to September 12, 1996.  Of these, the most significant
are decisions 5 through 8, which deal with the expanded scope  of
the  hearing, Entrop’s original complaint of discrimination,  the
allegations of reprisal against Entrop, the remedies for Imperial
Oil’s  breaches  of  the  Code, and the legality  of  the  Policy
provisions  for alcohol and drug testing.  Because  many  of  the
Board’s findings and her jurisdiction to expand the scope of  the
hearing are in issue in this appeal, I will briefly summarize the
substance of each of her eight interim decisions.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Interim Decision No. 1, August 25, 1994</strong></pre>
    <pre>[17]  The parties asked for a preliminary ruling on the scope  of
the hearing.  Imperial Oil sought to limit the Board’s inquiry to
the  portion  of the Policy that applied to Entrop, that  is  the
provisions for disclosure of a previous substance abuse  problem,
reassignment and reinstatement.  The Commission took the position
that,  in  addition to dealing with Entrop’s specific  complaint,
the  Board  should  inquire into the entire  Policy.   The  Board
declined to rule, saying that it was premature to do so.  In  the
Board’s  view  the  scope of the hearing  had  to  await  further
scrutiny.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Interim Decision No. 2, September 27, 1994</strong></pre>
    <pre>[18] On a Commission motion for the production of documents,  the
Board  ruled  that  she  would take a “phased”  approach  to  the
hearing.    In  the  first  phase  she  would  consider  Entrop’s
complaint.   She  again  refused to rule on  whether  the  entire
Policy  would be in issue, saying that would become clear as  the
hearing progressed.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Interim Decision No. 3, October 21, 1994</strong></pre>
    <pre>[19]  In  this third interim decision the Board dealt with  three
matters.   First, she ruled that she would consider  whether  the
terms of Entrop’s reinstatement to his previous position violated
the   Code.   Because  the  Policy,  as  originally  promulgated,
contained  no  provision  for  reinstatement,  Entrop’s  original
complaint  contained  no  allegation about  reinstatement.   When
Imperial  Oil  amended  its Policy in  February  1992  to  permit
reinstatement.  Entrop sought and obtained reinstatement  to  his
former  position.   He  did  not, however,  apply  to  amend  his
complaint  to  allege  discrimination  in  connection  with   his
reinstatement.  Nonetheless the Board held that the inquiry would
cover  Entrop’s reinstatement because “the issue of reinstatement
is not severable from the issue of job loss.”
[20] Second, the Board allowed the Commission to amend the
complaint of discrimination to add allegations of reprisal
against Entrop for filing his complaint, contrary to s.8 of the
Code.
[21] Third, under her “phased” approach, the Board deferred her
ruling on whether the Commission could further amend the
complaint to allege that Imperial Oil’s distribution of its
Policy to its employees violated s.13 of the Code.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Interim Decision No. 4, December 5, 1994</strong></pre>
    <pre>[22]  The  Commission asked to widen the scope of the inquiry  to
include  random  drug  testing.  The  request  was  made  because
Entrop’s doctor had provided a pain killer (Tylenol 3) containing
codeine  for  Entrop’s  injured  knee,  and  codeine  is  a  drug
specifically targeted under the Policy.  The Board ruled that  it
would  reserve  its  decision on the Commission’s  request  until
after the first phase of the inquiry.

<strong>Interim Decision No. 5, June 2, 1995</strong></pre>
    <pre>[23]  In this fifth interim decision, the Board decided that  she
would  hear the complaint in three phases.  Phase one would  deal
with Entrop’s complaint of discrimination concerning his previous
alcohol dependency; phase two would deal with the allegations  of
reprisal; and phase three would deal with the Policy as a  whole.
Thus the Board decided to expand the hearing into all aspects  of
alcohol  and  drug testing under the Policy.  She  justified  her
decision to do so on four separate bases:</pre>
    <pre>     1. Entrop’s use of Tylenol 3;</pre>
    <pre>     2. The undertaking Entrop was required to sign to be
        reinstated “incorporated the Policy by reference”;</pre>
    <pre>     3. The Board’s broad remedial jurisdiction under s.41(1)(a)
        of the Code; and</pre>
    <pre>     4. The distribution of the Policy and supporting literature
        to Imperial  Oil’s workforce raised an alleged violation
        of s.13(1) of the Code.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The Board also indicated that she would consider in phase  3
whether  Imperial Oil had breached s.13(1) and, as I have already
said,  she  permitted Entrop to amend his complaint to  allege  a
breach of s.13(1).
[25] Having determined that she had jurisdiction to inquire into
all aspects of alcohol and drug testing under the Policy, she
then reserved her decision on whether she would make findings on
these issues.  The Board’s jurisdiction to inquire into all the
testing provisions in the Policy and eventually to make findings
on them was one of Imperial Oil’s grounds of appeal both in the
Divisional Court and in this court.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Interim Decision No. 6, June 23, 1995</strong></pre>
    <pre>[26]  In  this  interim decision the Board made its  findings  on
phase one, Entrop’s complaint of discrimination on the ground  of
handicap because of his past alcohol dependence.  The Board found
on  expert evidence that alcohol abuse was a “handicap” under the
Code.  She  then  concluded, relying on the broad  definition  of
“handicap”,  that Entrop had established a prima  facie  case  of
discrimination contrary to s.5.  In her view, by requiring Entrop
to disclose his past alcohol abuse, by removing him from a safety-
sensitive   position,   and  by  imposing   conditions   on   his
reinstatement,  Imperial Oil had directly  discriminated  against
him on the basis of “perceived handicap”.
[27] The Board held that the only defence to a prima facie case
of direct discrimination was s.17 of the Code.  She held that to
establish “incapability” under s.17(1) Imperial Oil had to meet a
subjective standard of good faith and an objective standard of
reasonable necessity.  She found that Imperial Oil had met the
subjective standard of good faith.  She also found that Imperial
Oil had the right to insist that employees in safety-sensitive
positions be unimpaired by alcohol.  However, Imperial Oil failed
to meet the objective standard of reasonable necessity because it
could not establish that Entrop’s previous alcoholism had
adversely affected his job performance.  Therefore Imperial Oil
was not justified in treating him differently.
[28] The Board also found that even if Imperial Oil’s treatment
of Entrop was objectively justified, the company had not met its
duty to accommodate him under s.17(2) of the Code.  The mandatory
obligation to disclose his past alcohol dependency, his automatic
reassignment and his subsequent reinstatement under the
conditions specified in his undertaking all failed the
accommodation requirement.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Interim Decision No. 7, August 10, 1995</strong></pre>
    <pre>[29]  In this interim decision the Board dealt with phase two  of
the  hearing,  the  allegations of reprisal  against  Entrop  for
filing his complaint, and with the remedy for the breaches of the
Code  she  found  in  phases one and two.  The  Board  held  that
Imperial Oil had retaliated against Entrop contrary to s.8 of the
Code.   She  found that after he filed his human rights complaint
he had been subjected to a series of acts, actual and threatened,
that detrimentally affected him in his job at Imperial Oil.   She
listed  a number of incidents, which in her view amounted  to  an
ongoing  pattern of reprisal. In some of the incidents she  found
that  Imperial  Oil  intended to retaliate  against  Entrop;  for
others she could find no proof of intent but still held that  s.8
had   been   breached  because  the  “reasonable   human   rights
complainant”   in  Entrop’s  position  would  be   justified   in
perceiving that Imperial Oil had retaliated.
[30] The Board awarded Entrop $10,000 in general damages to
compensate him for the “intrinsic value” of the infringement of
his rights, $10,000 in damages for mental anguish, for his rights
being infringed wilfully and recklessly, and $1,241.93 in special
damages for lost overtime because of his reassignment.  Only the
award of damages for mental anguish is in issue on this appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Interim Decision No. 8, September 12, 1996</strong></pre>
    <pre>[31]   In  this  eighth  and  last  interim  decision  the  Board
considered  the legality of the parts of the Policy dealing  with
alcohol and drug testing. She found that drug abuse, like alcohol
abuse,  was  a  handicap  under the Code.  She  also  found  that
Imperial  Oil’s  Policy directly discriminated against  employees
who  were  using  or  had used drugs, on the ground  of  handicap
contrary  to  s.5  of  the  Code.   Although  she  accepted  that
employees  impaired  by drugs were incapable  of  fulfilling  the
essential  requirements  of the job, she  held  that  the  expert
evidence  unequivocally showed that drug testing cannot establish
impairment.    Therefore,  a  positive  drug   test   could   not
substantiate an incapability defence under s.17(1) of  the  Code.
She  also found that the Policy provisions on disclosure of  drug
use,  reassignment  and reinstatement were  not  justified  under
s.17(1).   Further,  she  found that  the  Policy  provisions  on
reassignment  and  reinstatement did not satisfy  Imperial  Oil’s
duty to accommodate under s.17(2).
[32] Although this eighth interim decision mainly dealt with drug
testing, the Board also considered the legality of random alcohol
testing.  During the hearing the Commission conceded that, in
contrast to urinalysis for drug impairment, breathalyzer testing
does show alcohol impairment.  The Commission also conceded that
alcohol testing may be permissible “for cause” and “post-
incident”.  The Board, however, declined to rule on the accuracy
or reliability of breathalyzer testing or on its legality for
cause or post-incident.
[33] But the Board apparently accepted the Commission’s argument
that breathalyzer testing was not necessary to detect or deter
alcohol impairment on the job because other less intrusive
measures were available.  These methods included employee
assistance programs, health promotion programs, supervisory
assessment and peer control programs.
[34] The Board ended her decision with five general conclusions,
all of which are in issue on this appeal.  They are:
     </pre>
    <pre>    1. The   Policy’s  requirement  that  employees  in   safety-
       sensitive   positions  disclose  any   current   or   past
       “substance  abuse  problem” contravenes the  Code  because
       the  definition of “substance abuse problem” is too  broad
       and is unlimited in duration.     </pre>
    <pre>    2. The  Policy provisions that prescribe a minimum  of  seven
       years  between  reassignment  following  disclosure  of  a
       substance   abuse  problem  and  potential   reinstatement
       breach  the  Code  because this  length  of  time  is  not
       necessary in all cases.     </pre>
    <pre>    3. The  mandatory conditions of reinstatement breach the Code
       because they are more than necessary in some cases.     </pre>
    <pre>    4. The  Policy provisions for pre-employment and random  drug
       testing  breach the Code because Imperial  Oil  failed  to
       prove   that   a  positive  drug  test  shows  impairment.
       However,  drug  testing “for cause”,  “post-incident”,  on
       “certification for safety-sensitive positions” and  “post-
       reinstatement”  may be permissible, but only  if  Imperial
       Oil  establishes  that this “testing is necessary  as  one
       facet of a larger process of assessment of drug abuse”.     </pre>
    <pre>    5. The  Policy  provisions for random alcohol testing  breach
       the  Code  because Imperial Oil failed to  establish  that
       this  testing  is  reasonably necessary to  deter  alcohol
       impairment    on   the   job.    Alcohol    testing    for
       “certification” for safety-sensitive positions and  “post-
       reinstatement”  may  be  permissible  but  again  only  if
       Imperial  Oil establishes that this testing “is  necessary
       as  one  facet of a large process of assessment of alcohol
       abuse”.</pre>
    <pre>[35]  The  Board  also included in this decision an  appendix  in
which she set out in more detail her reasons for concluding  that
she had jurisdiction not only to inquire into the drug and random
alcohol testing provisions of the Policy but to make findings  on
them  as well.  In this appendix she added one further conclusion
to  her  five  general conclusions.  She held that  the  posting,
printing  and  dissemination  of  the  Policy  constituted   “the
publication  or  display  for the public”  of  a  “notice”  under
s.13(1) and that to the extent the testing provisions contravened
the Code they announced an intention to infringe a right contrary
to the section.
[36] On this appeal Imperial Oil asks that we set aside the
Board’s five general conclusions, that we declare the Board had
no jurisdiction concerning her fourth and fifth conclusions, and
that we set her aside her conclusion on s.13(1).
[37] Following this eighth interim decision the Board indicated
that if necessary she would conduct a fourth phase of the hearing
to address revisions to Imperial Oil’s Policy and further
allegations of reprisal.  However, the record before the
Divisional Court and this court included only the eight interim
decisions that I have summarized.</pre>
    <pre><strong>V.  The Decision of the Divisional Court (Flinn, Kent and Feldman
JJ.)</strong></pre>
    <pre>[38]  The  Divisional  Court upheld  the  Board  of  Inquiry  and
dismissed  Imperial  Oil’s appeal.  Flinn  J.,  writing  for  the
court,  held  that most of the submissions made by  Imperial  Oil
raised  questions  of  mixed  fact and  law,  and  therefore  the
applicable  standard of review was reasonableness.   However,  on
the  question of the Board’s jurisdiction to consider the  entire
Policy, he held that the standard was correctness.
[39] Flinn J. then addressed Imperial Oil’s five main arguments.
First, he agreed with the Board’s interpretation of ss.5 and 17
of the Code and held that the Board’s finding that Entrop’s
rights were infringed on the ground of handicap was reasonably
supported by the evidence.  Second, he concluded that the broad
remedial jurisdiction in the Code and the undertaking to comply
with the Policy signed by Entrop as a condition of his
reinstatement gave the Board jurisdiction to consider the Policy
as a whole.  Third, he saw no reason to interfere with the
Board’s findings that drug abuse was a handicap and drug testing
under the Policy breached the Code, holding that these findings
were “reasonable and based on the evidence”.  Fourth, he held
that the Board had not erred in her assessment of the expert
evidence.  Fifth, he held that the award of damages to Entrop was
not excessive.  In summary, Flinn J. held that all the Board’s
orders and conclusions were supportable on the evidence.</pre>
    <pre><strong>VI.  Grounds of Appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre>[40] In this court Imperial Oil raised six grounds of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>    1. The  Divisional Court erred by applying the wrong standard
       of review to the Board’s findings.     </pre>
    <pre>    2. The  Divisional Court erred in holding that the Board  had
       jurisdiction  to inquire into all aspects of  alcohol  and
       drug testing under the Policy.     </pre>
    <pre>    3. The  Divisional  Court  erred  in  upholding  the  Board’s
       conclusion  that the Policy’s provisions for  alcohol  and
       drug testing violate the Code.     </pre>
    <pre>    4. The  Divisional  Court  erred  in  upholding  the  Board’s
       conclusion  that  the  Policy’s provisions  for  mandatory
       disclosure,  reassignment, reinstatement and certification
       violate the Code.     </pre>
    <pre>    5. The  Board  erred in holding that Imperial  Oil  infringed
       s.13(1)  of  the Code by distributing its  Policy  to  its
       employees.     </pre>
    <pre>    6. The  Divisional  Court erred in holding that  the  Board’s
       finding  that  Imperial  Oil  infringed  Entrop’s   rights
       “wilfully and recklessly” was reasonably supported by  the
       evidence.</pre>
    <pre><strong>VII.    Discussion</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>First  Issue  -  Did the Divisional Court apply  the  wrong
standard of review?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[41] The Divisional Court held that the standard of review of the
Board’s  jurisdiction to expand the scope of its inquiry to  deal
with  the  entire  Policy was correctness,  but  that  all  other
findings  and  conclusions of the Board were on issues  of  mixed
fact   and   law,   for  which  the  standard   of   review   was
reasonableness.   Imperial Oil submits that the Divisional  Court
erred because it applied the reasonableness standard to questions
of  law, such as the concept of perceived handicap under s.10  of
the Code.  Imperial Oil contends that these questions should have
attracted the correctness standard.
[42] Under s.42(3) of the Code, an appeal from a Board decision
to the Divisional Court may be made on questions of law or fact
or both and the Divisional Court has wide powers to affirm,
reverse or substitute its opinion for that of the Board.  The
standard of review applicable to a human rights tribunal subject
to such a broad right of appeal has been settled by the Supreme
Court of Canada in Canada (A.G.) v. Mossop, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 554
at 583-5 and University of British Columbia v. Berg, [1993] 2
S.C.R. 353 at 368-9.  The standard of review of general questions
of law, including the interpretation of the governing human
rights statute is correctness; the standard of review of the
Board’s findings of fact and the application of the law to those
findings of fact is reasonableness.
[43] Thus, in this appeal, the Board’s jurisdiction to expand the
scope of the inquiry is, as the Divisional Court held, a question
of law to which the correctness standard applies.  But so too is
the interpretation of the definition of “handicap” under s.10 of
the Code, and the test to justify a prima facie case of
discrimination under ss.11 and 17 of the Code.  For the other
issues raised in the appeal the reasonableness standard applies.
In my view, this is the appropriate approach to the substantive
issues raised by Imperial Oil.
Second  Issue – Did the Divisional Court err in holding that  the
Board had jurisdiction to inquire into all aspects of alcohol and
drug testing under the Policy?
[44]  Entrop’s human rights complaint alleged that  Imperial  Oil
discriminated against him on the ground of handicap  because  the
company required him to disclose his previous alcohol abuse,  and
once  he  had  disclosed it, reassigned him out  of  his  safety-
sensitive  position.   Entrop’s complaint  thus  focused  on  the
provisions of the Policy for mandatory disclosure of past alcohol
abuse  and  reassignment on disclosure.  Nonetheless,  the  Board
decided  part way through the hearing that she would broaden  the
inquiry  into all aspects of alcohol testing and even  into  drug
testing under the Policy.  Imperial Oil submits that she  had  no
jurisdiction  to  do  so.   The Divisional  Court  rejected  this
submission.
[45] For reasons that I will outline, the Board’s decision to
inquire into all aspects of alcohol testing can be justified.
However, the Board had no jurisdiction to inquire into drug
testing.  Moreover, I think that the Board was unwise to have
done so, especially in the way that she did, even though Imperial
Oil did not claim that it was prejudiced.  That said, because
both the Board and the Divisional Court have considered whether
the drug testing provisions of the Policy violate the Code,
practically I see no alternative but to do so as well.
[46] The   jurisdiction  of a  board of inquiry under the Code is
provided for  in Part IV  of  the  statute, titled “Enforcement”.
Under   s.36(1)   the   Commission   may   refer   “the   subject
matter  of the complaint to a board of inquiry.”1  Under  s.39(1)
the board of inquiry shall hold a hearing to determine whether  a
right of the complainant under the Act has been infringed and  if
so  by whom, and to decide an appropriate remedy.  Thus the board
of inquiry’s jurisdiction is circumscribed by “the subject matter
of  the complaint.”  The subject matter of Entrop’s complaint was
the   mandatory   disclosure   of  his   past   alcoholism,   his
reassignment,  and, fairly, the conditions of his  reinstatement.
His  complaint, admittedly, contains a general statement that  if
he  again obtains a safety-sensitive position he will be  subject
to drug and alcohol testing.  But what prompted his complaint and
its  real subject matter was the mandatory disclosure of his past
alcohol  abuse  and  the  consequences  of  disclosing  it.   His
complaint was properly amended to add allegations of reprisal.
[47]  As  I  have  said, the Board justified her decision  to  go
beyond  the  parameters of Entrop’s original  complaint  on  four
separate  grounds:   Entrop’s use of Tylenol 3; the  distribution
of  the  Policy  and  supporting  literature  to  Imperial  Oil’s
workforce allegedly violated s.13(1) of the Code; the undertaking
Entrop  was  required to sign as a condition of his reinstatement
incorporated  the  entire Policy by reference;  and  a  board  of
inquiry’s  broad  remedial jurisdiction under s.41(1)(a)  of  the
Code.   The  Division  Court relied on the last  two  grounds  to
dismiss Imperial Oil’s jurisdictional argument.  In my view, only
the  undertaking signed by Entrop affords a plausible  basis  for
expanding the scope of the Board’s inquiry into alcohol  testing.
None  of  the four grounds justifies inquiring into drug testing.
I  shall, however, discuss each of the four grounds relied on  by
the Board.
[48] Entrop was taking Tylenol 3, a pain killer prescribed by his
doctor,  for  a  knee  injury that he had sustained.   Tylenol  3
contains  codeine, and codeine is a drug targeted by the  Policy.
The  Policy prohibits not only the use of illicit drugs and  non-
prescribed  drugs but also the intentional misuse  of  prescribed
medications.  The Board therefore concluded that Entrop’s use  of
Tylenol  3  put  him  in  jeopardy of  discriminatory  action  by
Imperial  Oil  and  thus raised a live issue before  her  of  the
validity of Imperial Oil’s random drug testing.
[49] To invoke jurisdiction over Imperial Oil’s entire drug
testing policy because of Entrop’s use of Tylenol 3 is
unsupportable.  He never alleged in his complaint to the
Commission that he had been discriminated against because he took
this medication and he had never been subjected to a random drug
test.  Moreover, the Policy does not sanction an employee for
using a prescribed medication legitimately for medical reasons
and Imperial Oil never suggested Entrop had misused this
medication.  In short, Entrop was not at risk for his use of
Tylenol 3.
[50] Invoking jurisdiction over all aspects of Imperial Oil’s
alcohol and drug testing because the company distributed the
Policy to its employees stands on no firmer foundation.  Section
13(1) of the Code provides that the right to equal treatment is
infringed by the publication of a “notice, sign, symbol, emblem,
or other similar representation” indicating an intention to
infringe a protected right.  The Commission argued that by
distributing the Policy and explanatory literature to its
employees Imperial Oil exposed its entire Policy to review by the
board of inquiry.  The Board accepted that argument.
[51] I do not think that the Board could properly rely on an
alleged violation of s.13(1) to  confer jurisdiction over all
aspects of alcohol and drug testing when the entire Policy was
not the subject matter of Entrop’s complaint.  Had Entrop’s
complaint put all the provisions of the Policy in issue then the
Board might legitimately have considered whether the distribution
of the Policy to Imperial Oil’s workforce infringed s.13(1).
Alternatively, under s.32(2) of the Code, the Commission could
have initiated its own complaint alleging that the entire Policy
was discriminatory, including an allegation that its distribution
violated s.13(1).  But the Commission did not do so.
[52] In June 1995 the Board did permit Entrop to amend his
complaint to allege an infringement of s.13(1).  That amendment
was not filed until December 1995, long after the Board decided
she had jurisdiction to expand the scope of the inquiry.  She did
not rely on this “amended amended complaint” and it was not
referred to by counsel in this court.  In my view, it does not
advance the respondents’ position on the Board’s jurisdiction.
Thus, I do not think s.13(1) provides any support for the Board’s
decision to inquire into all aspects of alcohol and drug testing
under the Policy.
[53] I now come to the two grounds relied on by the Divisional
Court for upholding the Board’s jurisdiction.  When Entrop filed
his original complaint the Policy did not provide for
reinstatement of an employee taken out of a safety sensitive
position because of a substance abuse problem.  However, as I
have said, Imperial Oil amended the Policy to provide for
reinstatement.  Entrop took advantage of this amendment and he
was reinstated, but on conditions, including a condition that he
sign an undertaking to comply with and be subject to the Policy.
The Board held that this undertaking “incorporated by reference”
the entire Policy into the conditions of Entrop’s reinstatement
and thus gave the Board jurisdiction over the entire Policy.  In
her words the undertaking “transformed a case of previous alcohol
dependency into a larger case with matters of drug abuse and
random testing inextricably linked into Mr. Entrop’s
reinstatement.”  On a generous view, I think that the undertaking
entitled the Board to assert jurisdiction over alcohol testing
but not drug testing.
[54] An employee of Imperial Oil was always subject to and
obliged to comply with the Policy.  The undertaking affirmed that
obligation.  Indeed, all the employees in safety-sensitive jobs
were required to certify in writing that they agreed to be bound
by the terms of the Policy.  Although Entrop was bound by the
Policy when he filed his complaint with the Commission he did not
allege then that the other provisions of the Policy dealing with
random alcohol testing and drug testing discriminated against
him.  He did not suggest, for example, that random drug testing
put him at risk or placed him in jeopardy.  Nor did Entrop or the
Commission ask to amend the complaint to cover the undertaking
and by reference the Policy as a whole.
[55] However, Entrop did have an alcohol abuse problem.  And the
undertaking addressed that problem by imposing additional
“controls” on Entrop.  For example, in the undertaking, Entrop
had to agree to “undergo unannounced alcohol testing, at a
frequency of at least twice per quarter … in addition to any
testing … required … as an employee in a safety-sensitive
position in accordance with the Alcohol and Drug Policy.”  This
provision and the undertaking as a whole were rooted in Imperial
Oil’s concern that Entrop might again become an alcoholic.
Viewed expansively, therefore, the undertaking gave the Board
jurisdiction to inquire into all aspects of alcohol testing under
the Policy.
[56] But Entrop never had a drug abuse problem.  The undertaking
was not directed at drug abuse.  Thus, the undertaking did not
justify a broad ranging inquiry into drug testing.  Indeed the
Board even inquired into pre-employment drug testing, to which
Entrop was not and could never be subjected since he was already
an employee when the Policy was introduced, and into drug testing
“post-incident” and “for cause”, though Entrop had not been
tested after an incident or for cause.
[57] Finally, the Board relied on its broad remedial jurisdiction
in s.41(1)(a) of the Code to give it jurisdiction to inquire into
the legality of the entire Policy.  Section 41(1)(a) is indeed a
broad remedial provision.  Once the board of inquiry finds that a
complainant’s rights have been infringed the Board may direct the
infringing party “to do anything that, in the opinion of the
board, the party ought to do to achieve compliance with this Act,
both in respect of the complaint and in respect of future
practices”.  But it seems to me the proposition that the Board’s
broad remedial power can be used to expand its jurisdiction is
logically flawed.  The Board cannot work backwards from its
remedial powers to enlarge the subject matter of the complaint.
In other words the Board’s remedial powers cannot confer
jurisdiction over a matter if the Board had no jurisdiction over
it at the outset.  The range of remedies available to the Board,
though broad enough to include future practices, must be linked
to the subject matter of the complaint.  In this case the Board’s
remedy could properly address Entrop’s complaint and Imperial
Oil’s future practices concerning the subject matter of his
complaint, that is the disclosure of past alcohol abuse,
reassignment, reinstatement and unannounced alcohol testing.  To
go further and conduct what amounted to a freestanding inquiry
into drug testing cannot be justified by s.41(1)(a) of the Code.
[58] I thus conclude that the Board had jurisdiction to expand
the scope of the inquiry into all aspects of alcohol testing but
not drug testing.  Also, expanding the scope of the inquiry in
the way that she did caused two practical difficulties.  First
the scope of the inquiry became a moving target.  The hearing
began in August 1994 as an inquiry into Entrop’s complaint of
handicap discrimination because of his previous alcohol abuse.
Not until June 1995, ten months into the hearing, in her fifth
interim decision, did the Board decide to broaden the scope of
the inquiry to deal with the issues of drug and alcohol testing.
Not until her eighth and last interim decision in September 1996,
over two years after the hearings began, did she decide that she
had jurisdiction to make findings on these broader issues.
Broadening the scope of the inquiry in this way did not prejudice
Imperial Oil.  Nonetheless, ordinarily hearings proceed much more
efficiently and effectively when the parties know what the issues
are at the outset.
[59] Second, the inquiry into the Policy’s provisions on drug
testing lacked a proper factual underpinning.  Entrop had never
been tested for drugs.  Apart from his use of Tylenol 3 under
prescription, he did not consume drugs.  Thus, his complaint did
not raise a live dispute about drug testing.  The courts have,
with good reason, been wary about resolving disputes that do not
have a proper factual or evidentiary foundation.  The Board
justified her inquiry into drug testing on the ground of
“judicial economy”.  Because she had heard a good deal of
evidence about the development and implementation of the Policy
and because the Commission’s resources were limited, she
concluded that broadening her inquiry into drug testing would be
economical.  However, judicial economy was a debatable
justification for turning Entrop’s narrow complaint about how
Imperial Oil dealt with his past alcohol abuse into a wide-
ranging inquiry into drug testing.  Moreover, the inquiry into
drug testing took place in phase three.  The Board could simply
have ended the inquiry after phase two.
[60] However, with some misgivings, I will address the merits of
the various aspects of Imperial Oil’s Policy on drug testing.  I
do so because the Board and the Divisional Court did so and
because Imperial Oil has not asserted that it was prejudiced by
the broadening of the inquiry.  Indeed, the Board gave both sides
a fair opportunity to lead evidence and make submissions on all
contested issues.  In these circumstances, to avoid the merits
would be of little solace to any of the parties.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Third  Issue  –  Did the Divisional Court err  in  upholding  the
Board’s  conclusion that the Policy’s provisions for alcohol  and
drug testing violate the Code?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[61]  This is the main issue on the appeal.  Imperial Oil submits
that  the  provisions  in  the  Policy  for  pre-employment  drug
testing,  random  alcohol and drug testing  for  safety-sensitive
positions,  and  testing post-incident  and  for  cause  are  not
discriminatory.  Alternatively, Imperial Oil contends that,  even
if  these  provisions  are prima facie discriminatory,  they  are
justified as bona fide occupational requirements (“BFORs”).
[62] I will first discuss the legal principles to be applied to a
complaint that a workplace standard or rule is discriminatory,
and then apply these principles to the challenged provisions of
the Policy.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>  1.   The legal principles</strong></pre>
    <pre>[63] Determining whether a workplace rule violates the Code is  a
two-stage process.  At the first stage, the complainant must show
that  the  workplace  rule  is prima facie  discriminatory  on  a
prohibited  ground.  If a prima facie case of  discrimination  is
made  out, at the second stage the burden shifts to the  employer
to justify the rule.
[64] Therefore, the complainant must first show that the
workplace rule contravenes s.5(1) of the Code.  Section 5(1)
provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>5.–  Every person has a right to equal treatment with
respect to employment without discrimination because 
of race, ancestry, place of origin, colour, ethnic 
origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, 
age, record of offences, marital status, family status 
or handicap.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[65]  For  years, courts and human rights tribunals held  that  a
contravention  of  s.5(1) could occur in one of  two  ways:   the
contravention was characterized as “direct” discrimination if the
workplace  rule  was  discriminatory on its  face;  and  “adverse
effect”  discrimination if the rule was neutral on its  face  but
discriminatory  in  its  effect  on  an  employee  or  group   of
employees.   Adverse effect discrimination has also  been  termed
“indirect”  or  “constructive” discrimination.   The  distinction
between  direct  and  adverse  effect  discrimination  was  first
recognized  by  the  Supreme Court of Canada  in  Ontario  (Human
Rights Commission) v. Simpsons-Sears Ltd. (1985), 23 D.L.R. (4th)
321.   McIntyre  J.  discussed the distinction in  the  following
passage at 332:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>A distinction must be made between what I would describe 
as direct discrimination and the concept already referred 
to as adverse effect discrimination in connection with 
employment.  Direct discrimination occurs in this 
connection where an employer adopts a practice or rule 
which on its face discriminates on a prohibited ground.  
For example, “No Catholics or no women or no blacks 
employed here.”  There is, of course, no disagreement in
the case at bar that direct discrimination of that nature 
would contravene the Act.  On the other hand, there is no 
concept of adverse effect discrimination.  It arises where 
an employer for genuine business reasons adopts a rule or 
standard which is on its face neutral, and which will 
apply equally to all employees, but which has a 
discriminatory effect upon a prohibited ground on one 
employee or group of employees in that it imposes, because 
of some special characteristic of the employee or group,
obligations, penalties, or restrictive conditions not imposed 
on other members of the work force.  For essentially the same
reasons that led to the conclusion that an intent to 
discriminate was not required as an element of discrimination 
contravening the Code, I am of the opinion that this court 
may consider adverse effect discrimination as described in 
these reasons a contradiction of the terms of the Code.  An 
employment rule honestly made for sound economic or business 
reasons, equally applicable to all to whom it is intended to 
apply, may yet be discriminatory if it affects a person or 
group of persons differently from others to whom it may 
apply.  From the foregoing I therefore conclude that the 
appellant showed a prima facie case of discrimination based 
on creed before the board of inquiry.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[66]  After this decision, much of the human rights case  law  on
employment  discrimination centred on whether the  discrimination
was  direct  or indirect.  The distinction was important  because
what  the  employer  had  to  show to  justify  the  prima  facie
discriminatory rule and the appropriate remedy differed depending
on  whether  the rule was discriminatory on its face or  facially
neutral but discriminatory in its effect.
[67] Ontario’s Code gives an employer two separate defences to a
prima facie case of handicap discrimination.  Under s.11, an
employer may justify a workplace rule that has the effect of
discriminating against a person or group of persons on a
prohibited ground by showing that the rule is a BFOR:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>11.–(1)  A right of a person under Part I is infringed
where a requirement, qualification or factor exists that 
is not discrimination on a prohibited ground but that 
results in the exclusion, restriction or preference of a 
group of persons who are identified by a prohibited 
ground of discrimination and of whom the person is a 
member, except where,</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a)  the requirement, qualification or factor is 
reasonable and bona fide in the circumstances; or</pre>
        <pre>(b)  it is declared in this  Act, other than in 
section 17, that to discriminate because of such 
ground is not an infringement of a right.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>(2)   The Commission, a board of inquiry or a court 
shall not find that a requirement, qualification or   
factor is reasonable and bona fide in the circumstances
unless it is satisfied that the needs of the group of 
which the person is a member cannot be accommodated 
without undue hardship on the person responsible for 
accommodating those needs, considering the cost, 
outside sources of funding, if any, and health and  
safety requirements, if any.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[68]  Under s.17, an employer may justify a prima facie  case  of
handicap  discrimination  by  showing  that  the  complainant  is
incapable of performing the essential duties of the job:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>17. – (1) A right of a person under this Act is not
infringed for the reason only that the person is 
incapable of performing or fulfilling the essential 
duties or requirements attending the exercise of the 
right because of handicap.</pre>
      <pre>(2)  The Commission, a board of inquiry or a court shall 
not find a person incapable unless it is satisfied that 
the needs of the person cannot be accommodated without  
undue hardship on the person responsible for accommodating  
those needs, considering the cost, outside sources of 
funding, if any, and health and safety requirements, if any.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[69] This court held in Ontario Nurses’ Assn. v. Orillia Soldiers
Memorial  Hospital (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 692 that s.11 applies  to
cases  of adverse effect discrimination and s.17 applies to cases
of direct discrimination.
[70] Though important, characterizing the discrimination as
direct or indirect was often difficult.  This case is a good
example.  Is the rule requiring all employees in safety-sensitive
positions to undergo random alcohol and drug testing facially
neutral because it applies to an entire segment of the workforce,
or discriminatory on its face because it targets substance
abusers and perceived substance abusers?  The Board of Inquiry
held that these Policy provisions were discriminatory on their
face and constituted direct discrimination on the ground of
handicap.  In this court, Imperial Oil contended that the Policy
was neutral on its face and that if it discriminated at all, the
discrimination was indirect.  Because the Board found that the
discrimination was direct, she held the only defence available to
Imperial Oil was under s.17.  Imperial Oil, on the other hand,
argued that it could rely on s.11 of the Code.
[71] The development of human rights jurisprudence was well-
served by the distinction between direct and adverse effect
discrimination, or, more accurately, by the recognition of
adverse effect discrimination as a form of discrimination.  The
Code aims to remove discrimination in Ontario.  Its main purpose
is not to punish the wrongdoer but to provide relief for the
victim of discrimination.  Recognizing adverse effect
discrimination furthers this purpose.  It focuses not on the
intention of the employer but on what is most important, the
effect or the result of the employer’s conduct.  Indeed, few
modern employers openly discriminate directly by advertising, for
example, “No Blacks or Jews employed here.”  Even those employers
with a discriminatory intent will invariably use neutral language
to frame their employment rules.  Thus, in most cases, the
inquiry focuses on the effect of the employer’s actions.
[72] However, increasingly, tribunals, courts and academics have
doubted the continuing validity of the distinction between direct
and adverse effect discrimination.  Then, late last year, after
this appeal was argued, the Supreme Court of Canada, in two
ground-breaking decisions – British Columbia (Public Service
Employee Relations Commission) v. B.C.G.S.E.U. (“Meiorin”)
(1999), 176 D.L.R. (4th) 1 and British Columbia (Superintendent
of Motor Vehicles) v. British Columbia (Council of Human Rights)
(“Grismer”) (1999), 181 D.L.R. (4th) 385 – erased the distinction
between direct and adverse effect discrimination and prescribed a
single three-step test, which the employer must meet to justify a
prima facie case of discrimination.  Meiorin was a sex
discrimination case, Grismer a handicap discrimination case.
Both cases were decided under the British Columbia Human Rights
Code and in both the reasons were written by McLachlin J.
[73] In Meiorin, McLachlin J. gave seven reasons for abandoning
the distinction between direct and adverse effect discrimination:</pre>
    <pre>  1.   The distinction is artificial.  Few cases “can be so neatly
       characterized”; and the distinction is unrealistic because 
       today most employers use neutral words whatever their intent.</pre>
    <pre>  2.   The  remedies could differ depending on  the  kind  of
       discrimination.  If the employer could not justify a 
       workplace rule that was discriminatory on its face, the
       rule would ordinarily be struck down.  The employer,
       however, could  maintain a rule that was neutral on its
       face but discriminatory in its effect,  by accommodating
       individuals affected by the discrimination to the point
       of undue hardship.  A different result flowing from a
       questionable initial classification is difficult to justify.</pre>
    <pre>  3.   The   rationale  for  the  remedy  for  adverse  effect
       discrimination is questionable.  Facially-neutral workplace 
       rules were permitted to remain in effect because ordinarily 
       they affected a minority of employees.  But permitting a 
       neutral rule to stand because it did not adversely affect 
       the majority of employees is difficult to defend.  Moreover, 
       the size of the “affected group” can be manipulated and, in 
       some cases, can actually constitute a majority of the
       workforce.</pre>
    <pre>  4.   Although  the  defences to direct  and  adverse  effect
       discrimination differed, the differences were hard to define; 
       in practice, probably no meaningful distinction existed.</pre>
    <pre>  5.   The  distinction  between  direct  and  adverse  effect
       discrimination may legitimize systemic discrimination.  If a
       workplace rule is characterized as neutral on its face, its
       legitimacy is not questioned.  Instead, the inquiry focuses
       on whether the complainant can be accommodated.</pre>
    <pre>  6.   Permitting a workplace rule to be questioned only if it is
       discriminatory on its face does not permit human rights
       statutes “to accomplish their purpose as well as they might
       otherwise do”.</pre>
    <pre>  7.   The court’s approach to human rights legislation should not
       differ from the court’s approach to the equality guarantee
       in s.15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
       Eliminating the distinction between direct and adverse
       effect discrimination is more consistent with the Court’s
       interpretation of s.15(1), which principally focuses on the
       effect of the challenged law.</pre>
    <pre>[74]   For  these  reasons,  the  Supreme  Court  abandoned   the
problematic   distinction  between  direct  and  adverse   effect
discrimination.   Instead,  the  Court  adopted  in  Meiorin  and
affirmed  in  Grismer  a  “unified  approach”  that  avoids  this
distinction.   This  new  approach  requires  employers   setting
workplace  rules  to accommodate affected employees  as  much  as
reasonably   possible,   but  permits   employers   to   maintain
discriminatory  rules reasonably necessary to achieve  legitimate
work-related objectives.
[75] In Meiorin, at pp. 24-25, the Court proposed that an
employer could justify a prima facie discriminatory workplace
rule or standard by meeting a three-step test:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Having considered the various alternatives, I propose 
the following three-step test for determining whether a 
prima facie discriminatory standard is a BFOR. An employee 
may justify the impugned standard by establishing on the 
balance of probabilities:
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>                (1)   that  the  employer  adopted  the
          standard  for a purpose rationally  connected
          to the performance of the job;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (2)   that  the  employer  adopted  the
          particular  standard in an  honest  and  good
          faith  belief  that it was necessary  to  the
          fulfilment  of  that legitimate  work-related
          purpose; and
          </pre>
    <pre>                (3)  that  the  standard is  reasonably
          necessary  to  the  accomplishment  of   that
          legitimate  work-related  purpose.   To  show
          that the standard is reasonably necessary, it
          must be demonstrated that it is impossible to
          accommodate individual employees sharing  the
          characteristics   of  the  claimant   without
          imposing undue hardship upon the employer.</pre>
    <pre>If the three-step test is met, the workplace rule is a BFOR.</pre>
    <pre>[76]  The  significance  of eliminating the  distinction  between
direct  and  adverse effect discrimination and of the  three-step
justification for a prima facie discriminatory workplace rule  is
that  now the rule itself must accommodate individual differences
to  the point of undue hardship.  If it does, the rule is a BFOR.
If  it  does  not,  the  rule  is discriminatory.   McLachlin  J.
discussed the significance of her unified approach in Grismer  at
393:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Meiorin announced a unified approach to adjudicating
discrimination claims under human rights legislation.  
The distinction between direct and indirect discrimination 
has been erased.  Employers and others governed by human 
rights legislation are now required in all cases to 
accommodate the characteristics of affected groups within 
their standards, rather than maintaining discriminatory 
standards supplemented by accommodation for those who 
cannot meet them.  Incorporating accommodation into the 
standard itself ensures that each person is assessed 
according to her or his own personal abilities, instead 
of being judged against presumed group characteristics.
[Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[77]  The Supreme Court’s three-step test was formulated  in  the
context  of a discrimination complaint under the British Columbia
Human  Rights  Code, R.S.B.C. 1996, c.210.  The  wording  of  the
statutory defences available to an employer under Ontario’s  Code
differs  from  the  wording  under  the  British  Columbia  Code.
Section 11 of Ontario’s Code sets out in detail the elements of a
BFOR;  the  comparable  provision of the British  Columbia  Code,
s.13(4),  provides simply that “subsections (1) and  (2)  do  not
apply  with  respect to a refusal, limitation,  specification  or
preference  based on a bona fide occupational requirement.”2   In
the case of handicap discrimination, s.17 of the Ontario Code has
no  counterpart in the British Columbia Code.  The difference  in
wording  in  the  two  statutes raises the question  whether  the
Supreme  Court’s  three-step test for justifying  a  prima  facie
discriminatory workplace rule should be applied in this case.  In
my  view, the unified approach and the three-step test adopted in
Meiorin  should be applied.  Applying the unified approach  means
that  Imperial Oil can rely on s.11 of the Code as well as  s.17.
Under either section, however, to justify its workplace rules  it
must  satisfy  the three-step test in Meiorin.   I  rely  on  the
following reasons for applying Meiorin in this case.
[78] First, although the Supreme Court in Grismer said only that
the Meiorin test applies to all claims for discrimination under
the British Columbia Code, it seems to me the Court contemplated
that the test would apply generally to discrimination claims
under human rights legislation unless precluded by the applicable
statutory provisions.  Thus, at 393 of Grismer, McLachin J.
wrote:  “Meiorin announced a unified approach to adjudicating
discrimination claims under human rights legislation.”
[79] Second, as McLachlin J. observed in Meiorin, the Ontario
statute already reflects the unified approach she advocates.
Section 11(2) of the Code provides that a board of inquiry shall
not find a rule is a BFOR “unless it is satisfied that the needs
of the group of which the person is a member cannot be
accommodated without undue hardship”.  Similarly, the statutory
defence under s.17 imposes a duty to accommodate to the point of
undue hardship and a prima facie discriminatory rule not saved by
s.17 will be struck down.  See Central Alberta Dairy Pool v.
Alberta (Human Rights Commission), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 489.
[80] Third, though the language of s.11 does reflect the
distinction between direct and adverse effect discrimination –
because it provides a BFOR defence “where a requirement … exists
that is not discrimination on a prohibited ground but that
results in the exclusion, restriction or preference of a group of
persons who are identified by prohibited ground of
discrimination” – I would limit the situations to which s.11 does
not apply to those few cases that can be “neatly characterized”
as cases of direct discrimination.  I have in mind the kinds of
cases referred by McIntyre J. in Ontario v. Simpson Sears, supra
– “No Catholics or no women or no blacks are employed here” –
where the requirement expressly includes a prohibited ground of
discrimination.  So limiting the cases to which s.11 does not
apply is consistent with the reasoning underlying the Supreme
Court’s unified approach in Meiorin.  The case before us,
however, is the kind of case where characterizing whether the
discrimination is direct or indirect is problematic and thus
where s.11 should be applied using the Meiorin test.  The focus
should be, as s.11 mandates, on the effect or the result of the
challenged provisions of the Policy.
[81] Fourth, the three-step justification test proposed by the
Supreme Court is consistent with both the language of ss.11 and
17 of the Code and the jurisprudence under these provisions.  See
Ontario (Human Rights Commission) v. Borough of Etobicoke, [1982]
1 S.C.R. 202 and Large v. Stratford (1995) 128 D.L.R. (4th) 193
(S.C.C.).  Indeed, the Supreme Court’s new three-step test
combines the elements of the previous test for justifying adverse
effect discrimination with the elements of the previous test for
justifying direct discrimination.  And, as McLachlin J. observed
in Meiorin, there is little difference between the two previous
tests, other than semantics.
[82] As I have said, eliminating the distinction between direct
and adverse effect discrimination and adopting Meiorin’s unified
approach allows Imperial Oil to rely on s.11 of the Code as a
defence to Entrop’s claim, a defence the Board held was not
available to it.  But that defence, which is an express BFOR
defence, must now be assessed against the Meiorin test.
[83] The language of s.17 differs from the language of s.11.
Under s.17 Imperial Oil can legitimately assert, as the Board
held, that an employee impaired by alcohol or drugs “is incapable
of performing the essential duties or requirements” of safety-
sensitive jobs.  But, unless Imperial Oil shows that its methods
for establishing impairment – random alcohol and drug testing,
mandatory disclosure and automatic reassignment – are themselves
BFORs, then its s.17 defence will fail.
[84] The elements of the Meiorin test for establishing a BFOR
closely parallel the elements of the incapability defence
developed in the case law under s.17 and applied by the Board in
this case.  Relying on Ontario v. Borough of Etobicoke, supra,
the Board held that, to show Entrop was incapable of performing
the essential requirements of the job under s.17(1), it had to
meet a subjective standard of good faith and an objective
standard of reasonable necessity.  In substance, these comprise
the second step and one aspect of the third step in the Meiorin
test.  The Board also applied the other aspect of the third step,
the duty to accommodate to the point of undue hardship, as it is
prescribed by s.17(2) of the Code.  The first step in the new
test in Meiorin – the workplace rule is rationally connected to
the performance of the job – is drawn from the jurisprudence on
adverse effect discrimination.  The need for a rational
connection, though not expressly adverted to by the Board, was
implicit in her analysis and, as I have said, is consistent with
the wording of s.17.
[85] For these reasons, I propose to analyze whether the
challenged provisions of the Policy breach the Code using the new
three-step test in Meiorin.  I do not believe that doing so
causes any unfairness to the parties.  Because the Meiorin test
and the test applied by the Board are so similar, both sides
addressed the relevant questions.  Thus, the new test can be
applied to the findings of the Board.     </pre>
    <pre>  <strong>2.   Pre-employment drug testing and random alcohol and drug
       testing for employees in safety-sensitive positions</strong></pre>
    <pre>[86]  The workplace rules that lie at the heart of Imperial Oil’s
Policy  are  the provisions for pre-employment drug  testing  and
random alcohol and drug testing for employees in safety-sensitive
positions.   The  Board concluded that these provisions  breached
the  Code, and her conclusion was upheld by the Divisional Court.
Imperial Oil submits that these provisions do not breach s.5  but
that,  even if they do, they are justified because they are  bona
fide  occupational requirements.  I agree that the  drug  testing
provisions  of the Policy violate the Code.  However, I  disagree
with  the  Board  and  the  Divisional Court  on  random  alcohol
testing.   The  important  difference between  alcohol  and  drug
testing  is  that  a  positive drug  test  does  not  demonstrate
impairment;  a positive breathalyzer reading does.   I  therefore
think that random alcohol testing for safety-sensitive positions,
though prima facie discriminatory, can be justified providing the
sanctions  for  a positive test are individually tailored.   With
this  brief  background, I will discuss the  application  of  the
Meiorin test to these provisions.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(a)       Are these provisions prima facie discriminatory on
          the ground of handicap?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[87] Section 5(1) of the Code guarantees every person “a right to
equal treatment with respect to employment without discrimination
because of … handicap.”  Handicap is defined very broadly in s.10
of  the  Code,  both in respect of what conditions  constitute  a
handicap   and   who   can  claim  protection  against   handicap
discrimination:</pre>
    <pre>	  “because  of handicap”  means  for the reason 
	  that   the  person  has  or  has  had,  or is 
	  believed to have or have had,</pre>
    <pre>          (a)    any  degree  of  physical  disability,
          infirmity, malformation or disfigurement that
          is  caused by bodily injury, birth defect  or
          illness  and, without limiting the generality
          of    the   foregoing,   including   diabetes
          mellitus,  epilepsy, any degree of paralysis,
          amputation,  lack  of physical  coordination,
          blindness  or visual impediment, deafness  or
          hearing   impediment,  muteness   or   speech
          impediment, or physical reliance on  a  guide
          dog  or  on  a  wheelchair or other  remedial
          appliance or device,</pre>
    <pre>          (b)    a  condition  of mental retardation or
          impairment,</pre>
    <pre>          (c)    a    learning    disability,    or   a
          dysfunction  in one or more of the  processes
          involved in understanding or using symbols or
          spoken language,</pre>
    <pre>          (d)    a mental disorder, or</pre>
    <pre>          (e)    an  injury  or  disability  for  which
          benefits  were claimed or received under  the
          Workers’ Compensation Act;</pre>
    <pre>[88]  This definition provides protection to persons who  have  a
handicap,  persons who had a handicap but no longer  suffer  from
it,  persons believed to have a handicap whether they do or  not,
and persons believed to have had a handicap, whether they did  or
not.   In other words, the definition protects those who have  or
have     had     an     actual     or     perceived     handicap.
[89]  The  Board  found, on uncontradicted expert evidence,  that
drug  abuse  and alcohol abuse – together substance abuse  –  are
each  a  handicap.   Each  is  “an illness  or  disease  creating
physical  disability  or mental impairment and  interfering  with
physical, psychological and social functioning.”  Drug dependence
and alcohol dependence, also separately found by the Board to  be
handicaps,  are severe forms of substance abuse.   Therefore,  on
the findings of the Board, which are not disputed on this appeal,
substance  abusers are handicapped and entitled to the protection
of the Code.
[90] A person who tests positive on a random alcohol or drug test
may be a casual user, not a substance abuser, and may, therefore,
not actually be handicapped.  But the Policy treats even casual
or recreational users as substance abusers.  The Policy’s
Administrative Guidelines, which are “intended to provide
additional details, interpretative guidance and administrative
procedures” in support of the Policy list the following
categories of substance abusers:
                                           </pre>
    <pre>                           <u>CATEGORIES OF SUBSTANCE ABUSERS</u></pre>
    <pre>   EXPERIMENTER         An  individual  who  experiments  with
                        alcohol  or  drugs,  usually  out   of
                        curiosity.
</pre>
    <pre>   RECREATIONAL USER    A  person who uses and gets “high”  on
                        alcohol    or    drugs   at    special
                        occasions, e.g. parties.
</pre>
    <pre>   REGULAR USER         One  who adopts a constant pattern  of
                        alcohol    or    drug   abuse    while
                        attempting to maintain normal  day-to-
                        day activities.
</pre>
    <pre>   BINGE USER           An  individual who consumes alcohol or
                        drugs  in  an uncontrolled manner  for
                        short   periods  of  time   and   then
                        abstains until the next binge.
</pre>
    <pre>   DEPENDENT USER       A  dependent,  or addicted,  user  has
                        become  psychologically or  physically
                        dependent   on  the  use   of   drugs,
                        characterized  by  a progressive  loss
                        of  control despite either a desire to
                        reduce   intake   or   knowledge    or
                        recurring   disturbances  in   health,
                        work of social functioning.
</pre>
    <pre>[91] The Guidelines then state: “In the cycle of substance abuse,
users  frequently begin by experimenting with drugs and  progress
to the dependent user stage later on.”
[92] Thus, though the social drinker and casual drug user are not
substance abusers and, therefore, not handicapped, Imperial Oil
believes them to be substance abusers for the purpose of the
Policy.  In other words, Imperial Oil believes that any person
testing positive on a pre-employment drug test or a random drug
or alcohol test is a substance abuser.  Because perceived as well
as actual substance abuse is included in the definition of
handicap under the Code, anyone testing positive under the
alcohol and drug testing provisions of the Policy is entitled to
the protection of s.5 of the Code.  Imperial Oil applies
sanctions to any person testing positive – either refusing to
hire, disciplining or terminating the employment of that person –
on the assumption that the  person is likely to be impaired at
work currently or in the future, and thus not “fit for duty.”
Therefore, persons testing positive on an alcohol or drug test –
perceived or actual substance abusers – are adversely affected by
the Policy.  The Policy provisions for pre-employment drug
testing and for random alcohol and drug testing are, therefore,
prima facie discriminatory.  Imperial Oil bears the burden of
showing that they are bona fide occupational requirements.  See
Canadian Civil Liberties Assn. v. Toronto-Dominion Bank (1998),
163 D.L.R. (4th) 193 (Fed. C.A.).          </pre>
    <pre><strong>(b)    Are these testing provisions justified as BFORs?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[93] The question is whether Imperial Oil can justify these prima
facie  discriminatory workplace rules as BFORs under  the  three-
step  test  in  Meiorin.   The Board  held  that,  because  these
provisions were discriminatory on their face – the discrimination
was  direct  –  Imperial Oil could not rely on the  BFOR  defence
under  s.11  of  the Code; the only defence available  was  under
s.17.   However,  Meiorin has eliminated the distinction  between
direct  and  adverse effect discrimination for the provisions  of
the  Policy challenged in this case, thus permitting Imperial Oil
to  rely  on  s.11 as well as s.17.  As I have said earlier,  the
three-step test in Meiorin applies to either defence.  As in most
cases, whether Imperial Oil can meet the test turns on the  third
step.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(i)  Has Imperial Oil adopted alcohol and drug testing for a
     purpose rationally connected to the performance of the job?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[94]  Meiorin  tells us that the first step focuses  not  on  the
validity  of  the particular challenged workplace  rules  but  on
their  more general purpose.  The stated purpose or objective  of
the  Policy “is to minimize the risk of impaired performance  due
to  substance  use”  in  order “to ensure  a  safe,  healthy  and
productive   workplace.”   This  general  purpose  is  rationally
connected  to the performance of the work at Imperial  Oil’s  two
refineries.  Common sense and experience suggest that an accident
at  a  refinery can have catastrophic results for employees,  the
public  and  the  environment.   Promoting  workplace  safety  by
minimizing the possibility employees will be impaired  by  either
alcohol  or  drugs  while  working  is  a  legitimate  objective.
Imperial Oil has met the first step of the Meiorin test.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(ii) Did Imperial Oil adopt these testing provisions in an honest
     and good faith belief that they were necessary to accomplish 
     the company’s purpose?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[95] The second step is the subjective element of the test.   The
Board  found  that  Imperial Oil developed  and  implemented  the
challenged  provisions of the Policy honestly and in good  faith.
That  finding is reasonably supported by the evidence.   Imperial
Oil  consulted widely with its employees and with experts in both
occupational  health  and  safety and substance  dependency.   It
assembled  one  of  Canada’s  most  comprehensive  databases   on
workplace  alcohol  and drug abuse.  Imperial  Oil  has  met  the
second step of the Meiorin test.
      <strong>    
(iii)   Are these testing provisions reasonably necessary to
        accomplish Imperial Oil’s purpose?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[96]  This  third step of the Meiorin test focuses on  the  means
Imperial Oil has used to accomplish its purpose.  The question is
whether  Imperial Oil has shown that the alcohol and drug testing
provisions  of  the Policy are reasonably necessary  to  identify
those persons who cannot perform work safely at the company’s two
refineries,  because they are impaired by alcohol or  drugs.   To
meet this third requirement Imperial Oil must show that it cannot
accommodate  individual  capabilities  and  differences   without
experiencing   undue  hardship.   The  phrase  “undue   hardship”
suggests that Imperial Oil must accept some hardship in order  to
accommodate individual differences.
[97] An employer’s workplace rule may fail to satisfy the third
step in the Meiorin test in several ways.  For example the rule
may be arbitrary in the sense that it is not linked to or does
not further the employer’s legitimate purpose; the rule may be
too broad or stricter than reasonably necessary to achieve the
employer’s purpose; the rule may unreasonably not provide for
individual assessment; or the rule may not be reasonably
necessary because other means, less intrusive of individual human
rights, are available to achieve the employer’s purpose.
[98] I turn now to whether Imperial Oil’s alcohol and drug
testing provisions are reasonably necessary.  As the Board held,
Imperial Oil has the right to assess whether its employees are
capable of performing their essential duties safely.  An employee
working in a safety-sensitive position while impaired by alcohol
or drugs presents a danger to the safe operation of Imperial
Oil’s business.  Therefore, as the Board found, “freedom from
impairment” by alcohol or drugs is a BFOR.  An employee impaired
by alcohol or drugs is incapable of performing or fulfilling the
essential requirements of the job.  The contentious issue is
whether the means used to measure and ensure freedom from
impairment – alcohol and drug testing with sanctions for a
positive test – are themselves BFORs.  Are they reasonably
necessary to achieve a work environment free of alcohol and
drugs?
[99] I deal with drug testing first.  The drugs listed in the
Policy all have the capacity to impair job performance, and
urinalysis is a reliable method of showing the presence of drugs
or drug metabolites in a person’s body.  But drug testing suffers
from one fundamental flaw.  It cannot measure present impairment.
A positive drug test shows only past drug use.  It cannot show
how much was used or when it was used.  Thus, the Board found
that a positive drug test provides no evidence of impairment or
likely impairment on the job.  It does not demonstrate that a
person is incapable of performing the essential duties of the
position.  The Board also found on the evidence that no tests
currently exist to accurately assess the effect of drug use on
job performance and that drug testing programs have not been
shown to be effective in reducing drug use, work accidents or
work performance problems.  On these findings, random drug
testing for employees in safety-sensitive positions cannot be
justified as reasonably necessary to accomplish Imperial Oil’s
legitimate goal of a safe workplace free of impairment.
[100]     The random drug testing provisions of the Policy suffer
from a second flaw:  the sanction for a positive test is too
severe, more stringent than needed for a safe workplace and not
sufficiently sensitive to individual capabilities.  This aspect
of the Policy’s provisions on random drug testing was not
addressed by the Board.  However, the Administrative Guidelines
specify the consequences of a Policy violation.  Employees in non-
safety-sensitive jobs who test positive are subject to
progressive discipline, which consists of a warning, a three-to-
five day suspension without pay, and termination.  But for
employees in safety-sensitive positions who test positive for
drugs or alcohol, the Guidelines provide only one sanction:
termination of employment.
[101]     Howard Moyer, the manager of Imperial Oil's Policy,
acknowledged in his evidence before the Board that employees in
safety-sensitive positions testing positive for drugs or alcohol
would be given no individual accommodation.  In his view “certain
corporate minimums” had to be maintained.  According to Moyer,
unless the employee can explain a positive finding, the employee
is fired.          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   For   safety-sensitive  positions,   the
	  automatic  consequence  for a first violation
	  for presence in the body would be termination
	  of employment.          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I  would  quarrel  with  the  use of the
          term “Automatic”.  We certainly go through an
          in-depth  investigative  process  with   each
          random  position that we have, but  if  there
          isn't a reasonable explanation of that,  then
          the result for a person in a safety-sensitive
          job is termination.</pre>
    <pre>[102]      Automatic termination of employment for all  employees
after a single positive test is broader than necessary.  In  some
cases termination may be justified; but in others, the employee's
circumstances may call for a less severe sanction.  Imperial  Oil
failed  to  demonstrate why it could not tailor its sanctions  to
accommodate  individual  capabilities  without  incurring   undue
hardship.
[103]     Pre-employment drug testing suffers from the same two
flaws:  a positive test does not show future impairment or even
likely future impairment on the job, yet an applicant who tests
positive only once is not hired.
[104]     In this court Imperial Oil submitted that the Board
mischaracterized the underlying workplace standard the company
sought to achieve by drug testing.  The Board characterized the
standard as “freedom from impairment.”  Imperial Oil argued that
the standard is what the Policy says, “no presence” of drugs or
their metabolites.  Imperial Oil contended that in the interests
of safety it is legitimately entitled to adopt a “no presence”
standard, that does not depend for its efficacy on the discovery
of impairment.
[105]     There are two answers to Imperial Oil’s submission.
First, the Board’s finding that the standard was “freedom from
impairment” by drugs is a finding of fact, which is reasonably
supported by the evidence and thus is entitled to deference.
Second, the “no presence” standard does not assist Imperial Oil
because it too is arbitrary, again for the reason that a positive
drug test does not demonstrate incapability to perform the work
safely.  Therefore, the drug testing provisions of the Policy are
not BFORs.
[106]     The provisions for random alcohol testing for employees
in safety-sensitive positions stand on a different footing.
Breathalyzer testing can show impairment.  The expert evidence at
the hearing confirmed the reliability and utility of breathalyzer
testing to measure alcohol impairment, and the Commission
conceded its reliability and utility. The Commission also took no
issue with the standard used by Imperial Oil, .04 per cent.
Studies indicated that with a blood alcohol concentration of .04
per cent most individuals show discernible signs of impairment.
Admittedly the effects of alcohol on an individual will vary
depending on a wide array of factors:  size, age, sex, body
metabolism, body fat, the amount of food in the stomach, acquired
tolerance, stress and fatigue.  Despite individual variability,
we use a bright line standard – 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100
mililitres of blood – in the criminal law for drinking and
driving offences. The standard used by Imperial Oil was
reasonable to ensure workplace safety.
[107]     Despite the overwhelming expert evidence and the
Commission's concession, the Board seemed unconvinced of the
utility of breathalyzer testing to measure impairment.  Moreover,
she disagreed that random alcohol testing was reasonably
necessary for employees in safety-sensitive positions.  She held
that “the provisions of the Policy that provide for random
alcohol testing are unlawful because [Imperial Oil] failed to
prove such screening is reasonably necessary to deter alcohol
impairment on the job.”  In her opinion other less drastic means
existed to deter alcohol impairment on the job.  Those means
included various kinds of employee supervision and assessment
programs.
[108]     I find the evidence the Board relied on weak and her
reasoning unpersuasive.  The Board gave great weight to the
evidence of Dr. Shain, the head of workplace programs at the
Addiction Research Foundation, even though he had no practical
experience with drug and alcohol testing in the workplace.  Dr.
Shain thought that other programs were more effective in
eliminating alcohol abuse.  In his opinion, properly trained
supervisors had a “very high likelihood of being able to detect
impairment” on the job.  His opinion fails to appreciate that
Imperial Oil does use trained supervisors to detect impairment,
but in conjunction with breathalyzer testing.  Most important,
however, Dr. Shain's opinion fails to adequately appreciate that
a safety-sensitive position is one that by definition has no
direct or very limited supervision.
[109]     Relying exclusively on supervisors to detect impairment
raises additional concerns, also addressed in the expert evidence
before the Board.  Supervisors have other duties; at Imperial Oil
their primary focus is to direct the manufacture of petroleum
products.  Supervisors are often unwilling to confront employees
with an alcohol problem, or at least to do so constructively.
And, increased supervision may lead to harassment of or even
discrimination against some employees.  Random testing is seen by
many experts to be fairer to employees because of its
objectivity.
[110]     Imperial Oil can legitimately take steps to deter and
detect alcohol impairment among its employees in safety-sensitive
jobs.  Alcohol testing accomplishes this goal.  For employees in
safety-sensitive jobs, where supervision is limited or non-
existent, alcohol testing is a reasonable requirement.
[111]     The Commission’s “Policy Statement on Drugs and Alcohol
Testing” recognizes that an employer can administer alcohol
testing to its employees without contravening the Code.  The
Commission’s Policy Statement provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>If workers will be required to undergo drug and alcohol
testing during the course of their employment – on the 
grounds that such testing, at the time that it is 
administered, would indicate actual impairment of 
ability to perform or fulfil the essential duties or 
requirements of the job, as opposed to merely detecting 
the presence of substances in the system – the employer
should notify them of this requirement at the beginning 
of their employment.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Because  alcohol  testing  does indicate  “actual  impairment  of
ability to perform or fulfil the essential duties or requirements
of  the  job,  as  opposed to merely detecting  the  presence  of
substances  in  the  system” and because  Imperial  Oil’s  Policy
fairly notifies employees in safety-sensitive positions that they
will  have  to  undergo random alcohol testing, such  testing  is
consistent  with the Commission’s Policy Statement.  I  think  it
significant  that  the  intervener, who vigorously  opposed  drug
testing, took no position on alcohol testing in the workplace.
[112]      However, random alcohol testing though reasonable  for
employees  in safety-sensitive jobs, will not satisfy  the  third
step of the Meiorin test unless Imperial Oil has met its duty  to
accommodate  the needs of those who test positive.  The  Policy's
Guidelines  provide  for  dismissal from employment  following  a
single  positive test. The Board did not discuss the question  of
individual accommodation following a positive breathalyzer  test.
However,  for  the  reasons I discussed in connection  with  drug
testing,  dismissal  in all cases is inconsistent  with  Imperial
Oil's duty to accommodate. To maintain random alcohol testing  as
a  BFOR,  Imperial  Oil  is  required to  accommodate  individual
differences and capabilities to the point of undue hardship. That
accommodation  should  include consideration  of  sanctions  less
severe  than  dismissal  and,  where appropriate,  the  necessary
support  to  permit  the employee to undergo  a  treatment  or  a
rehabilitation program.
[113]     I would therefore set aside the Board’s conclusion that
random alcohol testing for employees in safety-sensitive
positions breaches the Code and in its place hold that this
testing is a BFOR provided the sanction for an employee testing
positive is tailored to the employee’s circumstances.          </pre>
    <pre><strong>(c)   Drug testing post-incident and for cause</strong></pre>
    <pre>[114]      The  Policy provides testing for alcohol and specified
drugs  “after a significant work accident, incident or near  miss
as  determined by management” and “where reasonable cause  exists
to suspect alcohol or drug use or possession in violation of this
Policy.”   The  Commission  accepted  that  alcohol  testing  was
sufficiently related to job performance to justify its use  post-
incident or for cause and the Board made no ruling on this issue.
The  Board did, however, conclude that drug testing post-incident
or for cause was permissible only if Imperial Oil could establish
that  it  was  “necessary as one facet of a larger assessment  of
drug abuse.”  Although the Board did not elaborate on what larger
assessment  is  required, her conclusion is consistent  with  the
evidence  and  her  finding that drug testing  cannot  accurately
measure  impairment.  I would, therefore, not interfere with  the
Divisional Court’s order upholding the Board’s conclusion on drug
testing post-incident and for cause.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Fourth  Issue  –  Did the Divisional Court err in  upholding  the
Board’s  conclusion  that the Policy’s provisions  for  mandatory
disclosure, reassignment, reinstatement and certification violate
the Code?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[115]      Entrop’s  original  complaint  of  discrimination  was
directed  at  the  Policy  provisions for  mandatory  disclosure,
reassignment  and  reinstatement.  The Board concluded  that  the
mandatory  disclosure, reassignment and reinstatement  provisions
violated  the Code.  She concluded that alcohol and drug  testing
for   certification  for  safety-sensitive  positions  and  post-
reinstatement  may be permissible if Imperial Oil “can  establish
that  testing  is necessary as one facet of a larger  process  of
assessment”  of  alcohol  or drug abuse.   The  Divisional  Court
upheld her conclusions and I would too.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(a)  Are the provisions for mandatory disclosure, reassignment
     and reinstatement prima facie discriminatory?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[116]      The Policy requires any employee in a safety-sensitive
position  to disclose a current or past substance abuse  problem.
On disclosure, that employee is automatically reassigned to a non-
safety-sensitive job.  The employee can only be reinstated  to  a
safety-sensitive   position   by   undergoing   two   years    of
rehabilitation,  followed  by five years  of  abstinence  and  by
agreeing to a set of post-reinstatement controls.
[117]     A substance abuse problem – which triggers the
provisions for disclosure, reassignment and reinstatement – is
defined in the Policy’s Administrative Guidelines to include:</pre>
    <pre>          For purposes of the Policy, an employee has or 
	  has had a substance abuse problem if he or she
	  meets one or more of the following criteria:</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  Episodic Abuse</pre>
    <pre>          Has continued to use alcohol or drugs despite
	  knowledge of recurring disturbances in health,
	  work or social functioning.         </pre>
    <pre>          …          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  Dependence          </pre>
    <pre>          Has developed a physical and/or psychological
	  dependence characterized by:</pre>
    <pre>          (i)   progressive  loss  of  control  despite
          either a desire to reduce intake or knowledge
          of  recurring disturbances in health, work or
          social functioning;          </pre>
    <pre>          (ii)  a pattern of tolerance and withdrawal.  </pre>
    <pre>           …          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  Treatment          </pre>
    <pre>          Has  participated in  a   structured  program
          of  counselling,  therapy or other  treatment
          for  alcohol  or  drug  abuse  (episodic   or
          dependence).</pre>
    <pre>[118]     The Board found that a “substance abuse problem”  is  a
handicap.   That finding is supported by the expert evidence  and
is  not  challenged  on appeal.  Entrop had a previous  substance
problem as defined in the Policy.  He therefore had a handicap as
defined in the Code.  Although he had not a drink since 1984, the
Policy required him to disclose his substance abuse problem,  his
past  handicap, to management.  On disclosure, he was  reassigned
to  a  less  desirable  job, though at comparable  pay,  and  was
reinstated  only after agreeing to a rigorous medical  evaluation
and ongoing controls.  Entrop therefore was adversely affected in
his  employment  because  of his past handicap.   Imperial  Oil’s
treatment  of  him  and  the  Policy’s provisions  for  mandatory
disclosure, reassignment and reinstatement are, therefore,  prima
facie discriminatory.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(b)   Are the provisions for mandatory disclosure, reassignment 
      and reinstatement BFORs?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[119]     Imperial Oil has met the first two steps of the Meiorin
test.   A  workforce unimpaired by alcohol or drugs is rationally
connected to – indeed is essential to – the work done by Imperial
Oil  employees in safety-sensitive jobs, and Imperial Oil adopted
these Policy provisions honestly and in good faith.
[120]      The contentious question is whether Imperial  Oil  has
shown  that  the  Policy  provisions  for  mandatory  disclosure,
automatic reassignment and reinstatement are reasonably necessary
to ensure that employees working in safety-sensitive jobs are not
impaired  by  alcohol or drugs.  In my view,  the  provisions  as
drafted are not reasonably necessary to accomplish Imperial Oil’s
purpose.  The provisions fail the third step in the Meiorin  test
for at least four reasons.
[121]     First, requiring an employee to disclose a past
substance abuse problem, no matter how far in the past, is an
unreasonable requirement.  As the Commission acknowledged,
Imperial Oil is entitled to require disclosure of a current
substance abuse problem and a past substance abuse problem to a
point.  That point is reached when the risk of relapse or
recurrence is no greater than the risk a member of the general
population will suffer a substance abuse problem.  On the expert
evidence before her, the Board found that the cut-off point is
five to six years of successful remission for a person with a
previous alcohol abuse problem and six years of successful
remission for a person with a previous drug abuse problem.  Had
the Policy provisions on mandatory disclosure been tailored to
these cut-off points, I would have found them unobjectionable.
[122]     Second, automatic reassignment out of a safety-
sensitive position following disclosure of a past substance abuse
problem is not reasonably necessary either.  Automatic
reassignment cannot be justified because it follows a mandatory
disclosure obligation that itself is too broad.  More important,
automatic reassignment fails to accommodate individual
differences and capabilities.  Although Imperial Oil may be
justified in temporarily removing an employee with an active or
recently-active substance abuse problem from a safety-sensitive
job, it failed to establish that a single rule, automatic
reassignment, was reasonably necessary in all cases.  To use the
words in Meiorin at p. 28, Imperial Oil failed to show that it
could not accommodate “individual testing against a more
individually sensitive standard” without imposing undue hardship
on the company.
[123]     Entrop’s case is a good example of why the Policy
provisions for mandatory disclosure and automatic reassignment
are not reasonably necessary.  The evidence showed that his risk
of relapse was extremely low and that his past alcohol abuse had
not adversely affected his performance as a control board
operator.  In short, he was not incapable of performing his job
because of his past alcohol abuse.  Even so, and though he had
been in remission for over seven years, once he disclosed his
previous handicap, he was automatically reassigned.  In applying
the Policy provisions to Entrop without considering his
individual circumstances, Imperial Oil’s treatment of him was
unjustified.
[124]     A third and related reason why these Policy provisions
are not reasonably  necessary is that the requirement of two
years’ rehabilitation followed by five years’ abstinence is
overly broad.  The Board concluded that “a minimum seven year
period between the date of reassignment and potential
reinstatement” contravenes the Code “because this length of time
is not necessary in all cases.”  I agree with that conclusion,
which again is supported by the expert evidence led at the
hearing.  Indeed, the seven year period is required even for
those who have successfully completed a treatment program because
“substance abuse problem” as defined in the Policy includes
participation in a “structured program of counselling, therapy or
other treatment.”  Imperial Oil did not show that a single seven
year rule was needed and that it could not without undue hardship
accommodate differences in how quickly individuals recover from a
substance abuse problem.
[125]     Fourth, as the Board also concluded, “the mandatory
conditions and undertakings for reinstatement are unlawful since
the evidence shows this is more than is necessary in certain
instances.”  Imperial Oil may legitimately insist on placing
special controls for a period of time on an employee with a
previous substance abuse problem who is returned to a safety-
sensitive position.  But the controls must be tailored to the
individual’s circumstances to meet the accommodation requirement.
[126]     The controls initially demanded by Imperial Oil apply
to all employees reinstated to a safety-sensitive position after
disclosure of a past substance abuse problem.  Many are onerous.
For example, the employee must attend a self-help group
(apparently indefinitely), must commit “to report to Imperial
Oil’s Occupational Health Division any changes in his/her
circumstances that may significantly increase the risk of
relapse”, must commit “to report to his/her supervisor/manager
compliance with the above conditions on a periodic basis to be
determined by the review panel”, and must commit “to undergo
annual medical examinations, including screening for alcohol and
drug abuse, conducted by Imperial's Occupational Health
Division”.  These controls can be modified over time but to
require them at all for employees like Entrop cannot be
justified.
[127]     For these reasons, Imperial Oil has failed to meet the
third step of the Meiorin test.  The provisions for mandatory
disclosure, reinstatement and reassignment cannot, therefore, be
justified as BFORs.          </pre>
    <pre><strong>(c)   Testing for certification and post-reinstatement</strong></pre>
    <pre>[128]     Under the Policy, employees hired into, promoted to  or
transferred   to   safety-sensitive   jobs   are   required    to
satisfactorily complete a certification process, which includes a
negative  result on an alcohol and drug test.  Employees  with  a
past  substance  abuse problem wishing to be  reinstated  into  a
safety-sensitive job must also complete the certification process
and “post-reinstatement” may be required to undergo “frequent and
unannounced testing in addition to random testing.”
[129]     The Board concluded that testing for certification or
post-reinstatement did not contravene the Code provided it was
part of a larger assessment to determine whether an employee was
not merely using but was abusing alcohol or drugs.  Under the
Policy, however, alcohol and drug testing is but one part of the
certification process and but one of the post-reinstatement
controls.  Both certification and reinstatement controls are
intended to ensure that employees in safety-sensitive positions
are not impaired by alcohol or drugs on the job.  The Board did
not discuss or make any findings whether either the certification
process as a whole or the post-reinstatement controls as a whole
was a satisfactory method of assessing substance abuse.  I
therefore think it unnecessary to interfere with the Board’s
conclusions on testing for certification and post-reinstatement.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Fifth  Issue – Did the Board err in concluding that Imperial  Oil
infringed s.13(1) of the Code by distributing its Policy  to  its
employees?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[130]      In  her last interim decision, in an appendix  to  her
reasons, the Board concluded that Imperial Oil infringed  s.13(1)
of  the Code by distributing the Policy and supporting literature
to its employees.  Section 13(1) provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>13. – (1)   A right under Part I is infringed by a 
person who publishes or displays before the public or 
causes the publication or display before the public of 
any notice, sign, symbol, emblem, or other similar 
representation that indicates the intention of the 
person to infringe a right under Part I or that is 
intended by the person to incite the infringement of a
right under Part I.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[131]      The  Board concluded that the posting and printing  of
the   Policy  and  its  distribution  together  with  educational
awareness materials to Imperial Oil’s workforce amounted to  “the
publication  or  display before the public” of a  “notice”  under
s.13(1).   She then held that, to the extent the Policy  violated
the Code, this publication and display “indicated the intention …
to infringe a right” under the statute.  The Divisional Court did
not  expressly address the Board’s conclusion that  Imperial  Oil
infringed s.13(1).
[132]     In my view, the Board’s conclusion that Imperial Oil
infringed s.13(1) should be set aside.  The possible breach of
s.13(1) only became an issue before the Board as one of the
grounds she relied on to confer jurisdiction over the alcohol and
drug testing provisions of the Policy.  Earlier in these reasons,
I expressed the view that s.13(1) could not be used to expand the
Board’s jurisdiction.  However, even if the Board could properly
consider s.13, in my view, the respondents have failed to
establish that Imperial Oil breached this provision.
[133]     Even accepting that the posting of the Policy and its
distribution to Imperial Oil’s employees amounted to the
publication of a “notice”, to contravene s.13(1), the notice must
indicate an intention to infringe a right under the Code.  The
evidence does not reasonably support the conclusion that the
Policy indicates an intention to discriminate.  The Board did not
discuss the question of intention.  Intention might be inferred
from the Board’s finding that alcohol and drug testing under the
Policy amounted to direct discrimination on the ground of
handicap.  However, in her sixth interim decision, the Board
found that Imperial Oil was justified in insisting that its
employees in safety-sensitive positions not be impaired by
alcohol or drugs and that the company had developed and
implemented the Policy in good faith to achieve a workplace free
of impairment.  These findings are inconsistent with the finding
that the Policy indicates an intention to discriminate.
[134]     Also, the Board did not even consider s.13(2) of the
Code, which provides that s.13(1)  “shall not interfere with
freedom of expression or opinion.”3  Even apart from s.13(2),
however, for the reasons I have stated, I would set aside the
Board’s finding that Imperial Oil infringed s.13(1) of the Code.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Sixth  Issue – Did the Divisional Court err in holding  that  the
Board’s  finding  that  Imperial Oil  infringed  Entrop’s  rights
“wilfully  and  recklessly”  was  reasonably  supported  by   the
evidence?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[135]      In her seventh interim decision, the Board dealt  with
monetary  compensation for Entrop.  She awarded him $1,241.93  in
special  damages  for lost overtime because of his  reassignment,
$10,000.00  in  general  damages  to  compensate  him  for   “the
intrinsic   value”  of  the  infringement  of  his  rights,   and
$10,000.00  for  mental  anguish, for “the  wilful  and  reckless
manner” of the infringement.  Imperial Oil attacks only the award
for damages for mental anguish.  It submits the evidence does not
show  that the company’s conduct was “wilful and reckless”.   The
Divisional Court rejected this submission and I would too.
[136]     Two aspects of Imperial Oil’s conduct support the
award.  First, the Board accepted Entrop’s evidence of the
adverse effect on him of the job reinstatement process.  This
process was lengthy and intrusive for a problem, alcohol abuse,
that Entrop fairly believed he had conquered.  The process
demeaned him and ostracized him with his co-workers, thus causing
him stress and anxiety.  At the very least, Imperial Oil acted
recklessly in subjecting Entrop to this process.
[137]     Second, Imperial Oil took a number of actions, which
the Board ruled amounted to acts of reprisal against Entrop for
having brought a human rights complaint.  These actions included
the aggressive monitoring of his work performance, pressuring him
to withdraw his complaint, interfering with his ability to
function as an elected delegate to the Joint Industrial Council,
the organization that represents non-unionized employee
interests, unfairly refusing to assign him to light duties
because of his injured knee, and unfairly issuing him a warning
letter when he was unavoidably delayed in reporting for a random
test.  The Board found that at least some of these actions were
taken deliberately by Imperial Oil in retaliation for Entrop’s
filing of a complaint.  That finding is reasonably supported by
the evidence.  In my view, the evidence on Entrop’s reassignment
together with the finding of reprisal support the Board’s
conclusion that Imperial Oil’s conduct was wilful and reckless
and thus justifies the award of damages for mental anguish.  I
would therefore not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[138]     I would allow Imperial Oil’s appeal on three issues:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(i)     I would hold that the Board had no jurisdiction to
        inquire into the drug testing provision of the Policy;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(ii)    I would set aside the Board’s conclusion that random
        alcohol testing for employees in safety sensitive 
	positions violates the Code, and in its place I would
	hold that such testing is a BFOR provided the sanction
	for an employee testing positive is tailored to the
 	employee’s circumstances; and</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(iii)   I would set aside the Board’s conclusion that Imperial 
	Oil infringed s.13(1) of the Code and would dismiss that 
	part of Entrop’s complaint.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[139]      In  all  other respects, I would dismiss  the  appeal.
Because  success  has been divided, I would  make  no  order  for
costs.
