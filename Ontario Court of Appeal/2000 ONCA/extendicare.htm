    <pre>MACPHERSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>Introduction
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   In  Ontario,  all purchasers of tangible personal  property
must  pay  the provincial sales tax.  The Retail Sales  Tax  Act,
R.S.O.  1980,  c.  454,1 defines &#147;sale&#148; to include  a  &#147;lease  or
rental&#148;.  A company that leases equipment must pay the sales  tax
on the fair value of the lease.  The tax is computed, and must be
paid, on the due date of each payment under the lease.  Thus,  if
the  lease  remains in force for its full term, the  lessee  will
pay,  and  the  lessor will collect on behalf of the  government,
sales  tax  corresponding  to each and every  payment  under  the
lease.
[2]  In a competitive marketplace, it is not unusual for a
company to run into difficulties.  If it has leased business
equipment from another company, it might have trouble keeping up
with its lease payments.  Most commercial leases contain
provisions dealing with such a contingency.  Not surprisingly,
these provisions will usually be of substantial benefit to the
lessor.  A standard provision of this type is what is known as a
liquidated damages clause.  This clause permits a lessor, faced
with a breach of a lease by the lessee, to recover as damages all
unpaid amounts payable for the entire duration of the lease.
[3]  Of course, a lessor may have trouble collecting pursuant to
a liquidated damages clause.  Litigation is time-consuming and
costly, results are not certain, and execution on a judgment is
not inevitable.  Thus, it may be in the lessor&#146;s interests to
negotiate a settlement with a defaulting lessee rather than stand
on its strict legal rights. Similarly, it may also be in the
lessee&#146;s best interests to negotiate a settlement, perhaps to
avoid litigation or a poor reputation in the business community.
[4]  If the parties successfully negotiate a settlement, the
usual result is that the leased equipment is returned to the
lessor and the lessee pays the lessor a sum of money to
compensate for the unused portion of the lease.  The compensation
is not a regular lease payment because the lease has been
breached. Nor is the compensation a judgment against the lessee;
the matter did not proceed that far.
[5]  What is the status, for purposes of Ontario&#146;s sales tax
regime, of such a compensation payment? Must the lessee pay, and
the lessor collect, sales tax corresponding to the amount of the
compensation payment?  Or is such a payment outside the sales tax
regime?  These are the questions posed by this appeal.  The
questions arise in the context of a failed lease of computer
equipment which gave rise to a negotiated settlement by which a
lessee paid a substantial amount of compensation ($1,749,000) to
the lessor.  Can the provincial government collect sales tax on
this compensation?</pre>
    <pre>A.   Factual Background</pre>
    <pre>     (1)  The parties and the relevant events
     
[6]   The  parties  prepared,  and placed  before  Boland  J.,  a
Special  Case  which contains a detailed history of  the  factual
circumstances giving rise to the litigation.  It is  unnecessary,
for  purposes of this appeal, to reprint the entire Special Case.
In my view, it is possible to summarize the essential facts so as
to  provide sufficient background for the legal analysis which is
required in order to dispose of the appeal.
[7]  The appellant, Extendicare International Inc.
(&#147;Extendicare&#148;),2 leased computer equipment from Canada Lease
Financing Ltd. (&#147;Canada Lease&#148;) under a Master Equipment Lease
Agreement (&#147;the lease&#148;) dated May 10, 1982.  By executing various
schedules to the lease, Extendicare entered into three
contractual leases of various computer equipment.  The three
contractual leases had effective dates of October 28, 1983,
January 31, 1985 and April 30, 1985.  Their durations were,
respectively, 50, 38 and 48 months.  One of the provisions of
both the main lease and the three contractual leases required
Extendicare to pay to Canada Lease retail sales tax in respect of
the monthly lease payments.
[8]  Clause 13 of the lease dealt with the situation of a default
by Extendicare.  It gave Canada Lease several options, including
terminating the lease and/or commencing an action for liquidated
damages:
          </pre>
    <pre>            13.        DEFAULT</pre>
    <pre>            &#133;  Lessor  may  at its option  declare
            this  Agreement to be in  default  and
            may do one or more of the following:
            </pre>
    <pre>            (a)  terminate this Agreement and Lessee&#146;s
	    right to possession of the equipment&#133;;
            </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>            (c)  demand and recover as damages the
	    present value of the aggregate of all
	    unpaid amounts payable hereunder as rental
	    to the expiration of the term of the lease
	    of the Equipment &#133; together with all
	    additional rental and other amounts due
            hereunder to Lessor, and Lessee agrees
	    that such amounts are a genuine pre-estimate
	    of the damages that would be suffered by
            lessor and are liquidated damages and not 
	    a penalty.
</pre>
    <pre>[9]   In  July 1986, while all of the leases were still in force,
Extendicare  notified Canada Lease that it  would  no  longer  be
using  the  leased equipment, and would no longer be  making  the
agreed  monthly payments.  Canada Lease treated this as a  breach
of  the lease.  At that juncture, the present value of all unpaid
rental   amounts   under   the  three  contractual   leases   was
$3,307,618.23.  By virtue of clause 13 of the lease, Canada Lease
could have demanded at least that sum as damages.
[10] Extendicare and Canada Lease entered into negotiations which
were successful.  On September 18, 1996, Canada Lease agreed to
release Extendicare from any further obligation to make monthly
lease payments under two of the contractual leases upon payment
by Extendicare of $1,000,000.  Extendicare made this payment on
September 22, 1986.  On December 17, 1986, the two companies
agreed to a similar arrangement with respect to the third
contractual lease.  The payment under this arrangement was fixed
at $749,000.  Extendicare made this payment by December 31, 1986.
[11] Canada Lease did not charge, and Extendicare did not pay,
any sales tax with respect to the two payments.  After Canada
Lease received the payments, it repossessed the computer
equipment.  Extendicare had no further use of it.
[12] The respondent Minister of Revenue (&#147;the Minister&#148;)
subsequently conducted an audit of Extendicare&#146;s business.  The
Ministry concluded that Extendicare was liable to pay sales tax
on the $1,749,000 it had paid to Canada Lease.  On January 14,
1988, the Ministry issued a Notice of Assessment against
Extendicare for $122,430 plus interest.
[13] The Minister&#146;s decision and Notice of Assessment were based
on its interpretation of certain provisions of the Retail Sales
Tax Act.  For purposes of this appeal, the crucial provision is
s. 2 which provides in relevant parts:</pre>
    <pre>          2(1)  Every    purchaser    of    tangible
                personal   property,   except    the
                classes  thereof  referred   to   in
                subsection  (2), shall  pay  to  Her
                Majesty  in right of Ontario  a  tax
                in  respect  of  the consumption  or
                use  thereof, computed at  the  rate
                of  7  percent  of  the  fair  value
                thereof.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2(6)  Notwithstanding  subsection  5   and
                section 10, where a purchaser,
                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>           (b)  acquires tangible personal property at
		a sale that is the lease or rental to 
		him of such tangible personal property 
		without provision for the transfer to 
		him of title thereto, or with the
                provision of such transfer only upon the 
		exercise of an option or similar right 
		to acquire such tangible personal property,
           </pre>
    <pre>          the  tax  imposed by this Act  shall  be
          computed, paid and collected on the  due
          date  of, and on the fair value  of  the
          consideration given in payment of,  each
          rental  payment by or on behalf  of  the
          purchaser  in  respect of the  lease  or
          rental   of  such  taxable  service   or
          tangible  personal  property,  and   tax
          shall,  in  addition, be computed,  paid
          and collected at the time of, and on the
          fair value of the consideration given in
          payment  for,  each of the obtaining  of
          any  option or similar right to purchase
          the tangible personal property leased or
          rented  or  the exercising of  any  such
          option   or   similar  right.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[14]  It can be seen that two of the pivotal concepts in s. 2  of
the  Act are &#147;purchaser&#148; and &#147;tangible personal property&#148;.   Both
of  these concepts are defined in s. 1 of the Act, the definition
section:</pre>
    <pre>       1.   In this Act, &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>            13. &#147;purchaser&#148; means a consumer or person
		who acquires tangible personal property &#133;
		for his own consumption or use&#133;;
                               &#133;..
            </pre>
    <pre>            19. &#147;tangible personal property&#148; means personal 
		property that can be seen, weighed, measured, 
		felt or touched, or that is in any way 
		perceptible to the senses, and includes 
		natural gas, and manufactured gas;</pre>
    <pre>[15] On July 8, 1988, Extendicare filed a Notice of Objection  to
the  assessment.   Relying on s. 2(6) of the  Act,  it  took  the
position  that  sales tax was payable only on the monthly  rental
payments  under the lease.  The two payments totalling $1,749,000
it made to Canada Lease arose after it had breached the lease and
ceased making monthly rental payments.  The two payments were  in
the  nature  of settlement payments made to Canada Lease  because
Canada  Lease had a strong legal basis for suing Extendicare  for
breach  of the lease.  These settlement payments were not  rental
payments pursuant to the lease.  Nor were they payments for  &#147;the
consumption or use&#148; of the computer equipment.
[16] On July 6, 1989, the Acting Assistant Deputy Minister
confirmed the Notice of Assessment against Extendicare.
Extendicare decided to appeal the assessment.  The parties were
able to agree on the statement of a Special Case pursuant to Rule
22 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.
(2)  The litigation
</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The  appeal by way of Special Case was heard by  Boland  J.
The question posed in the Special Case was:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Were  the  payments  of  $1,000,000  and
          $749,000  (the &#147;Payments&#148;) made  by  the
          Appellant  to Canada Lease  as described
          in  paragraphs  14  and  16  subject  to
          retail sales tax under the Act?</pre>
    <pre>[18]  In  a  decision  rendered on October 26,  1998,  Boland  J.
dismissed Extendicare&#146;s appeal and answered the above question in
the  affirmative.  She considered the relevant provisions of  the
lease  and of the Retail Sales Act.  The essence of her reasoning
is contained in these passages:

          The    covenant   to   pay   rent    was
          unconditional and absolute and Clause 13
          provides  that the lessee&#146;s  obligations
          shall  survive termination of the  lease
          agreement.   The refusal to pay  further
          monthly  payments was an obvious default
          under the lease agreement which entitled
          Canada  Lease,  among other  things,  to
          terminate  their  lease  agreement   and
          demand   and  recover  as  damages   the
          present  value of the aggregate  of  all
          unpaid  amounts payable under the  lease
          as  rental to the expiration of the term
          of   the   lease   agreement.    Surely,
          negotiation    payments    ending     in
          cancellation of the lease rather than  a
          law suit to enforce it, cannot alter the
          fact or the intent that the payment  was
          for  arrears  of rent and  other  moneys
          owing  under  the lease  agreement.   It
          seems to me it is immaterial whether  or
          not  Canada  Lease chose  to  accept  an
          amount  less than the present  value  of
          the  unmatured  rental payments,  rather
          than  engage in litigation.  In my view,
          as   the   lease  agreement  termination
          payments were paid to the lessor of  the
          equipment, they cannot be divorced  from
          the original lease agreement.
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>          I  am  satisfied that the scheme of  the
          legislation contemplated the payment  of
          retail  sales  tax calculated  upon  all
          amounts paid by a Lessee, regardless  of
          how  the  parties choose to characterize
          the  payment.  The termination  payments
          were  made  in response to the  debt  of
          rent  owing and were calculated  on  the
          bases of the three variables set out  in
          the   lease  agreement.   I   find   the
          Appellant  was  properly assessed  under
          the   Act   for  rental  payments   made
          pursuant   to   a  lease  agreement   of
          computer equipment.
</pre>
    <pre>[19] Extendicare appeals from Boland J.&#146;s decision.</pre>
    <pre>B.      Issue
</pre>
    <pre>[20] There is a single issue in this appeal: were the payments of
$1,000,000  and  $749,000  made by Extendicare  to  Canada  Lease
subject to retail sales tax under the Retail Sales Tax Act?
</pre>
    <pre>C.   Analysis
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  I begin my analysis by noting a number of matters on  which
there  is  no dispute. Canada Lease was a &#147;vendor&#148; as defined  in
the  Retail  Sales  Tax Act.  Extendicare was  a  &#147;purchaser&#148;  of
&#147;tangible personal property&#148; because the definition of &#147;sale&#148;  in
the  Act  included  &#147;lease or rental&#148;.   Thus,  while  the  three
contractual leases were in force, Extendicare always  paid  sales
tax on its monthly rental payments.
[22] Against this background, it is necessary to characterize the
$1,000,000 and $749,000 payments made by Extendicare to Canada
Lease.  The Minister&#146;s submission is that Extendicare&#146;s
obligation to pay rent did not end with its breach of the lease,
and the two post-breach payments could reasonably be considered
rental payments under the lease agreement.
[23] I do not agree with this submission.  Extendicare defaulted
under the lease.  It informed Canada Lease that it would make no
further rent payments and that it would not continue to use the
leased computer equipment.  The negotiations between the parties
that ensued were conducted in the context of a breach of the
lease.
[24] On this point, a particularly relevant case is Keneric
Tractor Sales Ltd. v. Langille, [1987] 2 S.C.R 440.  In that
case, a lessee defaulted on a lease of farm equipment.  The
lessor seized the equipment and commenced an action claiming
damages resulting from breach of the lease.  Although the
principal issue in the case was the calculation of damages for
breach of a chattel lease, Wilson J., speaking for a unanimous
court, enunciated some general propositions relevant to the
present appeal.  She said, at pp. 453-54:</pre>
    <pre>          [W]e must go back to first principles in
          the  law of contract.  If a party  to  a
          contract  breaches a term of  sufficient
          importance the other party has the right
          to  treat the contract as terminated and
          consider  himself  discharged  from  any
          further  obligations under  it  &#133;  .  An
          identical  right arises where one  party
          to   a  contract  by  words  or  conduct
          indicates  to  the other party  that  he
          does   not   intend   to   perform   his
          contractual obligations.  In the  latter
          instance the first party is said to have
          repudiated the contract &#133; .
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;   Thus,   there   is   no   conceptual
          difference between a breach of  contract
          that  gives the innocent party the right
          to  terminate and the repudiation  of  a
          contract &#133; .
          
</pre>
    <pre>[25]  In  the  present appeal, Extendicare breached a fundamental
term  of  the  contract &#150; it refused to make its lease  payments.
Moreover,  it repudiated the contract &#150; it informed Canada  Lease
that it did not intend to perform its contractual obligations.
[26] What then were the consequences of Extendicare&#146;s breach and
repudiation of the contract?  In the passage from Keneric Tractor
set out above, Wilson J. stated that a consequence of the breach
of an important contractual term by one party is that &#147;the other
party has the right to treat the contract as terminated&#148;.  That
is one of the rights, at common law, that Canada Lease possessed
after Extendicare breached the contract.  Moreover, it is worth
recalling that clause 13(a) of the lease expressly gave this same
right to Canada Lease.
[27] Canada Lease had a second right, at common law and under the
terms of the lease.  It could commence an action against
Extendicare and seek damages.  In Keneric Tractor, Wilson J.
said, at p. 455:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  modern view is that when one  party
          repudiates  the contract and  the  other
          party   accepts   the  repudiation   the
          contract is at this point terminated  or
          brought to an end.  The contract is not,
          however,  rescinded in  the  true  legal
          sense,  i.e.,  in  the  sense  of  being
          voided   ab  initio  by  some  vitiating
          element.  The parties are discharged  of
          their prospective obligations under  the
          contract as from the date of termination
          but the prospective obligations embodied
          in  the  contract  are relevant  to  the
          assessment  of damages: see  Johnson  v.
          Agnew,  [1980] A.C. 367,  [1979]  1  All
          E.R.  883 (H.L.) and Moschi v.  Lep  Air
          Services Ltd., [1973] A.C. 331, [1972] 2
          All E.R. 393 (H.L.). Such is the law for
          contracts generally and it is  this  law
          which  should apply equally to  breaches
          of chattel leases. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[28]  This  statement  of  the common law  position  was,  again,
replicated  in  the lease.  Clause 13(c) is a liquidated  damages
clause  which  entitled Canada Lease to &#147;demand  and  recover  as
damages  the present value of the aggregate of all unpaid amounts
payable as rental to the expiration of the term of the lease&#148;.
[29] Against the backdrop of these legal options, the parties
entered into negotiations.  Canada Lease insisted that
Extendicare had breached the lease.  Canada Lease did not
terminate the lease immediately, as it was entitled to do.
Rather, it held Extendicare to the terms of the lease while
negotiations ensued.
[30] The negotiations were successful.  With respect to two of
the three contractual leases, an agreement was reached on
September 18, 1986.  An exchange of correspondence on that date
between representatives of the two companies documented the
contents of the agreement.  Howard Strolicht of Extendicare wrote
to Gordon Levoy of Canada Lease:

       2.   We will pay you an amount of $1,000,000 (one
	    million Canadian dollars) for a complete and
	    final release from all our commitments on
	    the machine to you, or to whom you have assigned
            the leases.  The payment will take place no	 
	    later than Tuesday, September 23, 1986. [Emphasis
	    added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[31] Mr. Levoy&#146;s letter to Mr. Strolicht stated:</pre>
    <pre>            This  letter is to confirm  that  upon
            receipt  of  payment of  $1,000,000.00
            Crowntek    will    no    longer    be
            responsible for the lease  payment  of
            $125,072.00  for  Schedule  No.  8  of
            Master  Lease  No. 591  or  the  lease
            payment  of  $24,007.36  for  Schedule
            No.   20  of  Master  Lease  No.  591.
            [Emphasis added.]

</pre>
    <pre>[32]  Extendicare paid Canada Lease $1,000,000 on  September  22,
1986.
[33] Negotiations continued with respect to the third contractual
lease.  They, too, were successful.  On December 17, 1986, Mr.
Levoy of Canada Lease wrote to Mr. Strolicht at Extendicare:</pre>
    <pre>           Please    take   this   letter   as    our
           authorization  to  cancel   the   3083   E
           portion  of  Lease No. 591,  Schedule  No.
           21&#133;
           </pre>
    <pre>           This  cancellation will take  effect  upon
           receipt  by  Canada Lease of a payment  of
           $749,000&#133; .  [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[34] Extendicare paid Canada Lease $749,000 by December 31, 1986.
[35] In my view, the negotiations between the parties, and the
two agreements they made, fit precisely within the language of
both Keneric Tractor and clause 13 of the lease.  After
Extendicare breached and repudiated the lease, Canada Lease could
have terminated it immediately and repossessed the leased
computer equipment.  In addition (or in the alternative), it
could have commenced an action against Extendicare.  The
potential damages it could have sought to recover pursuant to the
main lease and the three contractual leases were $3,307,618.23.
[36] Canada Lease and Extendicare entered into negotiations
against the backdrop of these two options.  The backdrop was not
a continuation of the operation of the lease.  Extendicare had
informed Canada Lease that it would not be making further rent
payments, and Canada Lease appeared to accept this reality.
Accordingly, the negotiations ensued with two shared goals &#150;
first, to persuade Canada Lease to accept Extendicare&#146;s breach
and repudiation of the lease and to exercise its (Canada Lease&#146;s)
right of termination; and second, to forestall a lawsuit by
Canada Lease which, if successful, might net $3,307,618.23 (plus,
presumably, interest and costs).
[37] The parties reached an agreement.  Extendicare paid Canada
Lease $1,749,000, not $3,307,618.23.  In return, Canada Lease
terminated the lease and released Extendicare from all further
obligations under the lease.  The contractual leases were legally
terminated at precisely the same time as Canada Lease received
the two payments of $1,000,000 and $749,000.  That is clear from
the contents of Mr. Levoy&#146;s two letters to Mr. Strolicht.
[38] In summary, Canada Lease is accurate in its description of
the two payments as settlement payments.  The post-breach
negotiations, and the two payments made as a result of those
negotiations, took place under the umbrella of a potential
lawsuit for damages for breach of contract.  The lawsuit was
averted, and the lease was ultimately terminated by Canada Lease.
However, these results were achieved because, and when,
Extendicare paid Canada Lease $1,749,000.
[39] The next question is: are the two settlement payments
negotiated in the context of potential damages for breach of the
lease covered by the Retail Sales Tax Act?  The answer to this
question must be found in the interpretation of ss. 2(1) and 2(6)
of the Act, which for ease of reference I set out again:</pre>
    <pre>          2(1)  Every   purchaser  of   tangible
                personal   property,   except    the
                classes  thereof  referred   to   in
                subsection  (2), shall  pay  to  Her
                Majesty  in right of Ontario  a  tax
                in  respect  of  the consumption  or
                use  thereof, computed at  the  rate
                of  7  percent  of  the  fair  value
                thereof.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2(6)  Notwithstanding  subsection  5   and
                section 10, where a purchaser,
          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
          </pre>
    <pre>            (b) acquires tangible personal property at 
		a sale that is the lease or rental to 
		him of such tangible personal property 
		without provision for the transfer to 
		him of title thereto, or with the
                provision of such transfer only upon the 
		exercise of an option or similar right to 	
		acquire such tangible personal property,
               </pre>
    <pre>          the  tax  imposed by this Act  shall  be
          computed, paid and collected on the  due
          date  of, and on the fair value  of  the
          consideration given in payment of,  each
          rental  payment by or on behalf  of  the
          purchaser  in  respect of the  lease  or
          rental   of  such  taxable  service   or
          tangible  personal  property,  and   tax
          shall,  in  addition, be computed,  paid
          and collected at the time of, and on the
          fair value of the consideration given in
          payment  for,  each of the obtaining  of
          any  option or similar right to purchase
          the tangible personal property leased or
          rented  or  the exercising of  any  such
          option   or   similar  right.  [Emphasis
          added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[40]  Extendicare contends that only s. 2(6) is relevant  to  the
two  payments it made.  Its position is, in effect, that s.  2(6)
is  a  code  for lease situations.  In support of this  position,
Extendicare makes two arguments.  First, s. 2(6) applies  because
it deals specifically with lease situations, whereas s. 2(1) does
not:  generalia specialibus non derogant.  Second, s.  2(1)  does
not  apply to lease situations because it does not make provision
for the time in which the tax is to be paid: see British Columbia
Railway  Company  v. The Queen, [1979] 79 C.T.C.  56  (F.C.T.D.);
aff&#146;d [1981] 81 C.T.C. 110 (F.C.A.).
[41] I disagree with this submission.  Section 2(1) is the
general charging provision.  It identifies all of the relevant
aspects of the tax &#150; who pays (&#147;every purchaser&#148;), for what
(purchases of &#147;tangible personal property&#148;), to whom (&#147;Her
Majesty in right of Ontario&#148;), and how much (&#147;7 percent of the
fair value&#148;).  Moreover, s. 2(6) says that it is to apply
notwithstanding ss. 2(5) and 10; it does not say it is to apply
notwithstanding s. 2(1).  Accordingly, the interpretation of s.
2(1) is central to the legal issue presented by this appeal.
[42] That is not to say, however, that s. 2(6) is irrelevant.  In
my view, the two provisions must be read together.  Section 2(1)
is the general charging section applicable to all sales which, by
definition, includes leases.  Section 2(6) provides additional
information about the relationship between the general sales tax
and leases.
[43] The trial judge considered both ss. 2(1) and 2(6).  She
reasoned:</pre>
    <pre>          Section  2(6)  simply provides  for  the
          time  at which tax was payable on  lease
          or  rental  payments.  In my  view  that
          subsection cannot be regarded as  a  tax
          charging   provision   independent    of
          subsection  2(1).   Had  this  been  the
          intent   of   the  legislature   it   is
          reasonable to assume it would have  been
          clearly stated.</pre>
    <pre>[44]  I  agree  with  the trial judge that  s.  2(6)  is  not  an
independent charging provision.  I also agree that s. 2(6) speaks
to the timing of tax payments under leases.  However, in my view,
s.  2(6) goes beyond this function; it contains language that  is
helpful   in  determining  whether  the  two  payments  made   by
Extendicare were subject to sales tax.  In other words,  s.  2(6)
addresses  the  questions of &#145;when&#146; and &#145;for  what&#146;  in  a  lease
situation.
[45] Bearing in mind my characterization of the two payments made
by Extendicare, namely settlement payments made in the context of
a potential lawsuit for its breach and repudiation of the lease,
my conclusion is that a careful reading of ss. 2(1) and 2(6) of
the Act indicates that sales tax need not be paid on these
payments.  Rather, sales tax must be paid only with respect to
each rental payment while the lease is still in operation.  I
reach this conclusion for several reasons.
[46] First, s. 2(1) provides that sales tax is payable in respect
of &#147;the consumption or use&#148; of tangible personal property.  While
the lease was in force, the leased computer equipment was on
Extendicare&#146;s premises and was employed in its business
operations.  This fits comfortably within common notions of
consumption or use.  Once the lease was terminated, however, the
equipment was repossessed.  There could be no further consumption
or use.  The two payments were linked to termination
(simultaneous) and repossession (soon after), not to continuing
consumption and use.
[47] Second, both s. 2(1) and s. 2(6) provide that the sales tax
is payable in relation to the sale (which includes lease) of
&#147;tangible personal property&#148;.  It will be recalled that the
definition of &#147;tangible personal property&#148; is &#147;personal property
that can be seen, weighed, measured, felt or touched, or that is
in any way perceptible to the senses&#148;.  I do not think that the
$1,000,000 and $749,000 payments made by Extendicare to Canada
Lease come within this definition.  The payments were made by
Extendicare to purchase Canada Lease&#146;s  acceptance of
Extendicare&#146;s breach and reputation of the lease and to &#145;buy off&#146;
a potential damages award that Canada Lease might obtain in a
lawsuit.  If this is the case, Extendicare purchased intangibles.
[48] Third, s. 2(6) employs the words &#147;lease&#148; and &#147;rental&#148;.  In
The New Oxford Dictionary of English (1998), &#147;lease&#148; is defined
as &#147;a contract by which one party conveys land, property,
services, etc. to another for a specified time, usually in return
for a periodic payment&#148; (at p. 1048).  &#147;Rent&#148; is defined as &#147;a
tenant&#146;s regular payment to a landlord for the use of property or
land&#148; (at p. 1571). The two payments made by Extendicare do not
appear to come within these definitions.  The definitions are
anchored in notions of regularity of payments and continuation of
the relationship between lessor and lessee.  Neither of these
notions was present in Extendicare&#146;s two payments.  They were one-
time payments made at the precise moment the contractual
relationship ended.  Moreover, the payments were intended to
prevent a continuation of the relationship in a different context
&#150; i.e. in a lawsuit.
[49] Fourth, the legislative history of the relevant provisions
of the Retail Sales Tax Act supports the conclusion that it does
not cover the two payments in issue in this appeal. The original
Retail Sales Act, S.O. 1960-61, c. 91, defined &#147;sale&#148; to include
&#147;lease or rental&#148;.  However, there was no provision dealing
specifically with leases.  Since the general charging provision
said that the tax was to be computed &#147;at the time of sale&#148; (s.
2(2)), a technical application of the Act would have required
lessees to pay the tax on an up front basis, immediately
following the execution of a lease.
[50] In 1976, the legislature amended the Act to deal
specifically with leases of tangible personal property.  The new
provision, then numbered s. 2(5a), was very close to the
provision, s. 2(6), in issue in this appeal.  The Explanatory
Notes to Bill 170 stated:
    </pre>
    <pre>  Section 2.  The  amendment   clarifies  a  long-
              standing   administrative   practice
              that,  where a sale is  by  a  lease
              that  transfers only the  possession
              of  tangible  personal property  and
              that   does  not  provide  for   the
              transfer  of  title to the  property
              except  through the exercise  of  an
              option  that  may  or  may  not   be
              exercised,  tax is payable  on  each
              rental  instalment at the  time  the
              instalment  is paid. This procedure,
              it  has  been  felt, better  equates
              the  tax  payable with the use  made
              of   the  property  by  the  lessee.
              [Emphasis added.]
    
</pre>
    <pre>[51]  This  explanation strongly supports Extendicare&#146;s position.
The  fundamental purpose of the forerunner to s. 2(6) was to make
a  link  between  &#147;the  tax payable&#148; and &#147;the  use  made  of  the
property  by the lessee&#148;.  That link does not exist with  respect
to   Extendicare&#146;s  two  payments  totalling  $1,749,000.   Those
payments  were made several months after Extendicare had informed
Canada  Lease  that  it  would no longer be  using  the  computer
equipment  or making monthly rental payments.  The payments  were
also  made  in the context of a simultaneous termination  of  the
lease and repossession of the equipment very soon thereafter.
[52] Fifth, Information Bulletin I-82 published by the Retail
Sales Tax Branch of the Ministry in February 1982 is instructive.
The bulletin advised the public as follows:

          For  retail sales tax purposes, a rental
          on  an  item is considered to be a sale.
          In  other words, if a person is required
          to  pay  tax  on  an  item,  such  as  a
          television or an automobile,  tax  would
          also  apply  if he prefers to  rent  the
          item.
          </pre>
    <pre>          When  an  item  is  purchased,  tax   is
          payable on the full purchase price.
          </pre>
    <pre>          When  an  item is rented, tax is payable
          on  each rental payment made and on  any
          payment made in exercising an option  to
          purchase the item.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>[53]  The  emphasized words are telling.  The words &#147;each  rental
payment  made&#148; do not speak to only the timing of the payment  of
the  tax.  Rather, because these words are linked with the  words
&#147;tax  is  payable&#148;  they  also  address  the  substance  or   the
computation of the tax.
[54] Sixth, the Minister concedes that if Canada Lease had sued
Extendicare for damages for breach of the lease and recovered
damages after a trial, these damages would not be subject to
sales tax.  It is difficult to see why damages recovered through
negotiations to avoid a lawsuit should be treated differently.
[55] For these reasons, my conclusion is that the payments of
$1,000,000 and $749,000 by Extendicare to Canada Lease do not
attract retail sales tax.
[56] In Schwartz v. Canada, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 254, the Supreme
Court of Canada held that a $400,000 payment by a company to a
man to whom it offered a senior position, only to withdraw the
offer later, was not income under the federal Income Tax Act,
R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.).  In reaching this conclusion, La
Forest J. stated that &#147;one must obviously go back to the concept
of income and consider the whole scheme of the Act&#148; (at p. 293).
[57] In my view, a similar approach should be taken with respect
to the Retail Sales Tax Act.  The thrust of that Act is the
imposition of a sales tax for the consumption and use of tangible
personal property.  In the present case, Extendicare breached and
repudiated the lease.  The consumption and use of the computer
equipment stopped and payments on the lease ceased.  Negotiations
ensued and resulted in Extendicare making payments totalling
$1,749,000 to Canada Lease.  The payments achieved two purposes &#150;
they purchased Canada Lease&#146;s acceptance of Extendicare&#146;s
repudiation of the lease (thereby terminating the contract), and
they purchased Canada Lease&#146;s forbearance from commencing a
lawsuit in which, potentially, Canada Lease could have recovered
about double the settlement payment amounts.  In short, the two
payments were made in the context of a termination of all
relationships (contractual and litigation) between the parties,
not in the context of a continuing lease.  Accordingly, the two
payments do not come within &#147;the whole scheme of the Act&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[58]  I  would allow the appeal. The Special Case stated  by  the
parties is disposed of as follows:

       Question:    Were    the    payments     of
                    $1,000,000   and      $749,000
                    (the  &#147;Payments&#148;) made by  the
                    Appellant to Canada  Lease  as
                    described in paragraphs 14 and
                    16 subject to retail sales tax
                    under the Act?
           </pre>
    <pre>        Answer: No.</pre>
    <pre>[59]  The  respondent should vacate the Notice of Assessment  and
repay  to  the appellant $122,430 plus the interest paid  by  the
appellant.   The  appellant is entitled to  receive  interest  in
accordance with s. 33 of the Retail Sales Tax Act.
[60] The parties have agreed that in light of the novelty of the
issue there should be no costs order in this court or in the
trial court.
