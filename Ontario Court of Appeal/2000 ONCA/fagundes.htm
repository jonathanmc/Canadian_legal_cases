</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Pringle J. dated August 14, 1998
made at Simcoe.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CARTHY J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellants own land fronting on Lake Erie  and  appeal
from  a  judgment  restraining them from using the  property  for
cottage  purposes. Their position is that they have a legal  non-
conforming  use  as a cottage property extending  before  a  1985
zoning by-law which designated the property as &#147;hazard lands&#148; and
prohibited cottage use.
[2]  The property is located on the north shore of Lake Erie near
Long Point. The area has been plagued with bad storms, which have
caused such destruction that the number of cottages has been
reduced from 80 in the 1970s to 23 in the 1990s. Two such storms
occurred in 1985, leaving the cottage on the subject property
severely damaged and  canted on its foundation. In April of 1985
the area was rezoned from cottage use to hazard lands. This
change essentially eliminated habitable buildings as a permitted
use on a swath of lands deemed vulnerable to storm damage.
[3]  The evidence of the 1985 owners was introduced by the
affidavit of Eva and Orval Quantz. It reads in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>           4.  We  continued  to  occupy   the  cottage 
	       until in  or  about  the month of April,
	       1985,  when  the  cottage  was  severely
               damaged  by  a storm and essentially was
	       uninhabitable.
          </pre>
    <pre>           5.  We   faced  a  decision  as  to  whether
               to attempt reconstruction of the cottage
               or look for an alternate location in the
               Long Point area.
          </pre>
    <pre>           6.  In   September,  1985,    rather    than
               repair  or  reconstruct the cottage,  we
               entered   into  negotiations   for   the
               purchase  of  a vacant lot  on  Old  Cut
               Blvd.  on Long Point. It was our  intent
               to  move the cottage situate on Lots  62
               and  63,  Plan 251 to that location  and
               rebuild  same. That plan  did  not  come
               into   fruition,  as  the  cottage   was
               damaged beyond being salvageable  during
               a storm in December, 1985.
          </pre>
    <pre>           7.  We  advertised  the  property  for  sale
               as  a &#147;Handyman&#146;s Special&#148;. The property
               was  finally  sold  in September,  1988.
               During the period of December, 1985,  to
               the  date  of sale of the property,  the
               cottage  was further ransacked, all  the
               interior and exterior fixtures  such  as
               lights,  panelling, flooring, etc.  down
               to  the chimney were stripped by looters
               and  what  remained  was  essentially  a
               shell,  which was in a severely  damaged
               state.
          </pre>
    <pre>           8.  From  and  during  the  period  1985  to
               1988,  the cottage was not occupied  and
               not habitable.
          </pre>
    <pre>           9.  The    cottage  was  off   its  original
               foundation   and   all   the    exterior
               components  of  the  plumbing  for   the
               cottages were destroyed.</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  property  was purchased in 1988 by  the  Anthonys  who
clearly intended to rebuild the cottage. They prepared plans  and
opposed  a temporary by-law standing in their way, only  to  have
their efforts frustrated by illness, which forced them to put the
property  up  for sale. The appellants purchased the property  in
1995  for  $10,000.  Subject  to  the  effects  of  weather   and
vandalism, the building was apparently in much the same state  as
when sold by the Quantzes.
[5]  The appellants unwisely did not seek legal advice concerning
the purchase and compounded their problems by proceeding to
rebuild the cottage without a building permit and in defiance of
a stop work order issued by the building department. Their
reasoning was that they were simply making the building secure
and safe. In the result there is now a liveable cottage on the
original foundation with the same dimensions as the original
cottage except for an added deck and an extra 118 square feet of
living area.
[6]  As an aside, the Director of the Regional Health Department
revoked the appellants&#146; certificate of approval for a holding
tank sewage system, leading to a hearing before the Environmental
Appeal Board. The appellants were successful and the revocation
was set aside.
[7]  This action was instituted by the municipality seeking an
injunction against use of the property as a cottage dwelling. At
the conclusion of the trial, Pringle J. granted an
&#147;interlocutory&#148; injunction, clearly intended to be a permanent
one.
[8]  The appellants raised several issues on the appeal and I
will deal first with the ones I consider incidental to the
fundamental question of the existence of a legal non-conforming
use.
[9]  The appellants point to paragraphs 6.3.1 and 6.3.2 of the
1985 zoning by-law and argue that they permit replacement of
buildings that are partially or completely destroyed. Those
provisions read:
          </pre>
    <pre>        6.3.1  <u>Repair of Non-conforming Building and</u> 
	       <u>Structures</u>               </pre>
    <pre>               Subject to the provisions of subsection
               6.3.2, nothing contained herein shall 
	       prevent the repair or strengthening to a
	       safe condition of any existing non-conforming
               building  or structure or part  thereof,
               provided that such repair or strengthening
               will not increase the usable floor area or
               volume of such building or structure.</pre>
    <pre>        6.3.2  <u>Replacement of Buildings and Structures</u> 
	       <u>Non-conforming in Use</u>               </pre>
    <pre>               Nothing contained herein shall prevent
               the repair or replacement of any existing
               building or structure, the use of which is
               not  permitted in the zone in which  the
               building or structure is located, if such
               building  or  structure is partially  or
               completely destroyed by fire, an Act of God,
               or by any means beyond the control of the
               owner,  provided  that  such  repair  or
               replacement does not constitute an increase
               in the original usable floor area or volume
               of the said building or structure.</pre>
    <pre>[10]  My  answer  to this submission is that these  are  standard
forms  of permission to repair or reconstruct by reason of events
beyond the control of the owner where a legal non-conforming  use
exists. The headings refer to non-conforming uses and the body of
each  paragraph refers to construction. The authority for  a  use
contrary  to  a  zoning by-law is derived  from  s.34(9)  of  the
Planning Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.P.13. Thus, the paragraphs  must  be
read  as dependent for their application upon the existence of  a
legal non-conforming use.
[11] The appellants contend that the trial judge improperly
refused to hear the evidence of Dr. B.A. Brown, who intended to
give expert evidence concerning compliance by the appellants with
s. 6.3.2 of the by-law. As indicated above, s.6.3.2 is irrelevant
unless there is a legal non-conforming use and Dr. Brown could
not contribute to that issue. Further, there was a surveyor&#146;s
evidence that at the rear of the cottage an indentation in the
original building measuring 8 feet by 14.5 feet had been filled
in creating 118 square feet more living space and a deck added.
There is no indication that Dr. Brown could have countered that
evidence. I would reject this ground of appeal.
[12] The appellants submit that the trial judge should not have
drawn an adverse inference from their failure to call a municipal
employee to confirm their allegations that representations were
made by way of reassurance that they could proceed. A review of
the evidence reveals very little in the way of alleged municipal
representations to the plaintiffs, and none that affect the
zoning. This issue is therefore of no consequence on appeal.
[13] The next issue raised was that an issue estoppel flowed from
the decision of the Environmental Appeal Board and its conclusion
that the resurrected building was a similar size to the original.
The trial judge rejected that argument and so would I. It is a
stretch to make the Director of the Health Department, who
instituted the proceedings under the Environmental Protection
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.E.19, a privy of the Regional Municipality
itself in pursuing zoning and building by-law offences. But, in
any event, it is clear from the reasons of the Board that its
decision was not based upon zoning compliance and that its
opinion on the facts was offered gratuitously. The member stated:
&#147;&#133; it is unnecessary for me to determine whether the renovation
of the cottage does constitute a legal non-forming use. In case I
am incorrect on such issue, I thought it appropriate to resolve a
factual issue relevant to the planning question&#148;.
[14] Further, the opinion as to the size of the building does not
resolve the underlying issue of non-conforming use, which I now
turn to consider.
[15] Section 34(9) of the Planning Act provides that a by-law
does not affect the current use of land &#147;so long as it continues
to be used for that purpose.&#148;
[16] The trial judge found as a fact that the Quantzes had ceased
to use the lands for cottage purposes in April 1985. This finding
was based on the affidavit quoted earlier in these reasons and is
challenged by the appellants who argue that the Quantzes showed a
clear intention to continue the use by paying taxes annually as
an improved property and  advertising it for sale as a
&#147;Handyman&#146;s Special&#148;. The actual use obviously ended with the
storm of April 1985 and could have been legally resurrected if
the owners had taken steps to rebuild. Is it sufficient that they
retained the potential to do so unsupported by an ongoing
intention?
[17] The law on this subject is conveniently summarized in an
Ontario Municipal Board decision written by W.E. King, 572989
Ontario Inc. v. North York, [1997] O.M.B.D. No. 976, concerning a
parking lot which had not been used as such, except casually, for
a period of three years. He wrote at paragraph [10]:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>    I also agree with him [counsel for the applicant] 
that  in cases where the property has been vacant for
some  time the Courts and the Board have always found 
the  intention of the owner to be relevant. I do not,
however,   accept   his   further   suggestion   that 
intention   alone   is  sufficient  to  determine the 
matter. I note that in all the cases of vacancy where 
the Court or Board found that the use  had  continued 
despite  the  vacancy,  there  was  some   reasonable 
explanation  for  the vacancy or some circumstance at 
least  partially  outside  the  owner&#146;s  control that 
temporarily  prevented  the use: in San Joaquin [City 
of  Toronto v. San Joaquin  Investments  Ltd.  et al. 
(1979), 26 O.R. (2d) 775],   the  City  laid  charges 
against the owner for what it insisted was an illegal 
use; in O&#146;Sullivan Funeral  Homes [O&#146;Sullivan Funeral 
Homes Ltd. v. Corporation of City of Sault Ste. Marie 
and   Evans  (1961),  O.R.  413],   renovations  were 
required to  better  accommodate  a  funeral home; in 
Front  of  Escort  [Township  of  Front  of Escort v.
Committee  of  Adjustment  of   Front   of    Escort,
unreported  O.M.B.  decision,  13 February 1987], the 
apartment was  not safe for occupancy until expensive 
repairs  were  done;  in  another   case    [City  of 
Peterborough  v. Montgomery Brothers Ltd.  (1972),  1 
O.M.B.R.  360],   a  legal  non-conforming  use   was 
permitted to be rebuilt  after  it  was  destroyed by 
fire.  Although  in  North  Hill  Owners&#146; Association 
[North  Hill  Owners&#146;  Association  v.  Sobot, [1986] 
O.M.B.R.   242],   the    Board    used   the  phrase 
&#147;continuously  used (or intended to be used)&#148;,  there 
was nothing in the decision to indicate that the  use 
had  not  been actually continuous. In each case, the 
finding of continuity of use on the  vacant  property 
was supported by something beyond mere lack of change 
to  another  use.  Or if intention was determinative, 
the  intention  was  at  least  an  active  intention 
consistent with the spirit of the provision. An early 
Court  decision  [Re  Hartley and the City of Toronto 
(1925), 56 O.L.R. 433 (C.A.)],  referred to in  Imrie 
[Imrie  v.  City  of  Toronto Committee of Adjustment 
(1990), 25 O.M.B.R. 435]  established that there were 
two  necessary  elements  to establish bona fide use: 
the   intention  to   continue  the   use,   and  the 
continuation  of  the  actual  use  so  far as  it is 
possible  in  the  circumstances. In my review of the 
other submitted cases it appeared to me that they all 
followed this principle.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18]  In  that case the Board held that the use was preserved  by
the  combination of intention to market the property as a parking
lot, its occasional use for such purpose and delay in effecting a
sale caused by market conditions.
[19] I cannot find a similar level of use, intention to use or
excuse for non-use in the present case. On the evidence of the
Quantzes, they had determined in September 1985 to purchase
another lot and move the cottage to it. Then, in December 1985,
another storm caused such damage that they considered the cottage
beyond being salvageable. They, as owners at that time, made a
clear decision to abandon using this property for cottage
purposes. I would defer to the trial judge&#146;s finding and treat
the  payment of taxes and the &#147;handyman&#146;s special&#148; advertising as
efforts to do the best they could on a sale. Perhaps they thought
someone else could resurrect the cottage use and were unaware of
the need for continuity. However, their conduct and expressed
intentions clearly established a discontinuance of the use by
them. They were the owners. They effectively said &#147;we&#146;re not
cottaging here any longer and we&#146;re not even going to remove the
remains of what was a cottage.&#148;  That broke the chain of
continuance required by the statute both as to the fact of use
and as to intention deferred by some external cause. To them this
was no longer a property usable for cottage purposes. And the two
storms of 1985 plus the history of damage in the area gave them
good reason for so concluding.
[20] The judgment under appeal should be amended to strike the
word &#147;interlocutory&#148;, but otherwise the appeal is dismissed with
costs.
