      <pre><b>On appeal from the Divisional Court decision of Lane, Haley and
Belleghem JJ. dated June 28, 2000.
</b></pre>
      <pre><b>                      ENDORSEMENT</b> 
</pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellants, the Director, Income Maintenance Branch,
Ministry of Community and Social Services and the Attorney
General of Ontario move pursuant to ss. 106 and 134(2) of the
Courts of Justice Act and Rules 37, 61 and 63 of the Rules of
Civil Procedure for:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>An order staying the decision of the Divisional Court 
dated June 28, 2000 that s. 1(1)(d) of Regulation 366 
under the Family Benefits Act is unconstitutional, 
until leave to appeal this decision is determined and 
if leave is granted until the appeal is determined.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[2]  The appellants also move to expedite the hearing of the
leave motion.  That motion was unopposed and an order expediting
the leave motion was granted:  certain timelines were established
for the delivery of factums.  No purpose would be served in
reviewing those timelines.
[3]  The respondents strongly oppose the appellants’ motion to
stay.  They take the position that the motion should be dismissed
and alternatively that if it is granted that it would be granted
only on the following conditions:  (a) that the Ministry shall
not refer for prosecution any new cases involving allegations of
“welfare fraud” for having an undeclared spouse on the basis of
the impugned provision, and shall make best efforts to ensure
that no new charges are laid by the Crown, so long as this stay
remains in effect;  and (b) that the Ministry shall make best
efforts to ensure that any pending charges for “welfare fraud”,
for having an undeclared spouse on the basis of the impugned
provision are stayed by the Crown so long as the interim stay
remains in effect.</pre>
      <pre><b>Background</b></pre>
      <pre>[4]  This case concerns the constitutional validity of the
definition of “spouse” found in the Family Benefits Act for the
purpose of assessing entitlement to social assistance benefits.
In its decision dated June 28, 2000, the majority of the
Divisional Court held that the definition of “spouse” contained
in s. 1(1)(d) of Regulation 366 under the Family Benefits Act
violates s. 15(1) of the Charter and cannot be saved under s. 1
of the Charter.  The Divisional Court did not include in its
order a temporary suspension of its decision invalidating the
current definition of “spouse”.  The appellants sought leave to
appeal the Divisional Court and, as I have said, their motion for
leave has been expedited.</pre>
      <pre><b>The Test for Granting a Stay</b></pre>
      <pre>[5]  The parties appear to agree that the test that is to be
applied when considering an application for a stay is set out in
the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in RJR-MacDonald v. Canada
(Attorney General), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 311 at 334.  In RJR-
MacDonald, the Supreme Court summarized its earlier decision in
Manitoba (Attorney General) v. Metropolitan Stores Ltd., [1987] 1
S.C.R. 110 at 127-129:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>First, a preliminary assessment must be made as the 
merits of the case to ensure that there is a serious 
question to be tried.  Secondly, it must be determined 
whether the applicant would suffer irreparable harm if 
the application were refused.  Finally, an assessment 
must be made as to which of the parties would suffer 
greater harm from the granting or refusal of the 
remedy pending an decision on the merits.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><b>Serious Question to be Tried</b></pre>
      <pre>[6]  The parties agree that the issue whether the definition of
Sspouse” in Regulation 336 violates the Charter is a serious
question to be tried.</pre>
      <pre><b>Irreparable Harm</b></pre>
      <pre>[7]  In Metropolitan Stores, supra,  Beetz J. held that the
second stay test requires the court to consider whether the party
who seeks the stay would, unless the stay is granted, suffer
irreparable harm.  Sopinka and Cory JJ. explained in RJR-
MacDonald, at p. 341, that the only issue to be decided at this
stage is:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>… whether a refusal to grant release could so 
adversely affect the applicants’ own interests 
that the harm could not be remedied if the 
eventual decision on the merit does not accord
with the result of the interlocutory application.</pre>
        <pre>‘Irreparable’ refers to the nature of the harm 
suffered rather than its magnitude.  It is harm 
which either cannot be quantified in monetary 
terms or which cannot be cured, usually because 
one party cannot collect damages from the other.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[8]  Although the public interest is generally a factor that is
considered at the third stage (the balance of convenience),
Sopinka and Cory JJ. held in RJR-MacDonald, at p.349, that when a
government authority is the applicant on a motion for
interlocutory relief, the public interest issue will be
considered at the second – irreparable harm – stage.  However, it
will again be considered in the third stage when harm to the
applicant is balanced with harm to the respondent, including any
harm to the public interest that may in the circumstances be
found to exist.
[9]  The appellants’ claim that a refusal of the stay would cause
irreparable harm to the public interest appears to be based on
administrative convenience and financial costs that will be
incurred if the stay is not granted.  However, as the respondents
submit, administrative inconvenience, even where it is serious,
does not generally constitute irreparable harm (see Wellcome
Foundation Ltd. v. Novopharm Ltd., [1992] 45 C.P.R. (3d) 202
(F.C.T.D.) at 206).
[10] The evidence discloses that temporary interim measures were
put in place promptly following the release of the Divisional
Court’s reasons as a means of dealing with the immediate
implementation issues.  The appellants suggest that errors in
applying the decision will result in some persons mistakenly
being found eligible for social assistance which will result in
overpayments that may be impossible to recover.  However, on
cross-examination, Ms. Moretta, Director of the Social Assistance
Programs Branch, acknowledged that mechanisms do exist to enable
the Ministry to recover overpayments (see pp. 59-60 of the cross-
examination of Ms. Moretta).
[11] Ms. Minor, in her able submissions, emphasized that the same
definition of spouse used in the Family Benefits Act is also used
in the Ontario Works Act, 1997 and the Ontario Disability Support
Program Act, 1997.  These latter two statutes came into force in
the spring of 1998 and represent the current legislation
governing the provision of most social assistance in Ontario.
The appellants submit that the effect of the finding that the
definition of “spouse” is unconstitutional for Family Benefits
Act purposes has a real ripple effect with respect to the other
social assistance legislation in Ontario.  Ms. Moretta in her
affidavit, at pp. 92 and 93, confirms that.  The appellants also
contend that the Divisional Court decision has potential
ramifications for other legislative definitions of “spouse”, in
particular the Family Law Act, Part III definition.
[12] In my opinion, irreparable harm is a generally neutral
factor here.   Both sides will suffer harm if I do not accede to
their position on the stay issue.  Neither side will suffer
irreparable harm.</pre>
      <pre><b>The Balance of Convenience</b></pre>
      <pre>[13] The third test in an application for a stay requires a
determination of which of the two parties will suffer greater
harm from the granting or refusal of the stay sought pending a
decision on the merits.  The factors to be considered in
assessing the “balance of inconvenience” will obviously vary from
case to case.  However, in Metropolitan Stores, supra, at p. 49,
it was made clear that in all constitutional cases the public
interest is a special factor which must be considered in
assessing where the balance of convenience lies.
[14] It is the appellants’ position that requiring immediate
compliance of the decision of the Divisional Court would result
in serious harm to the public.  The appellants rely on a recent
decision of Sharpe J.A. granting a stay in Mushkegowuk Council v.
Ontario and Attorney General of Canada (1999), 126 O.A.C. at 285
(C.A.).  They cite the following passage from Sharpe J.A.’s
reasons:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Administration of these benefits is a complex 
matter requiring knowledge of local conditions 
and the circumstances of social assistance 
recipients.  To require a significant alteration 
in the administrative arrangements necessary for
distribution of social assistance before legal 
issues have been finally resolved, would be a 
cumbersome, costly and potentially unnecessary 
course of action. In assessing the balance of
convenience, I take into account the fact that 
the respondents have secured a judicial 
declaration which is determinative of their 
rights unless and until set aside or varied on 
appeal.  I cannot ignore, however, the fact of 
the appeal and the concession that there is a 
serious issue to be dealt with on the appeal.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[15] I agree with Sharpe J.A.’s practical concerns as expressed
in Mushkegowuk Council.  It is, however, important to note that
in that case if some form of stay were not granted there was a
serious risk that thousands of individuals would not receive
needed primary social assistance.  Sharpe J.A. explained, at
para. 12 of his reasons, that he was granting the stay because
“it is imperative that arrangements remain in place to ensure
that individuals will continue to receive social assistance
benefits to which they are legally entitled”.  The circumstances
in this case can be clearly distinguished from those of
Mushkegowuk since the Divisional Court’s decision in this case
does not affect the eligibility of current recipients of
assistance under the Family Benefits Act.  They will continue to
receive benefits whether or not a stay was granted.
[16] It appears to me that there is a real risk of financial
hardship faced by applicants who are deemed ineligible on the
basis of a definition of “spouse” which is held to be
unconstitutional.  This has to be set against the obvious
administrative inconvenience to the government and the
uncertainty of the law derived from the different definitions of
“spouse” in statutes which are least generically related.  There
is also the risk of individuals who could face “welfare fraud”
prosecutions for having an undeclared spouse.  The respondents
suggest that this could result in criminal charges and the
prospect of a lifetime ban from eligibility for social assistance
under the Ministry’s “zero tolerance” policy.
[17] Taking all of this into consideration, I think that without
any conditions the balance of convenience favours the
respondents.  However, with the conditions suggested by the
respondents, the balance of convenience favours the appellants.
Thus, the interests of justice would be best served if the stay
sought were granted, but on conditions which generally reflect
the conditions suggested by the respondents.  They are:</pre>
      <pre>(a)  The Ministry shall not refer for prosecution any new cases
     involving allegations of welfare fraud for having an
     undeclared spouse on the basis of the impugned provision,
     and shall make best efforts to ensure that no charges are
     laid by the Crown, so long as this stay remains in effect;
     and
(b)  The Ministry shall make its best efforts to ensure that any
     pending charges for “welfare fraud” for having an undeclared
     spouse on the basis of the impugned provision are adjourned or
     stayed by the Crown so long as the interim stay remains in
     effect.</pre>
      <pre>[18] In my view, these conditions are workable, notwithstanding
the appellants’ submissions to the contrary.  They represent a
modest price to be paid for stability which will accrue as a
result of the issuance on a stay of the Divisional Court order
pending the application for leave to appeal and if leave is
granted the appeal.
[19] I do not accept the respondents’ position that I have no
jurisdiction to grant a stay beyond the appellant’s application
for leave to appeal.  In my view, s. 132(2) of the Courts of
Justice Act provides a broad based jurisdiction to make any
interim order that is considered just (see Horsefield v. Ontario
(Registrar of Motor Vehicles) (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 304 (C.A.)).
[20] This is not a case for costs.
