    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Sharpe J. without a jury dated
January 6, 1997.</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent Fasken Campbell Godfrey (&#147;FCG&#148;), the
successor law firm to the respondent Calvin Godfrey &amp; Lewtas
(&#147;CGL&#148;), sued the appellants, Seven-Up Canada Inc. (&#147;Seven-Up&#148;),
Pathfinder Beverages Ltd. (&#147;PBL&#148;), 161275 Canada Inc. and Thomas
B. Baker, for outstanding legal fees in the amount of
$665,317.28 arising from services rendered to the appellants.
The appellants did not dispute the amount of legal fees claimed,
except with respect to one account, referred to as the &quot;SkyDome
account&quot;, for $136,216.33.  However, they asserted by way of
counterclaim that CGL was negligent in performing the legal
services and that the firm&#146;s failure to provide appropriate legal
advice exposed the appellants to various claims against them.
The appellants sought damages based on what they paid to settle
these claims and for related legal expenses.
[2]  In a decision dated January 6, 1997 and since reported at
142 D.L.R. (4th) 456, Sharpe J. granted judgment against the
appellants for outstanding legal fees owed to FCG in the amount
of $589,100.95 plus interest and costs.  He concluded that FCG
was liable to the appellants for breach of duty to warn in
relation to one of the transactions complained of by the
appellants and assessed the appellants&#146; consequent damages in the
amount of $200 plus interest.
[3]  The appellants appeal the judgment against them for payment
of the legal fees and the trial judge&#146;s assessment of damages on
the counterclaim.  The respondents cross-appeal on the finding of
liability against  them.  For the reasons that follow, we uphold
the trial judge&#146;s decision on all issues and dismiss both the
appeal and cross-appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Facts</pre>
    <pre>[4]  These proceedings surround the activities of Thomas B.
Baker, a former partner of CGL.  He spent his entire legal career
at the firm, where he developed a successful corporate-commercial
law practice.  On March 1, 1988, he left CGL to assume the
position of President of Seven-Up.  Seven-Up was a major client
of CGL and Baker had acted as the partner in charge of Seven-Up&#146;s
legal matters before leaving the firm.
[5]  Baker acted as the lead partner on a leveraged management
buy-out of Seven-Up from Pepsi-Cola Canada Ltd. (&quot;Pepsi&quot;) in June
1987.   Frederick Rosbrook, Jamie Colbourne, Russell Plawiuk and
Mark Benadiba were the members of management who participated in
the buy-out.  Rosbrook acquired 20.1% of the shares of Seven-Up,
while the other managers each acquired 10%.  The remaining shares
were purchased by a numbered Ontario company controlled by
Michael Graye (40%) and by the Bank of Nova Scotia (9.9%).
After the buy-out, Rosbrook was named President of Seven-Up.
[6]  In late August 1987, Rosbrook was diagnosed with terminal
cancer.  He asked Baker to prepare his will.  Baker agreed.
Rosbrook, who had been married three times and had children from
his first two marriages, was concerned that disputes among his
beneficiaries were likely.  He thus asked Baker to act as his
sole executor.  Again Baker agreed.   CGL prepared Rosbrook&#146;s
will naming Baker as executor.  Two weeks later, on September 13,
1987, Rosbrook died.  His only significant asset at this time was
his 20.1% equity stake in Seven-Up.
[7]  The trial judge&#146;s factual findings on the events following
Rosbrook&#146;s death are set out at pp. 460-470 of the reported
version of his decision.   These detailed findings, which are
supported by the evidence, will not be repeated in their entirety
here.   The salient facts for purposes of this appeal are as
follows.
[8]  Baker personally assumed primary responsibility for
administering the Rosbrook estate.  An estate file was opened at
CGL with Baker as billing partner.  Two weeks after Rosbrook&#146;s
death, solicitors for his former wife, Sherry Rosbrook, contacted
Baker claiming support for Candice Rosbrook, one of Rosbrook&#146;s
children and a beneficiary of his estate.   This claim ultimately
led to the commencement of legal proceedings against the estate
on behalf of Candice on May 31, 1988.
[9]  Also following Rosbrook&#146;s death, Baker was approached by
Michael Graye to act as President of Seven-Up.  He initially
refused, but eventually agreed to become President on terms that
he negotiated with Seven-Up (&quot;Baker transaction&quot;).  These terms
included that Baker receive 113 shares representing a 10% equity
stake in Seven-Up.  To permit Baker to acquire the newly issued
shares, he received an interest-free loan from Seven-Up for
$1,312,500.
[10] Baker did not advise anyone at his firm about his intentions
of becoming the President and a shareholder of Seven-Up at any
time before entering the agreement with Seven-Up.  Nor did he
seek advice from anyone at his firm about the legal implications
of his arrangements with Seven-Up, including his acquisition of
shares in the company.  CGL's role in the arrangements whereby
Baker became President of Seven-Up was limited to a CGL
associate, Mark Stinson, being instructed by Graye to obtain
consents from Pepsi and the Bank of Nova Scotia to the transfer
of the estate shares to Baker as executor and to the issuance of
113 shares to Baker.
[11] Baker&#146;s share acquisition on becoming President diluted the
Rosbrook estate&#146;s interest in the outstanding shares of the
company from 20.1% to 18.1%.  Baker did not advise the Rosbrook
beneficiaries of his intention to become the President and a
shareholder of Seven-Up, nor did he obtain their consent to do
so.  Rather, Baker himself prepared a consent to the share
issuance on behalf of the estate and executed it on the estate&#146;s
behalf in his capacity as executor.
[12] On November 23, 1987, CGL officially announced that Baker
was leaving the firm.  He remained a partner at CGL until March
1, 1988.  During this period, he remained as billing partner for
the Rosbrook estate.
[13] When Peter Clark, a second-year tax associate at CGL,
learned that Baker was to become President of Seven-Up and remain
as executor of the Rosbrook estate, he was concerned that Baker
was putting himself in a situation of a potential conflict of
interest.  However, Clark felt it was not appropriate for him to
ask Baker about the details of his arrangement with Seven-Up,
given his junior position in the firm.
[14] On January 12, 1988, Clark consulted John Fuke about Baker&#146;s
deal with Seven-Up.  Fuke had joined CGL in early January 1988
and was a senior lawyer with expertise in trusts and estates.
Fuke agreed that Baker could be in a situation of potential
conflict and suggested that it would be appropriate for Clark to
raise the matter with Baker.  Clark&#146;s evidence was that he had a
brief conversation with Baker about the situation during which he
suggested that Baker consider resigning as executor.   Clark did
not use the word &#147;conflict&#148; in this discussion, nor did he refer
specifically to any trust or fiduciary principles.  Clark
testified that Baker responded that he would stick it out as
executor in light of his commitment to Rosbrook.  Baker testified
that he did not recall this conversation with Clark.
[15] The next day, Clark relayed to Fuke the results of his
conversation with Baker.  The trial judge found that based on
this discussion with Clark, Fuke formed the erroneous impression
that Clark had invited Baker to meet with Fuke if he wanted to
discuss the conflict issue and that Baker had declined the offer.
The trial judge found that no one at CGL warned Baker of the
potential for a conflict of interest, nor did anyone advise him
of the applicable principles of trust law or fiduciary duty.
[16] After Baker left CGL, he continued to assume de facto
control of the Rosbrook estate file and instructed the estates
clerk at CGL as well as Clark on specific estate matters.
[17] In the first half of 1988, Baker negotiated a transaction
whereby Seven-Up would acquire Pathfinder Beverages Limited
(&#147;Pathfinder transaction&#148;).  He decided that the Seven-Up
shareholders, including himself, would acquire additional shares
in Seven-Up as part of the transaction.  He also decided that the
estate would not participate in the share acquisition.  Baker
testified that he made this decision because the estate lacked
the cash and the means to borrow the necessary funds to acquire
the newly-issued shares.
[18] On May 2, 1988, after the terms of the transaction had been
negotiated and set out in a letter of intent with the principal
shareholder of Pathfinder, Baker retained CGL to act for Seven-Up
in carrying out the transaction.  The beneficiaries of the estate
were not advised of the Pathfinder transaction prior to its
completion and did not consent to it. The Pathfinder transaction
further diluted the Rosbrook estate&#146;s proportionate holdings in
Seven-Up from 18.1% to 9%.
[19] The Pathfinder transaction closed on June 24, 1988.  In the
meantime, Baker had taken steps to sell the estate&#146;s shares to
Michael Graye.  The shares had still not been sold when in
December 1988, Baker was advised that an order in the Candice
Rosbrook litigation had the effect of suspending any transaction
involving the estate shares.
[20]   On February 12, 1989, management members Colbourne,
Plawiuk and Benabida commenced litigation seeking to remove Baker
as President of Seven-Up. To compound his difficulties, on March
9, 1989, Baker received a letter from counsel retained by the
Rosbrook beneficiaries demanding his removal as executor.  The
next day, the beneficiaries commenced an application for Baker&#146;s
removal as executor.  On April 14, 1989, Baker resigned as
executor.
[21] On October 13, 1989, two court-appointed executors of the
Rosbrook estate commenced an action against Baker, Seven-Up,
Pathfinder, CGL and others alleging, among other claims, that
Baker had breached fiduciary duties owed to the estate and the
beneficiaries, that he had misappropriated opportunities that
belonged to the estate, that he was unjustly enriched by his
compensation arrangements and by the Pathfinder transaction and
that he had exercised his powers in a manner that amounted to
oppression under both federal and Ontario business corporation
legislation (&#147;estate litigation&#148;).
[22] In late 1991, Baker negotiated the sale of Seven-Up&#146;s assets
to Pepsi.  The intended sale was announced in January 1992 while
the estate litigation was still pending.  The plaintiffs in the
estate litigation sought an injunction to restrain the closing of
the asset sale.  Baker testified that in order to proceed with
the sale, he agreed to settle the estate litigation as against
himself, Seven-Up and Pathfinder.   In a settlement agreement
dated March 4, 1992 Seven-Up agreed to pay the beneficiaries
$1.47 million and released a claim to reimbursement for $138,000
that had been advanced to the beneficiaries.  Colboune, Plawiuk
and Benabida also each paid $75,000 to the beneficiaries.  One
week after the settlement, the Pepsi sale went ahead.
[23] The amount that the Seven-Up shareholders received as a
result of the Pepsi transaction was not disclosed at trial or to
this Court.   However, Baker testified that the sale to Pepsi was
extremely beneficial to the shareholders of Seven-Up and that the
proceeds far exceeded their expectations.  He also admitted that
the amount that he and the other shareholders made on the Pepsi
transaction substantially exceeded the amount paid to settle the
estate litigation.  Baker led no evidence at trial as to the
amount that the beneficiaries might have accepted to settle their
claim, other than the amount that they ultimately accepted.
[24] CGL&#146;s action against the appellants for outstanding legal
fees was commenced on January 16, 1992.  On April 27, 1992, the
appellants issued their counterclaim against CGL and FCG for
reimbursement of the amount paid to settle the estate litigation
and associated legal fees as well as legal fees paid to CGL in
relation to the Pathfinder transaction.</pre>
    <pre>     The Trial Judge&#146;s Decision</pre>
    <pre>[25] The trial judge first considered whether CGL owed a duty to
warn either Baker or Seven-Up about the potential risk that the
beneficiaries might attack the transactions in which Baker
participated.  After reviewing the law respecting a lawyer&#146;s
duties, he concluded that the duty to warn a client of the risk
involved in a course of action is an integral part of a lawyer&#146;s
standard of care and can form a basis for liability.  However, he
noted that whether a duty to warn arises in a particular
situation will depend upon the precise scope of the retainer
between the lawyer and the client.
[26]  The trial judge concluded that CGL had no duty to warn
Baker or Seven-Up that the beneficiaries might attack the Baker
transaction (whereby Baker became President of Seven-Up) by
invoking the line of authority based on Regal (Hastings) Ltd. v.
Gulliver, [1942] 1 All E.R. 378 (H.L.).  This line of authority
requires a fiduciary to account to beneficiaries for any gains
resulting from the fiduciary&#146;s position, even where the fiduciary
acted in good faith and in the best interests of beneficiaries of
the trust.   The trial judge held that, considering Baker&#146;s
status as a senior partner in the firm as well as the close
control he maintained over both the estate and his arrangement
with Seven-Up, the scope of CGL&#146;s retainer was limited to the
specific matters it was asked to deal with.  He further concluded
that Seven-Up was in no better position than Baker because it too
had asked CGL to perform only specific tasks.
[27] However, the trial judge held that CGL did owe a duty to
advise Baker and Seven-Up of the risk that the beneficiaries
might challenge the Pathfinder transaction because their consent
had not been obtained.  This latter conclusion was based on the
trial judge&#146;s finding that the retainer on the Pathfinder
transaction was &#147;very different&#148; from the specific and limited
retainer given in relation to the Baker transaction, and on his
finding that Baker and Seven-Up had a legitimate expectation that
CGL would be proactive and would give legal advice designed to
avoid problems arising from the treatment of the Rosbrook
beneficiaries.  The trial judge then allocated fault as between
CGL and the appellants for the loss suffered as a result of the
beneficiaries&#146; claims as 20% to CGL and 80% to Baker and Seven-
Up.  He assigned 80% liability to Baker and Seven-Up because he
found that the seeds of the problems related to the Rosbrook
beneficiaries in connection with the Pathfinder transaction were
sown when Baker failed to address the estate's interests when his
arrangements were made to become President of Seven-Up.  In
particular, the trial judge noted that Baker decided without
consulting CGL that the estate would not participate in the
Pathfinder transaction and acted as if he were the senior lawyer
with carriage of the file.  Further, the trial judge found that
Seven-Up stood in no better position than Baker as Baker was the
President and directing mind of Seven-Up and Seven-Up acted
through Baker in relation to the transaction.
[28] In terms of assessing the appellants&#146; loss, the trial judge
concluded that the amount of the loss incurred because of CGL&#146;s
failure to advise the appellants of the risk of the
beneficiaries&#146; claims depended on the resolution of two issues:
1) determining the portion of the amount paid to settle the
beneficiaries&#146; claims that was attributable to the breach of
fiduciary duty claim against Baker in connection with the
Pathfinder transaction, of which CGL had a duty to warn; and 2)
determining the likelihood that Baker would have been able to
obtain the beneficiaries&#146; consent to his compensation arrangement
and the Pathfinder transaction had he received the appropriate
warning.
[29] On the first issue, the trial judge concluded that 50% of
the amount of the settlement was attributable to the breach of
fiduciary duty claim against Baker in relation to the Pathfinder
transaction.  In arriving at this figure, he took into account
that the beneficiaries had advanced several other claims in
addition to the alleged breach of fiduciary duty.  He also took
into account that both before and after the settlement, Baker had
maintained the position that the beneficiaries&#146; claims were
groundless and that he had agreed to the settlement so that the
lucrative Pepsi transaction could close.   The trial judge also
added 50% of the legal costs incurred by the appellants in the
estate litigation to the amount of the settlement that he
attributed to the breach of fiduciary duty claim.
[30] On the second issue, the trial judge rejected the
appellant&#146;s argument that CGL was in a fiduciary relationship
with the appellants and that the burden was thus on CGL to prove
that the beneficiaries&#146; consent could not have been obtained.
He determined that the appellants&#146; claim rested on negligence in
terms of a failure to render appropriate advice rather than on a
breach of fiduciary duty.  He further held that the burden rested
with the appellants to establish their compensable loss having
regard to the principles of lost chance as they relate to the
assessment of damages.
[31] Citing this court&#146;s decision in Eastwalsh Homes Ltd. v.
Anatal Developments (1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 675, the trial judge
considered whether the appellants had shown that there was a
reasonable probability that the beneficiaries would have
consented to the Pathfinder transaction such as was sufficient to
justify an award in their favour.  Baker had testified that prior
to closing the transaction in April 1988, he was on sufficiently
good terms with the beneficiaries that he could have procured
their consent.
[32] The trial judge did not accept Baker's evidence in this
regard.  He concluded that the chance that the beneficiaries
would have consented to the Pathfinder transaction was &#147;close to
zero&#148;.  He noted in this regard that Baker's relationship with
the beneficiaries was not one of complete confidence, pointing in
particular to the Sherry and Candice Rosbrook litigation.   He
also observed that obtaining the beneficiaries' consent would
have required that he obtain a waiver from them of a possible
claim of breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the Baker
transaction:  Baker's bargaining position with the beneficiaries
in this regard was weaker after he had accepted the position of
President than it would have been before.  In addition, the trial
judge found that obtaining the beneficiaries' consent to the
Pathfinder transaction would have been unlikely considering that
the estate did not stand to benefit from it.  As well, he noted
that if the beneficiaries were advised of their legal position
and informed of the benefits that Baker had already received and
that he and Seven-Up expected to receive from the Pathfinder
transaction, they would almost certainly have seized the
opportunity to squeeze concessions from Baker or Seven-Up.
[33] Having assessed the lost chance at close to zero, the trial
judge awarded nominal damages in the amount of $1000.  As he had
earlier found CGL only 20% responsible in relation to the
Pathfinder transaction, this amount was reduced to an award of
$200.
[34] Finally, the trial judge dismissed Baker&#146;s claim that CGL or
FCG were liable for his costs of defending proceedings against
him by the Law Society of Upper Canada (&quot;LSUC&quot;) in relation to
his conduct as executor of the Rosbrook estate.  He concluded
that CGL&#146;s retainer on the estate file was limited to the
performance of specific tasks and did not include the matter
complained of in the LSUC proceedings.</pre>
    <pre>     Issues</pre>
    <pre>[35] The appellants raise the following issues:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  whether the trial judge erred in holding that CGL was not
  liable in respect of its acts or omissions before March 1, 1988;
  and,</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  whether the trial judge erred in his assessment of damages.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[36] The respondents raise the following additional issue on the
cross-appeal:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  whether the trial judge erred in finding CGL liable for
  failing to warn in connection with the Pathfinder transaction.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>     CGL&#146;s duty to warn</pre>
    <pre>[37] The appellants submit that the trial judge erred in holding
that CGL did not owe a duty to warn Baker or Seven-Up that the
beneficiaries might attack the Baker transaction.  The appellants
argue that Seven-Up initiated the request which resulted in Baker
assuming the position of president, that CGL performed work on
behalf of Seven-Up to complete the transaction, and that CGL
claimed that it provided &#147;proactive service&#148; to its clients.  The
appellants submit that accordingly, CGL owed a duty to warn Baker
or Seven-Up of all risks associated with the transaction.
[38]  The trial judge correctly set out the law regarding a
solicitor&#146;s duty to warn a client about the risks involved in a
transaction or course of action.  He summarized the case law in
this area at p. 471:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; Defining the scope of the solicitor&#146;s retainer is an
   essential element in cases where the client&#146;s complaint is that
   the solicitor failed to warn the client of a risk.  In Midland
   Bank Trust Co. v. Hett, Stubbs &amp; Kemp, [1978] 3 All E.R. 571
   (Ch.D.), Oliver J. stated that there was nothing like a &#147;general
   retainer&#148; in the sense that a solicitor is duty bound to consider
   all the aspects of the client&#146;s interests generally when
   consulted for a particular aspect of the problem (at 583).  The
   duty to warn only arises when an ordinarily competent and prudent
   solicitor would have issued a warning, taking into account all of
   the surrounding circumstances, including the form and nature of
   the client&#146;s instructions and the sophistication of the client:
   see Woodglen &amp; Co. v. Owens, unreported (November 20, 1996)
   [summarized 67 A.C.W.S. (3d) 390 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.))].</pre>
    <pre>[39] In concluding at p. 473 that the scope of CGL's retainer
with respect to the Baker transaction did not require the firm to
advise Baker or Seven-Up of the risk that the transaction was
vulnerable to attack by the beneficaries, the trial judge noted
that neither Baker nor anyone at Seven-Up revealed to anyone at
CGL the terms of Baker's arrangement before it was a fait
accompli.  Neither did Baker nor anyone at Seven-Up ask the firm
to give advice on the legal issues arising from the arrangement.
The finding that the scope of CGL's retainer in respect of Seven-
Up was limited was appropriate considering that Seven-Up did not
consult CGL either directly or through Baker in negotiating the
arrangements with Baker;  the firm was simply given specific
instructions by Graye to perform certain specific tasks to
implement the arrangements.   The trial judge properly found that
CGL did not owe a duty to warn Baker considering that Baker, a
senior partner in the firm, was a sophisticated client who ought
to have known of the conflict of interest problem triggered by
the arrangements he was entering.  Moreover, as noted above,
Baker drafted the consent to the share issuance on behalf of the
estate and executed it on the estate&#146;s behalf in his capacity as
executor.   As CGL was not retained to perform these legal steps,
it was not required to provide legal advice in relation thereto.
[40] This court recently stated in Woodglen &amp; Co., supra, [1999]
O.J. No. 3989, that the nature and scope of a solicitor&#146;s
retainer is &#147;a factual question on which the findings of the
trial judge are entitled to great deference.&#148;   In this case,
there was ample evidentiary support for the trial judge&#146;s finding
that the retainer between the firm and Baker and Seven-Up in
relation to the Baker transaction was limited in nature.
Accordingly, this ground of appeal does not succeed.
[41] With respect to the Pathfinder transaction, the respondents
on their cross-appeal submit that the trial judge erred in
finding that CGL owed a duty to Baker and Seven-Up to warn them
that the beneficiaries might attack the transaction because their
consent to it had not been obtained.  The respondents raised a
number of arguments in support of the cross-appeal.  Counsel for
the respondents argued that the retainer for the Pathfinder
transaction was limited in that Seven-Up did not ask CGL to
provide advice on the risk of a potential dispute among its
shareholders and that Baker acted as if he were the lead
solicitor on the transaction.  In addition, the respondents
argued that the appellants failed to establish that any
individual lawyer had the necessary knowledge to give rise to
vicarious liability on the part of the firm for failure to warn.
[42] The findings of the trial judge amply support his conclusion
that the retainer on the Pathfinder transaction included a duty
to warn Baker and Seven-Up of the potential problem created by
the estate's exclusion.  As found by the trial judge, CGL was
involved in all aspects of the transaction.  The firm knew from
the time it was retained that the estate would not participate in
the transaction and that Baker was continuing as sole executor.
The legal problems presented by this scenario are ones that the
trial judge properly observed any lawyer should recognize.   The
trial judge also correctly observed that the reason that CGL did
not warn Baker or Seven-Up of the attendant risk was because no
CGL lawyer on the transaction perceived the problem and not
because they perceived the problem to fall outside its retainer.
[43] As noted, a trial judge&#146;s determination of the nature and
scope of a solicitor&#146;s retainer is entitled to deference by an
appellate court.  In our view, the trial judge&#146;s findings
regarding the nature and scope of the retainer on the Pathfinder
transaction are supported by the record and there is no basis for
this court to interfere with them.</pre>
    <pre>     The Assessment of Damages</pre>
    <pre>[44] Counsel for the appellants raised several grounds of appeal
related to the trial judge&#146;s assessment of damages.  First,
counsel submitted that the trial judge erred by focussing on the
lost chance of obtaining the beneficiaries&#146; consent at no cost to
Seven-Up.   Counsel argued that the appellants were entitled to
damages so long as there was a reasonable basis to conclude that
their losses could have been reduced.  To this end, counsel
suggested that there was a reasonable basis to conclude that the
cost of obtaining consent in April 1988, at the time of the
Pathfinder transaction, would have been lower than the amount
ultimately paid to settle the estate litigation.  In the
alternative, counsel argued that the trial judge should have
considered that the appellants could have pursued other means for
avoiding paying the settlement amount, such as by formally
requesting the estate to invest in the Pathfinder transaction
prior to closing.  It was submitted that if such a course were
followed, the evidence showed that the estate lacked the funds to
invest and would have had to decline the opportunity, thereby
undermining a subsequent claim by the beneficiaries for breach of
fiduciary duty.
[45] These arguments are not persuasive.  The appellants'
submission that there was a reasonable prospect that consent
could have been obtained at a lower cost than was ultimately paid
to settle the estate litigation is not compelling in light of the
absence of  evidence to support this position.  There was no
evidence led at trial regarding the possibility of obtaining the
beneficiaries' consent to the Pathfinder transaction at a lower
cost, that is, on the basis of a payment less than the amount
paid to the beneficiaries to settle their claim.   Nor was there
any evidence from Baker as to what he, and hence Seven-Up, would
have paid to procure the beneficiaries' consent to the Pathfinder
transaction.   Thus, the appellants' case for damages at trial
did not proceed on the basis that counsel now seeks to advance on
appeal.
[46] To require the trial judge to consider all of the various
permutations of what one party might have paid and the chances
that the other party might have accepted that amount does not
involve mere &#147;difficulty in assessing damages&#148;, particularly
where there is no evidence from either party on the point.  It
renders the assessment of damages impossible.
[47] The appellants' alternative submission that the trial judge
should have considered that they could have pursued other means
to avoid paying the settlement is similarly undermined by the
absence of evidence before the trial judge on this point.
Moreover, this submission could work against Baker.  It may be
that the beneficiaries would have found a way  to participate in
the Pathfinder transaction if they had been given the opportunity
to do so.  Had the beneficiaries thereby acquired some of the
newly-issued shares, Baker's ultimate share in the proceeds from
the Pepsi transaction would have been reduced, perhaps by an
amount that exceeded the cost of settling the estate litigation.
Accordingly, the possibility of the beneficiaries' participation
in the Pathfinder transaction undermines the appellants' claim
for damages flowing from CGL's failure to warn the appellants of
their potential liability to the beneficiaries.
[48] Furthermore, even if Baker had given the beneficiaries the
opportunity to participate in the transaction and if they had
been unable to raise the necessary funds to do so, this fact
would not have been a defence to Baker's liability for breach of
fiduciary duty.  Critical to the concept of fiduciary duty is the
requirement that the fiduciary scrupulously avoid placing himself
or herself in a possible conflict of interest with the
beneficiary.   The fact that the beneficiary is unable to
participate in or profit from a transaction has not been
permitted to allow the fiduciary to benefit from it where a
potential conflict exists:  Keech v. Sandford (1726), 25 E.R.
223.
[49] Secondly, counsel for the appellants submitted that the
trial judge erred with respect to the onus and standard of proof
applied to the assessment of damages.  Counsel argued that,
because CGL&#146;s negligence made it difficult to assess damages, the
trial judge ought to have reversed the onus, or resolved
uncertainties in the proof of damages in favour of the
appellants.
[50] The appellants cannot succeed on this ground of appeal.  In
terms of the onus of proof, the onus was on the appellants to
establish the value of the lost chance.  The lost chance
assessment does not proceed on the basis that an inference of
lost chance may be drawn where the defendant fails to adduce
evidence to the contrary:  see Farrell v. Snell, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
311.
[51] In the lost chance assessment, the plaintiff must establish
causation and the value of the lost chance on a balance of
probabilities:  see De la Giroday v. Brough, [1997] 6 W.W.R. 585
(B.C.C.A.).  However, the plaintiff need not prove on a balance
of probabilities that the chance would have in fact materialized:
see Wong v. 407527 Ontario Ltd., [1999] O.J. No. 3377 (C.A.).
Thus, the fact that the chance of avoiding a loss or obtaining a
benefit was less than 50% does not serve as a bar to the
plaintiff&#146;s claim for damages, provided that the chance of
success is above the de minimis range identified in Eastwalsh
Homes, supra.
[52] Applying these principles to this case, the trial judge
properly accepted that the appellants could be compensated for
the value of the lost chance of obtaining the beneficiaries'
consent at the time of the Pathfinder transaction.   His finding
that the appellants' evidence only established an entitlement to
nominal damages did not involve an improper shift in onus, nor an
improper application of the standard of proof.  In any event, it
bears noting that the trial judge found that the appellants had
satisfied the onus of proving causation and the value of the lost
chance.
[53] Counsel for the appellants' third submission was that the
trial judge erred by assessing the damages at 50% of the amount
paid to settle the beneficiaries&#146; claims and by attributing 80%
of the loss to Baker and Seven-Up.  Counsel argued that CGL&#146;s
failure to warn was the cause of all proximate losses as all of
the beneficiaries&#146; concerns would have been resolved had a
warning been given.  Counsel further suggested that it is
inappropriate to apportion liability as CGL knew of the problems
and chose not to give a warning.
[54] These arguments again are without merit.  The trial judge
found that the beneficiaries&#146; success in obtaining a large
settlement did not have &#147;an all-or-nothing causal connection&#148;
with CGL&#146;s failure to warn the appellants of their potential
liability to the beneficiaries.  On this basis, he found that 50%
of the settlement and the related legal costs were attributable
to CGL&#146;s breach.   We agree with this finding for the reasons
given by the trial judge. The trial judge acknowledged the
difficulty of estimating the portion of the settlement amount
attributable to the breach of fiduciary claim.  In arriving at
the 50% figure, he had regard to Baker's evidence that the estate
litigation was settled primarily to permit the highly lucrative
asset sale to Pepsi to proceed.  As well, he considered that the
estate litigation included a number of other claims aside from
breach of fiduciary duty.  We do not see a basis for disturbing
his finding that only 50% of the settlement amount was
attributable to CGL's failure to warn.
[55] In apportioning liability, the trial judge found that Baker
&#147;&#133;acted virtually as if he were the senior lawyer with carriage
of the file.&#148;  In this regard, he noted that Baker made the
decision that the estate should not participate in the Pathfinder
transaction without consulting CGL.  He further found that Seven-
Up was in no better position than Baker as Baker was Seven-Up&#146;s
President and directing mind.  His finding that Baker and Seven-
Up were 80% responsible for any losses flowing from the
Pathfinder transaction is supported by the evidence and there is
no basis for this court to interfere.
[56] Finally, the appellants submit that the trial judge erred in
rejecting the appellants&#146; claim for other heads of damage,
including the costs of defending the estate litigation and the
LSUC complaint and the account paid for the Pathfinder
transaction.  The appellants argue that their legal costs are
properly recoverable as there would have been no estate
litigation or LSUC complaint against Baker had the beneficiaries&#146;
concerns been addressed in 1988.  In connection with the
Pathfinder account, the appellants argue that it is wrong to
allow CGL to retain fees for services negligently performed.
[57] We do not accept these submissions.  The appellants' claim
for legal costs associated with defending the estate litigation
was dealt with by the trial judge, who concluded that 50% of
these costs were attributable to CGL&#146;s breach.  The submission
that the legal costs of defending the estate litigation or the
LSUC complaint could have been avoided if the beneficiaries'
concerns had been addressed in 1988 is not supported by the
evidence.   Although there was negligence in the performance of
the legal services related to the Pathfinder transaction in light
of the failure to warn Seven-Up, no damages other than those
already found by the trial judge in relation to the failure to
warn were suffered as a result of that negligence.   Indeed,
Seven-Up derived significant benefit from the completion of the
transaction, which had the effect of augmenting the assets of the
company.  Accordingly, the appellants' claim for reimbursement
for these services is untenable.</pre>
