    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Chapnik J. dated May 28, 1998</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the judgment of Chapnik J. dismissing
the action brought by a group of investors against a law firm.  A
member of the firm performed legal work in relation to an
investment that ultimately went sour, causing the investors to
lose all of the money they had advanced.  The case against the
law firm depended on the nature of the relationship between the
solicitor and the investors. One of the promoters, Bell, retained
the solicitor to act as corporate solicitor for 835051 Ontario
Limited [&#147;the company&#148;].  The essential issues centred on whether
the solicitor also had a solicitor-client or other fiduciary
relationship with the investors.
[2]  The appellants advanced a number of grounds of appeal that
may be summarized as follows:</pre>
    <pre>   (1)  The trial judge erred in failing to find that the judgment
        of Wilkins J. constituted a determination that the company 
	held and had always held the property as a trustee for the 
	benefit of the investors and that the investors were 
	therefore the solicitor&#146;s client;</pre>
    <pre>   (2)  In the alternative, the trial judge erred in failing to 
	find that the solicitor was aware that Bell was in a 
	fiduciary relationship with the investors and he was 
	constructively a party to Bell&#146;s breach of duty;</pre>
    <pre>   (3)  The trial judge erred by not concluding that the solicitor
        had breached his duty of care to the investors by placing
        mortgages on the subject land and disposing of funds 
	without proper authorization from the corporation.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, there is no merit in any of these grounds of
appeal and the appeal must be dismissed.  Accordingly, it is
unnecessary to consider the appellants&#146; argument that the trial
judge also erred in finding that even if there was a breach of
duty by the solicitor it did not result in any damages to the
appellants.
[4]  The first ground of appeal depends upon the proper
characterization of the judgment of Wilkins J. in the former
proceedings between the investors and the promoters and the
corporation.  While the solicitor testified at those proceedings,
he was not a party to them.  The appellants nevertheless contend
that the judgment given by Wilkins J. was an in rem judgment and
was binding on the respondents.  We agree with the respondents
that there is nothing to indicate that Wilkins J. intended to
create a substantive constructive trust that would retroactively
affect the relationship between the solicitor and the investors.
All of the matters in issue in this case predate the judgment of
Wilkins J. by several years.
[5]  The finding that the judgment of Wilkins J. did not create a
substantive constructive trust is not determinative of the
issues.  The nature of the relationship between the solicitor and
the investors depended upon the facts.  Counsel for the
appellants pointed out a number of circumstances to demonstrate
that in any event the solicitor had a solicitor-client or
fiduciary relationship with the investors.  The relationship
between solicitor and client is based on general concepts of
contract and the specific concept of retainer.  The usual indicia
of a solicitor-client relationship &#150; meetings between solicitor
and client, a retainer agreement, correspondence between
solicitor and client, and a bill for services &#150; are all missing
in this case.  The trial judge fully reviewed the evidence,
including the various circumstances relied upon by the
appellants, and concluded that the solicitor was not in a
solicitor-and-client relationship with the appellants.  That
finding is fully supported by the evidence and is unimpeachable.
[6]  With respect to the second ground of appeal, it was open to
the trial judge to find that the solicitor was not otherwise in a
fiduciary relationship.  It is not suggested that the trial judge
misapprehended the applicable legal principles or the underlying
facts.
[7]  None of the indicia of a fiduciary duty &#150; scope for exercise
of discretion or power, actual exercise of discretion or power to
affect the beneficiary&#146;s interest and unique vulnerability of the
beneficiary &#150; are present in this case: see Lac Minerals Ltd. v.
International Corona Resources Ltd., [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574.
Moreover, the courts should be careful in imposing fiduciary
obligations on a solicitor outside the solicitor-client
relationship if the solicitor is engaged in the delivery of legal
services.  The imposition of a fiduciary duty on a solicitor in
relation to a non-client involved in a transaction with a client
whom the solicitor is representing could give rise to a serious
conflict of interest: see Anand v. Medjuck, [1994] O.J. No. 2571
(Gen. Div.) affirmed [1998] O.J. No. 101 (C.A.).
[8]  We do not think that the solicitor breached his duty of care
by failing to take steps to ensure that Bell made full disclosure
to the appellants.  The trial judge found that although the
solicitor was not in a fiduciary relationship with the investors,
he stood in a sufficient relationship of proximity with the
appellants to &#147;engender a duty of care&#148; on his part.  Assuming
that this is correct, we agree with the trial judge that the
solicitor did not breach his duty of care to the appellants.  It
is now apparent that Bell misled the appellants, or some of them,
as to the nature of the investment and did not fully disclose
that they were to be shareholders only and that the property was
encumbered by two very large mortgages.  The trial judge found
that there was nothing to indicate to the solicitor that Bell had
not made full disclosure to the investors about the nature and
structure of the investment opportunity.  It is implicit in her
reasons that she found the solicitor acted reasonably in relying
on Bell's assurances.  Counsel meticulously reviewed the evidence
to attempt to demonstrate that the circumstances surrounding the
investment agreement were obviously suspicious.  We have not been
persuaded that the trial judge erred in finding that the
solicitor did not breach any duty of care he might have owed to
the investors.  Further, in light of the trial judge's findings
of fact there is no basis for finding that the solicitor
knowingly assisted in the breach of Bell's fiduciary duty to the
investors.
[9]  With respect to the third ground of appeal, the trial judge
found that the solicitor reasonably believed that Bell and
Zahavy, the presidents of the company at the relevant times, had
the necessary authority to act on the company&#146;s behalf and give
the necessary instructions for disbursement of the funds and
placing of the mortgages.  This finding was supported by the
evidence and is entitled to deference.  Although the
circumstances, especially those attending the placing of the
second mortgage, are of some concern, the trial judge had the
benefit of seeing and hearing the witnesses and we cannot say
that her findings are unreasonable.  In light of this conclusion
it is unnecessary for us to consider the respondents&#146; position
that a legal challenge to the authorizations would need to be
made by the corporation, not by the individual investors.
[10] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
