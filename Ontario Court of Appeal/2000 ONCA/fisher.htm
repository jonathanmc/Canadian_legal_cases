    <pre>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Morin dated June 26, 1998
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence imposed on the
respondent on the ground that a blended sentence of imprisonment,
to  be  served  partly in custody and partly  in  the  community,
contravenes  s.  732(1) and s. 742.1 of the  Criminal  Code.  The
Crown does not otherwise dispute the fitness of the sentence. The
respondent concedes that the sentence is illegal. We agree.
[2]  Following his trial before a judge and jury, the respondent
was convicted on two counts of sexual assault.  The trial judge
sentenced the respondent to a conditional sentence of two years
less one day on each count, to be served concurrently. The
conditional sentence order was made subject to the respondent
complying with a number of conditions, one of which was that the
respondent spend week-ends in jail for a period of one year.
[3]  By this order, the trial judge purported to combine two
sentencing provisions, the intermittent sentence and the
conditional sentence, provided for under s. 732(1) and 742.1 of
the Criminal Code respectively. These sections read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          732. (1) Where the court imposes a sentence of 
	  imprisonment of ninety days or less on an offender 
	  convicted of an offence, whether in default of
	  payment of a fine or otherwise, the court may,
	  having regard to the age and character of the
	  offender, the nature of the offence and the
	  circumstances surrounding its commission, and
	  the availability of appropriate accommodation to
          ensure compliance with the sentence, order
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a) that the sentence be served intermittently at
	      such times as are specified in the order; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b) that the offender comply with the conditions
	      prescribed in a probation order when not in
	      confinement during the period that the sentence
	      is being served and, if the court so orders, on
	      release from prison  after completing the
	      intermittent sentence.
          </pre>
    <pre>          742.1  Where a person is convicted of an offence,
	  except an offence that is punishable by a minimum
	  term of imprisonment, and the court
           </pre>
    <pre>              (a)  imposes a sentence of imprisonment of
	           less than two years, and
           </pre>
    <pre>              (b)  is satisfied that serving the sentence
		   in the community would not endanger the
	           safety of the community and would be
	           consistent with the fundamental purpose
	           and principles of sentencing set out in
	           sections 718 to 718.2,
          </pre>
    <pre>          the court may, for the purpose of supervising the
	  offender's behaviour in the community, order that
	  the offender serve the sentence in the community,
          subject to the offender's complying with the
          conditions of a conditional sentence order made 
	  under section 742.3.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  It is clear that s. 732(1) provides for the imposition of an
intermittent sentence only where the court imposes a sentence  of
imprisonment  of  &#147;ninety days or less&#148;.  Since the  sentence  of
imprisonment  imposed  by the trial judge exceeded  ninety  days,
this option was not available.
[5]  The imposition of a custodial sentence as part of a
conditional sentence is also contrary both to the wording of
s. 742.1 and to the underlying purpose of the conditional
sentence regime.
[6]  Section 742.1 provides that, where the two prerequisites are
met, the court may order that the offender &#147;serve the sentence in
the community&#148;. It does not provide that the offender may be
ordered to serve a portion of his sentence in the community. A
useful comparison may be made with the wording under s. 742.6(9)
which does make that provision. Under s. 742.6(9), where the
court is satisfied that the offender has breached a condition of
the conditional sentence order, the court may direct &#147;that the
offender serve in custody a portion of the unexpired sentence&#148;.
Hence a conditional sentence order can only be made with respect
to the total sentence.
[7]  This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the
conditional sentencing scheme. As stated by the Supreme Court of
Canada in the recent decision of R. v. Proulx, 2000 S.C.C. 5 at
para. 21 &quot;[t]he conditional sentence is a meaningful alternative
to incarceration for less serious and non-dangerous offenders.
The offenders who meet the criteria of s. 742.1 will serve a
sentence under strict surveillance in the community instead of
going to prison.&quot; [Emphasis added.]
[8]  Other Canadian appellate courts that have considered this
same issue have consistently held that a blended sentence, which
purported to combine a custodial order with an order that the
sentence be served in the community, was illegal. See R. v.
Hirtle, [1999] N.S.J. No. 165 (C.A.); R. v. Wey, [1999] A.J. No.
957 (C.A.); R. v. Monkman (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Man.C.A.);
R. v. Maynard, [1999] M.J. No. 8 (Man. C.A.) and R. v. Kopf,
[1997] A.Q. No. 795 (C.A.).
[9]  Leave to appeal is therefore granted, the appeal is allowed
and the sentence is varied by deleting the condition that week-
ends be served in jail for a period of one year.
