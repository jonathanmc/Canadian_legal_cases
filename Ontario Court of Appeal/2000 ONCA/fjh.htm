    <pre><strong>On appeal from conviction by Hermiston J., with a jury, dated
January 20, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MACPHERSON J.A.:

INTRODUCTION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, F. J. H., was tried before Hermiston J.,
sitting with a jury, in Barrie in January 1999.  He was convicted
of three offences - sexual assault against BP, sexual assault
against SK, and touching for a sexual purpose SK, a person under
the age of fourteen.  He was acquitted of the offence of
invitation to touch for a sexual purpose in relation to BP, a
person under the age of fourteen.  The trial judge directed
acquittals on three other counts in the indictment.  The trial
judge imposed a one-year conditional sentence to be followed by
eighteen months of probation.
[2]  The appellant appealed his convictions on four grounds:</pre>
    <pre>(1)  the failure of the trial judge in his jury charge to warn
     the jury about improper use of evidence in two respects &#150; first,
     use of evidence across counts, and second, use of evidence for an
     impermissible propensity purpose;</pre>
    <pre>(2)  the inconsistency of the verdicts on the two counts relating
     to the complainant BP ;</pre>
    <pre>(3)  an improper mid-trial comment by the trial judge concerning
     the effect of the preliminary inquiry; and</pre>
    <pre>(4)  the multiplicity of convictions on the two counts relating
     to SK based on the same alleged conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  At the appeal hearing, the appellant abandoned his second
and third grounds of appeal.  The Crown conceded the fourth
ground of appeal on the basis of R. v. Kienapple (1974), 15
C.C.C. (2d) 524 (S.C.C.)  Accordingly, the only live ground of
appeal was the first ground relating to limiting instructions in
the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury.
[4]  The Crown sought leave to appeal the sentence  and sought a
term of incarceration instead of a conditional sentence.
[5]  At the conclusion of the hearing, we allowed the appeal
against the three convictions and dismissed the Crown&#146;s
application for leave to appeal the sentence as moot.  We
indicated that brief reasons would follow.  These are those
reasons.</pre>
    <pre>A.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[6]  BP was the daughter of the appellant&#146;s common law wife, SP.
The three resided together during the relevant time period.  BP
alleged that on a number of occasions the appellant touched her
vagina over her panties, or removed her panties and inserted his
fingers into her vagina.  The alleged course of conduct took
place from the time BP was 6 years old until she was 13.
[7]  SK was a friend of BP.  On one occasion, when she was 8 or 9
years old, she slept over at BP&#146;s home.  During the night she got
up for a glass of water.  She alleged that she encountered the
appellant, who was watching television in the living room.  He
asked her to sit on his lap.  While she was on his lap, he placed
his fingers into her vagina.
[8]  At the beginning of the trial, the Crown brought an
application to permit the jury to use the evidence of the
allegations of BP as similar fact evidence in respect of the
allegations of SK and vice versa.  The trial judge reserved his
decision on the Crown&#146;s application.  At the conclusion of the
trial, he dismissed the application.  He reasoned:
          </pre>
    <pre>                In  the case at bar the conduct of  the
          accused is common to each complainant and the
          nature  of the conduct is similar -  touching
          the   child&#146;s  vagina  in  his   home.    The
          complaints are contemporaneous.  The evidence
          is certainly discreditable to the accused and
          can be considered relevant and material.  The
          inference to be drawn is that the accused has
          a  propensity, or disposition to molest young
          girls  and did so on these occasions  as  set
          out   in   the  different  counts.   But   in
          achieving the correct balance the court  must
          be  satisfied that the probative value of the
          evidence    exceeds,   or    outweighs    its
          prejudicial  effect against  the  accused  on
          each  count.   I  am not so  satisfied.   The
          evidence  of  each girl is not  strong.   The
          evidence  of  [SK] appears to be inconsistent
          with   statements  given   earlier   to   the
          Childrens&#146;  Aid Society. [BP&#146;s]  evidence  is
          inconsistent with that of [SK] as to what she
          heard  on the night in question and the  time
          of  night  the alleged incident against  [SK]
          occurred.    There   is  a   possibility   of
          collusion  between the two complainants.   It
          is  my  view that each count should be judged
          by the jury based on the evidence relating to
          that   count   only.   The   application   is
          therefore dismissed. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[9]  In spite of this ruling, the trial judge did not instruct
the jury that they were not to consider evidence respecting
counts relating to one complainant in their consideration of
counts concerning the other complainant.  Nor did the trial judge
instruct the jury that evidence of one set of allegations
respecting one complainant could not be used as bad character or
propensity evidence in their consideration of the allegations
concerning the other complainant.
[10] The Crown concedes that the trial judge should have given
these two limiting instructions.  In our view, this concession is
properly made.  However, despite its concession that the trial
judge erred in not properly charging the jury on these matters,
the Crown relies on the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the
Criminal Code in support of its position that the convictions
should stand.  Section 686(1)(b)(iii) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          686(1)   On the hearing of an appeal against a 
	  conviction &#133; the court of appeal &#133;

              (b)   may dismiss the appeal where &#133;</pre>
    <pre>              (iii) notwithstanding that the court is of
	            the opinion that on any  ground mentioned
	            in (a)(ii) the appeal might be decided in
                    favour of the appellant, if it is of the
                    opinion that no substantial wrong or
                    miscarriage of justice has occurred &#133;.            </pre>
    <pre>B.   ISSUE</pre>
    <pre>[11] There is a single issue to be resolved on this appeal -
despite the trial judge&#146;s error in failing to provide proper
limiting instructions, should the appeal be dismissed under
s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code on the ground that no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred?</pre>
    <pre>C.      ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[12] The trial judge ruled against the Crown on its similar fact
evidence application.  However, since the counts were joined on
one indictment, the jury heard all of the Crown&#146;s evidence about
the alleged sexual assaults against the two complainants.  In
this circumstance, it was incumbent on the trial judge to warn
the jury that it must consider only the evidence relevant to each
alleged assault in arriving at a verdict on that assault.  As
well, it was essential that the trial judge warn the jury that it
could not use the conduct of the appellant in relation to one
complainant to form an opinion that he was the type of person who
might engage in the criminal activity related to the allegations
of the second complainant: see R. v. B. (F.F.) (1993), 79 C.C.C.
(3d) 112 (S.C.C.), and R. v. Rarru (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 53
(S.C.C.).
[13] In R. v. M. (B.) (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.),
Rosenberg J.A. provided a useful summary of the law in this area.
Referring to both B. (F.F.) and Rarru, he said that a jury charge
should contain two warnings.  He expressed them in this fashion,
at pp. 370-71:
          </pre>
    <pre>                First, when evidence of one count is  not
          admissible  as  similar fact  evidence  on  the
          other  counts,  jurors must  be  instructed  to
          consider each charge separately and not to  use
          evidence relating to one charge as evidence  on
          any of the other counts &#133;.
          Second, Rarru requires the trial judge to  give
          the   jury   a   proper  limiting   instruction
          regardless of whether evidence of other  counts
          or  of  uncharged misconduct is  admissible  as
          similar fact evidence &#133;  It was essential  that
          the  jury be instructed that it was not to rely
          on  the  evidence  of  other  counts  or  other
          uncharged misconduct as proof that the  accused
          is  the  sort  of person who would  commit  the
          offence or offences charged &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>[14] In the present appeal, the Crown concedes that these two
limiting instructions should have been given by the trial judge.
However, the Crown submits that this error was not fatal in this
case and can be saved by the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of
the Code.  The Crown succinctly states its position in its factum
at paragraph 30:
          </pre>
    <pre>                30.  The  Respondent concedes  that  the
          trial judge should have provided the jury with
          a limiting instruction in accordance with this
          Court&#146;s decision in R. v. M.(B.).  However, in
          the  unique  circumstances of this trial,  and
          having regard to the charge to the jury  as  a
          whole,  the closing arguments of counsel,  and
          the  jury&#146;s  verdict, the trial judge&#146;s  error
          occasioned no miscarriage of justice.
          </pre>
    <pre>[15] In this paragraph, the Crown mentions three separate factors
in support of its s. 686(1)(b)(iii) argument - the jury charge as
a whole, closing arguments by counsel, and the jury&#146;s verdict.  I
will consider these in turn.
[16] The Crown submits that the trial judge&#146;s charge would have
communicated to the jury that the evidence of one complainant was
to be considered solely in relation to the counts pertaining to
her allegations.  The trial judge reviewed the counts in the
indictment pertaining to each complainant one after the other.
He reviewed the theories of the Crown and the defence relating to
each complainant separately.  He instructed the jury that &#147;it is
incumbent upon the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the allegations made by the complainant in each count are
true.&#148;
[17] In my view, the structure and contents of the jury charge
are not sufficient to overcome the absence of the two standard
warnings set out in B. (F.F.), Rarru and M.(B.).  The problem
with the charge is its silence about what the jury could not do
with the evidence.
[18] The trial judge was alive to the nature and significance of
the problem.  In his ruling on the Crown&#146;s similar fact evidence
application he remarked on the similarities between the
allegations of the two young girls - similarities of time,
location and actual conduct.  However, he stated that the
&#147;evidence of each girl is not strong&#148; and pointed to
inconsistencies between their evidence.  He also referred to the
possibility of collusion by the complainants.  These factors led
him to deny the Crown&#146;s application and to conclude that &#147;each
count should be judged by the jury based on the evidence relating
to that count only.&#148;
[19] Unfortunately, the trial judge never instructed the jury in
accordance with his ruling.  In this case, given the similarities
between the allegations of the two complainants, there was a
danger that the jury might improperly consider the evidence of
one complainant as corroboration of the other.  There was a
further danger that the jury might conclude that the appellant
was guilty because he was the sort of person to commit this type
of offence.  It was, therefore, incumbent on the judge to explain
clearly to the jury that they could not use the evidence in these
ways - namely, across counts in the indictment relating to
different complainants, and to suggest that the accused had a
propensity or disposition to commit these types of crimes.
[20] The Crown also submits that the structure and contents of
the closing addresses of counsel would have brought home to the
jury that they had to consider the evidence pertaining to each
complainant separately.  In those addresses, the evidence of each
complainant and the credibility issues to be resolved by the jury
in regard to the truthfulness of each complainant were reviewed
separately for each complainant.  Moreover, counsel did not
suggest that the jury could make comparisons between the evidence
of the two complainants about the appellant&#146;s conduct.
[21] In my view, the Crown&#146;s submission on this point is
misconceived.  The jury must receive its instructions about the
law from the judge, and only the judge.  Where a trial judge
omits a required caution from his charge, this error cannot be
cured by inference flowing from either the structure or the
contents of the closing addresses by counsel.
[22] Finally, the Crown contends that the actual verdicts
rendered by the jury indicate that the jury did not misuse the
evidence.  The jury found the appellant guilty of sexual assault
on BP, but not guilty of the offence of inviting BP to touch him
for a sexual purpose.  The Crown submits that these verdicts
could only have been rendered if the jury considered the evidence
on each count carefully and separately.
[23] The Crown&#146;s interpretation of the jury verdicts is a
plausible one.  However, the opposite interpretation is equally
plausible. The jury might have found the appellant not guilty on
count 4 of the indictment because they were not satisfied beyond
a reasonable doubt on the basis of BP&#146;s evidence that the
appellant had asked her to touch him for a sexual purpose.  But
with respect to count 1, the jury might have supplemented BP&#146;s
evidence concerning the appellant&#146;s alleged sexual assaults with
SK&#146;s evidence of the appellant&#146;s similar conduct concerning her.
This reasoning, if the jury engaged in it, would be
impermissible.  In short, the jury&#146;s verdicts are at least as
consistent with improper use of the evidence as they are with
proper use.
[24] In B.(F.F.), Iacobucci J. described the circumstances in
which it is appropriate for an appellate court to apply the
proviso.  He said, at pp. 140-41:
          </pre>
    <pre>                Section  686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal
          Code is for use in exceptional cases only, as
          this  court  has  emphasized  in  two  recent
          cases.   In R. v. S. (P.L.) (1991), 64 C.C.C.
          (3d)  193 at 198, &#133; Sopinka J. held  for  the
          majority, that s. 686(1)(b)(iii) can only  be
          invoked   where   &#147;the   evidence    is    so
          overwhelming  that  a  trier  of  fact  would
          inevitably   convict&#148;.   In  R.  v.   Broyles
          (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 308 at p. 328,  &#133;  the
          court  emphasized:  &#147;The appropriate standard
          for  the application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii)  is
          an    onerous   one.&#148;    The   court   quoted
          Sopinka  J.&#146;s reasons from R. v.  S.  (P.L.),
          supra,  and  stated at p. 328:  &#147;Accordingly,
          the  question  here is whether there  is  any
          possibility that the trier of fact would have
          had a reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the
          accused   had  the  impugned  evidence   been
          removed from their consideration.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>[25] In my view, the Crown cannot bring this appeal within the
very high standard set out in this passage. In the end, the trial
judge&#146;s own reasoning in his ruling on the Crown&#146;s similar fact
evidence application underlines the dangers in this case
concerning the evidence of the two complainants. In the context
of the judge&#146;s own statement that the &#147;evidence of each girl is
not strong&#148;, I cannot conclude that, in the language of S.
(P.L.), &#147;the evidence is so overwhelming that a trier of fact
would inevitably convict&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION                                                                 </pre>
    <pre>[26] I would allow the appeal and order a new trial on counts 1,
5 and 7 in the indictment.  In light of this result, the
application of the Kienapple principle is left to the judge on
the new trial in the event that the appellant is found guilty of
both counts 5 and 7.  In light of this disposition, I would
dismiss as moot the Crown&#146;s application for leave to appeal
sentence.
