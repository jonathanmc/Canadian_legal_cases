    <pre><strong>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Humphrey J. on October 25, 1994.
On appeal from the sentence imposed by Epstein J. on November 29, 1994.
On appeal from the sentence imposed by Jennings J. on March 7, 1995.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellant appeals from the sentences imposed on him  at
the  conclusion  of the three separate trials.   These  sentences
were  imposed  for three discrete sets of acts which  took  place
over  a  relatively confined time frame of some  two  weeks.  The
appellant  also  appealed his convictions in  the  trials  before
Humphrey J. and Jennings J., these appeals have been disposed  of
in  separate  reasons.  The appellant commenced an inmate  appeal
against  conviction with regard to the trial before  Epstein  J.,
but this has been abandoned.
[2]  In our view it is appropriate to view these sentences
through the lens of the totality principle.  Given the way these
sentences were imposed, the appellant received a total of 18
years imprisonment which, taken together with his pre-trial
custody, represents the functional equivalent of 20 years.
[3]  In our opinion this represents a fit disposition and one
which cannot be said to be outside the range for these offences
taken together. These offences include, first, possession of a
restricted weapon and possession of cocaine for the purposes of
trafficking; second, forcible confinement, assault, possession of
a dangerous weapon and pointing a firearm; and finally the most
serious, which was an attempted murder of a near stranger using a
firearm, with significant elements of planning and deliberation.
The gravity of these offences is self-evident. We see no error in
the total term of imprisonment imposed on the appellant.
[4]  We therefore grant leave to appeal the sentences, but
dismiss the appeals.
