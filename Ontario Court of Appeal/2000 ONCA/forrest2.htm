    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice John Jennings,
sitting with a jury, on February 22, 1995
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Following  his trial by judge and jury, the  appellant  was
convicted of attempted murder and three related weapons offences.
He  was  sentenced  to a total term of imprisonment  of  eighteen
years to be served concurrently to the time being served on other
offences.   The appellant appeals his conviction and seeks  leave
to  appeal  his sentence. The sentence appeal was heard  together
with  two further appeals against sentence with respect to  other
offences and will be disposed of in separate reasons.
[2]  The appellant raises three grounds of appeal on his appeal
against conviction. The first relates to the trial judge&#146;s
instructions to the jury relating to the assessment of the
complainant&#146;s credibility. The appellant takes issue with the
following excerpt from the trial judge&#146;s charge:</pre>
    <pre>	You will decide whether his untruths about these 
	and perhaps other matters are sufficient to make 
	him unbelievable on the crucial issue of who shot 
	him.  [Emphasis added]
</pre>
    <pre>[3]   Counsel  argues that this instruction in effect erroneously
put  the  burden of proof on the defence to show that there  were
sufficient   untruths  to  make  the  complainant   unbelievable.
Although  this one sentence could  have been worded  differently,
it cannot be considered in isolation. We are satisfied that, when
taken in context, this instruction would not have misled the jury
in  their  assessment  of the complainant&#146;s  credibility  on  the
question  of  burden  of proof.  The trial judge  gave  extensive
instructions  on  this  crucial  issue.  His  instructions,  when
considered  as a whole, were very clear and do not  disclose  any
error.
[4]  The second ground relates to the manner in which the trial
judge instructed the jury to disregard an inappropriate comment
made by defence counsel. The trial judge stated as follows:
</pre>
    <pre>	The defence suggests to you in argument that it is 
	possible that the shooter was one of the two other 
	persons who were present.  I want to caution you on 
	one thing, and I want to caution you very strongly 
	on this point: towards the end of his address, Mr. 
	Azzoli said to you that Mr. Forrest, and I made a
        note of this &#150; I think it is accurate &#150; is telling 
	you he is not the one who shot Campbell.  I must 
	ask you to completely disregard that remark.  No 
	evidence has been called on behalf of the defence 
	to suggest any such thing.  The theory of the defence
        is that the Crown has not proved beyond a reasonable 
	doubt that Forrest shot Campbell.  That is quite a 
	different thing.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Counsel for the appellant concedes that the comment made  by
defence  counsel  was  inappropriate  and  that  it  required  an
instruction from the trial judge. He submits, however,  that  the
manner  in  which this was done by the trial judge  unnecessarily
undermined  the defence and could have led the jury to mistakenly
believe  that  there was an obligation on the appellant  to  call
witnesses for the defence.
[6]  While there may have been preferable ways for the trial
judge to address the jury in this regard, the wording chosen by
the trial judge did not amount to a comment on the failure of the
appellant to testify. Further, it is our view that the charge as
a whole fairly and adequately presented the theory of the
defence. This particular instruction does not in any significant
way detract from the overall effect of the charge.
[7]  Finally, the appellant submits that the trial judge
commented on a crucial piece of evidence, the &#147;near death&#148;
identification of the appellant by the complainant, in a manner
that  was greatly prejudicial to the defence.  We do not agree.
In our view, the trial judge&#146;s comment, in the context that it
was given, was consistent with his duty to decant and simplify
the evidence for the jury. To the extent that the trial judge&#146;s
comment constituted an opinion on the facts, it is our view that
it was fully supported by the evidence and appropriately coupled
with the clear instruction that the jury was free to disregard
his comment.
[8]   For  these  reasons,  the  appeal  against  conviction   is
dismissed.
