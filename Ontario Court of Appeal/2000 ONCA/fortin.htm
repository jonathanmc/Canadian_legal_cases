                   (Appellant)     )    Heard:  February 22, 2000
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the Order of O&#146;Neill J. dated November 4, 1999,
made at Sault Ste. Marie.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>GOUDGE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The defendant Laplante appeals from the order of O&#146;Neill  J.
made  pursuant  to Rule 21 declaring that a snowmobile  does  not
fall  under  the definition of &#147;automobile&#148; in s. 224(1)  of  the
Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8.
[2]  The respondent questions the jurisdiction of this court to
hear the appeal. The order appealed from is a declaration made
under Rule 21 finally disposing of an issue of law. It is not an
order for the payment of money nor an order dismissing such a
claim. The appeal is properly made to this court.
[3]  In this action the respondent has sued the appellant to
recover damages for injuries suffered by the respondent alleged
to be caused by the appellant&#146;s negligent operation of a
snowmobile in Blind River, Ontario.
[4]  We were advised during argument that the appellant&#146;s
snowmobile is covered under his motor vehicle liability policy
and that the respondent has been paid no fault benefits by the
insurer.
[5]   We were also advised that the practical purpose in bringing
this motion was to determine whether in this negligence action
the appellant will benefit as defendant from the nonpecuniary
loss threshold and deductible provisions found in s.267.1 of Part
VI of the Insurance Act. For that to occur the appellant must be,
in the language of that section, &#147;the owner of an automobile&#148;
that caused the damage.
[6]  O&#146;Neill J. concluded that the definition of &#147;automobile&#148;
found in s.224(1) of the Act does not include &#147;snowmobile&#148;. That
section provides the definitions for Part VI of the Insurance
Act. It reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>              224.&#151;(1) In this Part,
          
      	&#147;automobile&#148;, includes a motor vehicle required
	under any Act to be insured under a motor vehicle
	liability policy;</pre>
    <pre>[7]   I  agree  with the conclusions of O&#146;Neill J. and  with  his
reasoning.
[8]  As he said, in ordinary parlance one does not refer to a
snowmobile as an automobile or even a motor vehicle. He then
looked to the legislation which requires a motor vehicle to be
insured under a motor vehicle liability policy, namely, the
Compulsory Automobile Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.25. That
Act defines &#147;motor vehicle&#148; by incorporating the Highway Traffic
Act definition which expressly excludes a motorized snow vehicle.
Folding this back into s.224(1) of the Insurance Act, O&#146;Neill J.
concluded that a snowmobile is not encompassed by the phrase
&#147;motor vehicle&#148; and hence is excluded from the definition of
&#147;automobile&#148; found in s.224(1).
[9]  Finally, O&#146;Neill J. acknowledged that the Motorized Snow
Vehicles Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.44 prohibits a person from driving
a snowmobile unless he is insured under a motor vehicle liability
policy in accordance with the Insurance Act. However, he
concluded that this does not make a snowmobile either an
automobile or a motor vehicle for the purposes of the Insurance
Act.
[10] As I have said, I agree with this reasoning. If the
consequences of this conclusion are that as a matter of statute
or contractual interpretation a person injured by a snowmobile
rather than an automobile may be entitled both to no fault
benefits and to sue in tort without facing either the threshold
or the deductible provisions of s.267 of the Insurance Act that
is an issue of policy for the Legislature. It does not, in my
view, alter the correct statutory interpretation.
[11] The appeal must be dismissed with costs.</pre>
