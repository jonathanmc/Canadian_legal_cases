    <pre><strong>On  appeal  from his conviction by Mr. Justice Robert J.  Cusson,
sitting with a jury, on January 8, 1997</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LABROSSE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellant was convicted by a court composed of a  judge
and  jury  of  numerous sexual offences against his stepdaughter.
He  was  sentenced to five years' imprisonment plus three  years'
probation.   He appeals his conviction, as well as the  probation
portion  of  his  sentence.   It is agreed  that  the  period  of
probation was an illegal part of the sentence.
[2]  This was a bilingual case. The trial judge&#146;s opening
remarks, the opening and closing addresses of both counsel, and
the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury were all given in the French
language.  All witnesses testified in English.  The appeal was
argued in English and all references to the transcript were in
the language, as recorded.  I will adopt the same format that was
used on the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>The facts

[3]   At  the  time of the trial in January 1997, the complainant
was  fourteen  and one-half years of age.  She had  been  between
eight  and twelve years of age when the offences covered  in  the
indictment  occurred (1990-1994).  The complainant  testified  to
numerous  incidents of abuse, including kissing,  touching,  oral
sex,  as  well  as  vaginal  and anal penetration.   She  had  no
recollection  of any specific date, nor any recollection  of  her
mother's or brother's (the appellant's stepson) whereabouts  when
the abuse was taking place.
[4]  The appellant was thirty years of age at the time of the
trial and between twenty-four and twenty-eight years old at the
time of the alleged offences. He had cohabited with the
complainant&#146;s mother and her children for approximately twelve
years, including seven years of marriage.  He denied any incident
of sexual abuse.  His position was that the complainant&#146;s
testimony was all an act. It was part of his defence that because
of his work he was rarely at home and had little, if any,
opportunity to commit the alleged offences.
[5]  The appellant&#146;s wife and his stepson were called as
witnesses by the defence.  At the time of the trial, the
appellant and his wife had been separated since January 1996 and
the sixteen-year old stepson, who was two years older than the
complainant, was living with the appellant.  The wife and the
stepson testified that they never witnessed any sexual
improprieties or unusual behavior.
[6]  The complainant was the only witness for the Crown.  In her
original statement to the police on April 28, 1995, the
complainant mentioned only the appellant&#146;s bedroom as the
location of the sexual abuse.  On May 12, 1995, the complainant
was examined by a gynecologist.  A letter from the doctor, dated
the same date, was filed by the defence on consent.  It states:
&#147;I did not ask her to repeat the details of her disclosure.  The
allegation was of sexual touching of her genitals by fingers.
She was uncertain whether there had been any penetration.&#148; The
examination results neither supported nor refuted the allegations
of sexual abuse.
[7]  On May 20, 1995, the complainant told a Children&#146;s Aid
Society social worker that she had lied about the allegations of
penetration.  She also told her mother she had lied about
penetration.  She later maintained that the allegations of
penetration were true.
[8]  At trial, she testified to incidents of sexual abuse in (1)
the appellant's bedroom, (2) her bedroom, (3) the hallway, (4)
the bathroom, and (5) the living room of their home.  The latter
four locations were not mentioned in her original statement.  She
stated that she had forgotten these four locations and only
remembered them in January 1996, some ten months after her
original statement, when in preparation for the preliminary
hearing, Crown counsel led her through the house, room by room,
asking her in each room if anything had happened. This unusual
procedure by Crown counsel apparently triggered her memory: in
her words, &#147;it just click (sic)&#148;.  She testified it was &#147;weird&#148;
that she remembered these other locations.  She could not
remember any specific date of incidents of abuse and could not
remember where her mother or brother had been when the abuse was
taking place.  There was no expert evidence adduced on memory
recollection or delayed reporting of sexual abuse.</pre>
    <pre>The issues

[9]   With respect to the conviction appeal, the appellant raises
four issues:

  1.   The conduct of Crown counsel at trial;     </pre>
    <pre>  2.   The improper attack on the appellant&#146;s credibility;</pre>
    <pre>  3.   The inappropriate and prejudicial reference, during closing
       address, to an excerpt of a Supreme Court of Canada decision;
       and

  4.   The impression left with the jury that the complainant&#146;s
       sincerity could be equated with reliabilty.
</pre>
    <pre>  1.   The conduct of Crown counsel at trial</pre>
    <pre>[10]  This  is the main ground of appeal and, in my  view,  Crown
counsel&#146;s conduct seriously prejudiced the appellant.
[11] In R. v. Henderson (1999), 44 O.R. 628, this court recently
reviewed the role of Crown counsel during a trial.  It is
appropriate to quote again what I said at pp. 638-9, speaking for
a five-member panel:

               The classic articulation of Crown counsel's
	  role was set out in R. v. Boucher,  [1955] S.C.R.
	  16 at pp. 23-24,  110 C.C.C. 263 at p. 270, where
	  Rand J. stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>                         It cannot be over-emphasized that
               the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not
               to obtain a conviction; it is to lay before a
               jury what the Crown considers to be credible
               evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a
               crime.  Counsel have a duty to see that all
               available  legal proof of the  facts  is
               presented: it should be done firmly  and
               pressed to its legitimate strength, but it
               must  also be done fairly. The  role  of
               prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or
               losing; his function is a matter of public
               duty than which in civil life there can be
               none   charged  with  greater   personal
               responsibility. It is to be  efficiently
               performed with an ingrained sense of the
               dignity, the seriousness and the justness of
               judicial proceedings.
               </pre>
    <pre>               In Boucher, Taschereau J. added  the following
	  comments which were cited with approval by Lamer
	  C.J.C.  in R. v. Swietlinski, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 481
          at pp. 494-95, 92 C.C.C. (3d) 449:
          </pre>
    <pre>                     [TRANSLATION] The position held by
               counsel for the Crown is not that of a lawyer
               in civil litigation. His functions are quasi-
               judicial. His duty is not so much to obtain a
               conviction as to assist the judge and jury in
               ensuring that the fullest possible justice is
               done. His conduct before the Court  must
               always be characterized by moderation and
               impartiality. He will have properly performed
               his duty and will be beyond all reproach if,
               eschewing  any  appeal to  passion,  and
               employing a dignified manner suited to his
               function, he presents the evidence to the
               jury without going beyond what it discloses.
               </pre>
    <pre>                                  &#133;
                                </pre>
    <pre>                     Generally,  Crown counsel  perform
          all aspects of their functions honourably and
          fairly,  and  in  most cases the  respectable
          conduct of Crown counsel undoubtedly enhances
          public  confidence  in the  criminal  justice
          system.  To this extent, I note the  comments
          made  by  Cory  J. in R. v. Bain,   [1992]  1
          S.C.R.  91,  69  C.C.C. (3d)  481,  where  he
          states  [at  pp.  101-02]:  &quot;As  a  rule  the
          conduct and competence of Crown Attorneys  is
          exemplary.  They are models for the  Bar  and
          the  community.&quot; The efforts of Crown counsel
          are   particularly  admirable   given   their
          significant   case  loads  and   considerable
          resource restrictions.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[12]  I have emphasized the words in the quote from R. v. Boucher
which are specifically applicable in this appeal.  In the present
case,  these defining guidelines have all been breached by  Crown
counsel.
[13] First, he personalized his role in the case.  From the
outset of his opening address, Crown counsel told the jury:

               - &#147;&#133; je dois &#133; tenter de vous convaincre
	  que l&#146;accusé est bel et bien coupable.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>                                . . .
                                </pre>
    <pre>                - &#147;Mon but, c&#146;est pas une cachette, est
          de vous convaincre qu&#146;il est coupable.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>                                . . .
                                </pre>
    <pre>                 -   &#147;En  plaidant  non-coupable,  [the
          appellant]  pose le fardeau sur la  Couronne,
          sur mes épaules, de vous convaincre qu&#146;il est
          coupable.   Et puis c&#146;est exactement  ce  que
          j&#146;ai  l&#146;intention de faire pendant les  trois
          prochaines  journées.   Je  suis  confiant  à
          titre  de Couronne que lorsque vous  aurez  à
          l&#146;esprit &#150; lorsque vous aurez connaissance de
          ce  que  moi je connais du dossier, que  vous
          allez me joindre dans la conclusion qu&#146;il n&#146;y
          a  aucun  doute que [the complainant]  a  été
          abusée  sexuellement pendant trois  à  quatre
          ans  par  son  père par alliance.&#148;  [Emphasis
          added].
          
</pre>
    <pre>[14] His admitted role was to obtain a conviction.  The onus  was
on  his shoulders to inform the jury of what he knew so that  the
jury  could  join  him  in his conclusion that  the  accused  was
guilty.   In  addressing  the jury,  he  twice  referred  to  the
complainant  as  &#147;notre victime&#148;, as if she were his  client  and
inferring  there  was  some bond between  the  jury  and  himself
against the accused.
[15] Second, the involvement of his person became even more
obvious in his closing address to the jury:
     </pre>
    <pre>           -  &#147;Durant les deux dernières journées,  je  vous
           ai  démontré  ce  que  je  connaissais  de  cette
           affaire.  Vous savez maintenant ce que je  savais
           au  point  de départ.  Ce que le policier  savait
           au  point de départ.  Je suppose que si vous êtes
           pas  convaincus à ce stade ici, après tout ce que
           vous  avez  vu et tout ce que vous avez  entendu,
           alors  je  doute fort que j&#146;ai la  capacité,  que
           j&#146;ai  les habilités, soit comme orateur ou  comme
           personne  qui  peut argumenter comme  avocat,  je
           doute  fort  que  j&#146;aurais la  capacité  de  vous
           convaincre autrement.
                                &#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>           -  Si  vous arrivez à la conclusion que moi comme
           avocat  de la Couronne j&#146;ai failli dans ma  tâche
           de  vous convaincre de sa coupabilité, alors nous
           devons,   je  suppose,  vivre  avec   ce   triste
           résultat.
                                &#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>              -   J&#146;espère que vous allez nous quitter  avec
           l&#146;impression  que le bureau de la  Couronne,  que
           moi  comme  avocat de la Couronne,  que  je  suis
           juste,  que je suis honnête, que je suis sincère,
           diligent  mais aussi vigoureux dans la  poursuite
           de  la  justice.  [Counsel for the  appellant]  a
           qualifié  mon interrogatoire de dur,  d&#146;agressif.
           Mon  seul  but  est de m&#146;assurer que  la  justice
           soit atteinte pour [the complainant].
                                &#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>           -  C&#146;est  vrai  que j&#146;ai été agressif  avec  [the
           appellant].  C&#146;est peut-être mon caractère  comme
           avocat.   Et  puis  si  je vous  ai  offensé,  je
           m&#146;excuse.   Mon seul but comme je vous  indiquais
           était, du moins je l&#146;espère, que la justice  soit
           atteinte.
           </pre>
    <pre>                                &#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>           -  Moi  je vous suggère que ça prend de l&#146;audace,
           du  culot de la part de [the appellant] pour vous
           suggérer  que  ce  que l&#146;on  a  vu  lorsque  [the
           complainant]  a témoigné était du théatre  ou  un
           acte.  &#133;  Moi,  je  ne  prétends  pas  être   une
           personne  des  plus  brillantes  mais  il  semble
           évident  que [the complainant] souffrait, qu&#146;elle
           avait  mal  lorsqu&#146;elle recontait ce  que  lui  a
           fait subir son père pendant plusieurs années.
                                &#133;</pre>
    <pre>           -   moi,   je  suis  convaincu  que  c&#146;est   [the
           complainant]  qui  a  tout  perdu   dans    cette
           histoire. [Emphasis added].
     
</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Crown  counsel&#146;s stated mission was to obtain a  conviction
and  ensure that justice was done for the complainant.   He  told
the  jury he was an honest and just person and expressed that  if
the  jury  was  not  convinced of the appellant&#146;s  guilt  it  was
because he had failed to successfully do his job.  He then  added
the  shocking  comment that we (&#147;nous&#148;), he and the  jury,  would
have  to  live with this sad result.  He seemed to have felt  the
need to ask the jury to excuse his conduct toward the appellant.
[17] Third, Crown counsel was inappropriately sarcastic, flippant
and disrespectful towards the appellant.  When the appellant
answered during his cross-examination that he was living with his
stepson and his dog, Crown counsel retorted:

               Q.   I assume your dog is not going to testify?
          </pre>
    <pre>          
When the appellant agreed that his stepson knew why the appellant
was in court, the next question from Crown counsel was:

               Q.        He knows that you&#146;re not charged with
	       shoplifting, right?
               
And  when  Crown  counsel sought to find out when  the  appellant
ceased living with his wife, the following exchange took place:

               Q.   Okay. When did you stop living with [your
	       wife], sir?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.    28th  of  April &#146;95,  when  I  was
               charged. I was&#151;they put me in jail for three
               days&#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Okay.
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    &#133;until four o&#146;clock and I came out
               on Monday &#133;
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   I&#146;m touched, sir, but that&#146;s not my
               question.  My question is: when did  you
               stop living with [your wife]?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   28th of April, &#146;95.
               
</pre>
    <pre>Finally,  in  his last words to the jury in his closing  address,
Crown  counsel pleaded with the jury to recognize the appellant&#146;s
guilt as follows:

              - Et puis je vous prie de reconnaitre cette
              personne-là coupable de chacune des infractions
	      qui ont été déposées contre lui.
               
[18]  As  stated earlier, Crown counsel breached every aspect  of
the classic articulation of the role of Crown counsel referred to
in R. v. Boucher.  He took this case very personally. He injected
his  own  credibility and belief into the case.  His stated  goal
was  to obtain a conviction and justice for the complainant.   If
the  appellant were acquitted by the jury, he would have  failed.
His conduct was anything but moderate and impartial.
[19] In the present case, as I said in Henderson, Crown counsel&#146;s
conduct, viewed in its totality and with regard to the obligation
on Crown counsel to act in a scrupulously fair manner, crossed
over the line and must be characterized as improper and unfair.
The cumulative effect of the improprieties resulted in serious
prejudice.
[20] There is some overlap between this ground of appeal and the
second issue raised in the appeal, to which I now turn.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   The improper attack on the appellant&#146;s credibility
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  appellant&#146;s  defence was, in part,  that  for  various
reasons  he  did not have the opportunity to commit  the  alleged
offences.   At issue was whether he had opportunity to  be  alone
with  the  complainant.  His cross-examination, in  this  regard,
went as follows:

               Q.   Were you ever alone with [the complainant],
	       sir?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Like every father, yes.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Okay.   And  you would  have  been
               alone   when   she  was  what?    Eight,
               obviously?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   It could have happened, yes.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Yes.   And you agree with me  that
               you would be alone with her in the home at
               Limoges, right?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No &#150; none, never.  [My stepson] was
               always there.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    So,  you were never, never, never,
               never alone with [the complainant]?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    And you can tell us, sir, that not
               once were you alone with this child?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    No .. I don&#146;t recall.  Where  [the
               complainant] goes, [my stepson] &#150;  95  &#150;
               every time [my stepson] was there.
               
</pre>
    <pre>[22] As indicated in this exchange, the appellant stated that he,
like every father, had been alone with the complainant.  Next, he
is  asked  if  he was specifically ever alone with her  in  their
family house.  (All the incidents are alleged to have taken place
in  this house.)  He answers that he was never alone with her  in
the  house because his stepson would also have been in the house.
(At  no  time did the complainant suggest, in her evidence,  that
her  brother was not in the house when the incidents took place.)
The cross-examination continued:

               Q.  &#133; Were you ever alone with [the complainant]
	       in her bedroom, sir?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.     I  just  want  to  make  sure   I
               understand.  You were acting as a father
               for this child, right?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A    Yeah.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    And  you were never alone  in  her
               bedroom?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    Like come on.  I walked through to
               go to my bedroom.  What do you think?
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    What  do  you mean, &#147;what  do  you
               think&#148;?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    I  tucked her in once in a  while.
               That&#146;s normal.  Like every father.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    So, you would have tucked her  in,
               right?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   With [my wife] too.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    No,  no.   Were you alone  in  her
               bedroom, sir?  Yes or no?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I guess you could say, yes.
               </pre>
    <pre>                                  &#133;
                                </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    So you were never alone with  [the
               complainant] in the house, you  told  us
               that.   Your  stepson was always  there,
               right?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.   That&#146;s right.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    And you were never alone with  her
               in her bedroom except to tuck her in?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    Yeah, if I&#146;m there and there (sic)
               time  to  go  to bed, I would  tuck  [my
               stepson] or [the complainant] &#150; and [the
               complainant].  And [my wife]  was  there
               too  because most of the time we  go  to
               bed  at the same time, nine o&#146;clock,  if
               I&#146;m there.
               </pre>
    <pre>                                  &#133;
                                </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Have you ever been alone with [the
               complainant] in any other place, sir?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    It&#146;s  like a father,  like  you&#146;re
               alone sometime.  That&#146;s normal.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Yes,  well, that&#146;s my point,  sir.
               But  you&#146;re telling us that you&#146;ve never
               been alone with [the complainant]?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    Like &#150; like a father you &#150; you are
               alone sometime.
               </pre>
    <pre>               Q.    Yes.   And you&#146;d be alone  in  the
               home with [the complainant], right?
               </pre>
    <pre>               A.    Usually  [my stepson] is  all  the
               time there.
               
</pre>
    <pre>[23]   In   his  closing  address  to  the  jury,  Crown  counsel
incorrectly summarized the preceding exchange as follows:

   Pour un père de famille de dire qu&#146;il n&#146;a jamais été seul
   avec sa jeune fille est tout simplement insultant et puis
   déraisonable.  Cette jeune fille aurait demeuré avec lui pendant
   plusieurs, plusieurs années.  Et pourtant, il n&#146;aurait jamais été
   seul avec elle.  Et puis c&#146;est ce qu&#146;il nous dit.  Pensez-y!
   J&#146;ai deux enfants à la maison moi-même.  Je suis de façon
   quotidienne, journalière, seul avec au moins un de mes enfants.
   Il était à toute fin pratique le père de [the complainant].  Si
   vous êtes prets à accepter sa prétention qu&#146;il n&#146;a jamais été
   seul avec sa fille ou que ça soulève un doute raisonable, et puis
   ça pendant toutes ces années-là, pas une fois seul avec [the
   complainant], pas dans sa chambre, pas dans le salon, nulle part.
   Si vous êtes prets à accepter ceci et puis ne pas voir qu&#146;il
   s&#146;agit clairement d&#146;une tentative de sa part de vous duper, de
   vous tromper, en vous disant: j&#146;suis pas coupable, j&#146;ai jamais
   été seul avec elle.  Alors, je crois que je perds mon temps.  On
   ferme nos livres et puis on devrait aller chacun chez nous.
   C&#146;est fini.  Lorsqu&#146;un témoin vous fait une proposition;
   lorsqu&#146;il vous propose quelque chose qui est tellement insensé et
   puis déraisonable, ça devrait affecter sa crédibilité.  [Emphasis
   added].
          
</pre>
    <pre>[24]  In  this  passage, Crown counsel repeats on five  occasions
that  the  appellant had said that he was never  alone  with  the
complainant.   This  is  not  the  type  of  characterization  of
evidence  expected from a fair and impartial Crown  counsel  even
when dealing with a witness who could be said to be evasive.   In
fact,  it was a serious misstatement of the appellant&#146;s evidence.
Moreover, it is inflammatory, disrespectful and sarcastic.
[25] A review of the transcript on the issue of whether the
appellant was alone with the complainant in the house shows that
he answered in the affirmative or acknowledged that he was alone
with her ten times and answered in the negative nine times.
[26] Unfortunately, the prejudice from the improper
misrepresentation of the appellant&#146;s evidence does not stop with
what was said by Crown counsel to the jury.  It was commented
upon by the trial judge in a manner which exacerbated the
prejudice.
[27] At the beginning of his charge to the jury, the trial judge
indicated to the jury the various parts that he would cover.  He
told the members of the jury that in the last part of his charge,
just before instructing them on the possible verdicts, he would
comment on the evidence.  While he reviewed, in some detail (it
covers four pages of transcript), the evidence of the
complainant, the only reference made to the appellant&#146;s evidence
is as follows:

   Je trouve ça difficile à accepter que [the appellant] ne
   s&#146;est jamais retrouvé seul dans une pièce de la maison avec sa
   fille malgré son travail et ses &#150; malgré son travail et ses
   emplois.  Je comprends qu&#146;il travaillait fort.  Il a travaillé à
   deux emplois à un certain temps mais même à ça, à moins qu&#146;il
   travaillait en surtemps, il était chez lui ou il était &#147;off&#148;, de
   huit heures et demie le soir jusqu&#146;à trois heures et demie le
   matin.  Je doute fort qu&#146;il a dormi pendant cinq-six heures ou
   sept heures dans son auto à tous les soirs.  Je trouve ça un
   p&#146;tit peu difficile à accepter.  Il vit avec cette famille-là,
   ils sont ensemble depuis que [the complainant] a deux ans.  De
   dire qu&#146;il n&#146;a jamais eu de temps seul avec elle, c&#146;est pas mal
   difficile &#150; même si on parle d&#146;une petite maison.
          
[28]  In  so commenting, the trial judge endorsed Crown counsel's
misstatement of evidence.  I accept the submission of counsel for
the  appellant that while Crown counsel&#146;s comments were damaging,
this comment on the appellant&#146;s evidence by the trial judge would
have  &quot;sealed the appellant&#146;s fate&quot;.  In his only comment on  the
appellant&#146;s evidence, the trial judge was telling the  jury  that
the  appellant  should  not  be  believed  on  the  basis  of   a
misunderstanding  of the evidence.  In a case  where  credibility
was at issue, this error was most serious.
[29] There are also a second and third incident of Crown counsel
improperly attacking the appellant&#146;s credibility.  Despite
telling the appellant that he did not have to provide an
explanation as to why the complainant made up the allegation of
sexual abuse, Crown counsel invited the appellant to provide one
and then ridiculed the explanation.  Also, Crown counsel inquired
of the appellant whether the complainant was a known liar.  This
court has repeatedly held that this specific type of cross-
examination is improper.  See for example R. v. F.(A.) (1996), 30
O.R. (3d) 470 (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>    3.   The inappropriate and prejudicial reference to an
         excerpt of a Supreme Court of Canada decision during
	 closing address</pre>
    <pre>[30]  During  his  closing  address to the  jury,  Crown  counsel
proceeded  to  read  an  excerpt of a  Supreme  Court  of  Canada
decision dealing with the non-reporting, incomplete reporting and
delay in reporting cases of sexual abuse.  Further, not only  did
counsel  read from the decision (which is found in R. v. L.(W.K.)
(1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 328), he in fact misrepresented the
passage  he  was  purporting to quote by omitting the  references
made  therein  by  the  court  that  the  relevant  opinion   was
attributed to a report and not to the court directly as the Crown
represented.   In  my view, it was improper for counsel  to  read
from this decision the passage he did for three reasons.
[31] First, he improperly read caselaw to the jury.  Generally in
a jury trial counsel is not permitted to quote from case reports:
see R. v. Cashin (1981), 65 C.C.C. (2d) 56 at 62 (N.S.C.A.); and
Pianosi v. C.N.R., [1943] O.W.N. 766 at 770 (C.A.).
[32] Second, in reading this passage, Crown counsel was, in
effect, relating evidence when there had been none.  His
reference to the Supreme Court of Canada was an attempt to
influence the jury in its finding of fact on the issue.  He was
in effect telling the jury they were bound to follow the passage
referred to: see R. v. M. (T.E.) (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 179, at
182 (Alta. C.A.); and R. v. I. (R.R.) (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d)
367, at 375 (S.C.C.) affd (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 376 (S.C.C.).
[33] Moreover, the jury was never instructed by the trial judge
on the issue, thus leaving the jury with the impression that the
Crown&#146;s remarks were proper.</pre>
    <pre>     4.   The jury may have been left with the impression  that
          the complainant&#146;s sincerity could be equated with
	  reliability.</pre>
    <pre>[34]  I find no merit in this ground of appeal.  Both counsel  at
trial emphasized to the jury that the real issue in this case was
credibility.   In  particular,  defence  counsel  emphasized  the
demeanor  of the complainant and made no effort to establish  the
distinction  now  sought  to  be  made  between  credibility  and
reliability.  This is likely the reason why the trial judge  only
briefly  pointed  out to the jury that they had to  consider  the
reliability (&#147;fiabilité&#148;) of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>     5.   Other incident</pre>
    <pre>[35]  There  was  another incident of improper  cross-examination
that  occurred  during the trial which, although  not  raised  as
grounds of appeal, warrant brief comments.
[36] During her cross-examination, it was suggested to the
complainant that her evidence with respect to the location of the
incidents of sexual abuse and her age at the time the abuse
stopped was different from what she had said in her statement of
April 28, 1995.  For the purpose of these questions, she was
shown and reviewed her statement.
[37] During the appellant&#146;s cross-examination, he was questioned
on the issue of penetration.  He was also shown the statement.
Crown counsel confirmed that the appellant took the position that
certain things had been omitted in the statement.  At that point,
Crown counsel proceeded to read the entire statement.  He read it
again, except for the last two sentences, in his closing address
to the jury.
[38] It was not proper for Crown counsel to read the statement
into evidence during either the cross-examination or in his
closing address.  The questions that had been asked did not
permit him to read the entire statement.  It could only be an
excuse to avoid the rule against prior consistent statements and
use the statement to bolster the complainant&#146;s credibility.  No
instruction was given by the trial judge to the  jury on the use
that could be made of the statement.
[39] Finally, having dealt extensively with the conduct of Crown
counsel, something needs to be said about the conduct of defence
counsel (who is not counsel on the appeal).  Unfortunately, he
never objected to anything, except with respect to Crown counsel
having read the extract from R. v. L. (W.K.) to the jury.  It has
been pointed out by this court that the failure of counsel to
object does not give Crown counsel carte blanche at trial.  See
R. v. R. (A.J.) (1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 405 at p. 416.
[40] Unfortunately, the improprieties were never diffused or
corrected by the trial judge.
[41] The disposition of the issues dealt with in this appeal lead
me to conclude that the appellant did not receive a fair trial.
As was so succinctly stated in R. v. F. (A.), (supra at 472),
&#147;unless and until Crown counsel stop this kind of improper and
prejudicial conduct, this court will regrettably have to remit
difficult and sensitive cases of this nature back for a new trial
at great expense to the emotional well-being of the parties, not
to mention the added burden to the administration of justice.&#148;
[42] I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction, and
order a new trial.
