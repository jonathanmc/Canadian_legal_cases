    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of McCartney J. dated February 24, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]   We agree with the respondents that the sole issue in the
appeal is whether the trial judge materially misapprehended the
facts in coming to the conclusion that the respondent hospital
had a reasonable parking lot maintenance system which provided
for the reasonable safety of the users of the lot.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The evidence at trial appeared to be directed more to the
implementation of the system for plowing, salting and sanding
than the system itself.  Be that as it may, the trial judge
found, on conflicting evidence, that the area in the lot where
the appellant Eleanor Gardiner slipped and fell had, in fact,
been sanded and salted the day before.  In support of his
findings, the trial judge had the benefit of photographs and a
video taken on the day of the accident which was put into
evidence by the plaintiffs.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  This court also viewed the video and we agree with counsel
for the respondent that it supports the findings of the trial
judge in the following terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I accept the defence evidence that the
          witness, DeProphetis did in fact, pursuant to
          the system that was in place, apply sand to
          the parking lot on February 1st in areas
          where there were no parked vehicles.
          Further, I accept the evidence that
          apparently sand had been applied in the area
          where the Plaintiff fell.  That being the
          case, all that could have been done to
          protect the Plaintiff after this was to do
          more work on the lot, either snow removal
          and/or more sanding between the work on
          February 1st and the morning of February 2nd.
          With conditions having changed very little
          between the two days, other than for the
          dusting of snow, it is not reasonable to
          think that the contractor would feel more
          work was necessary unless perhaps he was
          alerted to a new situation by the Defendant.
          </pre>
    <pre>[4]  Accordingly, we can find no error in the trial judge&#146;s
reasons.  The appeal is dismissed with costs.
