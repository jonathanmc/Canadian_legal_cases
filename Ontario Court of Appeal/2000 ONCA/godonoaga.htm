    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Pitt J. dated July 8, 1999 and
from the costs addendum released on September 15, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>FINLAYSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants Bijan Khatambakhsh and Fatima Khatambakhsh
(the &#147;appellants&#148;) appeal from the summary judgment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Pitt of the Superior Court of Justice,
dated July 8, 1999, and the respective costs addendum released on
September 15, 1999, which collectively ordered as follows:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (A)  A declaration that the respondent third party insurer is
          under no duty to defend the appellants in respect of the 
	  claims against them in the main action herein;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (B)  That the appellants&#146; motion for summary judgment is
          dismissed;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (C)  That the appellants pay costs associated with the summary
          judgment motion, up to the beginning of the hearing, on a
          solicitor-and-client scale, fixed in the amount of $2,450.27,
          payable within 60 days of the release of the endorsement on
          costs;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (D)  That there be no costs for the remainder of the motion.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The action as pleaded involves claims for personal injuries.
The injuries arose out of alleged assaults committed against the
minor plaintiff, Igor Godonoaga (&#147;Igor&#148;).  The defendants to the
action are the appellants and their minor children, Maher
Khatambakhsh (&#147;Maher&#148;) and Houman Khatambakhsh (&#147;Houman&#148;).  The
alleged assaults occurred on April 17, 1998.
[3]  By the third-party claim, the appellants sought a
declaration that they are insured under a Tenants Policy (the
&#147;policy&#148;) from the respondent third party, Allstate Insurance
Company of Canada (&#147;Allstate&#148;).  The appellants argue that this
policy insures them in respect of the claim against them for
alleged failure to supervise their children, Maher and Houman.
They also sought an order that Allstate defend the appellants in
the main action and indemnify them against any judgment in the
action.  Finally, they sought an order that the appellants be
permitted to appoint counsel of their choice to represent them in
the main action.
[4]  Allstate denied coverage to the appellants on the basis of a
clause in the policy.  Allstate asserts that the clause excludes
coverage for claims arising from bodily injury or property damage
caused intentionally by, or at the direction of, the insureds, or
resulting from their criminal acts or omissions.
[5]  The facts pleaded by the plaintiffs as they relate to this
appeal are that Igor, who emigrated from Russia with his mother,
Galina Godonoaga, was enrolled in a school under the jurisdiction
of the defendant Toronto Board of Education.  From the date of
his enrolment, Igor began experiencing problems with a group of
Iranian students who constantly teased, bullied, harassed, and,
on several occasions, beat him up.  He was approximately nine
years old at the time.
[6]  One day, on leaving the school building but while still on
school property, Igor was set upon by a group of roughly six
Iranian students from the school, including the defendant Maher.
He was pushed and shoved for approximately twenty minutes.  Maher
was particularly violent.  He kicked and hit Igor several times
while shouting obscenities at him.
[7]  Maher&#146;s mother, the appellant Fatima, witnessed this scene
from the balcony of the appellants&#146; apartment.  She sent her
other son, the defendant Houman, who was about 15 years old, to
join in beating up Igor.  Houman attacked Igor with a broken
hockey stick that he brought from home for that purpose, and beat
him about the head and body.  Igor was rendered unconscious and
suffered serious injuries.
[8]  Some other children found the unconscious Igor and lifted
and dragged him toward his home.  The father of Maher and Houman,
the appellant Bijan, witnessed this activity, and when the
children passed the appellants&#146; apartment he went down to speak
to them.  He then accompanied Igor and the other children to
Igor&#146;s home.  While at the home, he obstructed members of Igor&#146;s
family from calling an ambulance by tying up the telephone so
that he could speak to his wife Fatima.
[9]  The first plaintiff in the action is Igor, personally, by
his mother Galina as litigation guardian.  The second plaintiff
is Galina as a claimant under Part V of the Family Law Act,
R.S.O. 1991, c.F.3 (ss.61-63).  They sue for special, general and
exemplary damages against the Toronto Board of Education, the
principal of the school in question, the appellants, and the
appellants&#146; two children.
[10] The plaintiffs&#146; action against the appellants&#146; children,
Houman and Maher, is for assault and battery.  The action against
the appellants, Fatima and Bijan, is pleaded as a negligence
claim.  The claim is that the appellants were negligent in
failing to instil in their children reasonably acceptable values
and rules for living in society, including respect for the life,
person and property of others in the community.  Alternatively,
if they did properly instruct the children, they failed to
supervise, monitor or enforce compliance with these values and
rules.  It is also alleged that the appellants knew or ought to
have known that their children had emotional and psychological
disturbances that made them dangerous to other children of the
community.
[11] Further, in that part of the claim that the plaintiff has
labelled negligence, there are specific pleadings involving both
parents.  It is alleged that &#147;Fatima in particular sent Houman to
beat up Igor with callous disregard to Igor&#146;s health and safety&#148;.
As for Bijan, it is alleged that he &#147;with callous disregard to
Igor&#146;s health and safety prevented and delayed the ambulance from
being called after it was apparent that Igor required immediate
medical assistance&#148;.
[12] The plaintiffs also sue the Toronto Board of Education and
the principal of the school, Debbie Smith, for failure to
supervise and protect Igor while on school property. The Toronto
Board of Education and Smith cross-claim against all the
Khatambakhsh family members for contribution and indemnity under
the Negligence Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.N.1.
[13] The relevant terms of the insurance policy provided by
Allstate are as follows.
                                </pre>
    <pre>                       TENANT&#146;S POLICY

          &#133;.

                 SECTION I &#150; PROPERTY COVERAGES

          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          DEFINITIONS

          &#147;You&#148; and &#147;your&#148; mean the person(s) named as
          Insured on the Declaration page and, while
          living in the same household, his or her wife
          or husband, the relatives of either or any
          person under 21 in their care&#133;.

          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          COVERAGES

          This insurance applies only to accidents or
          occurrences which take place during the term
          of this policy.
          The amounts of insurance are shown on the
          Declaration page.  Each person insured is a
          separate Insured but this does not increase
          the limit of insurance.

          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          COVERAGE X &#150; Family Liability

          We will pay all sums which you become legally
          liable to pay as compensatory damages because
          of Bodily Injury or Property Damage.
          The amount of insurance is the maximum amount
          that we will pay, under one or more Sections
          of Coverage X, for all compensatory damages
          in respect of one accident or occurrence.
          You are insured for claims made against you
          arising from:

          1.Personal Liability &#150; legal liability
            arising out of your personal actions
            anywhere in the world.

          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Trailers:

          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          LOSS OR DAMAGE NOT INSURED (Applying to Section II)

          You are not insured for claims arising from:

          &#133;.

          (5) Bodily Injury or Property Damage caused
              intentionally by or at your direction or
              resulting from your criminal acts or
              omissions;
</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[14] The appellants concede that the policy of insurance, by
reason of subsection (5), quoted above, does not cover the
plaintiffs&#146; claims against their two sons, Houman and Maher, for
bodily injury caused to Igor.  They also concede that, if the
claim against Fatima was limited to her participation in the
assault by directing or inciting Houman to take part in it, she
is a party to the assault and is excluded from coverage as well.
The action against the appellant parents, however, is pleaded in
negligence.  Moreover, the action sounds in negligence, certainly
to the extent that it relies upon the appellants&#146; failures in the
upbringing and discipline of their children, and their failure to
recognize their emotional problems.
[15] The respondent third party, Allstate, does not contest that
there is an action against the appellant parents that is properly
framed in negligence.  Its defence, simply, is that because the
assaultive conduct of the two sons is clearly excluded from
coverage under the policy, the parents are effectively excluded
from coverage as well.  All else aside, Allstate asserts that it
is not liable for exemplary and punitive damages.
[16] The appellants are the named insured persons under the
policy.  Their two children qualify under the definition of
&#147;Insured&#148; as &#147;the relatives of either or any person under 21 in
their care&#148;.  Accordingly, as provided for in the definition
section of the policy, the phrases &#147;you&#148; and &#147;your&#148; in the
coverage section refers to all four members of the Khatambakhsh
family who are defendants in this action.
[17] Allstate asserts that the terms &#147;you&#148; and &#147;your&#148; have the
same meaning throughout the policy.  Thus, in effect, where the
exclusion states that you are not insured against bodily injury
or property damage caused intentionally by or at your direction
or resulting from your criminal acts or omissions, the references
to &#147;you&#148; and &#147;your&#148; embrace all four of the insured defendants.
In the result, if any one of the four is excluded from coverage,
all four are excluded.
[18] I do not read the policy this way.  It ignores the language
in the &#147;Coverages&#148; section:  &#147;Each person is a separate Insured
but this does not increase the limit of insurance&#148;.
[19] The Declaration page of the policy reads in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>   POLICY COVERAGES AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY          LIMITS
   Personal Property (Replacement Cost)              $ 25,000
   Additional Living Expenses                        $  5,000
   Family Liability            Each Occurrence       $500,000
   Voluntary Medical Payments  Each Person           $  2,000
                               Each Accident         $ 25,000
          
</pre>
    <pre>[20] In my view, a proper interpretation of the policy is that
the parents and the two children are each separately insured to
the face value of the policy.  The insurer does not have to
respond to the claims against the two sons because their separate
policies exclude claims arising from bodily injury caused
intentionally by them.  However, the parents are in a different
position under their separate policies.  They are sued in
negligence, which is not an excluded claim, and the fact that the
pleadings allege intentional assaults by their children does not
disentitle them to coverage.  Since the claims in negligence
against the parents arise out of the same occurrence, the maximum
exposure of the insurer is $500,000.
[21] This approach has been followed in Bluebird Cabs Ltd. v.
Guardian Insurance Co. of Canada (1999), 173 D.L.R. (4th) 318
(B.C.C.A.).  Here, the court heard two appeals in which the
respective plaintiffs each alleged in their statements of claim
that they had been assaulted and injured by drivers employed by
the taxi cab company in question.  They both sued the company
maintaining it was vicariously liable for the assaults.  Under
the terms of the insurance policy, both the taxi company and the
driver were &#147;Insured&#148; persons, but the policy excluded coverage
for &#147;bodily injury... expected or intended from the standpoint of
the insured&#148;.  There was another clause, dealing with &#147;Separation
of Insureds&#148;, however, which stipulated that the insurance
applied &#147;as if each named insured were the only named insured&#148;.
[22] In his reasons for the Court, Lambert J.A. relied on the
latter clause to conclude that the taxi company&#146;s policy coverage
was separate from that of the drivers.  He said at p.324:</pre>
    <pre>          [10]  We were referred to the condition relating
	  to &#147;Separation of Insureds&#148; which I have quoted.
	  The policy applies separately to each insured.
	  That condition must mean that in this case one
	  must consider the application of the policy to
          Bluebird Cabs Ltd., the employer, entirely
	  separately from the application of the policy to
 	  the two cab drivers.
          
          [11]  The result is that one must ask
          oneself whether the bodily injuries said to
          have been suffered by the two victims were
          expected or intended from the standpoint of
          Bluebird Cabs Ltd.  There is no basis in the
          pleadings or in fact for such a conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>[23] In Sheppard v. Co-operators General Insurance Co. (1997), 33
O.R. (3d) 362 (C.A.), this court was reluctant to expand the use
of &#147;you&#148; and &#147;your&#148; beyond the coverage clause of an insurance
policy, even without a clause providing for separation of
insurance.  After an analysis of various clauses in the policy
where the two words were used, the court concluded at p.367:</pre>
    <pre>        These inconsistent usages of the words &#147;you&#148; and 
	&#147;your&#148; in the Co-operators policy suggest that it 
	cannot be safely assumed that the word &#147;your&#148; in 
	the coverage clause has its defined, extended 
	meaning wherever it appears.</pre>
    <pre>[24] In any event, it is self-evident that if there is any
ambiguity in the policy before this court, it must be resolved in
favour of the insured.  As this court stated in Sheppard, supra,
at p. 368:</pre>
    <pre>	Exclusion clauses are construed narrowly: Reid 
	Crowther &amp; Partners Ltd. v. Simcoe &amp; Erie General 
	Insurance Co., [1993] 1 S.C.R. 252 at p. 269.  They 
	must use language that clearly expresses the extent 
	and scope of the exceptions and limitations imposed 
	and, in so far as they fail to do so, the language 
	of the coverage clause obtains: [authorities not 
	copied.]  The language of this exclusion clause does 
	not clearly express the extent and scope of the 
	exception and limitation for which Co-operators
        contends.</pre>
    <pre>[25] I feel obliged to comment on two decisions of the Supreme
Court of Canada that were delivered after this appeal was argued.
They are Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd&#146;s of London v. Scalera,
delivered May 3, 2000, [2000] s.c.j. 26; and Nicodemo Sansolone
v. The Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company, delivered May 3, 2000,
[2000] s.c.j. 27.  Both stand for the proposition that the
respondent insurer had no duty to defend the appellant because
the plaintiff&#146;s statement of claim made no allegation that could
potentially give rise to indemnity under the insurance contract. 1
[26] The lead judgment is Scalera.  In that case, the underlying
action was brought against five B.C. Transit bus drivers,
including the appellant Vincent Scalera, by a young woman
alleging various sexual assaults between 1988 and 1992.  The
liability insurance policy owned by Scalera was at issue in the
appeal.  The allegations of sexual assault were very detailed and
claimed damages for sexual assault, sexual exploitation,
intentional infliction of nervous shock, misrepresentations,
negligence, breaches of duty, and breaches of fiduciary duty.  No
facts whatsoever were pleaded in support of the allegation of
negligence.
[27] The Court was divided on the issue of whether the plaintiff
or the defendant bore the burden of proof in terms of the issue
of consent to sexual activity.  The Court was unanimous, however,
on the issue that concerns us here.  In his analysis, Iacobucci
J., at paras. 50-52 and 54, stated:</pre>
    <pre>
          50    Determining whether or not a given claim
	  could trigger indemnity is a three-step process.
	  First, a court should determine which of the
	  plaintiff&#146;s legal allegations are properly pleaded.
	  In doing so, courts are not bound by the legal
	  labels chosen by the plaintiff.  A plaintiff cannot
	  change an intentional tort into a negligent one
	  simply by choice of words, or vice versa.
	  Therefore, when ascertaining the scope of the
          duty to defend, a court must look beyond the
	  choice of labels, and examine the substance of
	  the allegations contained in the pleadings.  This
	  does not involve deciding whether the claims
          have any merit; all a court must do is decide,
	  based on the pleadings, the true nature of the claims.

          51    At the second stage, having
          determined what claims are properly pleaded,
          the court should determine if any claims are
          entirely derivative in nature.  The duty to
          defend will not be triggered simply because a
          claim can be cast in terms of both negligence
          and intentional tort.  If the alleged
          negligence is based on the same harm as the
          intentional tort, it will not allow the
          insured to avoid the exclusion clause for
          intentionally caused injuries.</pre>
    <pre>          52     Finally, at the third stage the
          court must decide whether any of the properly
          pleaded, non-derivative claims could
          potentially trigger the insurer&#146;s duty to
          defend.  In this appeal. I conclude that the
          respondent has no duty to defend.  The
          plaintiff has alleged three basic claims
          against the appellant:  sexual battery,
          negligence, and breach of fiduciary duty.
                                . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>          54    The claims for negligence and breach of
          fiduciary duty fail to trigger the duty to
          defend not because they could not fall within
          coverage, but because they are either not
          properly pleaded, or derivative of the claim
          for sexual battery.  As a result, they are
          also covered by the exclusion for injuries
          intentionally caused.</pre>
    <pre>[28] On Iacobucci J.&#146;s analysis, as applied to the case at hand,
one might argue that Allstate&#146;s duty to defend the appellant
parents on the plaintiff&#146;s negligence claim has not been
triggered because the alleged negligence is arguably &#147;based on
the same harm&#148; as the intentional assault committed by the
appellant&#146;s children.  This argument would fail on the facts in
this appeal which are clearly distinguishable from Scalera.  This
is not a case where the plaintiff has attempted to &#147;dress&#148; the
assaults of Houman and Maher in the guise of a negligence suit.
On the contrary, the allegations of negligence constitute a
separate tort and are directed against different parties.  The
alleged perpetrators of the assault do not claim they are
entitled to a defence under the policy.  The facts that support
the negligence claim depend upon the fact of the assault only to
the extent that it is a consequence of the negligence.  Thus,
this is not an attempt to represent an intentional tort as a
negligent one.
[29] In these circumstances, the appellant parents are entitled
to call upon Allstate for indemnity for any liability they should
incur for compensatory damages arising from this claim.  The
insurer must also defend the action on their behalf, including
the cross-claim by the Board of Education and the principal of
the school.
[30]  Referring back to Scalera, I am concerned with the language
in para. 51: &#147;If the alleged negligence is based on the same harm
as the intentional tort, it will not allow the insured to avoid
the exclusion clause for intentionally caused injuries&#148;.  There
is also the statement in para. 54 that the duty to defend is not
triggered because the claims are &#147;derivative of the claim for
sexual battery&#148;.
[31] It seems to me that these statements must be confined to the
facts of Scalera.  The facts pleaded in Scalera give rise to a
cause of action against a single insured defendant based on
sexual assault only.  To place the case in context, it would be
interesting if the plaintiff in Scalera had brought an action
against B.C. Transit and raised certain issues in tort.  Would
B.C. Transit&#146;s insurer be obliged to respond to a claim that the
transit authority was vicariously liable for the tortious acts of
Scalera?  Would it be obliged to respond to a claim that B.C.
Transit was negligent in failing to screen Scalera before
employing him, or in failing to properly supervise and control
him during the course of his employment?  Put another way, if the
plaintiffs in the action in appeal had sued only the parents of
the two Khatambakhsh boys for negligence in their upbringing and
supervision of the two boys, would there be any issue before the
court at all?
[32] I do not read Scalera as stating that different tort actions
cannot arise out of the same occurrence.  Rather, I read it to
mean only that a given plaintiff cannot convert an assault and
battery into an action in negligence solely to ensure that the
defendant&#146;s insurer will provide the necessary &#147;deep pocket&#148; to
make a judgment recoverable.
[33] The use of the term &#147;derivative&#148; in Scalera is problematic.
In the case at hand, the plaintiff Galina is bringing an action
under Part V of the Family Law Act to recover loss resulting from
non-fatal injuries to her son.  The statute authorizes her claim
for damages arising out of her son&#146;s injuries that were caused by
the &#147;fault or neglect&#148; of a third party, namely the parents of
the children who assaulted him.  It is accepted that the wrong
complained of must involve tortious conduct.  It is also accepted
that this is a derivative action in the sense that no action can
be brought unless the injured person would be entitled to
maintain an action on the facts of the incident.  Accordingly, I
do not take the word &#147;derivative&#148; in Scalera to have been used in
any technical sense relating to pleadings.  The action by Galina
against the Khatambakhsh parents in negligence is derivative in
the sense that she does not have a cause of action in
circumstances where her son would not have one.  However, it does
not follow that the Khatambakhsh parents would not have a defence
to the action against them simply because their sons may not have
one. In this case, the sons could readily be held liable for
assault and the action in negligence against their parents
dismissed.  In this sense the liability of the parents is not
derivative of the claims against their sons and can not
constitute a reason for denying them coverage and a defence.
[34] The third party insurer, Allstate, has argued this case as
if it was restricted to a dispute between insurer and insured as
to its duty to defend the appellants under the policy.  However,
looking ahead to the obligation to indemnify, if it should arise,
it is apparent that the plaintiffs have an interest as well.
Under s.132 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8, where a
person has incurred a liability for injury or damage to the
person of another, is insured against such liability and fails to
satisfy a judgment awarding damages against the person in respect
of his or her liability, &#147;the person entitled to the damages may
recover by action against the insurer the amount of the judgment
up to the face value of the policy, but subject to the same
equities as the insurer would have if the judgment had been
satisfied&#148;. [Emphasis added.]  I cannot accept the proposition
that Igor&#146;s mother would be disentitled from recovering a
judgment in negligence against the parents of the boys who
injured her son because her claim is derivative of her son&#146;s
claim against the boys themselves.
[35] In the case in appeal, it is my opinion that the third party
is obliged to defend the appellants in respect of the negligence
claim against them.  The appellants also ask for an order that
they be entitled to select their own counsel to represent them in
the action, but at the third party&#146;s expense.  I do not think the
latter order is necessary.  There was an arguable point as to
insurability in this case and I do not believe there is reason to
be concerned that counsel chosen by the third party will not
represent the appellants appropriately.
[36] I would repeat, however, my response to a remark made by
Allstate&#146;s counsel in appeal.  The comment was that if the third
party has a duty to defend the appellants on the claim for
negligence, counsel cannot ignore what took place in the
schoolyard.  Counsel&#146;s obligation in defending the negligence
suit and the claim over by the co-defendants is to mitigate and
minimize the circumstances that form the underpinning of the
negligence suit, namely the assault by Houman and Maher on Igor.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[37] For the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, set aside
the judgment of Pitt J. and grant a declaration that the
appellants are insured with the third party, Allstate, under
Tenants Policy No. 1 46 43564 in respect of the plaintiffs&#146;
claims against them in the main action.  Further, the appellants
are indemnified against any judgment, costs and interest covered
by the said policy.  It follows that Allstate is obliged to
defend the appellants in the main action and the cross-claim by
the co-defendants.  The appellants are entitled to their costs,
here and below.
