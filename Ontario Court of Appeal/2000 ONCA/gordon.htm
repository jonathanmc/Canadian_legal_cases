    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Southey,
McNeely and Brockenshire JJ.) dated March 15, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>GOUDGE J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  On November 13, 1991, Gordon Glaves, a successful Brantford
business man, died suddenly and unexpectedly at the age of 51. In
the year prior to his death he had acquired a significant
shareholder interest in the respondent Care Corporation of Canada
Limited (&#147;Care Corp.&#148;). This interest was acquired and held by
his wholly owned holding company the appellant Gordon Glaves
Holdings Ltd. (&#147;GGHL&#148;). Care Corp. held life insurance policies
on the lives of each of its shareholders.
[2]  In this litigation, the appellant asserts that the
expectation of Mr. Glaves and GGHL was that on his death all
shareholder advances would be repaid and the proceeds of
insurance would be used to purchase the GGHL interest in Care
Corp. to the benefit of the Glaves estate. The appellant says
that the failure of Care Corp. to do so constitutes oppression
entitling the appellant to relief pursuant to s.248 of the
Business Corporations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.B.16.
[3]  The appellant was successful at first instance before Greer
J. On appeal the Divisional Court reversed and ordered that
because of conflicting evidence the matter should not be resolved
by application, but should proceed to trial. Before us the
appellant seeks to restore the finding of Greer J. while Care
Corp. cross-appeals, seeking a dismissal of the oppression
application.
[4]  For the reasons that follow I have concluded that on the
basis of the present record it can safely be determined that the
appellant has failed to establish the oppression alleged and that
its application must be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  Care Corp. was a fledgling company formed in 1989 to build
and manage retirement homes. The five original shareholders were
all individuals who had enjoyed long, stable business careers in
the Brantford/St. Thomas area. In October 1990 and February 1991
Gordon Glaves and his friend Peter Francis jointly acquired 30%
of the issued shares of Care Corp. Each used his personal holding
company to do so. The share certificates were issued jointly in
the names of GGHL and Peter J. Francis Holdings Ltd. (&#147;PJFHL&#148;).
Mr. Glaves and Mr. Francis each paid about $400,000 for these
shares, a significant premium over the current value of the
shares because of their belief in the significant long term
potential of the company and their investment in it.
[6]  Mr. Glaves and Mr. Francis had been close friends and
business associates for many years. Indeed, in his will executed
in November 1990, Mr. Glaves named Mr. Francis as one of his
executors and provided that Mr. Francis would be a manager of his
major businesses, which the will contemplated would be carried on
for up to 15 years beyond the death of his wife.
[7]  Consistent with this history, Mr. Francis asserted that he
and Mr. Glaves had agreed, although not in writing, that Mr.
Glaves would be responsible for their joint investment in the
Care Corp., but if he died, Mr. Francis would take over
management of the jointly held shares. To this end, Mr. Glaves
became a Director of Care Corp.  Mr. Francis did not.
[8]  Four of the other shareholders gave evidence that their
understanding from Mr. Glaves was that if anything happened to
himself or Mr. Francis the survivor would look after their joint
investment which was to be maintained, despite the death of one
of them, until the death of the survivor.
[9]  Throughout 1990 and 1991 the shareholders of Care Corp. were
developing a shareholders&#146; agreement to govern their
relationship. Mr. Glaves was involved in this process. The draft
agreements went through four iterations, the last dated August
21, 1991. However, no agreement had been executed prior to Mr.
Glaves&#146; death.
[10] Every version of the draft agreement provided for life
insurance to be obtained &#147;to assist in&#148; funding the purchase of
the interest of a deceased shareholder. In pursuit of this
concept, in April of 1991 Care Corp. obtained insurance policies
on the lives of each of its principals. For Mr. Glaves the amount
of the policy was $750,000 as it was for Mr. Francis and two
other shareholders. None of the drafts fixed the value of the buy-
out on death by reference to the value of the insurance policies.
The last three of these drafts all provided that the buy-out
value would be an arbitrary amount fixed annually by the
shareholders.
[11] All three drafts of the agreement created after Mr. Glaves
and Mr. Francis purchased their shares contained a specific
provision that only upon the death of the survivor of the two of
them would the obligation to purchase their jointly held interest
arise.
[12] In July 1991 the company solicitor assisting with the
preparation of the shareholders&#146; agreement wrote to the company
president setting out several ways in which the survivor of Mr.
Glaves and Mr. Francis could end up with the shares of both. The
evidence of Mr. Rogers the president of Care Corp. was that this
was not the desired objective and that he advised the solicitor
of this with the result that the August 21, 1991 draft continued
to reflect the fact that there would be no buy-out on the death
of Mr. Glaves or Mr. Francis and that the joint shareholding
would continue until the survivor died when Care Corp. would
purchase their joint interest.
[13] On December 17, 1991 about one month after Mr. Glaves&#146;
death, the shareholders executed a shareholders&#146; agreement. Mr.
Francis signed on behalf of GGHL and PJFHL. That agreement
reflected Mr. Glaves&#146; death and provided that the obligation to
purchase the jointly held Glaves/Francis block arose only on the
death of Mr. Francis.
[14] By February 1992 Care Corp. had obtained additional
insurance coverage of $750,000 on Mr. Francis and had received
the proceeds of the insurance policy on the life of Mr. Glaves.
The Directors distributed this $750,000 to the shareholders pro
rata except for $75,000 from the share of GGHL. This amount they
resolved to retain in a special interest bearing loan account to
be used for GGHL&#146;s share of future cash calls that might be made
by the company on its shareholders. Mr. Francis agreed to this on
behalf of GGHL and indicated that, as with the execution of the
shareholders&#146; agreement, he had the approval of the Mrs. Glaves
to do so. However, Mrs. Glaves takes direct issue with this.
[15] Thereafter, over time, a serious rift developed between Mr.
Francis and Mrs. Glaves and on December 2, 1994, an order was
obtained with his consent removing him as an executor of the
estate.
[16] In February 1997 the application for an oppression remedy
was launched. It was followed very shortly by an application by
PJFHL for a declaration that it had the sole right to vote the
jointly held shares in Care Corp. or that ownership in this block
should be severed. It also sought an order that GGHL is bound by
the shareholders&#146; agreement executed on December 17, 1991.
[17] The PJFHL application was heard together with the oppression
application. It was dismissed by Greer J. On appeal the
Divisional Court ordered that this application like the
oppression application should proceed to trial. PJFHL appeals
from this order.</pre>
    <pre><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>1.   GGHL&#146;s Application for Oppression Remedy</strong></pre>
    <pre>[18] I will turn first to the main issue before us, namely the
assertion by GGHL that it has suffered oppression as a minority
shareholder of Care Corp. Subsection 248(1) of the Business
Corporations Act provides that a complainant such as a
shareholder may by way of application seek an oppression remedy
from the court. Subsection 248(2) then reads as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>    (2)  Idem. &#150; Where, upon an application under
subsection (1), the court is satisfied that in 
respect of a corporation or any of its affiliates,</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(a)  any act or omission of the corporation or 
     any of its affiliates effects or threatens 
     to effect a result;</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(b)  the business or affairs of the corporation 
     or any of its affiliates are, have been or 
     are threatened to be carried on or conducted 
     in a manner; or</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(c)  the powers of the directors of the corporation 
     or any of its affiliates are, have been or are 
     threatened to be exercised in a manner,</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>that is oppressive or unfairly prejudicial to or that 
unfairly disregards the interests of any security holder, 
creditor, director or officer of the corporation, the
court may make an order to rectify the matters complained 
of.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] In Naneff v. Con-Crete Holdings Ltd. (1995), 23 O.R. (3d)
481 this court spoke about how oppression of a minority
shareholder is to be determined. It said this at p. 490:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The law is clear that when determining whether there 
has been oppression of a minority shareholder, the 
court must determine what the reasonable expectations 
of that person were according to the arrangements 
which existed between the principals. The cases on 
this issue are collected and analyzed by Farley, J. 
in 820099 Ontario Inc. v. Harold E. Ballard Ltd.
(1991), 3 B.L.R. (2d) 113 at p. 123 (Ont. Gen. Div.), 
affirmed (1991),  3 B.L.R. (2d) 113 (Ont. Div. Ct.). 
I agree with his comment at pp.185-86:</pre>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>Shareholder interests would appear to be
intertwined with shareholder expectations. It
does not appear to me that the shareholder
expectations which are to be considered are
those that a shareholder has as his own
individual &#147;wish list&#148;. They must be
expectations which could be said to have been
(or ought to have been considered as) part of
the compact of the shareholders.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] In the context of this application, GGHL must satisfy the
court that Care Corp. acted contrary to the reasonable
expectations that could be said to be part of the compact among
the shareholders. In more particular terms, the appellant must
show that Care Corp. contravened the reasonable expectations of
Gordon Glaves concerning the treatment of GGHL&#146;s shareholder
interest on his death.
[21] The appellant asserts that in these circumstances Mr.
Glaves&#146; reasonable expectation was that on his death Care Corp.
would purchase GGHL&#146;s interest with the proceeds of its insurance
policy on his life.
[22] I do not agree. The following factors lead me to that
conclusion:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  GGHL entered upon this investment jointly with PJFHL.
          The shares were held jointly by the two holding
          companies. If Mr. Glaves had expected to be bought out
          separately from Mr. Francis it is more likely that he
          would have held his shares separately.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Mr. Glaves regarded this as a long-term investment of
          great potential. The premium over current value that he
          paid is more consistent with an expectation that his
          shares would be held as long as possible in order to
          realize this value, not bought out at an early date.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (c)  Mr. Francis and other shareholders gave evidence that
	  Mr. Glaves had indicated his intention that the jointly
	  owned shares would be bought out only on the death of
	  the survivor of himself and Mr. Francis. The appellant
	  could point to nothing that directly contradicted this
	  evidence. Indeed Mr. Glaves&#146; decisions to name Mr. Francis
 	  as an executor of his will and to appoint him as a manager
 	  of his major ongoing businesses tends to support this
	  evidence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (d)  Finally, and most importantly, all of the drafts of the
          shareholders&#146; agreement that followed the joint investment
          explicitly provide that this block of shares would be 
	  purchased only on the death of the survivor of Mr. Glaves 
	  and Mr. Francis.   Mr. Glaves was not only aware of these 
	  drafts, he was involved in the process of preparing them. 
	  These drafts clearly corroborate the evidence of Mr.
	  Francis and the other  shareholders. They show that Mr.
	  Glaves could have had no reasonable expectation that if he
	  died before Mr. Francis his interest would nonetheless be
	  bought out by Care Corp.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The appellant argues that the existence of insurance held by
Care Corp. on the life of Mr. Glaves yields the inference that
Mr. Glaves could reasonably expect to be bought out on his death
even if he predeceased Mr. Francis.
[24] I disagree. Had the draft shareholders&#146; agreement provided
that the insurance proceeds were designated as the funds to be
paid over to effect the buy-out, the appellant&#146;s argument would
have some merit. However, those drafts make clear that the
insurance was only to assist in funding any buy-out whenever it
was required. Hence the mere existence of this insurance says
little about the timing of the buy-out.
[25] The appellant also relies on the July 1991 memorandum from
the corporate solicitor to support the inference of a buy-out of
Mr. Glaves&#146; interest by Care Corp. when he predeceased Mr.
Francis. I do not think that the memo permits such an inference.
It appears to have been based on a misunderstanding that on the
death of either Mr. Glaves or Mr. Francis the survivor would end
up owning the entire block. There was never any such intention
and the subsequent draft of the shareholders&#146; agreement
reiterated that the buy-out of the joint block would be by the
company not the survivor and would only occur on the death of the
survivor.
[26] The appellant further seeks to draw comfort from the fact
that Mr. Glaves&#146; will made no reference to the agreement alleged
by Mr. Francis, namely, that the survivor would take
responsibility for the jointly held shares. However, as the
respondents point out, it is only the shares of the holding
company GGHL that are of concern to the estate and one would not
expect to see a reference in Mr. Glaves&#146; will to the assets of
GGHL which form no part of his estate.
[27] Finally, the appellant says that the evidence of Mr. Francis
and the other shareholders should be disregarded because they
have a financial stake in seeing that the oppression application
is dismissed. I do not agree. There is no direct contradiction of
their evidence and more importantly as I have indicated there is
significant corroboration of it, particularly from the drafts of
the shareholders&#146; agreement.
[28] I therefore conclude that the appellant cannot satisfy the
court that Mr. Glaves had a reasonable expectation that if he
predeceased Mr. Francis his interest would be bought out by Care
Corp. using the insurance proceeds. Rather, his reasonable
expectation was that the joint shareholding would be bought out
on the death of the survivor Mr. Francis. Hence, when Care Corp.
incorporated that intention into the shareholders&#146; agreement
executed on December 17, 1991 there was no oppression of the
minority shareholder GGHL.
[29] Moreover, it is clear to me that a trial is not needed to
reach this conclusion.
[30] The statute authorizes this proceeding to be brought by
application not action. As with any application the court will
require the trial of an issue only if there is good reason to do
so and no determination can properly be made on the application
record. A common example of such a circumstance is a credibility
conflict between witnesses.
[31] In argument all parties asserted that the evidence in the
application record supported their position on reasonable
expectations and that a trial was not necessary.
[32] I agree that there is nothing in this record that points to
the need for a trial of the oppression application. The evidence
of Mr. Francis and the other shareholders of Mr. Glaves&#146;
expectations is uncontradicted. The appellant made clear in
argument that in seeking to displace this evidence it was
prepared to set aside any consideration of demeanour and rely on
the inherent improbability of that evidence in the face of the
inferences that it sought to draw from other documentary
evidence. This is not an exercise that requires a trial, nor
would the appellant&#146;s chance of success be improved by a trial.
In summary the court is not faced with any direct conflict in
credibility nor any need to consider the demeanour of deponents.
The application record is therefore an entirely satisfactory
basis on which to evaluate the oppression claim.
[33] In the result I would therefore dismiss the appellant&#146;s
appeal, but allow the cross-appeal of Care Corp. I would set
aside the order of the Divisional Court and the order of Greer J.
and order that the appellant&#146;s oppression application be
dismissed.</pre>
    <pre><strong>2.   PJFHL&#146;s Application Regarding the Jointly Held Shares</strong></pre>
    <pre>[34] I turn now to the appeal from the disposition of the PJFHL
application. In my view the primary issue that requires
resolution is whether Mr. Francis was cloaked with the ostensible
authority to execute the shareholders&#146; agreement on behalf of
GGHL on December 17, 1991 and to represent to Care Corp. on
behalf GGHL on February 6, 1992 that $75,000 could be retained by
Care Corp. as a special shareholder loan from GGHL to meet future
cash calls.
[35] If there was such ostensible authority then GGHL is bound to
both arrangements with Care Corp.
[36] Any dispute between Mr. Francis and Mrs. Glaves as to
whether she actually agreed that he could made these arrangements
is a matter to be settled between them, as Brockenshire J. said
in the Divisional Court.
[37] The analysis of Mr. Francis&#146; ostensible authority can be
made without resolving the conflict between Mr. Francis and Mrs.
Glaves. The representations made by Mr. Glaves to Mr. Francis and
the other shareholders are clear. If either he or Mr. Francis
died the survivor was to take over responsibility to manage this
joint investment. In addition, the provisions of his will, which
were known to Care Corp., and which named Mr. Francis as an
executor and as a manager of his major ongoing businesses provide
sufficient corroboration to satisfy me that Mr. Francis had the
necessary ostensible authority to bind GGHL to the shareholders&#146;
agreement and to the special shareholder loan arrangement.
[38] The second issue presented by the PJFHL appeal concerns the
future management of the joint shareholding of PJFHL and GGHL in
Care Corp. In my view, it is clear that a deadlock has arisen
because of the rift that has developed between Mr. Francis and
Mrs. Glaves. The appropriate resolution is that the jointly held
block of shares be severed and that each holding company be the
sole owner of 50% of the jointly held block.
[39] In summary, therefore, I would allow the PJFHL appeal and
order that its application be granted to the extent of declaring
(1) that GGHL is bound to the shareholders&#146; agreement of December
17, 1991 and the special shareholders&#146; loan made on February 6,
1992, and (2) that the joint ownership of the shares and Care
Corp. be severed so that GGHL and PJFHL would each own 50% of
those shares.
[40] I see no basis for making any further order in connection
with the PJFHL application.
[41] As to costs Care Corp. and PJFHL have been successful on
this appeal. I see no reason why they should not have their party
and party costs throughout including their costs of the motion
for leave to appeal to this court.</pre>
