    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice J. R. R. Jennings,
sitting with a jury, on July 7, 1998
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CHARRON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant was charged with one count of sexual assault
causing  bodily  harm contrary to s. 272(1)(c)  of  the  Criminal
Code.  Following a trial before Jennings J. and a  jury,  he  was
found  not guilty of the offence as charged but was convicted  of
the included offence of sexual assault and sentenced to a term of
two years&#146; imprisonment.
[2]  This appeal turns on the trial judge&#146;s application of the
similar fact evidence rule to the particular facts of this case.</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[3]   The alleged offence arises out of an incident that is often
referred to in common parlance as &#147;date rape&#148;. The Crown  alleges
that the appellant continued an act of vaginal sexual intercourse
with  the complainant after she had withdrawn her consent to  the
act,  and  that  he  then  proceeded  to  forcibly  perform  anal
intercourse  despite  her  protestations.  In  support   of   the
complainant&#146;s testimony, the Crown at trial sought  to  introduce
the  testimony  of the appellant&#146;s former wife  with  respect  to
seven  incidents of physical and/or sexual abuse alleged to  have
been committed against her.
[4]  Following a voir dire, the trial judge ruled that the former
wife&#146;s testimony was admissible in support of the complainant&#146;s
credibility because it evidenced &#147;a pattern of using an initially
consensual situation to escalate into violent, painful sexual
connection, with both vaginal and anal penetration.&#148;  The former
wife was therefore allowed to testify about the seven incidents
in question. At the end of the trial, the trial judge instructed
the jury that, if they found that the appellant &#147;enjoyed forcing
anal and vaginal sex upon his ex-wife in circumstances
accompanied by pain and continuing in spite of a request to
stop&#148;, the evidence of this conduct could assist them in
determining the truth of the complainant&#146;s allegations.
[5]  Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge&#146;s
finding that the former wife&#146;s testimony evidenced &#147;a pattern of
conduct&#148; which supported the complainant&#146;s testimony cannot be
supported by the evidence. He argues that this evidence had no
probative value with respect to any issue at trial other than
proving the appellant&#146;s bad character and consequent propensity
for committing the offence. Counsel for the appellant therefore
takes the position that the evidence was inadmissible and that,
given its highly prejudicial nature, its admission resulted in an
unfair trial.
[6]  Alternatively, counsel for the appellant submits that, even
if this evidence was properly admitted, the jury was misdirected
by the trial judge as to the use they could make of this evidence
in their deliberations. Rather than being cautioned against
adopting the propensity reasoning prohibited by law, counsel for
the appellant submits that the jurors were effectively told that,
if they found on the basis of that evidence that the appellant
was the type of person who would commit the offence, they could
use this fact to assist in determining the truth of the
complainant&#146;s testimony. Counsel for the appellant argues that
this direction constituted reversible error.
[7]  It is the Crown&#146;s general position that the trial judge did
not err either in admitting the former wife&#146;s testimony or in his
charge to the jury regarding the permissible use of her evidence.
[8]  A trial judge&#146;s decision on the application of the similar
fact evidence rule is entitled to considerable deference upon
appellate review because it involves the delicate and difficult
process of balancing the probative value of the evidence against
its prejudicial effect, a task which the trial judge is in a
better position to perform. Hence, where a trial judge has
properly addressed all relevant concerns, has weighed the
evidence and its potential prejudice and has arrived at a
conclusion as to its admissibility, a court of appeal should not
lightly interfere. See R. v. B. (C.R.) (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.) at 23-24.
[9]  In this case, the trial judge instructed himself according
to correct legal principles. However, it is my view that the
trial judge erred in characterizing the probative value of the
proposed evidence as evidencing &#147;a pattern of conduct&#148; that
supported the complainant&#146;s testimony. I agree with counsel for
the appellant that the evidence cannot reasonably support this
finding. The incidents involving the former wife were varied and
did not evidence any identifiable pattern of conduct nor could
any helpful parallel be drawn between those incidents and the
allegations of the complainant. The evidence was also subject to
a number of frailties, not adverted to by the trial judge, that
further reduced any probative value it could have. Finally, as
became apparent from the trial judge&#146;s own instruction to the
jury, the evidence could serve no purpose other than to show that
the appellant was the type of person who would commit the alleged
offence. As such, the evidence was highly prejudicial and of
slight probative value. It should not have been admitted at
trial. In the circumstances, I am satisfied that the erroneous
decision of the trial judge merits appellate intervention. In my
view, there must be a new trial.</pre>
    <pre>     THE EVIDENCE AT TRIAL</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  complainant met the appellant about six months  before
the  incident in question. He had been introduced to her  by  her
boyfriend at the time. On December 6, 1996, the complainant  went
out  with a girlfriend for a few drinks and saw the appellant  at
the bar. He was already visibly intoxicated. After an evening  of
drinking  and  flirting, the appellant and the  complainant  went
with  two  of  the complainant&#146;s friends to one of  the  friends&#146;
homes,  where  they  smoked marijuana.   The  appellant  and  the
complainant then left together, with the appellant driving.  Both
the  appellant  and the complainant had consumed  a  considerable
amount  of  alcohol and, while driving to the Econo Lodge  motel,
their  car  went into a ditch and they had to push it  out.  Once
inside   a   motel   room,  they  commenced  consensual   vaginal
intercourse.  The  complainant alleged  that  the  appellant  was
forceful  and that intercourse became uncomfortable for her.  She
told  the  appellant that he was hurting her. She testified  that
the appellant asked &#147;How am I hurting you?&#148;, but continued.
[11] The complainant testified that, eventually, the appellant
stopped vaginal intercourse and initiated anal intercourse. She
testified that she told him to stop because he was hurting her.
She stated that, again, the appellant asked &#147;How am I hurting
you?&#148; but did not stop. The complainant testified that she tried
to get the appellant off her but was unsuccessful. She alleged
that he held her down and continued the anal intercourse despite
her pleas and her crying.
[12] The complainant further alleged that, at one point during
the incident, she slapped the appellant in the face. He struck
her in the chest and also choked her. Afterwards, she told him
that he had made her bleed. He allegedly said &#147;What the hell am I
doing here? Why does this keep happening to me?&#148;
[13] Two days later, the complainant was feeling poorly and
sought medical assistance. She was diagnosed with pneumonia and
post-traumatic stress. A number of witnesses testified that they
observed bruises on the complainant&#146;s throat, chest and arms in
the days following the sexual assault.
[14] Following a voir dire, the evidence of the appellant&#146;s
former wife, Kelly Byrne,  regarding seven incidents of physical
and/or sexual abuse that she suffered during their relationship,
was admitted as similar fact evidence. It is necessary to
consider Ms. Byrne&#146;s evidence in some detail to dispose of this
appeal.
[15] Ms. Byrne testified as to her relationship with the
appellant. Ms. Byrne and the appellant were married in 1989, when
she was seventeen years old. They had three children together,
born in 1990, 1991 and 1992 respectively. They separated in 1992
around the time when the appellant was imprisoned. Ms. Byrne
divorced the appellant in 1994 while he was still in prison. The
appellant was released in 1995. Shortly after his release, he and
Ms. Byrne resumed living together. Ms. Byrne left the appellant
for the last time in December 1996, after she found a note from a
woman in his pocket. This was shortly after the alleged incident
in this case, which occurred on December 7, 1996. In January
1997, by which time Ms. Byrne knew that the appellant had gone to
a motel with the complainant in this case and had been arrested
on this charge, Ms. Byrne went to the police and gave a statement
about a number of incidents that happened during the course of
her relationship with the appellant. At the time of trial in June
1998, these incidents were the subject-matter of criminal charges
and a preliminary hearing had been completed in separate
proceedings. Ms. Byrne&#146;s testimony about the incidents in
question can be summarized as follows.
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.  Incident One</pre>
    <pre>          In March 1990, a few weeks after their first child
          was born, the appellant wanted to have vaginal
          intercourse with Ms. Byrne. She did not want to do so
          because she thought intercourse would be painful.  The
          appellant was curious to &#147;see what it would feel like&#148;
          and insisted that they have intercourse. Once they
          started, Kelly told him she was in pain.  He said that
          it was supposed to hurt and did not stop.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.  Incident Two</pre>
    <pre>          Approximately six months after their first child
          was born, Ms. Byrne and the appellant visited her
          sister and brother-in-law in their mobile trailer.
          After everyone went to bed, the appellant wanted to
          have sexual intercourse. Ms. Byrne did not want to do
          so because her sister and her husband were at the other
          end of the trailer and Ms. Byrne did not feel
          comfortable having intercourse in that situation. She
          told the appellant that she did not want to have sex
          and tried to move away from him. The appellant told her
          to shut up and had intercourse with her anyway.
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.  Incident Three</pre>
    <pre>          One afternoon during the summer of 1991, Ms. Byrne
          returned home from doing the laundry to find that the
          appellant had invited a number of people into their
          apartment for a party.  The guests were drinking and
          tatooing each other.  The appellant was sitting on the
          living room sofa with two women, all tickling each
          other. Ms. Byrne became upset and told everyone to
          leave.  Everyone left except for the appellant's cousin
          and another man. Ms. Byrne went into the bedroom. The
          appellant followed her. He was upset because she had
          told everyone to leave and began throwing her around
          the room.  He tried to have sexual intercourse with
          her.  She tried to get away from him.  He blocked the
          door with a dresser so she tried to get out by the
          second floor bedroom window, but the appellant pulled
          her back in.  The appellant then forced Ms. Byrne to
          have sexual intercourse and then passed out.  Ms. Byrne
          left the bedroom. The appellant&#146;s cousin and the other
          man were still inside the apartment.  Ms. Byrne
          testified that the two men &#147;didn't know what to do&#148;.
          She left the apartment and went to her father-in-law's
          auto body shop located down the street.
          </pre>
    <pre>          4.  Incident Four</pre>
    <pre>          Approximately two weeks after their third child
          was born, the appellant came home after he had been
          drinking and wanted to have anal intercourse with Ms.
          Byrne. She did not want to do that because the
          appellant had tried to have anal intercourse with her
          before, and it had &#147;hurt a lot&#148;. She told him that she
          did not want to have anal intercourse. The appellant
          initiated anal intercourse nonetheless. She kept moving
          and tried to get away. The baby woke up a number of
          times crying.  She attempted to give the baby a bottle
          but the appellant pulled her back to the bed each time.
          Then, the appellant threw her onto the bed and grabbed
          a bottle of baby oil from under the bed.  He put the
          baby oil on his penis and on her anus.  The application
          of the baby oil made it more difficult for her to get
          away.  The appellant started to have anal intercourse
          with her.  The baby started to cry again.  The
          appellant stopped to put the baby to sleep. Ms. Byrne
          ran to the basement.  The appellant followed her.  He
          told her that if she did not stop running, he would tie
          her up with a rope.  He told her she was acting like a
          baby. It is unclear from Ms. Byrne&#146;s testimony whether
          they went back to the bedroom. In any event, she ran
          naked out of the house and over to the neighbour's
          house. The police were called. They told Ms. Byrne that
          she could lay charges but she testified that she &#147;just
          couldn&#146;t.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Sometime later in 1992, the appellant was imprisoned. While
the appellant was imprisoned, Ms. Byrne divorced him and obtained
compensation in the amount of $16,500 from the Criminal Injuries&#146;
Compensation Board for the abuse she suffered during  the  course
of  her  marriage.  She testified that the above-noted  incidents
formed the basis of her complaint to the Board. Ms. Byrne resumed
cohabitation  with the appellant sometime after  his  release  in
1995.
          </pre>
    <pre>          5.  Incident Five</pre>
    <pre>          Shortly after the appellant and Ms. Byrne resumed
          living together in 1995, they had an argument. Ms.
          Byrne was upset because the appellant had gone out with
          a woman whom he used to date.  The appellant became
          angry, grabbed Ms. Byrne by the throat, threw her
          around, pinned her against the wall and broke the glass
          coffee tables. He did not, however, sexually assault
          her.
          </pre>
    <pre>          6.  Incident Six</pre>
    <pre>          One night during the summer of 1996, the appellant
          and Ms. Byrne were returning home after dropping off
          their friends. The appellant told Ms. Byrne that they
          were not going home. Rather they were going to a gravel
          pit and she &#147;was going to get it up the ass.&#148; She
          testified that he had forced her to have sexual
          intercourse with him at the gravel pit in the past.
          Ms. Byrne told the appellant that she was willing to do
          anything, just not anal intercourse, &#147;because it really
          hurt&#148;.  The appellant, however, wanted to have anal
          intercourse.  He tried to enter Ms. Byrne anally, but
          was unsuccessful because she  moved around and there
          was not enough room in the back seat.  The appellant
          took her out of the back seat and put her face down on
          the hood of his car.  He attempted to enter Ms. Byrne
          anally from behind. It is unclear from Ms. Byrne&#146;s
          testimony whether he was successful but eventually he
          turned her over onto her back and had vaginal
          intercourse with her.
          </pre>
    <pre>          7.  Incident Seven</pre>
    <pre>          In October 1996, Ms. Byrne&#146;s grandfather passed
          away. The appellant and Ms. Byrne were alone in Ms.
          Byrne&#146;s home. Ms. Byrne was upset and was crying. Ms.
          Byrne testified that her crying &#147;turned [the appellant]
          on&#148; and that he wanted to have sexual intercourse on
          her mother's new couch. Ms. Byrne did not want to have
          intercourse.  The appellant put her on the couch and
          commenced vaginal intercourse.  She cried.  While they
          had intercourse, he punched her in the stomach a number
          of times to make her cry louder.  The incident ended
          when the appellant stopped abruptly.
</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The appellant testified at trial. He described his marriage
to Ms. Byrne and denied committing any of the alleged assaults on
her.  With respect to the allegation made by the complainant,  he
testified  that he met her at the bar, that they were both  quite
intoxicated and that they left the bar together. Eventually, they
went to a motel room. He testified that the complainant straddled
him  as he lay on his back and that they engaged in approximately
fifteen  or  twenty minutes of vaginal sex. He  denied  that  the
complainant at any time complained or asked him to stop. He  also
denied hitting her or choking her. He did not remember whether or
not they had anal intercourse. They slept for awhile and at about
6:40 a.m. she drove him home. He did not see her again.
     </pre>
    <pre>THE TRIAL JUDGE&#146;S RULING</pre>
    <pre>[18]  The trial judge correctly identified the test for admitting
similar fact evidence.  He quoted from McLachlin J.'s judgment in
R. v. B.(C.R.) (1990), supra, at 21 as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In determining its admissibility, one starts from the
proposition that the evidence is inadmissible, given 
the low degree of probative force and the high degree 
of prejudice typically associated with it.  The 
question then is whether, because of the exceptional 
probative value of the evidence under consideration 
in relation to its potential prejudice, it should be 
admitted notwithstanding the general exclusionary rule.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19]  The trial judge then followed the analysis proposed by this
court in R. v. B.(L.) (1997), 116 C.C.C. (3d) 481. He quoted  the
following from p. 490 of that decision:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The trial judge who is charged with the delicate process 
of balancing the probative value of the proposed evidence 
against its prejudicial effect should inquire into the 
following matters.</pre>
      <pre>1.  Is the conduct, which forms the subject-matter of the
proposed evidence, that of the accused?</pre>
      <pre>2.  If so, is the proposed evidence relevant and material?</pre>
      <pre>3.  If relevant and material, is the proposed evidence
discreditable to the accused?</pre>
      <pre>4.  If discreditable, does its probative value outweigh  
its prejudicial effect?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20]  The  trial  judge  held that there  was  no  difficulty  in
answering  the first question in the affirmative. Quite  clearly,
Ms. Byrne&#146;s proposed testimony was about the appellant Mr. Handy.
The  trial  judge then concluded that &#147;[h]ow Mr. Handy  acted  on
previous  occasions with Ms. Byrne may very well assist the  jury
in  determining  how he acted with Ms. Story&#148;  and  he  therefore
found  the evidence both relevant and material.  The trial  judge
then considered the third question, whether the proposed evidence
is  discreditable to the accused, and stated that the  answer  to
this  question must be yes. He therefore concluded that,  because
the  evidence was discreditable, it could only be admitted if its
probative  value  outweighed its prejudicial  effect.  The  trial
judge  then  reminded  himself that in  considering  whether  the
discreditable  evidence may prejudice the trier of  fact  against
the  accused,  the  issue  was  not whether  the  evidence  might
increase the chance of conviction but whether the evidence  would
be  improperly used by the trier of fact to find that the accused
was guilty simply because he was a bad person.
[21] The trial judge then concluded that, after considering the
factors enumerated by this court in R. v. B. (L.), the evidence
was admissible. He stated as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>  In my opinion the issue for the jury is not simply
  whether the withdrawal of consent was communicated; 
  it is whether Ms. Story's allegations are credible 
  that sex continued in a violent manner in the face 
  of her attempted refusal.  In my opinion, the 
  similar fact evidence, if believed, establishes a
  pattern of using an initially consensual situation
  to escalate into violent, painful sexual connection,
  with both vaginal and anal penetration.  It would
  show a pattern of behaviour.  It would confirm the
  credibility of Ms. Story.  Those are legitimate
  purposes for the reception of the evidence because
  it does more than simply suggest a propensity to
  commit the acts forming the subject of the charge,
  based upon the accused's alleged bad character.
  Because of that, I find the probative value to be
  high.                      </pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>                     The   analysis  of  the  proposed
          evidence  persuades me that there is  a  real
          similarity  in the contextual sense,  to  the
          evidence of what happened to Ms. Story.  That
          there   were   superficial   differences   is
          obvious.  For example, Mr. Handy was  married
          to  Ms.  Byrne and after divorce, lived  with
          her  in  a  conjugal situation.   There  were
          incidents  of consensual vaginal sex  between
          Mr. Handy and Ms. Byrne.  He used a lubricant
          on   one   occasion  when  there   was   anal
          intercourse.   None  of those  features  were
          present in his encounter with Ms. Story.
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>                     But  the overriding similarity  of
          the conversion of an occasion when consensual
          sex   may   be  anticipated,  into   one   of
          continuing vaginal sex after complaint,  pain
          and  request to stop, accompanied by physical
          attack, and of initiating and continuing anal
          sex   without  consent,  persuades   me   the
          proposed   evidence   has   the   substantial
          probative value required, and as was the case
          in  R.  v.  B. (L.) the proposed evidence  is
          relevant   to   an   important   issue,   the
          credibility of Ms. Story.</pre>
      <pre>                      In   assessing  its   prejudicial
          effect, I accept defence counsel's submission
          that  in  this day and age, spousal abuse  is
          rightly   regarded  with   disgust.    Sexual
          attitudes  may be more relaxed now  than  was
          formerly  the  case  with  respect  to   anal
          intercourse,    but    regardless,     forced
          intercourse  either anally or  vaginally,  is
          likely to be viewed with extreme distaste.</pre>
      <pre>                     The admission of the evidence will
          not confuse issues and the accused is able to
          respond to it.</pre>
      <pre>                     In my view, the probative value of
          the  evidence  is  sufficiently  high  as  to
          lessen  its prejudicial effect to the  extent
          that   probative  value  exceeds  prejudicial
          effect,  and  I  rule  the  evidence  to   be
          admissible.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>     ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[22]  There is no question that the admissibility of the proposed
evidence at trial was governed by the similar fact evidence rule.
The  trial judge correctly identified the governing test. As  set
out  in  the  excerpt from R. v. B. (C.R.) quoted  by  the  trial
judge, the rule begins with the premise of general exclusion, and
then calls for a balancing of all the factors that relate to  the
probative  value  of the proposed evidence and to  its  potential
prejudicial effect. As stated in B. (C.R.), &#147;[t]he question  then
is  whether,  because of the exceptional probative value  of  the
evidence   under  consideration  in  relation  to  its  potential
prejudice,  it  should  be admitted notwithstanding  the  general
exclusionary rule.&#148;
[23] Although it is by no means mandatory to follow the
analytical framework suggested by this court in R. v. B. (L), I
find it a helpful tool both to determine whether the similar fact
evidence rule comes into play and to apply the rule to the
particular facts of the case when it does apply.
[24] The first question is whether the conduct which forms the
subject-matter of the proposed evidence is that of the accused.
The Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Arp (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d)
321 at 346, recently reiterated that a link between the accused
and the alleged similar acts is a pre-condition to the
admissibility of the evidence. The threshold test is that set out
in R. v. Sweitzer, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 949 at p. 954:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Before evidence may be admitted as evidence of similar
facts, there must be a link between the allegedly similar 
facts and the accused.  In other words there must be some 
evidence upon which the trier of fact can make a proper 
finding that the similar facts to be relied upon were in 
fact the acts of the accused for it is clear that if they 
were not his own but those of another they have no
relevance to the matters at issue under the indictment.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[25]  In  this  case, this question posed no problem.  The  trial
judge was correct in noting that the link between the conduct  in
question  and  the  appellant was provided  through  Ms.  Byrne's
testimony. There was no question on her testimony that the person
she  was  testifying about was the accused before the  court.  Of
course,  her  testimony would have to be  accepted  by  the  jury
before  the evidence would have any probative value, but at  this
stage  of the inquiry the trial judge was correct in saying  that
this ultimate issue of credibility was not for him to determine.
[26] The second question is whether the proposed evidence is
relevant and material. Relevance and materiality is a basic
threshold that all evidence must meet before it will be admitted
at trial. Evidence is relevant &quot;where it has some tendency as a
matter of logic and human experience to make the proposition for
which it is advanced more likely than that proposition would
appear to be in the absence of that evidence.&quot;1  It is material
if it is directed at a matter in issue in the case.  Therefore,
this basic threshold of relevance and materiality can generally
be tested by asking what inference is sought to be made from the
proposed evidence and whether it has some tendency to advance the
inquiry before the court.
[27] The trial judge found that the proposed evidence was
relevant and material because, as set out above, &#147;[h]ow Mr. Handy
acted on previous occasions with Ms. Byrne may very well assist
the jury in determining how he acted with Ms. Story.&#148;   The
Crown submits  that  the  trial judge did not err in finding that
the proposed evidence was relevant and material to the  issue  of
whether  the  complainant&#146;s allegation was  credible.  The  Crown
argues in its factum that &#147;evidence that the appellant has  acted
in  a particular manner on past occasions or, stated differently,
evidence that an accused has the propensity or disposition to act
in a particular way, tends to support the inference that he acted
that  way  on  the  occasion  in issue.&#148;  Hence,  it  is  argued,
&#147;evidence  that the appellant sexually assaulted his former  wife
on a number of occasions was relevant and material to determining
whether he sexually assaulted the complainant.&#148;
[28]  I  agree with the Crown&#146;s contention that, as a  matter  of
logic  and human experience, evidence that the appellant sexually
assaulted  Ms.  Byrne on a number of occasions was  relevant  and
material  to  determining  whether  he  sexually  assaulted   the
complainant  as  she alleged. Hence, I am of the  view  that  the
trial judge was correct in finding that Ms. Byrne&#146;s evidence  was
relevant  and  material  in so far as  her  evidence  related  to
incidents of sexual assault. It is not as clear, however, how the
evidence  with  respect to &#147;incident five&#148; (where  the  appellant
physically  assaulted Ms. Byrne and broke some  furniture  during
the  course  of  an  argument) could really advance  the  inquiry
before  the  court  beyond  supporting  the  inference  that  the
appellant   could  prove  to  be  violent.  However,  since   the
complainant was also alleging certain acts of violence,  I  would
not interfere with the trial judge&#146;s finding on this question.
[29] It is important to note, however, that a finding of
relevance and materiality is only a basic threshold that can
easily be met. At this stage of the inquiry, the court is simply
recognizing that the nature of Ms. Byrne's evidence is such that
it may advance the inquiry before the court from the strict
standpoint of logic and human experience. If, for example,
Ms. Byrne's proposed testimony was that Mr. Handy was a heavy
smoker, I think that any trial judge would readily conclude that
the evidence was not relevant and not material because it would
not in any way advance the inquiry into any of the issues before
the court. Hence, the inquiry would stop at that point and the
evidence would be ruled inadmissible. In this case, it is because
Ms. Byrne's proposed testimony, as a matter of logic and human
experience, could be used by the jury in determining the issues
before them that the inquiry into its admissibility must
continue. In particular, it must be determined whether this
evidence could be misused by the jury. That consideration brings
us to the third question, was the proposed evidence discreditable
to the appellant?
[30]  As the trial judge properly concluded, there is no doubt
that the evidence was highly discreditable.  Ms. Byrne's
testimony presented Mr. Handy as a person who could be
insensitive, violent, and at times, even cruel. At this stage of
the inquiry, the court has in effect identified the dangers
associated with this type of evidence. There is a danger that
this evidence, which is discreditable to the accused and which is
not the subject-matter of the charge, could be misused by the
jury to convict the accused on the basis that he is a &#147;bad&#148;
person who is the &#147;type&#148; to commit the offence with which he is
charged rather than on the basis of evidence that properly
relates to the charge before the court. Therefore, the general
exclusionary rule is triggered.  As stated by Sopinka J., in R.
v. B.(C.R.), the principal reason for this exclusionary rule is
that there is a natural human tendency to judge a person's
actions on the basis of character.  He states at pp. 7-8 as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Particularly with juries there would be a strong inclination
to conclude that a thief has stolen, a violent man has 
assaulted and a pedophile has engaged in pedophilic acts.  
Yet, the policy of the law is wholly against this process of 
reasoning.  This policy is reflected not only in similar act 
cases but as well in the rule excluding evidence of the 
character of the accused unless placed in issue by him.  
The stronger the evidence of propensity, the more likely it 
is that the forbidden inference will be drawn and therefore 
the greater the prejudice.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[31]  Although  evidence  of propensity  or  disposition  may  be
relevant to the crime charged and material to some issue  in  the
case,  it  is  usually inadmissible because its slight  probative
value  is ultimately outweighed by its highly prejudicial effect.
It  will  only be admitted if it has exceptional probative  value
that  in effect outweighs its prejudicial effect. This brings  us
to  the critical inquiry as to whether the probative value of the
evidence  outweighs its prejudicial effect.   As  stated  by  the
Supreme  Court  in  Arp, supra, at 340, this is  the  &#147;basic  and
fundamental  question&#148; that must be answered in  considering  the
admissibility of similar fact evidence.
[32] In R. v. B. (L.), this court set out a list of factors at
p. 494 that may be useful to consider in applying this balancing
test.  The factors are as follows.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In assessing the probative value of the proposed evidence,
consideration should be given to such matters as:</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>  (i)   the strength of the evidence;
     </pre>
    <pre>  (ii)  the extent to which the proposed evidence supports the
        inference(s) sought to be made from it (this factor 
	will often correspond to the degree of similarity 
	between the prior misconduct and the conduct forming 
	the subject-matter of the charge); and</pre>
    <pre>  (iii) the extent to which the matters it tends to prove are
        at issue in the proceedings.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In assessing the prejudicial effect of the proposed
evidence, consideration should be given to such matters as:</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>  (i)   how discreditable it is;
     </pre>
    <pre>  (ii)  the extent to which it may support an inference of guilt
        based solely on bad character;
     </pre>
    <pre>  (iii) the extent to which it may confuse issues; and</pre>
    <pre>  (iv)  the accused's ability to respond to it.
</pre>
    <pre>[33] As stated earlier, the trial judge stated that he considered
these  factors  and  concluded that the probative  value  of  the
evidence  was  sufficiently  high  to  overcome  its  prejudicial
effect. With respect, it is my view that the trial judge erred in
his assessment of the evidence. I will refer to some of the above-
noted factors in explaining the reasons for my conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Probative Value
               a) the strength of the proposed evidence</pre>
    <pre>[34]  The extent to which the discreditable conduct can be proven
has  a direct bearing on its probative value.  In cases where the
accused  denies  his or her involvement in the  prior  acts,  the
issue of proof may be important to the inquiry into its probative
value.  This is such a case.
[35] Mr. Handy denied all of the incidents alleged by Ms. Byrne.
The incidents in question formed the subject-matter of pending
proceedings before the court and were as yet unproven. On the
voir dire, Ms. Byrne was subjected to extensive cross-examination
by defence counsel.  It is clear from this cross-examination that
there were serious issues with respect to Ms. Byrne's
credibility.  I note the following matters that could
legitimately be pursued by defence counsel in cross-examination
and considered by the jury in the assessment of her credibility:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  There were a number of material inconsistencies between her
  evidence at trial, her prior statements, and her testimony 
  at the preliminary hearing and on the appellant&#146;s first 
  trial. (The record indeed reveals a number of inconsistencies
  between her evidence on the voir dire and her evidence before 
  the jury.)</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  There was considerable delay in reporting any of the
  incidents.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  The timing of Ms. Byrne&#146;s complaints to the authorities and
  the context within which the complaints were made raised issues
  with respect to her motives to come forward.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Her complaint with respect to the first four incidents was
  first made to the authorities in the context of an apparently
  uncontested application for compensation before the Criminal
  Injuries Compensation Board, at a time when the appellant was
  incarcerated and as a result of which Ms. Byrne received $16,500.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  Her later complaint to the police about all of the incidents
  was made shortly after her final separation from the appellant
  and shortly after she had learned of the appellant&#146;s involvement
  in this case. This complaint was also made about a week after the
  appellant had been sentenced to a short period of incarceration
  on a charge of threatening Ms. Byrne, a sentence which Ms. Byrne
  admitted had disappointed her at the time.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[36]   I  am  not  suggesting  that  these  circumstances   would
necessarily affect Ms. Byrne's credibility in the final analysis,
but they are all matters that could be legitimately pursued in  a
proper  assessment  of her credibility.  The important  point  is
that, to the extent that these circumstances affected Ms. Byrne's
credibility,  they  made  the  proposed  evidence  weaker.  These
circumstances also increased the potential prejudicial effect  of
the  evidence  because  the issues raised  with  respect  to  Ms.
Byrne&#146;s credibility had nothing to do with the charge before  the
court and hence unnecessarily complicated the jury&#146;s task.</pre>
    <pre>     b) the extent to which the proposed evidence supports the
        intended inference</pre>
    <pre>[37]  As noted in R. v. B. (L.), the extent to which the proposed
evidence supports the intended inference will often depend on the
degree of similarity between the prior discreditable conduct  and
the facts sought to be proved at trial.  The requisite similarity
in  turn  depends on what particular inference is  sought  to  be
drawn.  It  is well established, and it follows as  a  matter  of
common sense, that where the inference sought to be drawn is that
the  same  person committed the acts in question, the  degree  of
similarity  must  be very high. One would not conclude  that  the
same  person  committed two separate acts on  the  basis  of  the
similarities  alone,  unless  there  was  a  striking  similarity
between  the acts in question. In cases such as this  one,  where
identity is not an issue and the evidence is intended to  support
the  credibility of the complainant's allegation, the  similarity
of  the  events  may be less crucial but is still of  importance.
While  it  is  not  necessary that the  incidents  be  strikingly
similar  for  the  evidence to have significant probative  value,
there   must   be  sufficient  similarity  in  the  circumstances
surrounding  the  prior  discreditable  conduct  to  support   an
inference that the complainant is probably telling the truth.  It
is   the   improbability  that  the  two  complaints  are  simply
coincidental  which gives the evidence of the other discreditable
conduct its probative value.
[38] In this case, as noted above, the trial judge concluded that
Ms. Byrne's testimony, if believed, established &quot;a pattern of
using an initially consensual situation to escalate into violent,
painful sexual connection, with both vaginal and anal
penetration&quot;.  He stated that this would show a pattern of
behaviour that would confirm the credibility of Ms. Story by
virtue of the similarity between the pattern and the allegation
of sexual assault in this case.  With all due respect, it is
difficult to identify any such pattern of behaviour in the
proposed evidence.  In none of the incidents did Ms. Byrne
testify that there was consensual intercourse escalating into
something violent.  Rather, with respect to each incident where
there was intercourse of one form or another, she alleged that it
was entirely without her consent from the outset.
[39] The various incidents are also quite disparate in nature.
The first incident involved vaginal intercourse with Ms. Byrne
without her consent, in circumstances where it was painful to her
because of the recent birth of her child but without additional
physical violence.  In the second incident (at the sister&#146;s
trailer), there was vaginal intercourse without her consent, but
in circumstances where there was no infliction of pain. The third
incident, when Mr. Handy was angry that Ms. Byrne had told his
guests to leave, involved mostly physical violence culminating in
an act of forcible vaginal intercourse. The fourth incident
involved attempted anal intercourse and physical violence when
Ms. Byrne resisted.  The fifth incident involved physical
violence towards Ms. Byrne and other violent behaviour but no
sexual assault. The sixth incident was involved either successful
or attempted anal intercourse and vaginal intercourse, all
without the complainant&#146;s consent. The last incident, when Ms.
Byrne&#146;s grandfather had died, involved an incident of vaginal
sexual intercourse without Ms. Byrne's consent in circumstances
where the appellant was insensitive to Ms. Byrne's emotional
condition and also some physical violence.  Although these
incidents share certain characteristics, it is difficult to fit
them into any sort of &quot;pattern&quot; that is specific enough to be of
use in bolstering the credibility of the complainant.
[40] There are also quite a few dissimilarities between the
conduct described by Ms. Byrne and the conduct alleged by the
complainant.  With all due respect to the trial judge, these
differences are not &quot;superficial&quot;.  For example, the incidents
involving Ms. Byrne took place largely within the context of a
conjugal relationship, whereas the conduct charged in this case
involved a complainant who was, at best, an acquaintance of the
appellant.  Moreover, the conduct charged in this case appears to
have begun as an act of consensual intercourse, thereby making it
different in a crucial way from all of the incidents recounted by
Ms. Byrne.
[41] Finally, there was a potential for collusion that further
weakened any probative value that could be derived from the
improbability of coincidence. The potential for collusion is
always a serious consideration in the assessment of the strength
of this kind of evidence.  As noted in Arp, supra, at p. 349,
&quot;[i]t is the unlikelihood of coincidence that gives the evidence
its probative force.&quot;  It follows, therefore, that collusion
between witnesses may deprive the evidence of much, if not all,
of its force.  In this case, the potential for collusion existed.
Ms. Byrne had met the complainant some months before this
incident.  She had told the complainant about the appellant's
criminal record and her allegations of the appellant's abuse
during their marriage.  Ms. Byrne also conceded in cross-
examination that she might have told the complainant about the
$16,500 compensation she received.  The trial judge noted this
possibility for collusion, stated that there was no &#147;direct
evidence&#148; of collusion and concluded, &quot;[r]egardless, this is a
decision for the trier of fact to make.&quot;  Although the trial
judge is quite correct that he does not have to make any
determinative finding as to whether or not there was collusion,
it is not a matter that can simply be left for the jury to
determine without giving it due consideration in the assessment
of the probative value of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>     c) the extent to which the matters it tends to prove
     are at issue in the proceedings</pre>
    <pre>[42]  This  factor, in essence, measures the extent to which  the
proposed  evidence is material to the case.  In this  trial,  the
credibility of the complainant's evidence was very much at issue.
Hence,  evidence  in  support of her credibility  would  be  very
material  to  the case.  It is therefore arguable  that,  in  the
balancing  process,  this factor favoured the  admission  of  the
proposed  evidence, in so far as it could be  supportive  of  the
complainant&#146;s  testimony.  As I have already indicated,  however,
the  proposed evidence in this case did not provide much  support
for the complainant&#146;s testimony.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Potential Prejudice</pre>
    <pre>          a) the extent to which it may support an inference
          of guilt based solely on bad character</pre>
    <pre>[43]  Given that the probative value of this evidence was so low,
there was a very high likelihood of pure propensity reasoning  in
this   case.   The  only  true  similarity  between   the   prior
discreditable conduct and the conduct alleged by the  complainant
was  the  fact  that  the accused was uncaring,  insensitive  and
violent  in  his  sexual  behaviour. It  was  essentially  purely
propensity evidence.  There was almost no other use to which  the
evidence could be put.  In fact, the trial judge&#146;s charge to  the
jury brings this into sharp focus where he states, &quot;[I]f you find
that  Handy enjoyed forcing anal and vaginal sex upon his ex-wife
in circumstances accompanied by pain and continuing in spite of a
request  to stop, that conduct may assist you in determining  the
truth  of  Ms. Story's allegations as to what happened  to  her.&quot;
This  charge  tells the jury to base its findings on whether  the
appellant  was  the type of person who &quot;enjoyed&quot;  sexual  assault
rather  than  on  whether  the  conduct  with  his  ex-wife   was
sufficiently  similar  and  probative  so  as  to   bolster   the
complainant's  credibility.  Hence, this evidence showed  nothing
more  than  the  propensity  of the appellant  to  commit  sexual
assaults and was highly prejudicial.</pre>
    <pre>          b)  the extent to which it may confuse issues</pre>
    <pre>[44]  There  was also a very real possibility that  admission  of
this  evidence would cause the jury to confuse the  issues.   The
main  issue  before them was the credibility of the  complainant,
specifically as it related to the issue of consent.   There  were
many  difficulties with respect to her own credibility that I  do
not  find necessary to describe for the purpose of this analysis.
The  jury was now faced with assessing the credibility of another
witness  with respect to seven other incidents. The  issues  were
further complicated by the fact that the witness with respect  to
these  seven  incidents  was  one  whose  credibility  was   also
seriously  in  issue.   The jury may well have  spent  more  time
determining   Ms.   Byrne's  credibility  than  determining   the
credibility of the complainant.</pre>
    <pre>         c) the accused's ability to respond to the evidence</pre>
    <pre>[45]  Many of the incidents alleged by Ms. Byrne dated back quite
a  number  of  years. With these incidents before the  jury,  the
appellant was now forced to, in effect, stand for trial on  eight
incidents  instead of one in circumstances where his  ability  to
respond  to  the  allegations was necessarily restricted  by  the
passage of time.</pre>
    <pre>     CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[46] For these reasons, it is my view that the probative value of
Ms. Byrne&#146;s evidence was slight and could not overcome its highly
prejudicial  effect. Hence, it should not have been  admitted  at
trial. This error necessitates a new trial.
[47]  In  light  of  my  finding  that  this  evidence  was   not
admissible, the second alternative ground of appeal with  respect
to the correctness of the jury charge becomes moot.
[48] I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction, and order a
new trial.</pre>
