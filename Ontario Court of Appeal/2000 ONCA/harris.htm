                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
[1]   The husband seeks a stay of the order of Lalonde J. pending
appeal.   The appeal has been perfected and will be heard  within
the  next  few  months  in the normal course.   It  may  also  be
expedited, if appropriate, upon application.
[2]  The matter arises from a separation agreement signed in 1990
containing a non variation of support clause and an agreed
equalization payment to be made to the wife over time.
[3]  The husband unilaterally reduced the support he was paying
for the agreed $5,000 per month to $2,000 per month in January
1998, and brought a variation application in the General
Division, now the Superior Court, in January 1999.  In the
meantime, the wife sought to enforce the separation agreement in
the Provincial Court and agreed to adjourn that matter until the
hearing of the variation application on terms that the husband
pay $2,000 per month until the decision of the enforcement
application, or until the General Division varied the support.
[4]  Lalonde J. rejected the husband&#146;s variation application and
ordered the support to stay at $5,000 per month, fixed the
arrears and ordered the company to assign a second mortgage on a
cottage property to the wife.  The husband&#146;s current wife is the
mortgagor.
[5]   The case of Circuit World v. Lesperance (1997), 33 O.R.
(3d) 674 O.C.A. sets out the test for imposing a stay pending
appeal at pp. 676-7, including a serious question to be tried,
irreparable harm to the applicant/appellant and balance of
convenience.
[6]  In my view, this is not a case for a stay.  The main point
of irreparable harm relied on by counsel for the husband was that
the wife may sell the property under Power of Sale prior to the
hearing of the appeal if there is default under the second
mortgage.  However, the payment of $25,000 due on April 1st is to
be made in any event to the company and used by the husband to
pay the equalization payment to the wife.  There is no suggestion
that there will be default by Mrs. Sharon Harris in making that
payment, therefore, there is no stated risk of default.
[7]  With respect to the amount of support, the husband has
continued to pay $2,000 per month rather than $5,000, in effect
creating his own stay, on the basis that the Provincial Court
order anticipates that he will do so pending the outcome of an
appeal of the General Division order declining to vary the
support.
[8]  In my view, there is no basis to interpret the Provincial
Court order in that way.  The order of the Superior Court is not
stayed by the rules and the appellant should be complying with
that order unless this court orders a stay on the husband&#146;s
application.  This conduct of the husband is consistent with the
finding of Lalonde J. in his reasons and militates against
granting him equitable relief.  The balance of convenience
favours the respondent.  I have concerns about the merits of the
appeal as they have been reviewed in court today but, as set out
in Lesperance, I put less emphasis on that part of the test than
on the others already referred to.
[9]  I therefore decline to order a stay of the order of Lalonde
J.  The respondent asks for security for costs of the appeal in
the amount of $10,000 including solicitor-and-client costs of the
appeal and of this motion.  I am not prepared to order security.
It is not clear that the husband&#146;s property would not be
sufficient to cover a further $10,000 if necessary.  The appeal
should be heard shortly if it goes ahead.  The husband will have
to comply with the order of Lalonde J. in the interim as well as
pay to the respondent her costs of this motion fixed at
$2,000.00.</pre></td>
