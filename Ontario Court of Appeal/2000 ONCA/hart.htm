    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction by Madam Justice M. P. Eberhard,
sitting with a jury, on October 13, 1995 and from the sentence
imposed on December 8, 1995
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LABROSSE J.A.:</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted on twenty-two counts which arose
out  of  three  sets  of  offences.  The counts  dealt  with  the
general  activities  of the appellant in the Orillia  region  and
related to the theft and possession of explosives, the causing of
an  explosion of a bank and threats against a judge and a  police
headquarters.  He pled guilty to seven of the counts relating  to
the theft and possession offences.
[2]  The appellant, who has abandoned his appeal from the
convictions arising out of the explosion of the bank, challenges
the remaining convictions on the basis that the charge to the
jury was inadequate with respect to (1) the manner in which the
jury should assess the evidence (a &#147;Miller&#148;error), (2) the
requirement of unanimity and (3) the concept of reasonable doubt
(a &#147;Lifchus error&#148;).  The appellant challenges six of the
convictions on the basis of (4) an error in jury instructions on
recent possession and (5) unreasonable verdict.  The appellant
also challenges the seven convictions on which he pled guilty, as
well as two other counts, on the basis that (6) his entrapment
application was improperly curtailed.
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   The Miller error</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The instruction to the jury, relating to the manner in which
evidence  is  to be assessed, was less than perfect,  keeping  in
mind  that  the instruction was given some four years  after  the
decision  of  this court in R. v. Miller (1991), 68  C.C.C.  517.
However,   the   Miller  error  is  tempered  by   two   specific
instructions  given by the trial judge after her  instruction  on
pooling the evidence.  The jury was instructed to consider all of
the  evidence in order to determine if the Crown had  proved  its
case  beyond a reasonable doubt.  The jury was also warned  about
approaching  the  evaluation  of  the  evidence  in  a  piecemeal
fashion.   Furthermore,  this was not a  case  where  exculpatory
evidence   had   to  be  considered.   In  these   circumstances,
considering  the  charge as a whole, we  are  not  persuaded  the
Miller  error  would have left the jury with the impression  that
only the evidence accepted as true and reliable could be used  on
the application of reasonable doubt.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   The unanimity requirement</pre>
    <pre>[4]   As seen in many of the cases where an error is said to have
been  made on the meaning of unanimity, the instruction  in  this
case  did  not exclude the right of jurors to disagree  upon  the
verdict.   On the contrary, the instruction specifically referred
to  the  right  to  disagree: &#147;It is  your  right  as  jurors  to
disagree,  but  I  know  you will do your  best  to  come  to  an
agreement.&#148;  Accordingly, the jurors would not have thought  that
they were under an obligation to agree upon a verdict.
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   The Lifchus error</pre>
    <pre>[5]  On the meaning of reasonable doubt, the trial judge used two
phrases  that  were disapproved of in Lifchus.  The  decision  in
Lifchus  was rendered two years after the present case.  However,
the  trial  judge also used much of the phraseology  approved  in
that  decision.  The instruction used by the trial judge conforms
with  similar instructions which have been held, by  this  court,
not  to give rise to a reversible error.  In our view, on reading
the  charge  as  a whole, the jury would not have  been  under  a
misapprehension as to the correct standard of proof.
          </pre>
    <pre>          4.   The recent possession instruction</pre>
    <pre>[6]   As a result of a question from the jury relating to one  of
the  counts  (the Hydro break-in) the trial judge  recharged  the
jury.  She adequately explained the doctrine of recent possession
and  reviewed the evidence relating to that count.  In our  view,
there  was  no  real risk that the jury would  have  misused  the
doctrine  of  recent  possession  in  relation  to  other   theft
offences.  In any event, we would have no hesitation in  applying
s. 686 (1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code on this issue.
          </pre>
    <pre>          5.   Unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  ground of appeal based on unreasonable verdict relates
to  the threatening charges.  The jury was properly instructed on
the  correct  approach to their assessment of the nature  of  the
appellant&#146;s  comments.  There was evidence which could  form  the
proper basis for the finding that the threats had been made.  The
verdict   is   one  that  a  properly  instructed  jury,   acting
judicially, could reasonably have rendered.
          </pre>
    <pre>          6.   Improper curtailment of entrapment application</pre>
    <pre>[8]   While  the  trial  judge was in error  in  restricting  her
consideration  of  entrapment to the evidence  heard  during  the
trial,  we  are not persuaded that the appellant was deprived  of
the  ability to properly prove entrapment.  Both at trial and  on
the   entrapment  hearing,  the  appellant  provided  his   views
extensively as to why he alleged entrapment.  It is hard  to  see
what  more he could have said on that issue.  Even if these views
were not considered by the trial judge, we would do so, and apply
the proviso.  In addition, in our view, the exclusion of what was
said  from  consideration would not have affected the disposition
of  this  issue. Moreover, the evidence did not demonstrate  that
the  conduct of the police officer had gone beyond normal  police
activities in an undercover operation.  There was a proper basis,
on  the  evidence, for the trial judge&#146;s conclusion  that  &#147;never
have  I  heard  evidence so compelling of an  individual  with  a
demonstrated  and  stated desire to commit criminal  offences  in
general, and including the type of &#148; offences in question.
[9]  We would, accordingly, dismiss the appeal against
conviction.  It should be said that the case against the
appellant was overwhelming and we see no basis to doubt the
correctness of the verdict.
[10] The appellant was sentenced to twelve years&#146; imprisonment.
In detailed reasons for sentence, the trial judge recognized all
the relevant principles and found that the most important factor,
in this case, was the need to protect the public from the
appellant&#146;s dangerous fascination with explosives.  We do not
agree that she failed to give sufficient weight to the principle
of totality.  Although the appellant had never received a
penitentiary sentence, he was no stranger to the judicial system.
Given the seriousness of some of the offences, which included
threats to life and property, which the trial judge found to be
striking at the heart of the administration of justice, and an
act of destruction of property, a lengthy sentence was required.
While the total sentence may be at the high end of the range for
these types of offences, we see no error which would justify
interference by this court.
[11] Leave to appeal the sentence is granted and this appeal is
also dismissed.</pre>
