    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Meehan J. dated February

    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T

    <pre>[1]   Although we had the benefit of thoughtful and extensive
submissions from both counsel, we are of the view that the
disposition of this appeal turns on a very narrow issue, namely,
did the Court of Appeal in its 1996 judgment deal with the
conviction for unlawful confinement?  The appellant conceded that
if it did, this panel has no jurisdiction to grant a remedy.
[2]  The unanimous judgment of the court was by Goodman J.A.  In
his two concluding paragraphs, he stated:

          In so far as the conviction entered on count
          two with respect to the charge of confining
          the complainant without lawful authority
          contrary to the provisions of s.279(2) of the
          Code is concerned, the defence of accident
          did not apply and the misdirection with
          respect to this defence is irrelevant to the
          conviction registered by the jury in this
          count.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the
          appeal against this conviction.
          In view of the disposition of the appeal
          which I would make with respect to the
          conviction on the other two counts, I would
          remove the stay of the conviction on the
          unlawful confinement charge entered by the
          trial judge on the Kienapple principle and
          remit the matter of sentencing on this charge
          to the trial judge.

[3]  In our view, it is clear from these paragraphs that the
court directed its mind to the disposition of the unlawful
confinement offence and purported to enter a conviction.
[4]  In these circumstances, we have no jurisdiction to entertain
an appeal to review a matter already dealt with by another panel
of this court.  Any alleged error in that panel&#146;s judgment could
be remedied only by seeking leave from the Supreme Court of
Canada.
[5]  The appeal is therefore dismissed.</pre></td>
