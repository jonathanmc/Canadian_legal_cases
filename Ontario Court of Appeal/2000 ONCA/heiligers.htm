[1]     We   have  not  been  persuaded  that  the  trial   judge
misapprehended the evidence in any way that affected his findings
of fact.  There was ample evidence to support the convictions for
aggravated assault and assault with a weapon.  As to the  offence
of  possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the  public
peace,  we  do not read the reasons for judgment as imposing  any
duty  on the appellant to stop his co-accused.  Rather, the trial
judge  was  satisfied that the appellant and his co-accused  were
engaged in a joint venture and that the appellant had formed  the
requisite intent at the time the co-accused took up the bat.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
