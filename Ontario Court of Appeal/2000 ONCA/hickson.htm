    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Samuel H. Murphy dated
March 30, 1998</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT

</strong>                                
[1]  The appellants appeal two judgments of Murphy J.
[2]   Action  No.  3430/94 (C30746), the main  action  by  Harold
Dickson (the &quot;husband&quot;) against the Ontario Milk Marketing  Board
and  Elizabeth Hickson (the &quot;wife&quot;), was settled prior to  trial.
On  her  counterclaim, the wife was awarded judgment for  $18,500
together  with  pre-judgment interest against  Roy  Hickson,  her
father-in-law,  and  $7,700 together with  pre-judgment  interest
against her husband.
[3]   In  action  No.  71203/96 (C30748), the  wife  was  granted
judgment  for  $91,863.43 against the husband,  representing  the
equalization payment between them.
[4]  The trial judge ordered that these amounts be paid out of
monies paid into court from the sale of the milk quota.
[5]  In the first action, the amount of $18,500 was advanced by
the wife on the belief that the partnership plans between the
husband, the wife, and Roy Hickson would go through.  The trial
judge drew the inference that it served to reduce the mortgage on
Roy Hickson's property.  The basis on which this payment was made
and the resulting benefit to Roy Hickson, together with the
manner in which the farm account was used, constituted a proper
basis for the repayment by Roy Hickson to the wife.
[6]  As to the amount of $7,700, the evidence supports the
finding that loans were made and would be repaid with interest.
We see no error.
[7]  With respect to the second action, there is a proper basis
in the evidence to support the trial judge's valuation of assets
and the equalization payment.  The husband now claims an unequal
division of assets. The husband did not claim for an unequal
division of assets in his pleadings.  Moreover, at trial the
husband did not dispute the equalization of net family assets.
This argument did not surface until after the parties had closed
their case.  We see no basis for allowing this late argument.
[8]  Finally, it was entirely proper for the trial judge to order
that the judgments be paid out of the monies paid into court.
[9]  Accordingly, the appeals are dismissed with costs.
