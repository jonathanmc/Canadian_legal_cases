    <pre><strong>               David E. Buckman
               for the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         February 17, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Mr. Justice Atwood on
September 9, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>Catzman and Abella JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  We are mindful of the requirement to be deferential, but the
sentence cannot stand in this case.  The sentencing judge took
exaggerated account of remorse and family history, and
underemphasized the seriousness of the offence and the severity
of the injuries.  He also appeared not to have taken sufficient
account of the length of the respondent&#146;s record as well as the
fact that he had previously received lengthy periods of
incarceration. In essence, the role of denunciation and general
deterrence was insufficiently considered, making this sentence
demonstrably unfit.
[2]  Leave to appeal sentence is granted.  The appeal is allowed
and the sentence increased to one of 18 months less the four
months&#146; credit given by the sentencing judge resulting in a
sentence of 14 months.  The order for probation remains.</pre>
    <pre><strong>MacPherson J.A. (dissenting):</strong></pre>
    <pre>[3]  Although I think that the sentence imposed by the trial
judge was at the low end of the range of possible sentences for
this type of offence, I cannot say that the trial judge erred in
his consideration of the relevant principles of sentencing or
that the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit.
[4]  I will dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Catzman J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  I have endorsed the appeal book: &#147;For reasons given orally
this day, the appeal is allowed and the sentence is increased to
that of 14 months.  We do not interfere with the period of
probation.&#148;
