</strong>[1]   The  appellant was convicted on December 4, 1997 by  Madame
Justice  Métivier  of  sexual assault and  sexual  touching.   He
appeals his conviction.
[2]  The appellant raises the following five grounds of appeal:</pre>
    <pre>     1.   Unreasonable verdict</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The trial judge was clearly aware of the inconsistencies  in
the complainant's evidence relating to the sexual abuse incidents
and  disclosures.  The trial judge made a detailed review of  the
inconsistencies in the complainant's evidence and the details  of
disclosure.   In  the end, the trial judge concluded  that  these
inconsistencies  were  not  meaningful  and  she   accepted   the
complainant's evidence.
[4]  On this issue, it is appropriate for this court to consider
that the appellant did not testify at trial.
[5]  In our view, the verdict is not unreasonable.</pre>
    <pre>     2.   Improper reliance on demeanour</pre>
    <pre>[6]   The  trial judge considered the age of the complainant  and
the effect of the passage of time on her memory.  As noted above,
the trial judge made a detailed review of the inconsistencies  in
the complainant's evidence and of the details of the disclosures.
The  trial  judge noted that the complainant was  susceptible  to
suggestions.   However,  she also found  that  the  complainant's
evidence was confirmed on several material points.
[7]  This ground of appeal has no merit.</pre>
    <pre>     3.   Improper requirement that appellant prove motive to fabricate</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The defence raised the issue of motive to fabricate and thus
the  trial judge dealt with it.  However, the trial judge did not
rely  on  her  findings  on  this issue  to  reach  her  ultimate
decision. She properly focused on all of the evidence to  convict
the appellant.
[9]  We see no indication that the trial judge reversed the
burden of proof.</pre>
    <pre>     4.   Improper use of prior consistent statement</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  strategy  of  the  defence  throughout  trial  was  to
highlight  the  inconsistencies in the complainant's  statements.
The  prior  statements  were  introduced  without  objection  and
defence  counsel cross-examined the complainant on the statements
at length.
[11] We see no indication that the trial judge made improper use
of this evidence in her conclusion to convict the appellant.</pre>
    <pre>     5.   Refusal to grant an adjournment</pre>
    <pre>[12]  On this record we see no basis to interfere with the  trial
judge's exercise of discretion in refusing to grant an additional
adjournment  of  the sentencing more than four months  after  the
appellant  was convicted.  In addition, counsel for the appellant
did   not   make  clear  the  purpose  for  seeking  yet  another
adjournment  except to say that he did not have a  transcript  of
the  proceedings.   We  note  that  counsel  filed  no  affidavit
material in support of this ground of appeal.
[13] The appeal is dismissed.
