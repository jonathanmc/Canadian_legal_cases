    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Wright dated June 16, 1999</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T

</strong>                                
[1]   The  appellants,  Bank of Montreal and  Young,  appeal  the
decision of Wright J. (the motions judge) dismissing a motion  to
strike  the  statement of claim and granting a motion  dismissing
its third-party notice.  The third party, RBC Dominion Securities
Ltd.  (&quot;RBC&quot;),  cross-appeals against that part of  the  judgment
dismissing the motion to strike the statement of claim.
[2]  In 1995, the respondents (the plaintiffs) suffered
substantial damages through the improper cancellation of certain
share certificates.  As a result, the respondents commenced an
action against the predecessor to the third party RBC claiming
damages for the loss of its shares.  During the course of this
action, the plaintiffs obtained information implicating the
appellants, Bank of Montreal and its employee Young (the &quot;Bank&quot;)
in the loss of its shares.
[3]  On January 23, 1998, the respondents and RBC settled that
action.  A full and final release was duly executed.  The
respondent agreed, inter alia, not to make any claim against &quot;any
other person, or corporation, who might claim contribution or
indemnity from the Release by virtue of the said claim or
proceeding&quot;.
[4]  In October 1998, the respondents commenced a second action
claiming damages against the Bank, which in turn issued a third-
party claim against RBC seeking contribution and indemnity.  RBC
brought a motion to strike the statement of claim or, in the
alternative, to strike the third-party claim.
[5]  The motions judge dismissed the motion to strike the
statement of claim and struck out the appellant's third-party
notice.
[6]  It was conceded at the outset of this hearing that if the
appeal from the order striking the third-party notice is
dismissed, the cross-appeal is moot.
[7]  We agree with the decision of the motions judge to strike
the third-party claim.
[8]  In this action, the statement of claim  expressly limits the
damages sought to &quot;the portion of the damages the plaintiffs
experienced which can be attributed to the Bank's negligence &#133;&quot;.
[9]  As the statement of claim is limited to the damages which
can be attributed to the fault of the Bank, the Bank can have no
claim-over against RBC with respect to these damages.
Sections 1, 2 or 5 of the Negligence Act do not assist the
appellants.
[10] Moreover, since the damages claimed are limited to those
attributable solely to the Bank's negligence, RBC could not be
liable for all or any part of the respondents' claim within the
meaning of rule 29.01(a) or (b). To be successful at trial, the
respondents will have to show not only some fault on the part of
the Bank but the extent of that fault.
[11] The motions judge did not err by refusing to exercise his
discretion to permit the third-party claim to stand so that the
Bank could obtain declaratory relief.  On the facts of this case,
there can be no prejudice to the Bank from this decision.  It was
conceded on appeal that the Bank was not seeking declaratory
relief.
[12] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
