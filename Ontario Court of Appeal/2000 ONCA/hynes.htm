               (Respondent)</strong></pre>

    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Alec M. Hynes
               in person</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               Laurie Lacelle
               for the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         April 6, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Justice J.B. Allen dated June 11, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</strong>[1]  The Crown appeal must succeed.
[2]  The indication in the Crown charge screening form that the
Crown would proceed summarily on the assault charge was an
administrative error.  The charge had been laid outside the
limitation period applicable to summary proceedings.  The
indication of the Crown&#146;s intention in the charge screening form
was not an election by the Crown.
[3]  The Crown&#146;s subsequent decision to proceed by indictment
caused no prejudice or hardship to the accused, much less the
level of prejudice or hardship that would justify a stay of
proceedings.  This is particularly true given the fact that the
Crown offered to proceed summarily if the accused was prepared to
give the required consent.
[4]  The principles set down by this court in R. v. Belair
(1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 329 and R. v. Kelly (1998), 128 C.C.C.
(3d) 207 were applicable.  The contrary authority, R. v.
Boutilier (1995), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 329 (N.S.C.A.), relied on by
Justice Allen was specifically rejected in R. v. Kelly.
[5]  The appeal must be allowed, and the stay of proceedings set
aside.  The matter is remitted to the Ontario Court of Justice.</pre></td>
