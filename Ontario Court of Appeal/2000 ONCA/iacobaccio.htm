	   Defendant/Respondent on Appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:     February 15, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>     On appeal from the order and judgment of MacKinnon J. dated 
                         July 29, 1999
                                </strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  We recognize that the appellant is asserting a personal
claim against the City of Barrie for his loss of income while an
employee of Ruanne&#146;s Restaurant Inc. which is now a bankrupt
company and that he is not purporting to assert a claim on behalf
of that company.  Nevertheless, we are satisfied that as pleaded,
the appellant has no cause of action against the City of Barrie
in his personal capacity.
[2]   Although we are not in complete agreement with the reasons
of the motions judge for dismissing the plaintiff&#146;s claim, we
agree with the result.
[3]  Therefore, the appeal is dismissed with costs.  The cross-
appeal is quashed without costs.</pre>
