    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Wilkins J. dated January 9, 1996</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MACPHERSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>INTRODUCTION
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The central issue in this appeal is the relationship between
corporate and personal liability in the field of investment
advice.  This court has considered the relationship between
corporate and personal liability on a number of recent occasions:
see, for example, Scotia McLeod Inc. v. Peoples Jewellers Ltd.
(1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.); Adga Systems International Ltd.
v. Valcom Ltd. (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 101 (C.A.); Meditrust
Healthcare Inc. v. Shoppers Drug Mart (1999), 124 O.A.C. 137;
460635 Ontario Ltd. v. 1002953 Ontario Inc. (1999), 127 O.A.C.
48; and NBD Bank, Canada v. Dofasco Inc. (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 514
(C.A.).
[2]  In this appeal, the issue of the relationship between
corporate and personal liability arises in a pleadings context.
Specifically, what are the requirements for pleadings alleging
personal liability against a corporate director and officer in a
case where the formal legal arrangements were clearly between two
corporate entities?</pre>
    <pre>A.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre> (1)  The parties and events</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant Pretiosa Enterprises Limited (&#147;Pretiosa&#148;) and
the respondent Immocreek Corporation (&#147;Immocreek&#148;) entered into a
written agreement on October 18, 1997 under which Immocreek
retained Pretiosa  to manage a portion of its investments on a
discretionary basis.  The appellant Rudolf Stoll (&#147;Stoll&#148;) was a
director, officer and shareholder of Pretiosa.  He had negotiated
the contract on behalf of Pretiosa with Dieter Lissmann
(&#147;Lissmann&#148;) who was the principal of Immocreek.
[4]  Stoll had developed a technical investment tool utilizing a
computer programme which was being marketed by Pretiosa under the
name of the Stoll Monument System.  It was understood by the
parties that Pretiosa would employ this system in making
investment decisions on Immocreek&#146;s behalf.
[5]  The contract between Pretiosa and Immocreek is a very
concise document - four paragraphs on a single page.  The two
paragraphs that are relevant on this appeal provide:          </pre>
    <pre>          Management  fees are due and payable  at  the
          end  of  each quarter and/or at the  time  of
          termination.  Should during one  quarter  the
          management result be negative, fees are  only
          calculated   after  surpassing  level   where
          previous profit participation was based upon.      </pre>
    <pre>                              &#133;..                                </pre>
    <pre>          Pretiosa  Enterprises Ltd. does not guarantee
          that  any  investment(s)  will  result  in  a
          profit.  All investments based on our  system
          are  at  the  sole  risk of  the  client  and
          Pretiosa Enterprises Ltd. does not assume any
          responsibility.      
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  The contract was in force from October 18, 1987 to March 16,
1990. During that time, Pretiosa made two sets of investments
which ultimately gave rise to this litigation.  One set of
investments related to what the parties called &#147;Delta shares&#148;.
This was an investment in a small private start-up company which
was promoting the production of a revolutionary new type of
motor.
[7]  The second set of investments was a series of purchases of
shares in Campeau Corporation in the autumn of 1989.  The
purchases were as follows:      </pre>
    <pre>     September 21, 1989    5000  shares  at $14.50 each
     September  22, 1989   3000  shares  at $13.50 each
     October 26, 1989      5000  shares  at $8.75 each
     October  27, 1989     5000  shares  at $7.25 each
     November  23,  1989   2000  shares  at $5.375 each
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Both the Delta and the Campeau investments were disastrous.
The private company promoting the revolutionary new motor was a
complete sham.  Immocreek lost the entire $67,500 Pretiosa
invested on its behalf in the &#147;Delta shares&#148;.  Immocreek also
lost a substantial amount of money on the Campeau investment; in
essence, Pretiosa purchased Campeau shares at precisely the
period when Campeau Corporation was sliding into oblivion.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The litigation</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Immocreek commenced an action against Pretiosa and Stoll in
1991.  Initially, the action was limited to the &#147;Delta shares&#148;
transactions. Immocreek sought recovery of damages of $100,000
for breach of contract, negligence  and negligent
misrepresentation.
[10] Later, Immocreek amended its Statement of Claim and sought
recovery of $167,807 which it claimed it lost on the Campeau
shares transactions.  The stated legal basis for this additional
claim was breach of contract.
[11] Pretiosa and Stoll defended the action.  On the question of
Stoll&#146;s personal liability, the Statement of Defence provided:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>3.  The Defendant, Stoll states that he never acted in 
    his personal capacity with respect to his transactions 
    involving the Plaintiff and at all times acted on 
    behalf of the Defendant, Pretiosa Enterprises Inc.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12] Pretiosa also made a counterclaim against Immocreek, seeking
$160,000 for unpaid management fees and $50,000 on profit sharing
and quantum meruit bases respecting two other transactions
unrelated to the Delta and Campeau transactions.
[13] The matter came on for trial before Wilkins J.  The trial
lasted ten days.  On January 9, 1996, Wilkins J. released his
judgment.  He dismissed all of Immocreek&#146;s claims arising out of
the &#147;Delta shares&#148; transactions, principally on the basis that
Lissmann, the principal of Immocreek, was fully aware of the
risky nature of the investment and approved it in any event.
[14] With respect to the Campeau shares transactions, the trial
judge dismissed Immocreek&#146;s claims relating to the two September
1989 purchases.  However, he found in favour of Immocreek in
relation to the three purchases of Campeau shares made by
Pretiosa in October and November 1989.  The trial judge reasoned:     </pre>
    <pre>          I am satisfied that although the 8,000 shares
          in  Campeau  purchased in September  may  not
          have been purchased under circumstances which
          might  have constituted a breach of  contract
          or  a  breach  of the fiduciary relationship,
          the continued retention of those shares based
          upon a partial and wholly inadequate analysis
          of the investment circumstances constituted a
          breach  of contract by Pretiosa and a  breach
          of  the  fiduciary  duties  owing  from  both
          defendants  to the plaintiff.   In  my  view,
          Stoll ought properly to have embarked upon  a
          full  analysis  of  the fundamentals  of  the
          corporation and it was wholly inadequate  for
          him to have based his investment decision  on
          a  partial  review of some  of  the  concepts
          related to that form of analysis.          </pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..                                </pre>
    <pre>          In   making  the  purchases  of  October  and
          November, Stoll and Pretiosa acted in  breach
          of   their   fiduciary  responsibilities   to
          Immocreek  and,  as a consequence,  they  are
          responsible  for  the losses  which  were  so
          incurred.  [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[15] With respect to Pretiosa&#146;s counterclaim, the trial judge
dismissed it in relation to the profit sharing and quantum meruit
claims relating to the non-Delta and non-Campeau transactions.
However, he allowed the counterclaim on the management fee issue.
On that issue, the trial judge said:

          Having  regard to the conduct of Lissmann  on
          the subject of the preparation of statements,
          it, in my view, little behooves Immocreek  to
          complain  about the absence of statements  of
          account from Pretiosa during the currency  of
          the contractual agreement.              </pre>
    <pre>                                &#133;..          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;  Having regard to the confusion surrounding
          the   preparation   of   accounts   and   the
          differences  of  opinion between  Dutoit  and
          Stoll,  it  is not unreasonable for  Pretiosa
          not  to  have rendered accounts until matters
          could be straightened out.          </pre>
    <pre>          This was not a circumstance where the failure
          to create statements or accounts rendered the
          calculation   of   the  amounts   owing   for
          management   fees   impossible.    The   bank
          statements were provided.  There was a method
          of calculating the management fees owing.  In
          essence,  all  that  was  missing   was   the
          rendering  of  a  document comparable  to  an
          invoice.     </pre>
    <pre>          Under the circumstances, I find that there is
          nothing in the conduct of the parties or  the
          communications between themselves to  suggest
          that  Pretiosa  would be paid  anything  less
          than  its  earned management fees other  than
          the  fact that Pretiosa surrendered any  fees
          for   management  of  the  plaintiff&#146;s  money
          between  November  1, 1987  and  January  30,
          1988.    The  contract  provided   that   the
          management  fees  would be  due  and  payable
          quarterly.   There was no provision  in  that
          document   for  the  rendering  of   specific
          invoices  nor was there any requirement  that
          there  be  statements rendered. Good business
          practice might suggest that the rendering  of
          a  statement  and an invoice  would  be  more
          likely  to evoke payment than the failure  to
          do  so but, in my view, the failure to render
          the statements and provide invoices in no way
          constituted  a  variation of the  contractual
          terms  or  an abandonment of the  claims  for
          such fees as earned on a quarterly basis.          </pre>
    <pre>          Having  regard  to  the  above  finding,  the
          defendant shall be entitled to recover on its
          counterclaim the amount of fees  pursuant  to
          the   provisions  of  the  written   contract
          demonstrated  to  be owing from  January  31,
          1988 until March 16, 1990.</pre>
    <pre>[16] In the result, the formal judgment of the court ordered both
Pretiosa and Stoll to pay Immocreek damages and pre-judgment
interest of $123,442.50. On the other hand, the court ordered
Immocreek to pay Pretiosa $48,358 representing management fees
and pre-judgment interest thereon.
[17] With respect to the main action, Immocreek chose not to
appeal the components of the trial judge&#146;s decision relating to
the &#147;Delta shares&#148; and to the two September purchases of Campeau
shares.  Initially, both Pretiosa and Stoll appealed the trial
judge&#146;s decision relating to the Campeau shares.  However, at the
appeal hearing Pretiosa abandoned its appeal, leaving only
Stoll&#146;s appeal on this matter.
[18] With respect to the counterclaim, Pretiosa chose not to
appeal the trial judge&#146;s decision respecting the profit sharing
and quantum meruit claims relating to non-Delta and non-Campeau
transactions.  However, Immocreek appealed from the trial judge&#146;s
decision that it owed Pretiosa management fees for the January
31, 1988 &#150; March 16, 1990 period.</pre>
    <pre>B.   ISSUES</pre>
    <pre>[19] There are two issues, one arising from the appeal and the
other from the cross-appeal:</pre>
    <pre>1.   Did the trial judge err in concluding that the defendant
     Stoll was personally liable to Immocreek for breach of
     fiduciary duty concerning the October and November Campeau
     shares transactions?</pre>
    <pre>2.  Did the trial judge err in concluding that Immocreek was
     contractually bound to pay management fees to Pretiosa for
     the January 31, 1988 &#150; March 16, 1990 period?</pre>
    <pre>C.   ANALYSIS  </pre>
    <pre>(1)     The personal liability issue</pre>
    <pre>[20] The trial judge found that the corporate defendant Pretiosa
was liable for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty
with respect to the Campeau shares transactions.  Pretiosa
initially appealed this component of the trial judge&#146;s decision,
but abandoned this ground of appeal at the appeal hearing.  In my
view, this late decision by Pretiosa was wise.  On the record
before the trial judge, his conclusion that Pretiosa breached its
contract with Immocreek was sound.
[21] The trial judge also held that the personal defendant Stoll
was liable to Immocreek on the Campeau shares issue.  However,
his conclusion on this issue was grounded only in breach of
fiduciary duty.  Stoll appeals this component of the trial
judge&#146;s decision.  Stoll&#146;s principal argument is that Immocreek
did not set out this basis for liability in its pleadings and,
therefore, the trial judge erred in relying on it as the legal
basis on which to attach liability to Stoll.
[22] When Immocreek commenced its action against both Pretiosa
and Stoll, it initially claimed only in relation to the &#147;Delta
shares&#148; transactions.  There was nothing in the original
Statement of Claim about the Campeau shares transactions. Later,
Immocreek amended its Statement of Claim to introduce a claim
relating to the Campeau shares.  The new paragraphs in the
Amended Statement of Claim relating to this issue provided:
</pre>
    <pre>     1.(e) Damages   in   the  amount   of  $167,807.00  
	   representing  the   loss  suffered  by   the  
	   Plaintiff on the sale of shares  of  Campeau
	   Corporation  purchased  on  behalf   of  the  
	   Plaintiff    by   the   Defendant   Pretiosa
           Enterprises  Inc. in breach of the  contract
           dated November 1, 1987;</pre>
    <pre>                               &#133;..
                                </pre>
    <pre>     26.   The  defendant Pretiosa purchased  the  said
           shares  in  negligent  b     reach  of   its
           contract  with  the  plaintiff  wherein   it
           undertook    to    follow   a   conservative
           investment   policy  designed   to   achieve
           growth   and  income  without  the  use   of
           leverage.
               </pre>
    <pre>     27.   At   all   materials  times,  the  defendant
           Pretiosa  knew or ought to have  known  that
           the   investment   in  Campeau   Corporation
           shares  was  contrary to the  terms  of  the
           said agreement.
      </pre>
    <pre>     28.   At   all   material  times,  the   defendant
           Pretiosa  knew or ought to have  known  that
           the   purchase  of  Campeau  shares  in  the
           period  from  September  to  November,  1989
           constituted      speculative      aggressive
           investment  in  a volatile and unpredictable
           market.
      </pre>
    <pre>     29.   In  the  period from September to  November,
           1989  investor  reports  available  to   the
           defendant   Pretiosa  warned   against   the
           purchase  or  holding of Campeau  shares  by
           anyone  other  than  speculative  aggressive
           sophisticated  investors who  were  prepared
           to  suffer  substantial loss in  return  for
           the possibility of gain.</pre>
    <pre>     30.   The defendant Pretiosa failed to advise  the
           plaintiff of  the  purchase  of these shares
           or the fact  that the value   of the  shares
           was decreasing on a weekly basis.</pre>
    <pre>     31.   The  defendant Pretiosa failed to  take  all
           necessary  steps to sell the said shares  on
           the   basis   of   the  market   information
           available to it and thereby reduce the  loss
           ultimately suffered by the plaintiff.</pre>
    <pre>     32.   As  a  result of the breach by the  Pretiosa
           of   the   investment  contract   with   the
           plaintiff, the plaintiff suffered  a  direct
           loss   of   $167,807.00  and  the   ultimate
           disposition  of the shares in the  month  of
           March, 1990.     
</pre>
    <pre>[23] Stoll contends that this pleading does not make out a proper
claim against him personally in two respects - there is nothing
about him in it, and there is nothing about breach of fiduciary
duty in it.  On either basis, he submits, the trial judge erred
in finding him personally liable to Immocreek.
[24] Immocreek concedes that these paragraphs in the Amended
Statement of Claim, standing alone, would not justify the
imposition of personal liability on Stoll.  However, Immocreek
contends that these paragraphs, coupled with some general
paragraphs from the original Statement of Claim, and one
paragraph from its Reply, are sufficient to capture Stoll.  The
additional paragraphs on which Immocreek relies are paragraphs 4-
7 of the Statement of Claim and paragraph 2 of the Reply.
</pre>
    <pre>                       STATEMENT OF CLAIM</pre>
    <pre>  4.   The defendant Rudolph Stoll (&#147;Stoll&#148;) was at all material
       times a Director, Officer and Shareholder of the defendant
       Pretiosa and the controlling mind and will of the said
       corporation.</pre>
    <pre>  5.   In or about the month of August or September, 1987 the
       plaintiff, through  its  shareholder, Dieter  Lissmann,
       entered  into  discussions  with  the  defendant Stoll
       on behalf of the defendant Pretiosa  with respect to 
       the management and investment by  the defendants of the
       funds of the plaintiff.       </pre>
    <pre>  6.   In the said discussions, the defendants specifically
       represented to the plaintiff that the management of the
       plaintiff&#146;s funds by the defendants would be based upon a
       conservative investment policy designed to achieve growth
       and income without the use of leverage.
     </pre>
    <pre>  7.   Acting in reliance upon the said representations, the
       plaintiff entered into an agreement with the defendant Pretiosa
       dated November 1, 1987 for the management by the defendants of
       the plaintiff&#146;s monies.
     </pre>
    <pre>     
                              REPLY
                                </pre>
    <pre>   2.   With  respect  to paragraph 3 of  the statement
        of  defence  the  plaintiff says  that  at  all
        material  times  the defendant  Stoll  was  the
        sole director, officer and shareholder and  was
        in  fact the controlling mind and will  of  the
        defendant  Pretiosa Enterprises Inc.  and  that
        he  personally  assured the plaintiff  that  he
        would  cause his company Pretiosa to  make  the
        conservative  investments referred  to  in  the
        statement of claim.     
</pre>
    <pre>[25] There is no question that in some circumstances the
relationship between a financial advisor and an investor can give
rise to a fiduciary duty on the part of the financial advisor:
see Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377.  In that case, the
breach of fiduciary duty was specifically pleaded by the
plaintiff: see also Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. v. Bartlet &amp;
Richardes (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 642 (Gen., Div.) aff&#146;d (1996), 28
O.R. (3d) 768 (C.A.).  The question is whether Immocreek&#146;s
pleadings in the present case were sufficient to permit the trial
judge to address this legal issue.</pre>
    <pre>(a)  Pleadings re Stoll</pre>
    <pre>[26] This court addressed the question of the personal liability
of officers and directors of corporations in four decisions in
1999: Adga Systems International Ltd. v. Valcom Ltd., supra;
Meditrust Healthcare Inc. v. Shoppers Drug Mart et al., supra;
460635 Ontario Ltd. v. 1002953 Ontario Inc. et al., supra; and
NDB Bank, Canada v. Dofasco Inc., supra.  In Meditrust Healthcare
Inc., Labrosse J.A. reviewed the leading authorities and stated,
at p. 141:          </pre>
    <pre>          [16]  In  ADGA,   Carthy J.A.  simply  relied
          upon the principles previously enunciated  by
          Finlayson   J.A.,   in  ScotiaMcLeod.    Both
          decisions  stand for the proposition  that  a
          claim  in tort may proceed against directors,
          officers  and  employees of corporations  for
          acts performed in the course of their duties,
          provided  that (1) the allegations  of  their
          personal   tortious  conduct   are   property
          pleaded and (2) the limited exception in Said
          v.  Butt, [1920] 3 K.B. 497, does not  apply.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[27] I refer also to 46035 Ontario Ltd. v. 1002953 Ontario Ltd.
which, in my view, is quite similar to the present appeal.  In
that case, there were alleged breaches of leases between the two
corporate parties.  This led to actions and cross-actions by both
sides against their respective corporations and against one
Kallinikos, the sole shareholder and director of 460635 Ltd.  The
only real issue on appeal was whether the trial judge erred in
holding Kallinikos personally liable on the basis of the
pleadings.  This court held that the trial judge had erred on
this issue.  Labrosse J.A. reasoned, at para. 8:      </pre>
    <pre>          In the  present case, it is not clear on  the
          face   of   the  statement  of   claim   that
          Kallinikos  was  being sued in  his  personal
          capacity.   The  allegations are  general  in
          nature:  they  are  against &#147;the  defendants&#148;
          (i.e.   460   and   John  Kallinikos).    The
          pleadings   did  not  allege  any  negligence
          against  Kallinikos  personally.   Where  the
          pleading  asserted that the defendants  acted
          tortiously,   they  did   not   assert   that
          Kallinikos  acted  in his personal  capacity.
          No  attempt  was  made in  the  pleadings  to
          single   out  Kallinikos&#146;  activity   as   an
          individual.   Pleadings  of  such  a  general
          nature cannot properly serve as the basis for
          an independent claim against Kallinkos in his
          personal  capacity.   In my  view,  &#145;properly
          pleaded&#146;  as it relates to personal liability
          of    corporate   directors,   officers   and
          employees   must  be  read  as  &#145;specifically
          pleaded&#146;,  a  separate claim must  be  stated
          against   the  individual  in  his   personal
          capacity. [Emphasis added.]     
</pre>
    <pre>[28] Applying Meditrust Healthcare Inc. and 460635 Ontario Ltd.,
I do not think that Immocreek has &#145;specifically pleaded&#146; against
Stoll in a fashion sufficient to permit a judge to assign
personal liability to him.  As in 460635 Ontario Ltd., some of
the Statement of Claim (e.g. paragraph 1) refers to &#147;the
defendants&#148; generally, without setting out any particulars of the
claim against Stoll personally.  Moreover, in the Amended
Statement of Claim, where paragraphs 26-32 were added to raise
Immocreek&#146;s claim relating to the Campeau shares, there is no
mention of Stoll.  Indeed, in these paragraphs the claim is made
explicitly and only against the corporate defendant Pretiosa.
[29] The only pleading that even hints at a potential basis for
personal liability against Stoll is paragraph 2 of the Reply,
delivered prior to the amended claim in respect of the Campeau
shares. Putting aside the oddity of a crucial allegation by a
plaintiff being raised for the first time in its Reply, the
actual substance of this paragraph &#150; the allegation that Stoll
&#147;personally assured the plaintiff that he would cause his company
Pretiosa to make the conservative investments referred to in the
statement of claim&#148; does not meet the standard of specificity of
pleadings enunciated by this court in its recent decisions.</pre>
    <pre>(b)    Pleadings re cause of action</pre>
    <pre>[30] There is a second fundamental problem with Immocreek&#146;s
pleadings.  Unlike the pleadings in Hodgkinson v. Simms, supra,
nowhere in Immocreek&#146;s pleadings is there a reference to breach
of fiduciary duty.  It needs to be recalled that in its initial
Statement of Claim Immocreek made no claim concerning the Campeau
shares transactions.  This claim was introduced through the
Amended Statement of Claim and is set out in some detail in
paragraphs 26-32.  The only legal basis for the claim in these
paragraphs is breach of contract.
[31] In Kalkinis (Litigation Guardian of) v. Allstate Insurance
Co. of Canada (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 at 533-34 (C.A.),
Finlayson J.A. said:</pre>
    <pre>          It has long been established that the parties
          to  a  legal  suit  are entitled  to  have  a
          resolution of their differences on the  basis
          of  the  issues joined in the pleadings:  see
          rule  25.06.  The trial judge cannot  make  a
          finding   of  liability  and  award   damages
          against  a defendant on a basis that was  not
          pleaded in the statement of claim because  it
          deprives the defendant of the opportunity  to
          address  that issue in the evidence presented
          at trial.        </pre>
    <pre>          
See  also:  460635 Ontario Ltd. v. 1002953 Ont. Inc.,  supra,  at
pp.  50-51, and Vanek v. The Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Company  of
Canada  Limited and Beatrice Foods Inc. (1999), 180 D.L.R.  (4th)
748 at 766 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[32] In my view, Immocreek&#146;s pleadings fall afoul of these cases.
A cause of action grounded in breach of fiduciary duty is a
separate cause of action consisting of identifiable legal
components (e.g. special relationship, loyalty and
vulnerability): see Hodgkinson v. Simms, supra.  There is nothing
in Immocreek&#146;s pleadings dealing with these matters. Indeed, in
the most specific paragraph in its pleadings dealing with Stoll&#146;s
personal liability, namely paragraph 2 of the Reply, the language
chosen might relate to a claim of negligent misrepresentation,
not a claim of breach of fiduciary duty.
[33] I make a final observation on the adequacy of the pleadings
issue.  Following the argument of the appeal, we asked counsel
for further submissions as to whether the personal liability of
Stoll was raised in argument by counsel at the conclusion of the
trial.  Those submissions appear to confirm that Stoll&#146;s personal
liability for breach of fiduciary duty in relation to the Campeau
shares transactions was not argued before the trial judge.  In
short, the closing arguments at trial reflected the pleadings -
the personal liability of Stoll was not a live issue in either
setting. It is true that there was no suggestion in this case
that the defendant Stoll was prejudiced in his presentation of
the case or that he would have led other evidence or presented
his argument differently had he been aware of the personal claim
against him in respect of the Campeau shares.  However, based on
both the pleadings and on the oral argument, it appears that the
plaintiff&#146;s pleadings accurately reflected its view of the action
that it was not pursuing a claim against the defendant Stoll
personally in respect of the Campeau shares.  In those
circumstances, it is not unfair to hold the plaintiff to its
pleadings and argument at trial.</pre>
    <pre>(c)  Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[34] The initial discussions and negotiations took place between
Dieter Lissmann and Rudolf Stoll, two sophisticated businessmen.
They reached an agreement and entered into a formal contract.
For tax reasons, the contract was between two corporate entities
controlled by the two men.  One of the normal consequences of
this type of arrangement, a consequence well-known to practically
every business person, is immunization against personal exposure
if the company does something wrong.
[35] In this case, Immocreek, which took advantage of its own
corporate identity, seeks to ignore Pretiosa&#146;s corporate identity
to get at Stoll.  This is not impossible.  However, the case law
requires that if a party wants to seek damages for personal
liability in a case where its prima facie relationship is with a
corporation, the party must plead clearly the basis for such
relief.  The pleadings must address specifically the cause of
action asserted against the personal defendant and why he or she
is being sued separately from the corporation.  Immocreek&#146;s
pleadings in this case failed on both counts.  Hence, although
the trial judge was correct to impose liability on the corporate
defendant Pretiosa, he erred when he imposed joint liability on
the personal defendant Stoll.</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The Management Fee Issue</pre>
    <pre>[36] Immocreek cross-appeals against the trial judge&#146;s finding
that it was obligated to pay Pretiosa management fees for the
February 1, 1988 &#150; March 16, 1990 period.  For ease of reference,
I set out again the paragraph in the contract relating to
management fees:          </pre>
    <pre>          Management  fees are due and payable  at  the
          end  of  each quarter and/or at the  time  of
          termination.  Should during one  quarter  the
          management result be negative, fees are  only
          calculated   after  surpassing  level   where
          previous profit participation was based upon.   </pre>
    <pre>The  actual  fee Pretiosa was permitted to charge was 10  percent
of profits from its investments on Immocreek&#146;s behalf.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Pretiosa never charged a management fee during the life of
the contract.  Nor did it present an account when the contract
terminated on March 16, 1990.  Instead it submitted an account,
based on the quarterly option, when it filed its Statement of
Defence and Counterclaim in this action.
[38] Immocreek submits that the fact that Pretiosa did not seek
management fees on a quarterly basis during the life of the
contract (there were profits in the early quarters) indicates
that Pretiosa chose not to receive those fees on a quarterly
basis, but elected instead to recover fees based on the profit,
if any, which had been made at the time of termination of the
contract.  Since, at termination, the Immocreek account was in a
substantial loss position, no management fees are payable.
[39] The trial judge carefully reviewed the history of the
contract.  He found that there was a great deal of confusion, and
even conflict, about how accounts were to be prepared and
rendered.  He found as a fact that this issue was not resolved
until January 4, 1990.  The trial judge observed:</pre>
    <pre>          Having  regard to the conduct of Lissmann  on
          the subject of the preparation of statements,
          it, in my view,  little behooves Immocreek to
          complain  about the absence of statements  of
          account from Pretiosa during the currency  of
          the contractual agreement.        </pre>
    <pre>[40] The contract was terminated on March 16, 1990, less than a
quarter after January 4, 1990.  Accordingly, the trial judge
concluded that both options for billing management fees were open
to Pretiosa.  Its election of the quarterly option was permitted.
[41] I can find no fault with the trial judge&#146;s reasoning or
conclusion on this issue.  Hence, I would dismiss Immocreek&#146;s
cross-appeal, subject to a minor variation.  The parties to the
appeal are agreed that the trial judge awarded Pretiosa $3,887
more than it was entitled to receive by way of management fees.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[42] The trial in this matter lasted 10 days.  The trial judge
wrote a careful and comprehensive 61-page decision dealing with a
large number of claims in the action and cross-action.  The
parties chose not to appeal the vast majority of the trial
judge&#146;s conclusions.  Indeed, one defendant ultimately appealed
nothing.  The plaintiff and the other defendant each appealed on
one issue.  That is the context within which this appeal took
place.
[43] I would allow the appellant Stoll&#146;s appeal on the issue of
personal liability.
[44] I would allow the cross-appeal, but only to the extent of
reducing the trial judge&#146;s calculation of the management fees
owing to Pretiosa by $3,887.
[45] The appellant Pretiosa abandoned its appeal only at the
appeal hearing.  Accordingly, the respondent was required to
prepare for this component of the appeal.  The appellant Stoll
was successful on its appeal. The respondent Immocreek was
largely unsuccessful on its cross-appeal.  It succeeded on a
relatively minor calculation issue which was agreed to by the
appellants. In these circumstances, each side (the appellants
were represented by the same counsel) should bear its own costs
of the appeal and the cross-appeal.
