               CANADIAN GENERAL INSURANCE COMPANY (Defendant

    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Faisal B. Joseph
               For the appellant</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               W. Colin Osterberg
               For the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         February 23, 2000
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of McCart J. dated June 16, 1998,
made at London, Ontario.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</strong>[1]   It  is  conceded by the respondent that if the trial  judge
required  that  to  be a reasonable expense an  expenditure  must
confer a significant benefit, he erred. We agree, but we read the
trial  judge rather to be saying that given the evidence and  the
language  of  the  reports  before him,  he  concluded  that  the
proposed  expenditure would confer no more than an  insignificant
benefit. He was not attempting to establish a legal threshold.
[2]  On the evidence before him it was open to him to conclude
that the proposed expenditure was not a reasonable expense. We
note the respondent&#146;s acknowledgement that it is still open to
the appellant to seek to have the respondent provide him with the
T.E.A.C.H. program if he can demonstrate that in the present
circumstances it is a reasonable expense.
[3]  The issue of costs was never argued before the trial judge
and he retired on the day his reasons were issued. In the
circumstances we grant leave to appeal the costs order. Given the
novel point in issue, we think that there should have been no
order as to costs of the trial.
[4]  The appeal is allowed as to costs, but is otherwise
dismissed without costs.</pre>
