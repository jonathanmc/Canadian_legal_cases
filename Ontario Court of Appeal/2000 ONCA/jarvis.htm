    <pre>[1]   The appellant was convicted of robbery and related offences
and sentenced to a total of fifteen years' imprisonment.
[2]  We agree generally with the Crown that this was a case of
hot pursuit with the perpetrators essentially followed from their
exit from the bank until their arrest.
[3]  Much of the &quot;identification&quot; evidence was flawed.
[4]  It is conceded that the trial judge erred in telling the
jury that courts have found the line-up procedure utilized in
this case is fair.  This line-up procedure was flawed.  Its
results were contradictory and useless.
[5]  Although the estimates of the height and size of the
perpetrator alleged to be the appellant varied over time and
between witnesses, the witnesses generally and correctly
identified &quot;the money man&quot; (the appellant) as shorter than his
accomplice.
[6]  However, the identification evidence was explicitly
collateral to the Crown's case which rested on the powerful
inferences that may be drawn from the hot pursuit of the
perpetrator followed by his quick arrest.  The trial judge did
not even refer to the identification evidence when he reviewed
the Crown's theory in his charge to the jury.
[7]  The trial judge did not provide the jury with the complete
W.D. instruction.  The second step was left out.  However, the
trial judge clearly told the jury that if they believed the
appellant they would have to acquit him and even if they
disbelieved him, the burden rested on the Crown to prove the
guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.  We do not
think that the appellant was prejudiced by this error.
[8]  In our view, the appellant's explanation as to how he was
found in the room with the other bank robber bordered on the
incredible and was incapable of raising a reasonable doubt.  This
was an overwhelming case and we have no doubt as to the
correctness of the verdict.
[9]  The record does not support a conclusion of bias or improper
judicial interference.
[10] With respect to sentence, it is our view that this sentence
was outside the appropriate range for this type of offence for
this appellant.  The principle of parity is offended.  In all the
circumstances, a fit sentence is eight years concurrent on the
three robbery counts plus one year consecutive for the weapons
conviction.  The sentence is not otherwise varied.
[11] Accordingly, the appeal against conviction is dismissed,
leave to appeal sentence is allowed, and the sentence is reduced
to one of eight years plus one year consecutive for the weapons
conviction.
