                                </strong>
</pre>
    <pre>                                I
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondent is charged with first degree murder.  He was
one month short of his eighteenth birthday when the alleged
offence occurred (August 2, 1998).  Under the terms of s.
16(1.01) of the Young Offenders Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. Y-1, as
amended, 1992 c.11, s.2;  1995 c. 19, s. 8 (the Act), the
respondent must be tried in ordinary court unless, upon
application to a youth court judge, he is ordered tried in youth
court.  He made that application and on July 7, 1999, Justice
Little ordered the respondent tried in youth court.  The Crown
seeks a review of that order pursuant to s. 16(9) of the Act.
[2]  Pending this review, the matter has proceeded in youth
court.  The respondent elected trial by judge and jury and was
committed for trial on the charge of first degree murder after a
preliminary inquiry.  No trial date has been set.
[3]  This is a difficult case.  After anxious consideration, I
would confirm the order made by Little J.</pre>
    <pre>     				II</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The homicide occurred in Big Trout Lake, a remote First
Nations community of approximately 1,200 people located some 400
km. north of Sioux Lookout.  Big Trout Lake is accessible only by
air.  The respondent had lived in Big Trout Lake most of his
life, although he had been away from the community for a brief
time shortly before the homicide.  The victim, Darren Sainnawap,
was eighteen years old.  He and the respondent had been longtime
friends, but in the months prior to the homicide their friendship
had soured.
[5]  The respondent has acknowledged from the outset that he shot
and killed the victim.  He claims that the gun discharged
accidentally.  Before this court, his counsel submitted that even
on the respondent&#146;s version of events he was engaged in an
unlawful act when the gun discharged and was, therefore, guilty
of manslaughter.
[6]  The Crown contends that the discharge of the gun was no
accident, but rather the end product of a decision made some
hours earlier by the respondent to kill the victim.  The Crown
submits that this was a planned and deliberate murder.
[7]  The respondent, the victim, and many other young people
attended a &#147;home brew&#148; party that started the night before the
homicide.  The party carried on at different locations over
several hours.  The respondent and victim were both drinking
&#147;home brew.&#148;  During the party, the victim and the respondent
quarreled.  It seems that there were two reasons for the
animosity that had developed between them.  First, the respondent
had recently found out that the person he believed to be his
father was not his father, and his real father was the victim&#146;s
father.  Their father had suggested to the victim that he was
&#147;spoiled rotten&#148; compared to the respondent.  Second, the
respondent&#146;s former girlfriend, for whom he had strong feelings,
was, at the time of the homicide, the girlfriend of the victim.
[8]  The victim was the aggressor in the arguments with the
respondent at the party.  The evidence suggested that the
respondent was not anxious to fight with the victim and went so
far as to suggest that they fight the following Monday when, if
things went according to his plan, the respondent would have left
Big Trout Lake.
[9]  The respondent left the party at about 5:00 a.m.  He was
seen about two hours later walking along a causeway armed with a
rifle.  He fired a shot into the ground in front of him.  Shortly
before 8:00 a.m., the respondent encountered the victim walking
along a boardwalk.  They quarreled and the respondent shot and
killed the victim.  There were three witnesses who were within
several feet of the homicide.  Their descriptions of the homicide
varied, although it would appear that the respondent and the
victim were standing about two feet apart arguing when the victim
grabbed the barrel of the gun.  The respondent fired the gun,
shooting the victim in the chest.  He also hit the victim in the
face with the gun before the victim fell to the ground.  There
was evidence from which it could be inferred that the respondent
loaded the rifle immediately before shooting the victim.
[10] The respondent walked away from the scene and threw the
rifle into a bush near the boardwalk.  Within moments, he
encountered Fred Sainnawap, a First Nations Constable, driving
his vehicle towards the boardwalk.  The Constable was unaware of
the shooting.  The respondent flagged down the police car,
entered the vehicle and immediately told Constable Sainnawap that
he had killed the victim.  The Constable detected an odour of
&#147;home brew&#148; coming from the respondent, and observed that he was
glassy eyed.  The Constable believed, however, that the
respondent was not intoxicated.  He was not staggering, had no
difficulty communicating with the Constable, and seemed calm.
[11] The police investigation indicated that after leaving the
party, the respondent had walked to the home of David Hudson,
where he was staying.  He had taken one of Hudson&#146;s rifles, sawed
off the butt, obtained some ammunition for the rifle from
Hudson&#146;s home, and walked back toward the location of the party.
He encountered the victim on the boardwalk on his way back to the
party.
[12] There was an indication in the predisposition report that
the respondent had some loose connection to aboriginal youth
gangs in the community.  The police were never able to
substantiate any connection between the respondent and these
gangs.  There was no allegation that the shooting was gang
related.
[13] The investigating officer agreed during cross-examination
that there was no evidence that the respondent was &#147;hunting&#148; the
victim when he came across him on the boardwalk.  The officer
agreed that the respondent would have had no way of knowing that
the victim would be on the boardwalk at that time.</pre>
    <pre>     				III</pre>
    <pre>[14] Before addressing the principles governing the transfer
application and considering the evidence in some detail, it is
helpful to describe this court&#146;s function on this appeal.
Section 16(9) of the Act provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          An order made in respect of a young person
	  under this section &#133; shall, on application
	  of the &#133; Attorney General &#133; made within
	  thirty days after the decision of the youth
	  court, be reviewed by the court of appeal,
	  and that court may, in its discretion, confirm
	  or reverse the decision of the youth court.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellate court must consider the applicable statutory
principles and make its own evaluation of the merits of the
application.  In doing so, the appellate court will accept any
credibility assessments and findings of fact made by the judge
hearing the application unless those findings are unreasonable or
are based on a misapprehension of the evidence or a failure to
consider relevant evidence:  R. v. M.(S.H.) (1989), 50 C.C.C.
(3d) 503 at 548-49 (S.C.C.);  R. v. C.(D.) (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d)
547 at 558 (Ont. C.A.),  leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused
(1994), 86 C.C.C. (3d) vii.</pre>
    <pre>     				IV</pre>
    <pre>[16] As indicated earlier in these reasons, a 17 year-old charged
with murder will be tried in ordinary court unless on application
to the youth court, the young person is ordered tried in youth
court.   The test to be applied in deciding whether a transfer
order should be made is found in s. 16(1.1) of the Act.  It
provides that the youth court:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; shall consider the interest of society, which
	  includes the objectives of affording protection
	  to the public and rehabilitation of the young
	  person, and determine whether those objectives
	  can be reconciled by the youth being under the
          jurisdiction of the youth court &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[17] If the youth court is satisfied that the two objectives
referred to in s. 16(1.1) can be reconciled in youth court
proceedings, the young person must be tried in that court.  If
they cannot be reconciled, the protection of the public is
paramount and the youth must be tried in ordinary court (s.
16(1.1)(a),(b)).  The onus to establish that the objectives can
be reconciled falls on the party bringing the transfer
application (s. 16(1.11)).
[18] Section 16(1.1) provides a more focused test for the
determination of transfer applications than the predecessor
legislation.  It looks exclusively to the objectives of the
protection of the public and the rehabilitation of the youth.  As
Osborne J.A. observed in R. v. C.(D.), supra, at p. 557:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Although I agree that the interest of society
	  includes more than protection of the public and
	  rehabilitation, the provisions of s. 16(1.1) are
	  clear in their identification of only two elements
	  of the interests of society - public protection and
          rehabilitation.  It is protection of the public, on
	  the one hand, and rehabilitation, on the other,
	  which must be assessed with a view to determining
	  whether those objectives can be reconciled within
          the youth court system.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Section 16(2) of the Act sets out the factors which the
youth court must consider in determining whether the objectives
of protection of the public and rehabilitation of the young
person can be reconciled within the youth court system:
          </pre>
    <pre>          16(2) In making the determination referred to in
          subsection (1) or (1.03) in respect of a young
	  person, a youth court shall take into account
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the seriousness of the alleged
          offence and the circumstances in which it was
          allegedly committed;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  the age, maturity, character and
          background of the young person and any record
          or summary of previous findings of
          delinquency under the Juvenile Delinquents
          Act, chapter J-3 of the Revised Statutes of
          Canada, 1970, or previous findings of guilt
          under this Act or any other Act of Parliament
          or any regulation made thereunder;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  the adequacy of this Act, and the
          adequacy of the Criminal Code or any other
          Act of Parliament that would apply in respect
          of the young person if an order were made
          under this section, to meet the circumstances
          of the case;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  the availability of treatment or
          correctional resources;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)  any representations made to the
          court by or on behalf of the young person or
          by the Attorney General or his agent;  and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (f)  any other factors that the court
          considers relevant.</pre>
    <pre>[20] The factors identified in that section are applied in
conjunction with the broad principles underlying the Act:  see R.
v. M.(S.H.), supra, at pp. 541-42.  Section 3 of the Act lays
down those principles:
          </pre>
    <pre>          3(1) It is hereby recognized and declared that
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  crime prevention is essential to
          the long-term protection of society and
          requires addressing the underlying causes of
          crime by young persons and developing multi-
          disciplinary approaches to identifying and
          effectively responding to children and young
          persons at risk of committing offending
          behaviour in the future;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a.1)     while young persons should not
          in all instances be held accountable in the
          same manner or suffer the same consequences
          for their behaviour as adults, young persons
          who commit offences should nonetheless bear
          responsibility for their contraventions;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  society must, although it has the
          responsibility to take reasonable measures to
          prevent criminal conduct by young persons, be
          afforded the necessary protection from
          illegal behaviour;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c)  young persons who commit offences
          require supervision, discipline and control,
          but, because of their state of dependency and
          level of development and maturity, they also
          have special needs and require guidance and
          assistance;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c.1)     the protection of society,
          which is a primary objective of the criminal
          law applicable to youth, is best served by
          rehabilitation, wherever possible, of young
          persons who commit offences, and
          rehabilitation is best achieved by addressing
          the needs and circumstances of a young person
          that are relevant to the young person&#146;s
          offending behaviour;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d)  where it is not inconsistent with
          the protection of society, taking no measures
          or taking measures other than judicial
          proceedings under this Act should be
          considered for dealing with young persons who
          have committed offences;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (e)  young persons have rights and
          freedoms in their own right, including those
          stated in the Canadian Charter of Rights and
          Freedoms or in the Canadian Bill of Rights,
          and in particular a right to be heard in the
          course of, and to participate in, the
          processes that lead to decisions that affect
          them, and young persons should have special
          guarantees of their rights and freedoms;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (f)  in the application of this Act, the
          rights and freedoms of young persons include
          a right to the least possible interference
          with freedom that is consistent with the
          protection of society, having regard to the
          needs of young persons and the interests of
          their families;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (g)  young persons have the right, in
          every instance where they have rights or
          freedoms that may be affected by this Act, to
          be informed as to what those rights and
          freedoms are; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (h)  parents have responsibility for the
          care and supervision of their children, and,
          for that reason, young persons should be
          removed from parental supervision either
          partly or entirely only when measures that
          provide for continuing parental supervision
          are inappropriate.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  This Act shall be liberally
          construed to the end that young persons will
          be dealt with in accordance with the
          principles set out in subsection (1).</pre>
    <pre>[21] The statutory framework to be addressed on a transfer
application is complex and refers to broad principles, some of
which seem almost irreconcilable.  Stripped to its essentials,
however, the scheme directs that the judge hearing the
application accept that the primary concern is the protection of
the public, and that he or she consider whether the
rehabilitation of the young person can be achieved without
compromising the protection of the public.  As long as the young
person poses a danger to the public, removal from the community
affords the only adequate protection for the public.  The long-
term protection of the public is, however, best served by the
rehabilitation of the young person so that he ceases to pose a
danger to the public.  It is, therefore, necessary to contemplate
a sentence or disposition which promotes the rehabilitation of
the young person, while at the same time protecting society as
long as the young person remains a danger.  The crucial questions
on transfer applications become:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>Is the young person presently a danger to the public?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Can the young person be rehabilitated so that he or she
ceases to pose a danger to the public?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Can the rehabilitation be achieved within the disposition
scheme established under the Act?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Can the public be adequately protected through the
disposition scheme established under the Act during the
rehabilitative process?</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[22] If the answer to the first question is &#147;no&#148;, the young
person will be tried in youth court.  If, however, the court is
not satisfied that the young person is not a present danger, the
young person will be tried in ordinary court unless, where the
young person has the onus, as is the case here, he or she can
satisfy the youth court that the answer to the last three
questions is &#147;yes.&#148;
[23] Answers to these three questions require that the court look
well into the future and measure concerns and prospects that are
inherently difficult to gauge with any certainty.  The young
person cannot be expected to convince the court to a certainty
that each question can be answered in the affirmative.  A young
person seeking transfer to youth court must demonstrate that it
is likely that he or she can be rehabilitated; that it is also
likely that, by the termination of any disposition imposed under
the Act, the young person will be sufficiently rehabilitated so
as to no longer pose a danger to the public; and that it is
likely that the public can be adequately protected under the
disposition scheme established under the Act during the
rehabilitative process:  R. v. W.(B.) (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 419
at 423 (Ont. C.A.).
[24] Until recently, the duration of dispositions available under
the Act was not sufficiently long to protect the public during
the lengthy rehabilitative process needed in most cases where
young persons were charged with the offence of murder.  A trial
in youth court was, therefore, often not a viable option.  Recent
amendments have significantly extended the potential duration of
dispositions imposed under the Act.  Under s. 20(1)(k.1) and s.
26.1 of the Act, a young person convicted of first degree murder
in youth court may be subject to a disposition which extends for
10 years.  The young person may be required to serve the entire
10 years in a secure setting.1 Although the dispositions
available under the Act can stretch forward 10 years from the
date of disposition, there can be no restriction on the young
person&#146;s liberty when the disposition is complete.  The young
person must be released upon completion of the disposition,
regardless of the danger he may present to the public.
[25] While the dispositions now available under the Act are more
suitable to young persons convicted of murder than those
previously available under the Act, there are still significant
differences between potential dispositions under the Act and the
sentence imposed on a young person convicted of first degree
murder in ordinary court.  A 17 year-old young person convicted
of first degree murder in ordinary court is sentenced to life
imprisonment.  He is eligible for parole after 10 years.2  He
may, however, remain incarcerated beyond that time and perhaps
for the rest of his life.  Even if released on parole, the young
person remains subject to the restrictions imposed by the parole
conditions for the rest of his life:  Criminal Code, s. 745.1.
[26] In addition to the potential duration of any disposition
imposed on the young person if he is tried in youth court, the
availability of treatment to assist in the rehabilitation of the
young person must be considered.  Here, too, recent amendments to
the Act and the Criminal Code have eliminated many of the
distinctions which formerly existed between young persons
processed through the youth court and those dealt with in
ordinary court.  If the respondent is convicted either in youth
court or in ordinary court, the court may, under s. 16.2 of the
Act, direct that the sentence or disposition be served in the
youth facility or in an adult facility.  Furthermore, since the
respondent will be 20 years old in September, he will serve his
disposition or sentence in an adult facility from that point
forward:  Young Offenders Act, s. 24.5; Criminal Code, s. 743.4.
If the respondent is convicted of murder, the placement options
available to the court are not significantly different whether
the respondent is proceeded against in ordinary court or in youth
court.  The same can be said for the treatment services which may
be available to assist in the rehabilitation of the respondent.
As Crown counsel put it in his factum:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; regardless of whether a young person is tried
	  in ordinary court or youth court, similar
	  placement options are available to the court to
          meet the young person&#146;s needs and the circumstances
          of the case.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Given the disposition options available under the Act,
Little J. had to decide whether she was satisfied that the
respondent would likely not pose a danger to the public upon his
release if held in a secure setting for up to 10 years (but not a
day longer), where he could receive the benefit of services and
programs intended to further his rehabilitation.  To make this
decision, Little J. had to consider the circumstances of the
alleged offence and the respondent&#146;s background and character.</pre>
    <pre>     				V</pre>
    <pre>[28] A young person charged with murder who makes an application
to be tried in youth court has, of course, not been found guilty
of any offence and is still protected by the constitutionally
entrenched presumption of innocence.  The concepts of the
protection of the public and the rehabilitation of a young person
referred to in s. 16(1.1) of the Act, however, have meaning only
if the young person has committed the alleged crime.  A transfer
application with its relaxed rules of evidence is no place to
engage in a full blown trial or to make determinations of
culpability.  In my view, the judge hearing the transfer
application can only properly address the issues raised by s.
16(1.1) if he or she assumes that the Crown will prove the
allegation made against the young person.  Section 16(2)(a) of
the Act, which requires a judge to consider the seriousness of
the &#147;alleged&#148; offence and the circumstances in which it was
&#147;allegedly committed&#148;, supports the view that the judge must
proceed on the basis that the offence was committed by the young
person.
[29] In this case, Little J. was required to accept that the
Crown would establish that the respondent committed a planned and
deliberate murder.  She did so when she said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          For the purpose of this application, I believe
	  I must accept the theory offered by the Crown.</pre>
    <pre>[30] I do not, however, agree that the judge must accept all of
the evidence offered by the Crown touching on the circumstances
of the alleged offence or the young person&#146;s culpability for that
offence.  The judge has a fact finding responsibility and cannot
abdicate that function by simply accepting as fact all of the
evidence tendered by the Crown.  If the Crown leads evidence that
it claims supports factual findings relevant to the circumstances
of the alleged offence or the young person&#146;s conduct in relation
to the offence, the judge must weigh the credibility and
reliability of that evidence before accepting it.  In performing
this task, I do not suggest that the judge must test the evidence
in the way he or she would on a trial.  The judge should accept
as fact evidence tendered by the Crown if that evidence is
reasonably capable of belief and also reasonably capable of
supporting the finding of fact urged by the Crown.
[31] Authorities from this court are consistent with the position
outlined above.  In R. v. S.(G.) (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.),
leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) xiii, two
competing versions of the homicide were advanced.  On the Crown&#146;s
version, the homicide was committed in the course of a vicious
robbery.  On the young person&#146;s version (advanced through a
psychiatric report admitted as fresh evidence on the appeal), the
young person killed the victim in a panicked response to a
homosexual advance made by the victim.
[32] Carthy J.A., in dissent, at p. 102, opined that the decision
on the transfer application &#147;must be made without presuming which
version might be accepted by a judge or jury.&#148;
[33] Goodman J.A., for the majority, took a different view.  He
observed that the circumstances surrounding the alleged offence
were an important consideration in determining where the young
person should be tried.  Consequently, the judge hearing the
application had to make findings with respect to the relevant
circumstances.  In describing the approach to be taken to that
fact-finding function, Goodman J.A. said, at p. 112:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; where there is conflicting evidence placed
	  before the court considering an application
	  under s. 16 of the Act, with respect to the
	  manner in which the alleged offence was committed,
          such court is entitled to proceed on the basis of
	  the evidence most damaging to the alleged offender,
	  assuming that it is evidence capable of belief
	  and not merely trifling in nature or amounting
	  to no more than mere conjecture.</pre>
    <pre>[34] Goodman J.A. considered the competing versions of events
placed before the Court of Appeal and concluded that the more
inculpatory version of events provided by the young person in his
initial statement should be preferred over the exculpatory
version given to the psychiatrist many months later.
[35] The approach favoured by Goodman J.A. is consistent with
that followed in R. v. R.(S.) (1991), 1 O.R. (3d) 785 at 789
(C.A.) where this court said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; even though there were inconsistencies in the
	  evidence presented at the hearing with respect
	  to the nature of the participation of the applicant
	  in the murder, the youth court judge was entitled
	  to take into account under s. 16(2)(a) of the
          Act, as proven for the purposes of the application,
	  not only that the applicant had committed first
	  degree murder as alleged but also the circumstances
	  as alleged, that is to say, the manner in which
	  it was committed.</pre>
    <pre>[36] Other provincial courts have taken the same view of the fact
finding role of a judge on a transfer application:  see R. v.
B.(R.V.) (1994), 145 A.R. 384 at 387 (C.A.);  R. v. G.(W.P.)
(1999), 119 B.C.A.C. 145 at 152 (C.A.).
[37] The distinction between assuming that the Crown will prove
the allegation and accepting as fact all of the evidence led by
the Crown is of some significance in this case.  In addition to
evidence from which it could be inferred that the respondent
murdered the victim and that the murder was planned and
deliberate, the Crown led evidence of an alleged threat made by
the respondent against Priscilla McKay some six months after his
arrest.  Ms. McKay was the victim&#146;s girlfriend when he was killed
and had previously been the respondent&#146;s girlfriend.  The threat
was allegedly made while the respondent was in jail and was
passed on to Ms. McKay by a cell mate.  If accepted as fact, this
threat may be evidence on the charge and, more importantly on the
s. 16 application is significant evidence that the respondent was
an ongoing danger to the public as of January 1999.
[38] The evidence of the threat came through the investigating
police officer.  He testified that he spoke to Ms. McKay who said
she had spoken to the cell mate of the respondent who told her
that the respondent intended to kill her when he was released
from jail.  The police officer then spoke to the cell mate and
was advised:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; Jeffrey Winter [the cell mate] had contacted
	  Priscilla McKay [the girlfriend] and put J.C.
	  [the respondent] on the phone at one point, had
	  no idea what in fact J.C. had said and he had &#150;
          Jeffrey Winter also indicated that Priscilla had
	  better be careful, I believe, something might
	  happen to her from J.C.</pre>
    <pre>[39] The police officer&#146;s evidence considered in its totality
could not reasonably support the inference that the respondent
had threatened Ms. McKay.  It went no further than to indicate
that the cell mate believed Ms. McKay should be concerned about
her safety, told her so, and that Ms. McKay took this to be a
threat from the respondent.  Little J. did not refer to this
evidence in her reasons.  I take this to mean that she did not
give it any weight.  If I am correct that Little J. gave this
evidence no weight, I accept her assessment.  If her silence
indicates that she failed to consider the evidence, I do so now
and would not give it any weight.
[40] Although I would not give any weight to the alleged threat
made by the respondent against Ms. McKay, the nature of the
charge and the circumstances surrounding the alleged murder raise
very serious concerns that the respondent poses a significant
risk to the community.  Indeed, accepting the Crown&#146;s theory,
there can be no doubt but that he was a danger to the public as
of August 1998.  The respondent&#146;s age (17 years 11 months) also
tells against a transfer to youth court:  R. v. S.(G.), supra, at
109.</pre>
    <pre>     				VI</pre>
    <pre>[41] The respondent attempted to counter the inference of
dangerousness raised by the allegation and the circumstances of
the alleged offence with evidence that he was not a violent
person and did not suffer from any psychiatric illness which
would render him an ongoing danger to the public for some
indefinite time.  Counsel for the respondent acknowledged that
the respondent had significant social and psychological problems,
but contended that those could be addressed and rectified within
the youth court system and within the 10-year time period during
which he could be held in a secure setting.  Counsel relied on
the predisposition report and the report and testimony of Dr.
Sheppard, a psychiatrist.
[42] The respondent was born on September 7, 1980.  He is the
eldest of four brothers.  He was raised by his mother and father
and his material needs were met during his childhood.  His
childhood was, however, marred by physical and verbal abuse
within the family.  Both parents drank too much and the
respondent&#146;s father physically abused the children.  The
respondent&#146;s mother stopped drinking when he was about 11 years
old and his father learned to control his substance abuse over
time.  As of the date of the transfer application, the
respondent&#146;s parents were divorced but both were very concerned
about the respondent&#146;s well-being and offered whatever support
they could for him.
[43] The respondent began to use alcohol and other drugs when he
was 13 years old.  He associated with a peer group in the
community that regularly took drugs, drank too much and engaged
in anti-social conduct while under the influence of alcohol and
drugs.  The respondent&#146;s substance abuse worsened so that by the
time he was 17 years old he had a very serious problem with
alcohol and drug abuse.  That abuse had a negative effect on his
school work, employment history and his relationship with his
parents.
[44] The respondent also manifested signs of depression and
developed a suicidal ideation.  His depression was exacerbated by
the suicide of a girlfriend.  The respondent reportedly attempted
suicide on one occasion.
[45] The respondent&#146;s teachers and employers described him as a
quiet worker, polite and respectful.  He appears to have been an
average student, although as his drug abuse worsened, his
performance at school and in various jobs deteriorated
significantly.
[46] The respondent was found guilty of impaired driving in April
1998 and was on probation at the time of the alleged murder.  He
had completed a portion of the community service order made as a
part of the probation order.
[47] By August 1998, the respondent was very much a part of the
&#147;partying scene&#148; in Big Trout Lake.  He was reportedly part of a
group of young people who were involved in fighting, stealing and
other reckless behaviour.  The local police did not, however,
regard the respondent as violent or overly aggressive.  He had
not been charged with any criminal offence other than the
impaired driving conviction in April 1998.
[48] The four or five months leading up to the homicide was a
very difficult time for the respondent.  He revealed for the
first time that he had been sexually abused as a child; he was
trying to come to grips with the realization that the man he had
always thought of as his father was not his father; his lifelong
friendship with the victim had ended; his relationship with Ms.
McKay had ended and she was now seeing the victim; his substance
abuse continued to escalate; and his relationship with his family
continued to deteriorate.
[49] In June 1998, the respondent took part in a one-week family
counselling session aimed in part at helping him overcome his
substance abuse.  He was not motivated to continue that
counselling.  The respondent also left Big Trout Lake and went to
live with his grandmother in an effort to get away from the
negative influences in that community.  He returned to Big Trout
Lake shortly before the alleged murder and rejoined the &#147;partying
scene.&#148;  He moved out of his parents&#146; home and into the home of a
friend.
[50] The respondent became involved in the educational,
recreational and counselling programs available to him in the
institutions after his arrest in August 1998.  He was
cooperative, compliant and had not been involved in any
inappropriate conduct or received any reprimands.  He tended to
isolate himself from other residents who had a tendency to incite
questionable or challenging behaviour.  Although transfers to
various correctional institutions had interfered somewhat with
the respondent&#146;s programs, he was able to attend school and was
working at a grade 9 level.  He had strong writing abilities and
was capable of working at or above a grade 9 level.  His teacher
described him as polite, cooperative, and appropriately
assertive.  The respondent has expressed a desire to continue his
education.
[51] The author of the predisposition report identified the
respondent&#146;s substance abuse as a key negative feature of his
background and a considerable impediment to his psychological and
social development.  He summarized his interaction with the
respondent as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; the subject presented himself in a cooperative,
	  relatively articulate and polite fashion, offering
	  unsolicited insights into his behaviour and an
	  acceptance of responsibility for the circumstances
	  in which he now finds himself. &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[52] In addition to the information provided in the
predisposition report, Little J. had an assessment prepared under
s. 13 of the Act by a psychiatrist, Dr. Sheppard.  Dr. Sheppard
interviewed the respondent on two occasions, reviewed his medical
records, clinical records from a brief counselling session in
1998, a previous psychiatric report, information relating to the
circumstances of the crime, witness statements, and the results
of certain psychological testing performed after the respondent
was incarcerated on this charge.3
[53] In his report, Dr. Sheppard indicated that the respondent
did not suffer from any identifiable psychiatric illness.  There
was nothing to suggest that he suffered from any mental disorder
that would affect his criminal responsibility.  Dr. Sheppard also
wrote that the respondent had significant psychological and
social problems.  Most prominent amongst these was his alcohol
and drug abuse which were ongoing since the age of 13.  Dr.
Sheppard indicated that the respondent had experienced
difficulties with mood instability.  There were indications of
previous bouts of depression and problems with anger control.
Neither were, however, in the forefront when the respondent was
interviewed and evaluated by Dr. Sheppard.  The respondent did
not require treatment for depression and difficulties with anger
control had not manifested themselves since his incarceration.
[54] Dr. Sheppard also observed that the respondent&#146;s overall
I.Q. level was in the normal range.  There was, however, a large
discrepancy between his verbal and performance skills.  The
former was low whereas the latter was in the high average or
superior range.  Dr. Sheppard explained that the difference was
possibly attributable to a head injury the respondent had
suffered as a 13 year old.  Dr. Sheppard could not, however, find
any evidence of any ongoing effect from that injury and could not
come to any conclusion as to what impact, if any, the injury had
on the respondent&#146;s intellectual and psychological functioning.
[55] Dr. Sheppard referred to a number of destabilizing events in
the respondent&#146;s life:  his parents were divorced; he had been
physically and sexually abused as a child; a girlfriend had
committed suicide about two years before the alleged offence; and
his relationship with a subsequent girlfriend (Ms. McKay) was a
difficult one.  The respondent also found himself part of a peer
group in which substance abuse and physical altercations were
more the norm than the exception.  These events contributed to
his mood instability and substance abuse.
[56] Dr. Sheppard summarized his findings and opinions in these
terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>          To summarize briefly, [the Respondent] does not
  	  suffer from an identifiable psychiatric illness.
	  He has however been prone to significant problems
	  with substance abuse and he will require
	  professional assistance in this area.  He has
	  also been traumatized to some extent in his
	  childhood, and counselling in this area may be
	  of benefit to him as well.  He has been prone to
          a certain amount of psychological and behavioural
	  instability, presumably on account of
	  characterological vulnerabilities which may stem
	  from his unstable childhood.  He has had problems
	  with both depression and anger control in the past,
	  although these are not prominent at present.
	  Finally, the possibility that [the Respondent] has
	  suffered from an acquired brain injury in the
          past could be further investigated in the future.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The prognosis is difficult to estimate
          with certainty at this time.  There are
          however some favourable prognostic signs.
          [The Respondent] has responded positively to
          institutional residence over these past few
          months.  His mood has appeared to be stable
          and his attitude has been generally
          constructive.  He has been willing to accept
          some responsibility for his problems, he has
          verbalized some insight into his problems
          with alcohol and drug abuse, and he has
          expressed a willingness to attend a
          residential treatment program.  Despite his
          history of antisocial behaviour in the past
          similar behavioural patterns have not
          surfaced in the institutional setting which,
          again, might be regarded as a favourable
          prognostic sign in that it tends to confirm
          the absence of entrenched characterological
          pathology.  [The Respondent] has shown the
          ability to benefit from involvement in a
          therapeutic institutional milieu, and this is
          a favourable sign.
          </pre>
    <pre>          On the other hand, [the Respondent&#146;s]
          psychological and behavioural problems have
          been quite longstanding and persistent.
          Although he has been in a therapeutic
          environment he has not been involved in
          treatment, and his actual ability to benefit
          from treatment interventions remains unknown.
          In the past he has been unwilling to follow
          treatment recommendations although, as
          indicated, his attitude appears to be more
          constructive at this time.  [The
          Respondent&#146;s] actual prognosis will depend
          partly on his consistent willingness to apply
          himself during the course of his treatment
          and rehabilitation which will no doubt be a
          reasonably long-term proposition.</pre>
    <pre>[57] Dr. Sheppard also testified on the transfer application.  He
had considerable experience with aboriginal clients and was
familiar with the Big Trout Lake community.
[58] He described the respondent as having a level of maturity
which was consistent with his age.  He said that the respondent
was cooperative, volunteered information and did not appear
overly defensive or resistant to the assessment.  Dr. Sheppard
believed that the respondent demonstrated various psychological
vulnerabilities as manifested by his depression, anger and poor
self-esteem.  These vulnerabilities had a negative effect on his
ability to cope with the many problems he had encountered in his
life.  His substance abuse was a manifestation of his inability
to cope in an appropriate manner with problems that he
encountered.  The one effort to counsel the respondent with
respect to substance abuse had proved ineffective because the
respondent was not prepared to cooperate.  He felt that he was
being forced to participate in the counselling and preferred to
handle things his own way.  Dr. Sheppard, however, perceived that
the respondent&#146;s attitude toward obtaining help for his problems
had changed since his incarceration.
[59] Dr. Sheppard was of the view that the psychological
vulnerabilities demonstrated by the respondent were the product
of instability in his upbringing, peer group pressures, and the
physical and sexual abuse he suffered as a child.
[60] Dr. Sheppard testified that he saw no evidence of a
sustained pattern of behaviour which he would describe as anti-
social in nature.  He would not diagnose the respondent as having
a personality disorder or its adolescent equivalent, a conduct
disorder.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; I don&#146;t think I would have diagnosed a conduct
	  disorder based on the information I had with
	  respect to his, his behaviour as a child and
	  adolescent.  I think that there were some areas
          where his behaviour was certainly unhealthy and
	  I&#146;ve described it as maladaptive in some ways,
	  but it didn&#146;t seem to be extreme or outside what
	  you might expect considering the sort of
          psychosocial environment in which he was living.
	  That is, it&#146;s, he was involved with a peer group,
	  for example, that was, I think, demonstrating
  	  many of the same sorts of behaviours that he
          was and you know, measured against that sort of
	  a, a standard, I don&#146;t think his behaviour
	  would&#146;ve been seen as that unusual so I would
	  not have diagnosed a conduct disorder in his case.</pre>
    <pre>[61] Dr. Sheppard testified that the respondent needed treatment
for his substance abuse and psychological counselling.  He
indicated that both should occur initially in an institutional
setting and continue after the respondent was returned to the
community.  Dr. Sheppard indicated that the time needed to treat
the respondent&#146;s substance abuse in an institutional setting
could range from four months to two years.  He also testified
that the psychological counselling should be directed at
assisting the respondent in coming to grips with unresolved
problems and helping him to develop mature and socially
acceptable coping mechanisms.  Dr. Sheppard was of the view that
this counselling could be a &#147;fairly long term proposition&#148; and
should begin with intensive treatment in an institutional setting
followed by long term out-patient counselling.
[62] Dr. Sheppard was careful to indicate that it was very
difficult to predict how anyone would respond to the treatments
he suggested.  He indicated that the effectiveness of any
treatment depended in large measure on the person&#146;s willingness
to apply himself to the treatment.  This variable could not be
measured until after the treatment was well underway.
[63] It became apparent during Dr. Sheppard&#146;s evidence that he
had based his opinions in part on the version of the relevant
events given to him by the respondent.  According to that
version, the respondent had obtained the rifle to intimidate
those people who had been threatening him during the evening.  He
felt he had to show them that they could not &#147;mess with him.&#148;
The victim was not one of these people.    The respondent said
that he encountered the victim on the boardwalk and that the
victim challenged him.  They struggled over the gun and it went
off by accident when the respondent slipped.
[64] Counsel for the respondent, no doubt anticipating that
Little J. would accept the Crown&#146;s allegation that the respondent
had committed a planned and deliberate murder, asked Dr. Sheppard
whether his opinion and prognosis would be different if the
Crown&#146;s version of events was accepted.  Dr. Sheppard was unable
to give a definitive answer.  He said that the Crown&#146;s version of
events was inconsistent with the profile he had developed of the
respondent&#146;s character and that he would have to &#147;talk to him
again and find out what really happened.&#148;
[65] Dr. Sheppard testified that the allegations of the Crown
were indicative of a seriously anti-social act.  He suggested
that the Crown&#146;s version of events could indicate that, contrary
to his present opinion, the respondent did fit the anti-social
personality profile.  That version could also indicate that the
respondent had suffered a &#147;temporary overwhelming of his coping
abilities&#148; as a result of the numerous difficulties he had
encountered in the months prior to, and on the evening of the
homicide.  Dr. Sheppard expressed the opinion that if the
homicide was the product of a &#147;temporary overwhelming of coping
abilities&#148; the treatments he had described earlier in his
evidence would be appropriate.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>          He would still have these, these psychological
  	  issues that should be looked at.  I guess what
 	  it would do is indicate a greater precariousness,
	  if you like, or sort of a more extreme fragility
	  in the sense that one, you&#146;d be forced to accept
	  that his behaviour under certain circumstances
	  could become extremely abhorrent and dangerous
   	  indeed so, but as to whether or not that would
          be, indicate a different issue that needed
	  treatment, not necessarily.  I mean, likely
	  not, in fact.</pre>
    <pre>[66] Dr. Sheppard agreed with the Crown in cross-examination that
if the respondent had lied to him about the circumstances of the
offence, those lies suggested a deviousness and a refusal to
accept responsibility which do not augur well for effective
treatment of the respondent.
[67] Crown counsel also pressed Dr. Sheppard on his view that the
appellant did not demonstrate an anti-social personality disorder
or a conduct disorder.  Dr. Sheppard agreed that the respondent
had engaged in anti-social behaviour, but opined that it had not
reached the degree or the repetitiveness necessary to permit the
diagnosis of a conduct disorder.  Dr. Sheppard referred to the
numerous reports from various sources ranging over a number of
years that described the respondent as pleasant, easygoing,
polite and cooperative.  He said these characteristics were
inconsistent with a person suffering from a conduct disorder.</pre>
    <pre>     				VII</pre>
    <pre>[68] The determination of whether the respondent could likely be
rehabilitated in the youth court system during the tenure of a
disposition available under that system turned in large measure
on the nature of his psychological and social problems.  If those
problems were rooted in a conduct disorder, the respondent&#146;s
rehabilitative prospects were significantly reduced as were the
chances that his rehabilitation could be affected within a fixed
period of time.  Little J. concluded that the respondent did not
suffer from a conduct disorder.
[69] Mr. Schwartz, for the Crown, in his able and even handed
submissions, argues that this conclusion was not open on the
evidence.  He submits that Dr. Sheppard&#146;s opinion that the
respondent did not have a conduct disorder was based on Dr.
Sheppard&#146;s acceptance of the respondent&#146;s version of events.  Dr.
Sheppard could not exclude the possibility of a conduct disorder
if the Crown&#146;s version of the relevant events was true.  Mr.
Schwartz argues that since Little J. accepted the Crown&#146;s version
of events for the purposes of the transfer application, Dr.
Sheppard&#146;s evidence could not support a finding that the
appellant did not suffer from a conduct disorder.  It is Mr.
Schwartz&#146;s position that on the evidence there is no explanation
for the respondent&#146;s conduct and no informed assessment of his
rehabilitative potential can be made at this time.  Consequently,
he argues that the respondent failed to discharge the onus on him
and Little J. should have refused to make the transfer order.
[70] Little J. referred to this submission in her reasons.  She
clearly did not accept it.  Even though Dr. Sheppard&#146;s opinion
that the respondent did not suffer from a conduct disorder had to
be qualified, given the acceptance of the Crown&#146;s version of
events, I think it was open to Little J. to find that the
respondent did not suffer from a conduct disorder.  Dr. Sheppard
made it clear that the diagnosis of a conduct disorder must be
based on a course of conduct and not on a single event.  On the
record before Little J., there was little, if anything, in the
respondent&#146;s history prior to the homicide or in his conduct
subsequent to the homicide, that could support a finding that he
suffered from a conduct disorder.  In fact, as Dr. Sheppard
pointed out, the numerous descriptions of the respondent&#146;s
personality drawn from various sources over many years were
inconsistent with the diagnosis of a conduct disorder.
[71] Dr. Sheppard&#146;s suggestion that the respondent&#146;s conduct as
described in the Crown&#146;s version of events could be explained by
&#147;a temporary overwhelming of coping abilities&#148; had great force
when considered in the context of the events leading up to the
killing.  The respondent, who was psychologically very vulnerable
to begin with, was operating in a very negative environment and
had been beset by a series of psychological blows in the months
prior to the killing.  He had also been subjected to physical and
verbal abuse from his peer group on the night of the killing.  He
was under the influence of alcohol.  In my view, these events
offer strong support for a finding that the respondent&#146;s conduct
was the product of &#147;a temporary overwhelming of his coping
abilities.&#148;  Dr. Sheppard had testified that if the murder was
planned and deliberate but was the product of situational stress
which overwhelmed the respondent&#146;s coping mechanisms, then in all
likelihood the treatment of the respondent would be the same as
that outlined by Dr. Sheppard in his initial opinion.
[72] The respondent&#146;s behaviour in the year and a half since his
incarceration also offers good reason to conclude that he can be
successfully rehabilitated within the time periods allowed for
under dispositions imposed under the Act.  His removal from the
negative influence of the peer group he associated with, combined
with access to educational and counselling programs within the
institutions, have already benefited the respondent considerably.
The record indicates that the respondent is now motivated to
improve his lot in life and that he has gained some insight into
his problems, including his substance abuse problem.  His
positive interaction with teachers and others, his desire to
further his education, and his intelligence all suggest that the
respondent has the means and the inclination needed to turn his
life around over the next 10 years.  The respondent&#146;s failure to
take advantage of an earlier counselling opportunity is cause for
concern, but the circumstances are now so different that the
respondent&#146;s prior rejection of counselling is of little
assistance in gauging his potential reaction to more intensive
future efforts to assist him within an institutional setting.  I
think his conduct since his incarceration in August 1998 is a
much better predictor of his rehabilitative potential.</pre>
    <pre>     				VIII</pre>
    <pre>[73] There is an understandable tendency to rely heavily on
psychiatric opinions when assessing rehabilitative potential and
potential dangerousness.  A more definitive opinion from Dr.
Sheppard based on an acceptance of the Crown&#146;s allegations would
have assisted Little J.  Unfortunately, Dr. Sheppard could not
provide a more definitive opinion.  Little J. was still required
to assess the totality of the evidence and make the determination
required under the Act.  Even if Dr. Sheppard could not put a
specific medical label on the respondent&#146;s problem, state with
certainty what caused the problem, or predict with certainty the
outcome of the course of treatment, Little J. had to decide
whether the rehabilitation of the respondent and the protection
of the public could be reconciled if the respondent was tried in
youth court.  She decided that those objectives could be
reconciled.  When I address the questions posed above in
paragraph 21 in the context of this record, I come to the same
conclusion.
[74] I would dismiss the appeal.

1 The 10-year duration runs from the date of disposition and does
not take into account pre-trial custody.  In this case where the
respondent has been in custody since his arrest, and it is likely
that his trial will not take place until almost two years after
his arrest, he could be subject to a period of confinement of
almost 12 years.
2 The period of parole ineligibility runs from the time of
confinement.  Consequently, this respondent, if convicted of
first degree murder, would be eligible for full parole 10 years
after his arrest (August 2008).  He would also be eligible for
some form of partial release 8 years after his arrest.
3 In his factum, Crown counsel suggested that because most of
this information was not before the court, the factual foundation
of Dr. Sheppard&#146;s opinion had not been proven.  Whatever the
merits, if any, of this contention in a trial setting, I am
satisfied that it had no effect on Dr. Sheppard&#146;s opinion for the
purposes of the s. 16 application.  The strict rules of evidence
do not apply.  There is also no suggestion that the Crown did not
have this information available to it and could not have, had it
seen any benefit in doing so, placed this material before the
court.</pre></td>
