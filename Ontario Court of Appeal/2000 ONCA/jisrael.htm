    <pre><strong>               Neil A. Kaufman

    <pre><strong>HEARD:         March 21, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Lane dated September
7, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T
                                
</strong>[1]  The appellant concedes that there is no evidence that Jack
Israeli ever made a statement to the effect that Mr. Saunderson
had authority to act on his behalf.  We are of the view that the
conduct relied upon by the appellant does not raise a genuine
issue that Saunderson was acting as the agent of Israeli when he
made the representations and warranties in issue.  We agree with
the conclusions of the motions judge.
[2]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre></td>
