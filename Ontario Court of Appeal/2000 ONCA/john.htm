    <pre><strong>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, ABELLA and O&#146;CONNOR JJ.A.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Roger Rowe
               for the appellants</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               Donald McIntosh and Jeremiah Eastman
               for the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         March 22, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Dambrot J. dated May 29, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T
                                
</strong>[1]  We are not persuaded that we should interfere with the
decision of Dambrot J.  In our view, he properly exercised his
discretion and declined jurisdiction to hear this application.
[2]  Counsel for the appellant expressed a concern that in the
event this court dismissed this appeal, there is nothing to
prevent the Minister from deporting the children&#146;s litigation
guardian, who is also the children&#146;s caregiver, and who is
presently subject to a removal order in her personal capacity.
[3]  We were advised by counsel for the Minister that the
litigation guardian is in a position, and has been for some time,
to make an application under s. 114(2) of the Immigration Act to
be permitted to remain in Canada on humanitarian and
compassionate grounds.  We assume that the Minister will not
implement the removal order until there has been a reasonable
opportunity to bring the appropriate proceedings under the
Immigration Act.
[4]  The appeal is therefore dismissed.</pre></td>
