</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Epstein J. dated April 16, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>

                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   At the opening of the appeal, Douglas Burns appeared with
counsel for the appellant and stated that he had an affidavit
from a former solicitor, Noel Bates, which he wished to introduce
in the form of fresh evidence.  The counsel of record for the
appellants had not seen the affidavit.  A copy had been given to
counsel for the respondent who objected to its acceptance by the
court.  The court had no material whatsoever dealing with this
fresh evidence application.  In the circumstances, we instructed
counsel of record for the appellants to proceed with the argument
without hearing further from Mr. Burns.
[2]  So far as the merits of the appeal are concerned, counsel
for the appellants embarked upon a re-argument of the issues
heard both by the assessment officer and Epstein J. in appeal.
It is clear that the Hallatts, particularly Mr. Hallatt, took
strong exception to the manner in which the respondent&#146;s
solicitors represented them.  The assessment officer was alive to
these differences and was not uncritical of the conduct of the
solicitors in aggressively pursuing the retainer in this case.
However, clearly, there was a retainer as found both by the
assessment officer and by Epstein J. in appeal.  We would not
interfere with this finding.
[3]  The assessment officer carefully reviewed the accounts and
taxed them.  With one exception, Epstein J. agreed with him.
There is ample evidence to support this assessment as varied and
no error in law has been pointed out to us.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
