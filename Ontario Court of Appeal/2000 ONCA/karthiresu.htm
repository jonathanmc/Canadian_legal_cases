    <pre>     On appeal from conviction by Then J. with a jury dated
                      November 25, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>BY THE COURT:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals against his conviction for second
degree murder.  Crown counsel fairly concedes, and we agree, that
the conviction cannot stand and a new trial must be ordered.
[2]  The incident giving rise to the charge occurred on May 2,
1993, when Sivapiragasam Namasivayam was shot and killed
following a night of drinking and fighting with a number of
individuals, including the appellant and his friend Jeyaseelan
Thuraisingham, at a house party on Bridletown Circle in
Scarborough.  The position of the Crown was that the appellant
was the shooter.  The defence on the other hand, maintained that
Thuraisingham was responsible for the killing.  While both sides
led evidence in support of their respective positions, it is fair
to say that on balance, the weight of the evidence favoured the
appellant&#146;s position.  Perhaps that explains why the jury
deliberated for the better part of seven days before rendering
its verdict.
[3]  On the fourth day of deliberations, the jury asked for
clarification of the definition of reasonable doubt. The learned
trial judge responded in part as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>   Now, what is meant by proof  beyond a reasonable doubt?
   A  reasonable  doubt  is exactly  what it says, a doubt
   based  on reason, on the logical processes of the mind.
   It is  not a fanciful or speculative doubt, nor is it a
   doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice.  It is the sort
   of doubt  which, if you ask yourself, &#147;Why do I doubt?&#148;
   you can assign a logical reason by way of an answer.
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>   The doubt, I emphasize, must be  reasonable.  It must be
   a reasonable doubt based upon the  evidence in this case
   that you have you heard.  It must  not be a speculative,
   fanciful, imaginary or illusionary  doubt conjured up in
   the mind of  a timid  juror so that  he or she may avoid
   their plain duties or responsibilities. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In oral argument, Crown counsel fairly conceded that the
emphasized portion of the re-instruction constituted reversible
error.  A long and unbroken line of authority from this court
supports that concession:  See R. v. Ford (1991), 12 W.C.B. (2d)
576; R. v. Jenkins (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 440; R. v. Matta,
[1996] O.J. no. 3252 and R. v. Collings (1998), 129 C.C.C. (2d)
218.
[5]  While it post-dated the trial in this case, R. v. Jenkins
was the unanimous judgment of a five judge panel of this court.
The following excerpt at p. 469 of that case explains why it is
wrong to put jurors in the position of having to be able to
articulate a logical response to the question &#147;why do I doubt?&#148;:
          </pre>
    <pre>   This court has held that reasonable doubt should not be
   defined as &#147;a doubt for which, if asked, one could give
   a reason&#148;: R. v. Ford (1991), 12 W.C.B. (2d) 576.  This
   court is of the view that such an instruction tends  to
   shift the burden of proof to the  accused.  It  directs
   jurors to subject any doubt  they may  have to  further
   evaluation and yet it does  not contain  any  standards
   for determining what kind of reason may suffice.   Most
   important, jurors may have a  reasonable doubt  but not
   be able to articulate a reason.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  As was pointed out in Collings, supra, R. v. Lifchus (1997),
118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) neither overrules nor even disapproves
this jurisprudence. Indeed, speaking for the court in Lifchus,
Cory J. expressed an additional concern about defining reasonable
doubt in this way. At p. 11 he said this:
          </pre>
    <pre>     [29]  Nonetheless there is still another problem with
   this definition. It is that certain doubts, although 
   reasonable, are simply incapable of articulation.  For
   instance, there may be something about a person&#146;s
   demeanour in the witness-box which will lead a juror to
   conclude that the witness is not credible.  It may be
   that the juror is unable to point to the precise aspect
   of the witness&#146;s demeanour which was found to be suspicious,
   and as a result cannot articulate either to himself or
   others exactly why the witness should not be believed.
   A juror should not be made to feel that the overall,
   perhaps intangible, effect of a witness&#146;s demeanour
   cannot be taken into consideration is the assessment of
   credibility.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In this case, the error of requiring a juror to be able to
articulate a logical reason for his or her doubt was exacerbated
by the reference to the concept of the timid juror that followed
it in the passage quoted above.
[8]  While we leave for a future case the question whether,
standing on its own,  reference to the timid juror would
constitute reversible error, there is no doubt that this practice
is fraught with risk and ought to be avoided.  It appears nowhere
in the model language set out in R. v. Lifchus, supra.  Moreover,
it can be argued that it may carry the implication that jurors
who acquit are timid and may be avoiding their responsibilities,
while courageous jurors convict.
[9]  In the context of the primary error in this charge, there
may also be an added risk that a conscientious juror who harbours
a reasonable doubt that he or she is simply incapable of
articulating may be encouraged to reject that doubt as
speculative or imaginary for fear of being viewed by other
members of the jury as a timid juror.  Hence, the reference to
the concept of a timid juror in this charge may have exacerbated
the impact of the error that we have found to necessitate a new
trial.
[10] The appeal from conviction is allowed and a new trial is
ordered.

                                               &#147;S. Goudge J.A.&#148;
