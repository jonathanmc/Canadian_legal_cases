    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Doyle J. dated March 5, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>MOLDAVER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Robert Kerr, appeals from the order of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Doyle, dated March 5, 1999, dismissing his
motion for summary judgment and allowing a cross-motion for
summary judgment brought by the respondents Michael Quigley, the
law firm of Quigley, Ross &amp; Cliffen and National Trust Company
(&#147;National&#148;).
[2]  In his motion for summary judgment, Kerr sought a
declaration that the sale of his farm property, by way of power
of sale under mortgage, from National to the respondent Glen
Sweeney, was void due to contraventions of the Farm Debt Review
Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-2.3 (&#147;the Act&#148;).  Kerr also sought a
declaration that he retained ownership in the property.  In their
cross-motion, the several respondents sought a declaration that
the sale was valid and that Kerr&#146;s ownership in the property was
extinguished.  The net effect of Doyle J.&#146;s order was to validate
the sale and extinguish Kerr&#146;s interest in the property.
[3]  Kerr submits that Doyle J. erred in coming to this
conclusion for two reasons:

1. The transfer of title from National to Sweeney was
   invalid because the notice of sale under which National purported
   to act was served on Kerr during the currency of a stay of
   proceedings under the Act and as such, it was a nullity; and
2. That an earlier notice of sale served on Kerr prior to
   the stay of proceedings could not be relied upon to validate the
   sale because it did not comply with the notice provisions under
   the Act and as such, it too was a nullity.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In order to place the appellant&#146;s arguments in their proper
context, I propose to reproduce the relevant provisions of the
Act before summarizing the background facts.</pre>
    <pre>RELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS

          thirty days each.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The pertinent facts are not in dispute.  At all material
times, Kerr carried on business as a livestock farmer.  In 1973,
he purchased the farm property in question.  Twelve years later,
in 1985, Kerr mortgaged the property to Kathryn Rycroft as
trustee for Anne Quigley, the respondent Quigley&#146;s spouse.
[6]  On April 20, 1994, Ms. Rycroft assigned the mortgage to
National as trustee for RRSP  #85424, the personal RRSP of
Quigley.  The mortgage came due on April 14, 1995 and at Kerr&#146;s
request, National extended the term to January 21, 1996.  The
mortgage contained a standard power of sale clause which entitled
National to sell the property on at least 35 days&#146; notice to Kerr
in the event of default of payment for at least 15 days.
[7]  Kerr ran into financial difficulties in the summer of 1995
and he was unable to maintain the monthly mortgage payments.  By
September 1996, he was in arrears under the mortgage in excess of
one year.  Accordingly, on September 13, 1996, Quigley, Ross &amp;
Cliffen, the solicitors for National, prepared a notice of sale
and served it on Kerr.  The notice required Kerr to pay the sum
of $50,582.05, then due and owing under the mortgage, by November
10, 1996, failing which, the property would be sold.  On
September 19, 1996, an amended notice of sale was prepared and
served on Kerr.  Apart from revising the amount said to be due
and owing under the mortgage from $50,582.05 to $54,310.87, the
amended notice was identical to the original notice.
[8]  On November 29, 1996, National&#146;s solicitors served Kerr with
a document entitled &#147;NOTICE,&#148; which read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                            NOTICE
          </pre>
    <pre>          THIS SHALL BE your good and valid notice
          pursuant to the Farm Debt Review Act, R.S.C.
          1985, c. 25 that a secured creditor namely
          National Trust Company as trustee for RRSP
          No. 85424, (being the assignee of mortgage
          inst. No. 136534) intends to realize upon its
          security in the above noted property.
          </pre>
    <pre>[9]  Reading between the lines, it would appear that sometime
after the September 19th amended notice of sale had been served
on Kerr, National&#146;s solicitors became aware of the notice
requirements under s. 22(1) and (2) of the Act and in an effort
to comply with those requirements, the notice referred to above
was prepared and served on Kerr.
[10] It is common ground that the November 29th &#147;NOTICE&#148; was
deficient in two respects.  First, it was not in the form
prescribed by the Act and second, it should have been served on
Kerr at least 15 days before National took any action to realize
on its security.
[11] Despite these deficiencies, Kerr either knew of or became
aware of his right to obtain a stay of proceedings under s. 23 of
the Act and on December 4, 1996, he applied for and received an
automatic 30 day stay of proceedings from the Farm Debt Review
Board.  Thereafter, Kerr applied for two further extensions of
the stay and the Board, in the exercise of its discretion,
extended the stay period to March 4, 1997.
[12] On December 12, 1996, during the currency of the initial 30-
day stay, National served Kerr with another notice of sale.  The
amount said to be due and owing under the mortgage was
$54,310.67, the same amount claimed in the September 19th amended
notice of sale.   Pursuant to the December 12th notice, Kerr was
given until January 28, 1997 to pay the outstanding balance,
failing which the property would be sold.  Six days later, on
December 18, 1996, National served Kerr with a document entitled
&#147;Notice of Intent to Realize on Security.&#148;  It is conceded that
this document complied with the form of notice prescribed by s.
22(1) of the Act.
[13] Thereafter, National took no steps to realize upon its
security until after March 4, 1997, when the final stay of
proceedings expired.  Some three and a half months later, on June
13, 1997, National sold the property under power of sale to
Sweeney for a purchase price of $40,000.
[14] For present purposes, it is unnecessary to itemize or detail
the contents of the conveyancing documents which National
registered on title.2 Suffice it to say that they recite the fact
that the property was being sold by National under power of sale
in accordance with its contractual rights under the Kerr
mortgage.  The only fly in the ointment is that throughout, the
documents refer to and purport to rely on the December 12, 1996
notice of sale served on Kerr during the currency of the initial
30-day stay.
[15] Several months after the sale had been completed, Kerr
commenced an action against the various respondents, seeking
among other things, a declaration that the transfer documents
registered on title &#147;are void and of no force or effect as they
contravene the provisions of the Farm Debt Review Act&#148; and a
further declaration that Kerr &#147;is the owner of the farm.&#148;
Following the exchange of pleadings, both sides moved before
Doyle J. for summary judgment.
[16] On the motion, Kerr took the position that the transfer from
National to Sweeney should be set aside because none of the
notices of sale served on him complied with the provisions of the
Act and accordingly, they were nullities.  In particular, Kerr
argued that the September 19, 1996 amended notice of sale was a
nullity because National had failed to comply with the notice
provisions under s. 22 of the Act and the December 12, 1996
notice of sale was a nullity because it was served during the
currency of the initial 30-day stay.
[17] Doyle J. refused to give effect to either submission.  In
his view, there was no reason to distinguish the September 19th
amended notice of sale from the December 12th notice and no need
to engage in a separate analysis of each.  Rather, as the
following passage from his reasons illustrates, based on his
interpretation of the relevant authorities, including this
court&#146;s decision in Calvert v. Salmon (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) 455,
neither notice was a nullity and since the final act in the power
of sale proceedings (the sale of the property) did not occur
during the currency of the extended stay period but only after
Kerr had received the full protection of the Act, there was no
basis for setting aside the sale:
          </pre>
    <pre>    Even though the notices had not contained any reference to
    sections 20 and 22(1) and (2) of the Farm Debt Review Act, they
    were not nullities &#133; Nothing was acted on during the stays of
    proceedings with respect to a final act.  The case law did not
    prevent steps being taken during the stays and the final step
    involved a foreclosure order but only after stays had terminated.
    Possession of a property after default in payment is also a final
    step as is a Power of Sale.
          </pre>
    <pre>[18] Doyle J. then went on to find that Kerr had suffered no
prejudice as a result of any deficiencies in the respective
notices and he accordingly concluded that the sale to Sweeney was
valid and that Kerr&#146;s interest in the property was extinguished.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1 &#150; Was the December 12 notice of sale a nullity and if so,
did this invalidate the sale?</pre>
    <pre>[19] In support of his position that the December 12th notice of
sale, served during the currency of the initial 30-day stay, was
a nullity, Kerr relied heavily on the recent decision of the
Supreme Court of Canada in M &amp; D Farm Ltd. v. Manitoba
Agricultural Credit Corp., [1999] S.C.J. No. 4.3  For reasons
which will become apparent when I address the second issue, I
find it unnecessary to discuss that decision because in the final
analysis, I am of the view that the validity or invalidity of the
December 12 notice is inconsequential.  Suffice it to say that
for the purposes of this appeal, I am prepared to assume that it
was a nullity.
[20] That said, I feel obliged to comment on the reasoning
process which led the motions judge to conclude that the December
12th notice was not a nullity.  In coming to that conclusion, it
would appear that Doyle J. was of the view that even though the
notice in question was served during the currency of the initial
30-day stay, it was not a nullity because service of the notice
did not amount to a &#147;final act&#148; in the power of sale proceedings.
[21] The &#147;final act&#148; line of reasoning was specifically rejected
by this court in Calvert v. Salmon, supra, at p. 458 and Doyle J.
should not have applied it in deciding whether the December 12th
notice was or was not a nullity. As indicated, however, this
appeal does not turn on the validity or invalidity of the
December 12th notice.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2 &#150; Was the September 19th amended notice of sale a
nullity?  If not, can it be relied upon to validate the sale?</pre>
    <pre>[22] By virtue of s. 22(1) and (2) of the Act, National was
required to notify Kerr of his rights under s. 20 of the Act at
least 15 days before serving him with the September 19th amended
notice of sale.  Because this was not done, Kerr submits that the
amended notice was a nullity.
[23] The same argument was raised and rejected in Calvert v.
Salmon, supra, where this court held that failure to give notice
under s. 22 of the Act before issuing a claim for foreclosure of
a mortgage on farm property did not render the claim a nullity.4
Rather, as was pointed out at p. 458, the deficiency was to be
treated as a &#147;continuing breach of the obligation, and the
penalty to be imposed, if any, [was to] be governed by the
circumstances.&#148;
[24] Not unlike this case, in Calvert, even though the farmer had
not received the requisite notice under s. 22 of the Act, he was
fully aware of his right to apply for a stay of proceedings under
s. 20 of the Act and he took advantage of that right.  In the
circumstances, the court found that Calvert had suffered no
prejudice as a result of the lack of notice under s. 22 of the
Act and accordingly, there was no basis for invalidating the
foreclosure proceedings.
[25] The same holds true in this case.  The fact that Kerr did
not receive the requisite notice under the Act before being
served with the September 19th amended notice of sale did not
render the amended notice a nullity.  By whatever means, Kerr
became aware of his rights under s. 20 of the Act and took full
advantage of them.  Moreover, as the record indicates, Kerr had
more than an ample opportunity to redeem the property.
Unfortunately, from his point of view, he was simply unable to
arrange the necessary financing.  In short, National&#146;s failure to
provide Kerr with the requisite notice under s. 22 of the Act
before serving him with the September 19th amended notice of sale
caused no prejudice to Kerr.
[26] Having concluded that the September 19th amended notice of
sale was not a nullity, and that Kerr suffered no prejudice, the
only remaining issue is whether the amended notice can be relied
upon to validate the sale.  This issue arises from the fact that
the conveyancing documents, registered on title, refer to and
purport to rely on the December 12th notice of sale and not the
September 19th amended notice.
[27] Kerr submits that the amended notice cannot be substituted
for the December 12th notice to validate the sale.  In his view,
having relied on the December 12th notice, National must live
with that and if that notice is a nullity, the transfer was
invalid and title did not pass to Sweeney.  The respondents on
the other hand submit that on their face, the conveyancing
documents express a clear intention on the part of National to
enforce its contractual rights under the mortgage and convey
title by way of power of sale and to the extent the December 12th
notice is a nullity, title can be founded on the valid
September 19th amended notice of sale.
[28] The issue in question does not appear to have been addressed
in any recent authorities.  It did, however, arise in the case of
Kelly v. Imperial Loan and Investment Co. (1885), 11 S.C.R. 516
(S.C.C.).  The facts of Kelly, briefly stated, are as follows.
[29] Imperial held a mortgage from Kelly over certain leasehold
premises owned by Kelly.  The mortgage contained a covenant
authorizing Imperial to sell the premises on default, with or
without notice to the mortgagor.
[30] Shortly after giving the mortgage, Kelly conveyed the equity
of redemption in the mortgaged premises to one O&#146;Sullivan, in
trust, for nominal consideration.  Kelly then left the country
for several years.  In his absence, the mortgage came due and it
was renewed by O&#146;Sullivan.
[31] Interest payments on the mortgage went into default and
Imperial advised O&#146;Sullivan of its intention to foreclose on the
mortgage.  Faced with this threat, O&#146;Sullivan, who had earlier
informed Imperial that he had no interest in the property,
purported to reconvey the equity of redemption back to Kelly.
Thereafter, Imperial brought an action against O&#146;Sullivan for
foreclosure.  O&#146;Sullivan filed a defence, which he later withdrew
at the behest of Imperial.  In the end, he consented to a decree
and a final order of foreclosure was made against him.
[32] On the basis of that order, Imperial eventually sold the
property to one Damer for a sum less than the amount due under
the mortgage.  Notably, in the deed to Damer, Imperial recited
the proceedings against O&#146;Sullivan, including the fact that it
had obtained title to the property under the final order of
foreclosure.
[33] Upon his return to Canada, Kelly learned of the final order
of foreclosure against O&#146;Sullivan.  At this point, the sale to
Damer had not yet been completed.  Kelly advised Damer of his
interest in the property and he notified Imperial not to sell.
His request fell on deaf ears and the sale to Damer was
completed.  Kelly then brought an action to have the final order
of foreclosure re-opened and cancelled, the sale to Damer set
aside and an account taken of what was due under the mortgage.
[34] At trial, Proudfoot V.C. found in favour of Kelly, holding
that the decree of foreclosure was improperly obtained because
Imperial knew that O&#146;Sullivan had no interest in the property.
On appeal, the Court of Appeal reversed this decision, holding
that irrespective of the validity of the foreclosure order and
notwithstanding the recital of this order in the deed to Damer,
Imperial could rely on the power of sale provision in the
mortgage to validate the sale.
[35] On further appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, Sir
William Ritchie C.J., for the majority, agreed with the Court of
Appeal and affirmed the validity of the sale to Damer.  One of
the issues raised by Kerr was that the transfer of title to Damer
was fatally flawed by reason of the recitals in the deed which
indicated that Imperial had obtained title to the property from
the final order of foreclosure against O&#146;Sullivan.
[36] Sir William Ritchie C.J. refused to give effect to this
argument.  His reasons, which are, in my view, dispositive of the
issue at hand, are reproduced in part below:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The recitals would seem to be 
	  inconsistent with the execution of the power,
	  but the nature and effect of the instrument is
	  entirely consistent therewith, and demonstrates, I
          think, a practical intent to execute the power, 
	  though, no doubt, the recital would show that the
	  deed was executed on the assumption that the
	  foreclosure was valid and that the property
          had thereby absolutely passed to the mortgagees.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    The power authorized the defendants
          to convey the interest mortgaged absolutely;
          the deed executed purports to do, in express
          terms, that which the mortgagees had the
          right to do, if not under the decree of
          foreclosure then under the power.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Then why should the deed,
          notwithstanding the recital, not receive its
          legal effect, and be treated as a good
          execution of the power, the legal effect of
          the deed being precisely the same, whether
          under a valid decree, or, there being no
          valid decree, under the power, the intent
          being to do what the decree, if valid, would
          authorize, or what, if invalid, the power
          would authorize.

    <pre>                    There can, I think, be no doubt
          that an instrument may be an exercise of a
          power, though on its face it does not so
          purport.  In Blake v. Marnell [2 Ball &amp; B.
          35] the Lord Chancellor says:
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is perfectly clear and well
          established that the recital of a power is
          not essential to the due execution of it; it
          is sufficient if the estate over which the
          power extends is dealt with in a manner which
          can be effectual only by reference to the
          power.5
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[37] Applying this line of reasoning to the case at hand, even if
the December 12th notice was a nullity, I am satisfied that the
September 19th amended notice can properly be relied upon to fill
the gap as it were and validate the sale.  Accordingly, I would
not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[38] The motions judge concluded that the sale from National to
Sweeney was valid and that there was no basis for setting it
aside.  I agree with that conclusion, albeit it for reasons
somewhat different than those given by the motions judge.
Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

Mediation Act, S.C. 1997, c. 21.
2     The  respondent  law firm Beament, Green,  Dust  acted  for
National  on  the sale and prepared the necessary  documentation.
The  Beament  firm was named as one of the defendants  in  Kerr&#146;s
action to set aside the sale.  Kerr concedes that if the sale was
valid,  the  motions  judge was correct in dismissing  his  claim
against the Beament firm.
3 In M &amp; D, relevant provincial legislation required that a
mortgagee obtain leave from the court before commencing
foreclosure proceedings against a farmer, failing which the
proceedings would be a nullity.  The respondent mortgagee sought
and obtained the necessary leave order during the currency of the
initial 30-day stay under s. 23 of the Farm Debt Review Act.  The
Supreme Court held that by virtue of s. 23, the order granting
leave was invalid and that the failure to comply with the
provincial leave requirement rendered the foreclosure proceedings
a nullity.
4 In M &amp; D, supra, the Supreme Court referred to Calvert with
approval but found that it had no application to the case at
hand.
5    The minority did not take issue with this line of reasoning.
Rather,  they  viewed  the  reference  to  the  final  order   of
foreclosure in the deed as tantamount to a recital that  Imperial
had become the absolute owner of the estate and that the power of
sale,  being an incident to the equity of redemption,  no  longer
existed.</pre></td>
