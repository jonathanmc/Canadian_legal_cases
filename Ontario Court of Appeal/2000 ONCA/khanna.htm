    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by the plaintiff from the order of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Cumming striking out the statement of
claim as against the respondent Alan Bromstein pursuant to rule
21.01(1)(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
[2]  The court is divided.  Abella J.A., dissenting, would
dismiss the appeal for the reasons given by the motions judge
which she adopts. The majority would allow the appeal and dismiss
the motion before Cumming J. for the reasons that follow.
[3]  The case against the defendant Bromstein is framed in
malicious prosecution.  The case is novel in that it is brought
against a solicitor who did not institute the disciplinary
proceedings against the plaintiff but took over the prosecution
and conducted it thereafter on behalf of the Royal College of
Dental Surgeons until its unsuccessful termination.  However,
novelty is not a bar to an action at the pleading stage.  In the
majority&#146;s view, the pleadings, if they can be proven, could
constitute a case of malicious prosecution.
[4]  Another claim asserted is that all the defendants, including
Bromstein, conspired together to injure the plaintiff by unlawful
means.  Particulars are provided.  This pleading should be
allowed to stand.
[5]  The majority has a major concern about the balance of the
causes of action asserted.  Some do not appear to be stand-alone
causes of action but, as pleaded, they could well constitute
constituent elements of the tort of malicious prosecution, i.e.
breach of procedural fairness, abuse of power and intimidation.
Others are merely pleadings of damages.  However, while the
pleadings are poorly drawn, it is apparent that yet another
amendment is unlikely to clarify the issues.  The plaintiff
should be left to stew in his pleadings such as they are.
[6]  In the majority&#146;s view, the matter should proceed to trial.
It will be up to the trial judge to assess the merits of the
various claims in the light of the evidence.
[7]  For these reasons, the appeal is allowed, the order of
Cumming J. is set aside and the motion is dismissed.  The
appellant is entitled to his costs here and below.</pre>
