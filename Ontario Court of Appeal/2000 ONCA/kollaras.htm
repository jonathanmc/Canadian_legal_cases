</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Gans dated April 28, 1999</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</strong>[1]        The appellant appeals the judgment of Gans J. awarding
Angeliki  Kollaras  (the &#147;respondent&#148;) damages  as  a  result  of
injuries  sustained in the Athens airport.  The respondents  seek
leave to appeal the disposition of the costs of the trial made by
the trial judge.
[2]   On  April 13, 1990, the respondent was struck on the  right
temple when an automatic sliding glass door closed on her at  the
Athens  airport  (the &#147;incident&#148;).  As a result,  an  action  for
damages  was commenced against the appellant as the occupier  and
operator  of  the  airport terminal building.   A  second  action
alleging medical negligence was also commenced with respect to an
operation  that was performed on the respondent&#146;s  brain  shortly
after  the  incident.   The two actions were  tried  together  in
January  and February 1999.  In the first action, the  respondent
and  members  of  her  family were awarded  damages  against  the
appellant and the second action was dismissed without costs.   No
appeal is taken from the judgment in the second action.
[3]  At trial, the appellant argued that the law to be applied in
the determination of liability and damages was the law of Greece.
The trial judge found that the appellant had failed to prove that
the law of Greece was different from the law of Ontario. He
carefully reviewed the extensive evidence of the circumstances
relating to the incident and held that the appellant was the
occupier of the premises and solely responsible for the
maintenance and operation of the automatic sliding doors.
Relying essentially on the evidence adduced on behalf of the
appellant, he further held that the appellant permitted an unsafe
condition to continue which could have easily been rectified.
There had been no contributory negligence on the part of the
respondent.
[4]  At the time of the incident, the respondent was 68 years of
age.  Although, unknowingly, she suffered from a condition
associated with Alzheimer&#146;s disease, her medical history had been
unremarkable.  At the time of the trial, her condition had
markedly deteriorated and she had become a victim of the disease.
[5]  The trial judge found that the force of the blow to the
respondent&#146;s right temple was not trivial.  Relying on the
evidence of a medical expert, he also found that the trauma and
stress associated with the incident and the subsequent brain
surgery which was causally connected to the incident collectively
served to unmask if not accelerate the onset of Alzheimer&#146;s
disease.  He concluded that the respondent&#146;s health problems had
been accelerated by a period of three years. The trial judge
recognized that the appellant was not obliged to compensate the
respondent for the effects of the pre-existing condition which
the respondent would have experienced in any event.  (Athey v.
Leonati (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 235 (S.C.C.).)  He awarded the
respondent damages for loss of enjoyment of life for a period of
three years.
[6]  The trial judge assessed the general and special damages,
including compensation  to the respondent&#146;s daughter-in-law for
attendant care based on the costs of hiring caregiver services.
He also assessed damages under the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. F.3 for members of the respondent&#146;s family.
[7]  While ordinarily a daughter-in-law would not fall within the
category of persons entitled to make a claim for loss of
affection under the Family Law Act, in the unusual circumstances
of this case we note that here there was evidence that a support
obligation had been assumed that was indicative of the
relationship that existed prior to the accident.
[8]  The appellant has in effect argued this appeal as a re-
hearing of the action, with little consideration, if any, given
to the findings of the trial judge.  We essentially agree and
adopt the trial judge&#146;s extensive and considered reasons.  His
findings are based on the evidence and reveal no error of law.
[9]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
[10] The respondents seek leave to appeal the order of party-and-
party costs made by the trial judge. They claim to be entitled to
an award of solicitor-and-client costs.
[11] The trial judge recognized that the plaintiff had &#147;bettered
the offer in monetary terms&#148;.  Nevertheless, he concluded that,
in all the circumstances, the respondents had not satisfied the
burden imposed under rule 49.10 (3) of the Rules of Civil
Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  This was a difficult
situation, particularly because of the medical negligence action
that had been tried with this action and dismissed without costs.
The respondents were not entitled to recover all their costs from
the appellant and the trial judge wisely issued directions for
the assessment of costs.
[12] The trial judge was in a far better position that this court
to assess this entire and complex situation.  Considering the
wide discretion which  must be accorded to the trial judge on
this issue, we see no proper basis to interfere.
[13] Leave to appeal is granted but this appeal is also dismissed
with costs.
