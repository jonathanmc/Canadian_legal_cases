    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Soliman A. Mangal
               For the appellant</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               Andrew C. Lewis
               For the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         July 4, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Campbell J. dated September 4, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</strong>[1]  While it would have been preferable if the plaintiff&#146;s
statement of claim contained more particulars than it did with
respect to the claim of Kortech Inc., it is clear that Kortech
was asserting the claim against the defendant to which the trial
judge gave effect.
[2]  Apart from this pleading point, the only other issue raised
on the appeal was whether or not five months was the appropriate
period as a basis for the award of damages.  The appellant
submitted that it was far too high.
[3]  While we would have been inclined to base our award on a
lesser period of time, we cannot say that the trial judge&#146;s award
is outside the acceptable range.  Accordingly, the appeal is
dismissed with costs.</pre>
