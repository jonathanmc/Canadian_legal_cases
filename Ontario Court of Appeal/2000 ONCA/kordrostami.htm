    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction of Hockin J. dated November 10, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>SHARPE J.A.:</strong>


[1]  The appellant, a 39 year old man, met the complainant, a 14
year old girl, at a McDonald&#146;s restaurant. The appellant made
certain sexually explicit comments. He asked the complainant
whether she had ever modeled topless, whether she was sexually
active or had ever engaged in a &#147;threesome&#148;.  The complainant
testified that the appellant knew her name and telephone number.
She denied giving the appellant her telephone number. It was the
appellant&#146;s evidence that the complainant was receptive to his
comments and that she had given him her telephone number. He
thought the complainant was older than 14. The conversation ended
when the complainant saw a friend and waved him over to the
table. The appellant left and she told her friend what had
happened. The complainant&#146;s friend went outside and took the
appellant&#146;s license plate number and the complainant spoke to the
McDonald&#146;s manager.
[2]  The appellant telephoned the complainant the next day and
made further sexual overtures. She told him that if he called
again he would be &#147;in a lot of trouble&#148; and that he was a &#147;sick
pervert&#148;. The complainant noted on her call display the name of
the company from which the call originated. That company was the
appellant&#146;s employer. The complainant was sufficiently concerned
about the appellant to call the police.
[3]  While the appellant denied making any further calls, the
complainant testified that she received several hang-up calls
over the next several days. The caller said nothing and hung up
after she answered. The complainant testified that her call
display indicated that several of the calls came from the
appellant&#146;s place of employment. She testified how she felt as a
result of these calls:
          
     Scared, frightened, I didn&#146;t know what was going to happen.
     I thought he was stalking me.
          

[4]  The trial judge found that the complainant had given the
appellant her telephone number. However, he also found that the
appellant had made the hang-up calls, that the calls made the
complainant fear for her safety, and that &#147;the accused knew that
any future contact would amount to harassment&#148;. He convicted the
appellant and imposed a suspended sentence of 18 months.

Issues

[5]  The appellant submits before this court that on the
evidence, there is not a proper basis for a conviction for
criminal harassment under s. 264 (1) of the Criminal Code. In
particular, it is the appellant&#146;s position that the complainant
was not &#147;harassed&#148; and that she did not &#147;reasonably&#148; fear for her
safety.  The appellant also argues that the trial judge&#146;s finding
that  he knew that the complainant  was harassed by his conduct
cannot be supported by the evidence.

Analysis


[6]  Section 264(1) and (2) provides as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          
          264. (1)  No person shall, without lawful authority and
          knowing that another person is harassed or recklessly as to
          whether the other person is harassed, engage in conduct
	  referred to in subsection (2) that causes that other person
	  reasonably, in all the circumstances, to fear for their safety
	  or the safety of anyone known to them.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  The conduct mentioned in subsection (1) consists of:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  repeatedly following from place to place the other
          person or anyone known to them;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  repeatedly communicating with, either directly or
          indirectly, the other person or anyone known to them;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  besetting or watching the dwelling-house, or place
          where the other person, or anyone known to them, resides,
          works, carries on business or happens to be; or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)   engaging in threatening conduct directed at the other
          person or any member of their family.
     

[7]  The trial judge did not have the benefit of this court&#146;s
decision in R. v. Kosikar (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 217, adopting
the analysis of R. v. Lamontagne (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 181
(Que. C.A.) and R. v. Sillip (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 384 (Alta.
C.A.), identifying and explaining the elements of this offence.
Accordingly, he did not analyze the case precisely in the
language of those cases. In my view, however, a fair reading of
the evidence and of the trial judge&#146;s findings demonstrates that
all of the elements of the offence were established.
[8]  As set out in Kosikar, supra, Lamontagne, supra, and Sillip,
supra, the elements of the offence are as follows:</pre>
    <pre>  1)   It must be established that the accused has engaged in the
       conduct set out in s. 264(2)(a), (b), (c), or (d) of the Criminal
       Code;</pre>
    <pre>  2)   It must be established that the complainant was harassed;</pre>
    <pre>  3)   It must be established that the accused who engaged in such
       conduct knew that the complainant was harassed or was reckless or
       willfully blind as to whether the complainant was harassed;</pre>
    <pre>  4)   It must be established that the conduct caused the
       complainant to fear for her safety or the safety of anyone known
       to her; and</pre>
    <pre>  5)   It must be established that the complainant&#146;s fear was, in
       all the circumstances, reasonable.
     
(1) Conduct Defined in s. 264 (2) (a) to (d).

[9]  The trial judge found that the appellant had repeatedly
communicated with the complainant. This falls within s. 264(2) (a).

(2)  Harassment

[10] Mr. Greenspan submits that the finding that the complainant
was &#147;harassed&#148; cannot be sustained. In his reasons for judgment,
the trial judge adopted a dictionary meaning of harassed as
repeated communication with the complainant that is unwelcome. In
Sillip, supra, Lamontagne, supra and Kosikar, supra, harassed is
defined as &#147;tormented, troubled, worried continually or
chronically, plagued, bedeviled and badgered&#148;. Mr. Greenspan
submits that these words must be read cumulatively, so that a
conviction could not be sustained unless it has been proven
beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainant experienced the
mental state expressed by these words as a whole.  It is
submitted that the failure of the trial judge to advert to this
stricter standard is fatal to the conviction. It is also
submitted that making a few hang-up calls falls short of conduct
of sufficient gravity to warrant a conviction for criminal
harassment. It was pointed out that calls of this kind are
covered by another, less serious offence of harassing telephone
calls, under s. 372(3).
[11] I do not view the list of words used in Lamontagne, supra
and Kosikar, supra as cumulative. Nor do they replace the word
&#147;harassed&#148; in the Criminal Code. In their origin in R. v. Sillip,
supra, at p. 393 they were stated to be individually synonyms for
&#147;harassed&#148;; see also R. v. Ryback (1996) 105 C.C.C. (3d) 240
(B.C.C.A) at p. 248 where this point is made. Thus, it would be
harassment to be &#147;plagued&#148; in one context and &#147;bedeviled&#148; in
another.
[12] While I agree that the trial judge appears to adopt a less
strict meaning of harassed, it is my view that his factual
findings fully support the conclusion that the complainant was
harassed within the meaning of s. 264(1). The hang-up calls
cannot be seen in isolation from other relevant facts. In order
to appreciate the impact of the calls and the gravity of the
wrong committed by the perpetrator of the calls, the entire
factual context must be considered. In Kosikar, supra, the court
took into account the entire history of the relationship between
the parties in finding that a single incident was found to be a
sufficient basis to establish harassment; see also R. v. Riossi
(1997), 6 C.R. (5th) 123 (Ont. Gen. Div.).
[13]  In the present case, the factual context includes the
earlier conversation at the restaurant and the first call made by
the appellant. The trial judge found that the complainant had
called the appellant a &#147;pervert&#148; and that she explicitly told him
that if he called her back he would be in a lot of trouble. She
was sufficiently alarmed by the appellant&#146;s conduct at the
restaurant to speak to the manager. After receiving the
appellant&#146;s first call, she called the police. The trial judge
found that the calls made by the appellant caused the complainant
to fear for her safety.
[14] In my view, on these findings, the complainant was harassed
within the meaning of s. 264(1). To the extent the synonyms
adopted from Sillip, supra, serve to elucidate the meaning of
harassment, I have no difficulty in concluding on the findings of
the trial judge that the complainant was &#147;tormented&#148;, &#147;troubled&#148;,
&#147;plagued&#148; or &#147;bedeviled&#148; as a result of the appellant&#146;s conduct.
Where a 39 year old man persists in making several hang-up calls
to a young girl after having invited her to engage in a threesome
and having been told that she regards him as a &#147;pervert&#148; on
account of his unwanted overtures, the young girl has been
harassed.

(3)  Knowledge or Recklessness

[15] I see no reason to interfere with the trial judge&#146;s finding
that on these facts, &#147;the accused knew that any future contact
would amount to harassment&#148;. On this point as well, the hang-up
calls cannot be viewed in isolation. Their impact on the
complainant, and the appellant&#146;s perception of the impact they
would have, must be seen in light of the earlier exchange and the
first call when he was unequivocally told to leave her alone; see
R. v. Krushel; R. v. Connors; R. v. Grey, [2000] O.J. No. 302 at
para. 26 where Catzman J.A. citing R v. Ryback, supra and R v.
Kosikar, supra states that this is a proper use of such prior
conduct.</pre>
    <pre>(4)  Fear for Safety

[16] The complainant testified that she was &#147;scared&#148; and
&#147;frightened&#148; by the appellant&#146;s calls and that she thought that
she was being &#147;stalked&#148;. This evidence fully supports the trial
judge&#146;s finding that she feared for her safety.

(5)  Reasonableness of Fear

[17] Nor do I see any reason to interfere with the finding that
this fear was reasonable, in light of the age of the complainant,
the nature of the &#147;sexually charged&#148; conversation they had at the
restaurant, and the very explicit direction she had given him to
leave her alone; see, for example, R. v. Lafreniere, [1994] O.J.
No. 437 (Ont. Prov. Div.) at para. 23 and R. v. Sousa, [1995]
O.J. No. 1435 (Ont. Gen. Div.) at para. 6 where similar personal
characteristics were used to assess the reasonableness of the
complainant&#146;s fear.  See also R v. Krushel, supra, at para. 26
where pre-charge conduct was stated to be relevant to the
reasonableness of the complainant&#146;s fear.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion
</pre>
    <pre>[18] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.
