    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Michael Dambrot dated
April 3, 1998</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the decision of Dambrot J. dismissing
the appellant&#146;s appeal from conviction.  Dambrot J. did allow the
sentence  appeal  in part by striking out the term  of  probation
requiring  the  appellant  to  complete  two  hundred  hours   of
community  service.  However, the appellant also seeks to  appeal
the sentence.
[2]  As this is an appeal from the summary conviction appeal
court, the appellant is restricted to questions of law alone.
The appellant raises two issues.  He argues that Kerr Prov. Ct.
J. unduly intervened and that when the record is read as a whole
it appears that the trial judge was not satisfied of the
appellant&#146;s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
[3]  Dambrot J. considered the question of undue intervention and
was satisfied that the interventions did not show bias nor
prevent the appellant from presenting his case.  The test for
whether there has been undue intervention was described by Martin
J.A. in R. v. Valley (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 207, at 230:
          </pre>
    <pre>              A criminal  trial is,  in  the  main, an
	adversarial  process, not an  investigation by 
	the judge of  the charge against  the accused, 
	and, accordingly,  the examination  and cross-
	examination  of  witnesses are  primarily  the 
	responsibility of counsel. The judge, however,
	is  not  required to  remain  silent.  He  may
	question  witnesses  to  clear up ambiguities, 
	explore some matter which  the answers  of  a 
	witness have left vague or, indeed, he may put
        questions  which should have been put to bring
	out some relevant matter, but which have  been
	omitted. Generally speaking,  the  authorities
	recommend  that  questions by the judge should 
	be   put  after  counsel  has  completed   his
	examination, and the witnesses  should not  be
        cross-examined  by  the  judge  during   their
        examination-in-chief.</pre>
    <pre>[4]   In  our view, most of the interventions by the trial judge,
prior to the finding of guilt, were innocuous and intended by the
judge to clear up ambiguities and assist him in understanding the
appellant&#146;s unusual explanation.  While it would have been better
if the trial judge had followed the advice of Martin J.A., we are
not  satisfied that Dambrot J. erred in law in refusing  to  give
effect to this ground of appeal.
[5]  As to the second ground of appeal, having considered the
entire record, we are of the view that the trial judge was
satisfied of the appellant&#146;s guilt to the requisite degree.  The
trial judge clearly rejected the primary defence, that the
appellant did not steal the goods but rather brought them with
him to the store.  This left only the question of mens rea.  The
appellant never asserted that he took the goods to test the
social assistance people who he claimed were following him.  His
position was that he did not take them.  We see no error in the
trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the appellant had the requisite
mens rea.  His subsequent comments and directions were directed
to ensuring that an appropriate sentence was imposed and do not
detract from the finding of guilt.
[6]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave
to appeal sentence is refused.
