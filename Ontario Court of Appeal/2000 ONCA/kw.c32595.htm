    <pre>HEARD:         January 18, 2000</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the disposition imposed by Douglas J. dated July
5, 1999.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </pre>
    <pre>                                
[1]  As the Crown properly concedes, a disposition totaling three
and  one-half years is illegal as it exceeds the two-year maximum
prescribed by s.20(3) of the Young Offenders Act.  Therefore,  it
falls upon this court to impose a sentence that complies with the
law  and balances the various factors and principles set  out  in
the Young Offenders Act.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  We agree with counsel for the appellant that the trial judge
erred  in  principle in using factors concerning adult  offenders
virtually to the exclusion of the principles set out in the Young
Offenders Act.  This error led the trial judge to impose  a  very
lengthy  term  of  custody.  Having said that, this  was  a  very
serious offence which had a serious impact on the complainant and
her  family.  While there was some indication that the  appellant
was  making  some progress in treatment, the expert reports  were
equivocal  and  provided  little assistance  in  determining  the
underlying cause of this very serious conduct.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant served approximately three and one-half months
of the secure custody term before being released on bail and also
spent  one and one-half months in pre-disposition custody.  While
we  are always reluctant to return a young offender to custody in
circumstances such as these, we believe that the appellant  could
continue to benefit from the treatment available at the Syl  Apps
Youth  Centre  and  that such treatment may be required  for  the
protection of the public.</pre>
    <pre>[4]   Reducing the custodial portion of the disposition  to  nine
months,  as  we  intend to do, and taking into account  the  pre-
disposition  custody, this means that in effect the appellant  is
subject to a disposition of twelve months.  This is a significant
custodial term given the appellant&#146;s age and background.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Accordingly,  the  appeal is allowed  and  the  disposition
reduced  to  nine  months  secure  custody  and  fifteen   months
probation on the same terms as those imposed by the trial judge.
