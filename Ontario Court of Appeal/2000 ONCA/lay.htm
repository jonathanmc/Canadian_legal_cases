    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Madam Justice Speigel dated October
16, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ABELLA J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The parties entered into a marriage contract on May 24,
1985, the day before their marriage.  Under the terms of that
contract, the wife was to retain sole ownership of certain
property &#147;free from any claims by the husband.&#148;  Thirteen years
later, the wife, as petitioner in a divorce proceeding, brought a
motion under Rule 21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure for an order
to determine an issue before trial.  That issue was the validity
of the marriage contract and, in particular, whether it exempted
the property from the equalization provisions in the Family Law
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3.
[2]  The motions judge, Speigel J., ruled that the contract did
not exempt the property.  She held that it was &#147;obvious that the
intention of the contract was to give the wife sole ownership,
control and enjoyment of the property after the dissolution of
the marriage.&#148;  Notwithstanding this finding, she stated that in
her view this intention was &#147;not adequate to displace the
provisions of the Act regarding equalization of net family
property.&#148;
[3]  Additionally, despite her finding that the parties&#146;
intention was that the wife own, control and keep the property,
she relied on Bosch v. Bosch (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 168 (C.A.) to
conclude that the &#147;parties did not turn their minds to the
division of their assets, or to some other form of economic
redress, upon the dissolution of their marriage.&#148;
[4]  This is an appeal by the wife from that determination.
[5]  With respect, it is my view that the terms of the contract
are sufficiently clear to oust the application of the Family Law
Act.  Moreover, this case turns not on the application of Bosch
but on s. 70(3) of the Family Law Act, a provision to which the
motions judge made no reference.
[6]  Only the first five paragraphs of the brief contract are
relevant to this appeal.  They read:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.  Definitions:
          </pre>
    <pre>              In this agreement, &#147;Property&#148; means
          whatever shares the wife shall from time to
          time beneficially own in the capital of
          240556 Investments Limited and in the capital
          of Michael I. Pitman Holdings Limited whether
          held directly or through an interest in a
          trust or trusts or otherwise and whether held
          at the date hereof or subsequently acquired.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.  Background
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  The parties are to become husband and
          wife by being married on the 25th day of May,
          1985, and throughout this agreement are
          called the &#147;husband&#148; and the &#147;wife&#148;,
          respectively;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  Each desires to determine by
          agreement his or her rights and obligations
          with reference to the ownership of the
          Property during marriage, and if cohabitation
          ceases, his or her rights and obligations
          with reference to the ownership of the
          Property upon separation, or upon the
          annulment or dissolution of the marriage, or
          upon death.
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.  Agreement
          </pre>
    <pre>              The husband and the wife each agree
          to be bound by the provisions of this
          agreement from the time of their marriage.
          </pre>
    <pre>          4.  Separate Property
          </pre>
    <pre>              The wife will retain sole ownership, 
	  control and enjoyment of the Property free
	  from any claim by the husband.
          </pre>
    <pre>          5.  The Family Law Reform Act (Ontario)
          </pre>
    <pre>              All rights and obligations of the
          husband and the wife, whether arising during
          marriage either before or after separation,
          or upon and after divorce or annulment,
          including the rights and obligations of each
          of them with respect to:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a) possession of the Property;  and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b) ownership in or division of the Property,
          </pre>
    <pre>          are governed by this agreement which prevails 
	  over all provisions of the Family Law Reform 
	  Act (Ontario) or any successor.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  This contract was made under the Family Law Reform Act,
R.S.O. 1980, c.152, the legislative ancestor of the 1986 Family
Law Act, S.O. 1986, c.4.  Under s. 70(4) of this Act (s. 70(3) in
the current Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3), the terms of a
valid marriage contract made before March 1, 1986, may, under
certain circumstances, prevail over the equalization provisions
in s. 5 of the Family Law Act.  There were no provisions for the
equalization of family property in the Family Law Reform Act.
[8]  Sections 70(3) and 5(1) of the Family Law Act provide:
          </pre>
    <pre>          70.(3)    A separation agreement or marriage
	  contract that was validly made before the 1st
	  day of March, 1986 and that excludes a spouse&#146;s
	  property from the application of sections 4 and
	  8 of the Family Law Reform Act, being chapter
	  152 of the Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  shall be deemed to exclude that property
	  from the application of section 5 of this Act;
	  and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  shall be read with necessary modifications.
          
               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          5.(1)     When a divorce is granted or a
          marriage is declared a nullity, or when the
          spouses are separated and there is no
          reasonable prospect that they will resume
          cohabitation, the spouse whose net family
          property is the lesser of the two net family
          properties is entitled to one-half the
          difference between them.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The issue in this appeal is whether this marriage contract
satisfies the requirements of s. 70(3).  There is no dispute that
the contract was validly made and pre-dated March 1, 1986.  The
argument centres on whether the contract excluded the application
of sections 4 and 8 of the Family Law Reform Act, the governing
statute when the contract was signed.  Section 4 of that Act
dealt with the division of family assets.  Section 8 permitted
the awarding of compensatory payments or shares in non-family
assets where the property had been obtained or enhanced by the
contributions of a spouse.
[10] The husband relied on this court&#146;s judgments in Bosch, supra
and Calvert v. Calvert (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 221.  In both cases,
the terms of the marriage contract were held not to exclude the
property from the equalization provisions of the Family Law Act.
In my view, the contractual provisions and circumstances in Bosch
and Calvert were sufficiently different from those in this case
to make those cases distinguishable.
[11]   The husband also urged the court to treat the terms of
paragraph 2 of the contract as determinative.  This paragraph
refers to the parties&#146; desire to &#147;determine by agreement his or
her rights and obligations with reference to the ownership of the
Property.&#148;  Since the reference in this paragraph is only to
&#147;ownership&#148; of the property, the husband argues, it cannot be
said that the parties intended also to deal with the &#147;division&#148;
of the property.  At the very least, the language is said to be
ambiguous and, as such, should not be permitted to oust the
application of the equalization provisions.
[12] It is noteworthy that paragraph 2 is under the heading
&#147;Background.&#148;  There is no doubt that an introduction or a
preamble can provide interpretative assistance, but I see no
basis for accepting the novel proposition that its terms can
triumph over those in the body of the contract.  And in this
case, those core terms reflect a clear intention to remove the
wife&#146;s designated property from the legislative grasp of the
Family Law Reform Act or any successor legislation.
[13] In the contract before us, property was defined as the
wife&#146;s shares and capital in two corporations.  The parties
agreed in paragraph 4 of the contract that the wife would retain
sole ownership of this property &#147;free from any claim by the
husband.&#148;  In my view, this unambiguous provision, along with
paragraph 5 of the contract, make the parties&#146; intentions
irrefutably clear and satisfy the requirements in s. 70(3) of the
Family Law Act.
[14] Under paragraph 5 &#147;all rights and obligations&#148; of the
husband and wife in connection with the possession, ownership, or
division of the designated property are to be governed by the
terms of the agreement.  The agreement is to prevail over &#147;all
provisions of the Family Law Reform Act (Ontario) or any
successor&#148;, necessarily including ss. 4 and 8.
[15] The husband argued that since ss. 4 and 8 of the Family Law
Reform Act were not directly referred to in the contract, the
parties cannot be said to have intended to exempt the property
from their application.  At the time the parties entered into
their marriage contract, s.70(3) of the Family Law Act, which
referred to ss. 4 and 8 of the Family Law Reform Act, did not
exist.  They could not have been expected to know &#150; or even
anticipate &#150; that their contract&#146;s applicability would one day
depend on whether these two sections were specifically mentioned.
The issue, then, is not the absence of a reference to these
sections, but whether, based on the terms of the contract, the
parties can be said to have directed their minds to whether the
property would be subject to &#150; or exempt from &#150; the governing
statutory regime.  Since the essence of this regime was set out
in ss. 4 and 8, it is a necessary inference that the parties
directed their minds to the content of those sections.
[16] The essence of this contract is that the defined property
was to be the wife&#146;s alone for all purposes, regardless of any
provisions of the Family Law Reform Act or any successor
legislation.  The husband contracted out of any claim to a share
in this property.  It is difficult to see how the parties could
have made their intentions clearer that the property was to be
exempt from any otherwise applicable matrimonial property
regimes, including the one set out under ss. 4 and 8 of the
Family Law Reform Act.
[17] I would, therefore, allow the appeal with costs throughout,
set aside the order of Speigel J., and declare that the marriage
contract dated May 24, 1985, is valid and binding, and exempts
the designated property from the application of the equalization
calculations in s. 5 of the Family Law Act.
