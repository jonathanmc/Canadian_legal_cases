    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Marchand J. dated November 8, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>SHARPE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  On November 5, 1993, Karen Lefor was driving to a concert.
Her two children, the plaintiff Netasha, then aged seven, and her
son Christopher, then aged five, were passengers in the car.  Ms.
Lefor parked on the street opposite her mother&#146;s residence where
she intended to leave her children for the evening.  Without
turning off the motor of her vehicle, she got out of the car, and
walked around to the back of the vehicle with her two children.
Ms. Lefor was holding her son&#146;s hand and her son was holding the
hand of his sister, Netasha.  The respondent told her children
&#147;don&#146;t run&#148; as she saw the vehicle of the respondent McClure
approaching.  Netasha misunderstood and proceeded to the middle
of the road where she stopped.  She looked for traffic but saw
none and then started forward.  Netasha was struck by the McClure
vehicle and, as a result of the accident, suffered physical
injuries that form the subject matter of this action.
[2]  The appellant third party Pafco Insurance Company (&#147;Pafco&#148;)
is Karen Lefor&#146;s insurer pursuant to a standard motor vehicle
policy that provides, pursuant to the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. I-8, s. 239 (1)(a), for indemnity for loss or damages &#147;arising
from the ownership or directly or indirectly from the use or
operation&#148; of her motor vehicle.  The issue on this appeal is
whether the appellant Pafco is required to defend and, to the
extent she is found liable, indemnify Karen Lefor with respect to
the claim of Netasha.</pre>
    <pre><strong>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</strong></pre>
    <pre>[3]  Pafco refused to defend and indemnify Karen Lefor and third
party proceedings were taken by her claiming declarations that
Pafco was required to defend the main action and to indemnify her
for all sums she may become legally liable to pay as compensatory
damages arising out of the allegations of negligence against her
in the main action.  After discoveries had been held, Pafco
brought a motion for summary judgment dismissing the third party
action, and a declaration that it was not required to defend or
indemnify Karen Lefor.  Marchand J. dismissed the motion for
summary judgment and granted a declaration to the effect that
&#147;the accident occurred at least indirectly from the use of the
motor vehicle in question&#148;.
[4]  It was common ground before the motions court judge and
before this court that there is no dispute as to the facts
relevant to the issue of coverage under the policy.  Although the
matter proceeded by the way of interlocutory motion, it was
treated as if the appellant had brought an application for
declaratory relief and all parties asked both the motions court
judge and this court to dispose of the matter on that basis.
Ordinarily, findings made by a motions court judge dismissing a
motion for summary judgment are not binding on the parties and
the order dismissing the motion is interlocutory for the purposes
of appeal: see V.K Mason Construction Group Ltd. v. Canadian
General Insurance Group Ltd. (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 618 (C.A.).
However, as a declaration was sought and as all parties have
proceeded on the basis that the facts are not in dispute and that
it is appropriate to dispose of the issue raised as a final
declaration of a point of law, this court will entertain the
appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  Pafco places heavy reliance on the decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in Law, Union &amp; Rock Insurance Co. Ltd  v.
Moore&#146;s Taxi Ltd. (1959), 22 D.L.R. (2d) 264.  That case involved
a claim against a taxi company that transported children with
special needs from their school to their homes.  The driver
allowed one of the children to cross the street to his home
unescorted and the child was hit by another car.  The taxi
company was found liable for the accident and brought an action
to recover indemnity against the appellant insurer under the
terms of a comprehensive policy that excluded &#147;claims arising out
of &#133; the ownership, use or operation &#133; of any motor vehicle&#148;.
The Supreme Court of Canada held that the risk was not excluded
and that the taxi company could recover against its insurer.
Ritchie J. held that the duty of the taxi company to the child
was separate and distinct from the use and operation of a motor
vehicle and that accordingly the exclusion did not apply.
Ritchie J. stated, at p. 268, as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It is sufficient to say that the words &#147;claims arising 
out of &#133; the ownership, use or operation &#133; of any motor 
vehicle&#148; as used in this exclusion can only be construed 
as referring to claims based upon circumstances in which 
it is possible to trace a continuous chain of causation 
unbroken by the interposition of a new act of negligence 
and stretching between the negligent use and operation 
of a motor vehicle on the one hand and the injuries
sustained by the claimant on the other.  In the present 
case the motor vehicle was stationary at the time of the 
accident and the chain of causation originating with its 
use was severed by the intervening negligence of the 
taxi driver whose failure to escort the boy across the 
street was the factor giving rise to the respondent&#146;s 
liability.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[6]  Law, Union &amp; Rock Insurance Co. Ltd  v. Moore&#146;s Taxi Ltd
must be read in light of the more recent judgment of the Supreme
Court of Canada in Amos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia
(1995), 127 D.L.R. (4th) 618.  In that case, the plaintiff had
been attacked and shot through the window of his motor vehicle by
third parties attempting to force entry.  The Supreme Court of
Canada held that the plaintiff was entitled to recover under a
statutory provision requiring the insurer to pay no fault
benefits to an insured with respect to injury &#147;caused by an
accident that arises out of the ownership, use or operation of a
vehicle&#148;.  Writing for a unanimous court, Major J. specifically
noted that provisions providing coverage in policies of insurance
have been interpreted broadly in favour of the insured while
exclusions have been interpreted strictly and narrowly against
the insurer.  Major J. went on to state that while the provision
before him could not be stretched beyond its plain and ordinary
meaning, equally the court ought to avoid a narrow or technical
construction to defeat the object and intent of providing
insurance coverage.  He set out, at p. 624, the following two-
part test to determine whether the accident &#147;arises out of the
ownership, use or operation of a vehicle&#148;:</pre>
    <ol>
      <li><pre>Did the accident result from the ordinary and well-known
activities to which automobiles are put?</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Is there some nexus or causal relationship (not necessarily
a direct or proximate causal relationship) between the
appellant&#146;s injuries and the ownership, use or operation of 
his vehicle, or is the connection between the injuries and 
the ownership, use or operation of the vehicle merely 
incidental or fortuitous?</pre>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <pre>[7]  Major J. further noted, at p. 627, that &#147;a motor vehicle
need not be the instrument of the injury to satisfy the causal
connection requirement.  Injuries which do not arise from the
negligent use of a motor vehicle may be covered...&#148;.  He also
stated, at p. 628: &#147;Generally speaking, where the use or
operation of a motor vehicle in some manner contributes to or
adds to the injury, the plaintiff is entitled to coverage.&#148;
Applying the two-part test, the Supreme Court of Canada held that
the injuries suffered as a result of the attack by the armed
third parties did arise out of the use or operation of a motor
vehicle.
[8]  I agree with the submission of the respondents that the
amendment to the wording of the standard form motor vehicle
liability insurance policy 1990 to provide coverage with respect
to injuries arising &#147;indirectly&#148; as well as directly from the use
or operation of a motor vehicle, strengthens their case.  In view
of that broad language and in view of the principles enunciated
by the Supreme Court in Amos, supra, it is my view that the
motions court judge correctly concluded that the accident arose
from the ownership or directly or indirectly from the use or
operation of Karen Lefor&#146;s motor vehicle.  Netasha was being
dropped off at her grandmother&#146;s house by her mother who was
immediately proceeding in the automobile to a concert.  Stopping
vehicles to pick up and drop off passengers is an ordinary and
well-known aspect of the use and operation of an automobile.
There is a clear nexus, within the meaning articulated in the
Amos case, between the use and operation of Karen Lefor&#146;s vehicle
and Netasha&#146;s injuries.  The automobile was stopped temporarily,
its motor still running, to drop off Netasha.  The accident
occurred as a result of the use of Ms. Lefor&#146;s vehicle as a means
of conveying passengers from one place to another.  Ms. Lefor&#146;s
decision to park her car on the opposite side of the road from
her mother&#146;s house and leave it running while she and her
children darted across the street placed Netasha in a situation
of danger and triggered the sequence of events that resulted in
Netasha&#146;s injuries.  The alleged negligence of Karen Lefor after
she left her vehicle does not preclude coverage as, on the
authority of Amos, supra, the motor vehicle need not be the
instrument of the injury, and injuries which do not arise from
the negligent use of a motor vehicle may be covered.  See Incerto
v. Landry, (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 622 at 626 (S.C.J.), per Lax J.:
&#147;The liability for the injury may arise from a tortious act other
than the negligent use of a motor vehicle&#133; [W]here the use or
operation of a motor vehicle in some manner contributes to the
injury, there is an entitlement to coverage.&#148;
[9]  This case is clearly distinguishable from the circumstances
in Alchimowicz v. Continental Insurance C. of Canada (1996), 37
C.C.L.I. (2d) 284 (Ont. C.A.).  That case involved injuries
suffered by a drunken person who had dived off a dock some twenty-
five minutes after he had been driven to a beach site.  In those
circumstances, the use of an automobile was a remote background
fact.  I note as well that the British Columbia Court of Appeal
held an insurer liable to indemnify in circumstances similar to
those arising in the case at bar: Wu v. Malmas (1985) 21 D.L.R.
(4th) 468 (B.C.C.A.).
[10] I note finally the somewhat unusual way in which the
question of insurance coverage has been presented.  This is not a
case, like Non-Marine Underwriters, Lloyd&#146;s of London v. Scalera
[2000] S.C.J. No. 26 (S.C.C.), where at the pleadings stage, an
insured seeks an order requiring an insurer to provide a defence
on the basis of facts alleged in the statement of claim.  In the
case at bar, the insured moved for declaratory relief on the
basis of a substantial factual record.  All parties took the
position, both before the motions court judge and before this
court, that there was no dispute as to any fact relevant to the
issue of coverage under the policy.  Obviously, the issue of
Karen Lefor&#146;s liability for damages must be determined at trial.
However, the issue of her insurance coverage for any liability
that might be found against her may, in these unusual
circumstances, be resolved at this stage of the proceedings.
[11] It follows that Pafco is required to defend Karen Lefor with
respect to the claim of the plaintiff and, to the extent that
Karen Lefor is found liable, to indemnify her for such liability.</pre>
    <pre><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[12] For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal.  The motions
court judge granted a declaration in the following terms:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   THIS COURT ORDERS that based on the determination 
of a question of law, the accident occurred at least 
indirectly from the use of the motor vehicle in question.
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>    2.   THIS COURT ORDERS that the motion is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>I would substitute for that language the following which achieves
the same result but tracks the precise language of the
appellant&#146;s motion:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   THIS COURT DECLARES that the Third Party is obliged 
to indemnify the defendant Karen Lefor for any damage for 
which she may become legally liable to the plaintiffs in 
the main action;</pre>
      <pre>2.   THIS COURT DECLARES that the defendant, Karen Lefor, 
is entitled to a defence to the main action pursuant to the
policy of motor vehicle liability insurance issued by the 
third party to the defendant Karen Lefor;</pre>
      <pre>3.   THIS COURT ORDERS that the motion for summary judgment 
dismissing the third party claim of the defendant, Karen 
Lefor, is dismissed.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[13] The respondents are entitled to their costs of this appeal.</pre>
