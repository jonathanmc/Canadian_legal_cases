    <pre><strong>MORDEN J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The respondents in this appeal move to quash the appeal on
the ground that it is from an interlocutory order and, therefore,
not within this court&#146;s jurisdiction under s.6(1)(b) of the
Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.C.43, which confers the
right of appeal from final orders only.
[2]  The order in question was made by Boissonneault J. on an
application made by the respondents in this appeal under s.107 of
the Mining Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 14.  This provision reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>A party to a proceeding under this Act brought before the
Commissioner and involving any right, privilege or interest 
or in connection with any patented lands, mining lands, 
mining claims or mining rights, may, at any stage of the 
proceeding, apply to the Superior Court of Justice for an 
order transferring the proceeding to that court.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[3]  Boissonneault J. ordered that a proceeding between the
parties to this appeal under the Mining Act be transferred to the
Superior Court of Justice.  While the particular nature of the
issue under that statute is not material to the issue on this
motion, I mention that it involves whether the mining claims
which the respondents had staked are subject to an aggregate
permit relating to the same area issued to the appellants by the
Ministry of Natural Resources.
[4]  In my view, Boissonneault J.&#146;s order is final.  I think that
the issue is completely resolved by the decision of this court in
Buck Bros. Ltd. v. Frontenac Builders Ltd., [1994] 19 O.R. (3d)
97, which analysed the leading case of Hendrickson v. Kallio,
[1932] O.R. 675 and concluded that, because the appeal before it
was from an order made at the conclusion of an application, i.e.
a &#147;proceeding&#148; as defined in the Rules of Civil Procedure, it was
a final order for the purposes of an appeal.  This is said in
more than one way in Buck Bros. but, for present purposes, I
refer simply to the following at p. 101:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Despite its particular form, the order of Sutherland
J. is the final judgment of the court, the final 
declaration of the rights of the parties, in a 
proceeding commenced by the notice of application 
from which I have quoted.  Subject to an appeal from
this order, this proceeding is finally determined.  
There is no further issue in it that remains to be 
decided.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[5]  This describes the present case.  The order of Boissonneault
J. finally decided the issue in the proceeding brought before him
&#150; whether the statutory proceeding under the Mining Act should,
or should not, be transferred to the Superior Court of Justice.
The proceeding commenced in the Superior Court of Justice by the
respondents, was a free-standing court proceeding that was begun
and concluded in the Superior Court of Justice.  The order made,
which enabled the statutory proceeding to be continued in the
court as a court proceeding, was a &#147;judgment&#148; as this word is
defined in rule 1.03 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:  &#147;a
decision that finally disposes of an application or action on its
merits. . . .&#148;
[6]  The moving parties submitted that this case is different
from Buck Bros. in that the result of the order in this case is
that there is a proceeding which is continuing in the court,
whereas in Buck Bros. the result of the order under appeal was
that the dispute between the parties was to continue in another
forum.  With respect, I do not think that this bears upon the
essential reasoning in Buck Bros.
[7]  It is true that, to refer to a key passage in Hendrickson v.
Kallio, Boissonneault J.&#146;s order &#147;does not determine the real
matter in dispute between the parties&#148; if this is intended to
refer to the underlying dispute relating to the priority of
claims to the land in question.  But, as Buck Bros. holds, it is
intended to refer to the matter in dispute in the proceeding in
the court, i.e. whether the statutory proceeding should be
transferred to the court.
[8]  The respondents rely on the judgment of this court in Re
McEnaney, [1949] O.W.N. 755, which held that an order made by a
Supreme Court judge removing proceedings into the Supreme Court
from the Surrogate Court under s.28 of the Surrogate Court&#146;s Act,
R.S.O. 1937, c.106, was an interlocutory order.  It appears that
this order was made on an originating motion, the precursor of
the present application.  The report of the case does not
indicate the reasons for the court&#146;s conclusion other than the
following statement at p. 756:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>At the conclusion of the argument, The Court delivered
judgment orally, quashing the appeal, with costs of the 
motion, on the ground that the order was interlocutory 
and discretionary, and that no appeal lay without leave.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[9]  This decision, which was not brought to the attention of the
court in Buck Bros., clearly supports the respondents&#146; position.
However, because its underlying reasoning is far from clear and
because it is contrary to Buck Bros. and the reasoning in the
cases cited therein as well as the implicit conclusion of the
earlier decision of this court in Re Newcombe v. Evans (1916), 37
O.L.R. 354, which was cited to the court in McEnaney, I am
satisfied that we should not follow it.  In Re Newcombe v. Evans,
the Court of Appeal heard an appeal from an order dismissing an
application to remove proceedings from the Surrogate Court to the
Supreme Court, without comment on its jurisdiction to do so.
[10] For these reasons I would dismiss this motion with costs.
