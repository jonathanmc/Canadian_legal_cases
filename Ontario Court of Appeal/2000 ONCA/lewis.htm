    <pre><strong>On appeal from the convictions imposed by Scime J. and jury dated
October 10, 1997 and on appeal from the sentences imposed by
Scime J. dated November 7, 1997.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                </strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  On March 14, 1996, Mr. Miette was brutally beaten in his own
home.  His mid-face was crushed, his throat was cut and he was
stabbed several times.  As a result, Mr. Miette lost an eye,
suffered permanent disfigurement and continues to suffer from
problems in regard to memory.  He cannot eat solid food and has
difficulty drinking liquids.  After being beaten, Mr. Miette was
robbed of his stereo, computer and other items of property.
Following a trial before judge and jury, the appellant was found
guilty of aggravated assault and robbery.  He was sentenced to
ten years imprisonment for the robbery and the conviction for
aggravated assault was stayed.
[2]  An acquaintance of the appellant, Mr. Highgate, told police,
and later testified, that the appellant had confessed to him and
threatened to kill him if he told anyone.  The appellant was also
charged and convicted of uttering a death threat for which he
received a sentence of two years consecutive to the sentence for
robbery.  The appellant appeals both his convictions and
sentences.
[3]  Marie Beardmore, a boarder in Mr. Miette&#146;s house at the
time, eventually admitted that she was a perpetrator of the
beating and robbery.  She testified, however, that the appellant
was not involved in the beating and robbery but solely with the
disposition of the stolen property.
[4]  The evidence of Marie Beardmore was contradicted not only by
Mr. Highgate&#146;s evidence but by the evidence of Ms. Fox, another
boarder, who identified the appellant in a photo line-up  A
friend of Ms. Fox, who had the opportunity to observe the
appellant from the same vantage point as she did, did not
identify the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.  The
appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his charge to the
jury respecting identification evidence because he did not
emphasize the non-identification of the appellant.  This
objection was not raised at trial and, while not conclusive, is a
factor to consider.
[5]  In our opinion, the trial judge&#146;s charge to the jury on the
issue of identification was sufficient.  We did not call upon the
Crown to respond to this ground of appeal as we were of the
opinion there was no merit in it.  The appellant did not pursue
the other grounds of appeal raised in his factum.  The appeal as
to conviction is dismissed.
[6]  We now turn to the sentence appeal which rests on the
submission that the appellant and Ms. Beardmore should receive
the same sentence.
[7]  Ms. Beardmore, who pled guilty to the offences of robbery
and aggravated assault, received consecutive sentences totalling
ten years for the robbery and aggravated assault.  The Court of
Appeal held that, in the circumstances, the trial judge erred in
principle in imposing consecutive sentences upon her.  Having
found that there was an error in principle, the Court of Appeal
was entitled to impose the sentence the court considered
appropriate for this offender.  In light of the fresh evidence
concerning Ms. Beardmore&#146;s rehabilitative efforts, her total
sentence was reduced from ten years to seven years.
[8]  The appellant submits that the principle of parity dictates
he is entitled to have his sentence similarly reduced on the
robbery conviction from ten years to seven years.  The
appellant&#146;s submission is that the sentence imposed by the Court
of Appeal is indicative that the trial judge&#146;s sentence of 10
years was outside the appropriate range of sentence.  This was
not the error in principle identified by this court in Ms.
Beardmore&#146;s case.
[9]  At the time the sentence was imposed on the appellant, it
was not an unfit sentence or outside the appropriate range of
sentence for this offence.  The trial judge took into account the
principle of parity at the time he sentenced the appellant.  In
his very detailed and considered reasons, the trial judge also
had regard for the fact that the appellant had been in custody
for eighteen-and-a-half months prior to his trial, while Marie
Beardmore had been in custody for nine months.  Thus, while the
length of sentence imposed with respect to the robbery was the
same for both offenders, it is apparent that the trial judge did
not view both offenders as being in the same circumstances.  Had
this been the case, the appellant would have been entitled to a
lesser sentence because of his longer pre-trial custody.
[10] The fact that Ms. Beardmore&#146;s sentence was reduced by this
court based on her particular circumstances does not mean that
the appellant is automatically entitled to have his sentence for
robbery reduced by three years.  The principle of parity in
sentencing requires that persons who have committed the same
crime be treated similarly provided that their circumstances are
similar.  Here, although both Ms. Beardmore and the appellant
committed the same crime, their circumstances were not the same.
Ms. Beardmore, by her plea and admission of guilt to the offence,
expressed remorse for her crime.  There is no similar mitigating
circumstance insofar as the appellant is concerned.  The
appellant&#146;s criminal record is also considerably more serious
than that of Ms. Beardmore.  Her longest period of incarceration,
prior to being convicted for this offence, was six months,
whereas the appellant had previously served two years less a day.
The appellant&#146;s record is indicative of escalating violence on
his part.  We have no information as to the appellant&#146;s progress
since his sentence.  While parity is a consideration, each case
must be viewed on its own merits.
[11] In conclusion, although Ms. Beardmore&#146;s reduction in
sentence by this court is a factor to be considered on the
appellant&#146;s appeal as to sentence, it is not the only factor.
The sentence imposed by the trial judge was not unreasonable or
outside the range of appropriate sentences for this offence and
this offender.  The trial judge committed no error in principle
at the time this appellant was sentenced.  Bearing in mind the
principle of parity, we would not reduce the sentence.
[12] The appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</pre>
