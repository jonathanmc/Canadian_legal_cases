[1]  This is an appeal from the sentence of five years
imprisonment and 15 year driving prohibition imposed by Richards
J. following the appellant’s plea of guilty to one count of
criminal negligence causing death.  The trial judge held that the
range for the offence committed by the appellant was three to
seven years.  He then imposed a sentence in the middle of that
range of five years.  Counsel for the appellant argues that the
trial judge was correct in holding that the sentence should be in
the middle of the range but argues that the trial judge erred in
principle in finding that the range was three to seven years.  He
argues that the range is 18 months to five or six years and that
only offences with much more aggravating factors such as multiple
deaths and a serious related driving record should attract a
sentence of five years or more.  He argues that, had the trial
judge identified the proper range and imposed a sentence in the
middle of that range, the sentence should have been two-and-one-
half years taking into account the six months of pre-trial
custody.
[2]  After noting that he had been presented with various
appellate authorities by counsel for Crown and defence, the trial
judge said that the sentence “ranges from that of three years to
seven years, with eight years afforded for the worst offender and
the worst set of facts”.  He then stated that he would be dealing
in the three to seven year range.  If there was any error by the
trial judge, it was in assuming that there was a set range for
the offence of criminal negligence causing death.
