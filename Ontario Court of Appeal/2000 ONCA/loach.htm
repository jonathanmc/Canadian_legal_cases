    <pre><b>HEARD:         May 23, 2000</b></pre>
    <pre><b>On appeal from the summary conviction appeal judgment given by
Valin J. dated October 22, 1999.</b></pre>
    <pre><b>                     E N D O R S E M E N T </b></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a Crown appeal on a question of law alone from the
decision of Valin J., sitting as a summary conviction appeal
court judge.  The respondent had been convicted by Fournier J. of
sexual assault arising out of the touching of the eight-year-old
complainant when he was acting as her babysitter.
[2]  The question of law the Crown puts forward in this court is
that Valin J. erred in law in his analysis of the trial judge&#146;s
self-instruction on the burden of proof.  This is an analysis
that is restricted to the particular facts of this case and the
specific language used by the trial judge.
[3]  In the circumstances of this case, we are not prepared to
grant leave to appeal.  Application dismissed.</pre>
