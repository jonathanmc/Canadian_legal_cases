      <pre><b>HEARD:         May 1, 2000</b></pre>
      <pre><b>On appeal from the sentence of Whalen J., dated June 25, 1999
</b></pre>
      <pre><b>                      E N D O R S E M E N T</b></pre>
      <pre>[1]  We agree with the trial judge that this was not a case for
the imposition of a conditional sentence.  The nature of the
crime fully justified a custodial sentence.
[2]  The trial judge imposed a sentence of three years
imprisonment.  Although he delivered full and careful reasons for
this sentence, in our view, the circumstances of the offence and
the offender do not justify a penitentiary term.
[3]  The appellant was a very young man with no criminal record
when he committed this offence.  The offence took place, it
appears, in the midst of an argument between the appellant and
the complainant, immediately after the complainant struck the
appellant.
[4]  Moreover, the evidence before the trial judge, affirmed by
the very positive fresh evidence we received, indicates that the
appellant is genuinely remorseful for his conduct and has taken
important steps, in terms of treatment and education, to put his
life on a path where it is unlikely he will re-offend.
[5]  For these reasons, we would allow the appeal and substitute
a sentence of two years less a day to be followed by a period of
probation for 18 months on the following conditions:</pre>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <pre>keep the peace and be of good behaviour;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>report to a probation officer upon release and thereafter 
as required;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>attend and actively participate in any rehabilitative
programs for domestic violence or anger management 
recommended by the probation officer;</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>continue his education and/or seek and maintain gainful
employment; and</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
          <pre>not associate or communicate directly or indirectly with 
the victim or members of the victim’s immediate family.</pre>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <pre>[6]  In addition, pursuant to s. 109 of the Criminal Code, an
order will go prohibiting the appellant from possessing any of
the weapons named in that section for a period of 10 years.</pre>
