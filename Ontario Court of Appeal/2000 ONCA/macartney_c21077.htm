</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Yates J. dated March 1, 1995
</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A. (dissenting in part):</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant appeals from the judgment of Yates J.  on  a
motion  brought under Rule 21 to determine certain  questions  of
law prior to trial.  The appellant was the defendant in an action
arising out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred on July  7,
1990  and  caused  the  death of Jeremy  Macartney,  son  of  the
plaintiffs, Dana and Cecil Macartney.  The action is governed  by
s.  266 of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as enacted  by
the  Ontario Motorists&#146; Protection Plan.  The appellant sought  a
determination as to whether the plaintiffs&#146; claim for damages for
nervous shock arising out of the death of their son was barred by
s.  266.   He also sought a determination as to whether at  least
part  of the claim could be brought under s. 61(1) of the  Family
Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3.
[2]  In a brief endorsement, Yates J. held that the action could
proceed.  Although the appellant filed a notice of appeal against
this judgment, the trial proceeded.  In the result, Yates J., who
was also the trial judge, found that the claim for nervous shock
was not made out.  The plaintiffs appealed that judgment.  The
two appeals were heard together and the reasons in the two
appeals are being released contemporaneously.1  For the reasons
that follow, I would allow this appeal.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[3]   Jeremy  Macartney was a passenger in a car  driven  by  his
friend,  the  defendant David Warner.  The  plaintiffs  Dana  and
Cecil Macartney were the parents of Jeremy.  The plaintiffs Allan
Earle  and  Marie  Earle were the grandparents  of  Jeremy.   The
plaintiff Adam Macartney was Jeremy&#146;s brother.  This appeal  only
concerns  a  part of the claim by Dana and Cecil  Macartney  [the
respondents].   As  indicated, Jeremy was  killed  in  the  motor
vehicle accident.  The accident occurred near the Macartney  home
and  Dana and Cecil claimed that they heard the crash and thereby
suffered nervous shock.
[4]  The respondents argued that they could bring a claim for
general and special damages based on the tort of nervous shock
notwithstanding the limits on tort liability as enacted by s. 266
of the Insurance Act.  Alternatively, the respondents argued that
they could bring a claim for damages for loss of income resulting
from the nervous shock, pursuant to s. 61(1) of the Family Law
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3.  The appellant concedes that the
respondents are entitled to compensation for the loss of Jeremy&#146;s
guidance, care and companionship under s. 61(2)(e) of the Family
Law Act.  He denies that the respondents may make a claim for
damages, however framed, arising out of nervous shock.</pre>
    <pre>THE QUESTIONS AND THE DETERMINATION</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Regrettably,  the questions posed for  determination  under
Rule 21 were not clearly expressed.  As set out in the notice  of
motion, they are as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
1.   A judicial determination on the issue of nervous shock.
2.   A judicial determination on the issue of allowable
     expenses pursuant to the Family Law Act.
3.   A judicial determination as to whether the Plaintiffs&#146;
     claims fall within the provisions of the Insurance Act, 
     R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8 as amended, particularly Section 266.
          
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[6]  The determination made by the motions judge is as follows:

                1.  Claims for  nervous  shock  arising
	  out  of  the  use  and  operation  of a motor
	  vehicle  in  the  Province  of  Ontario   are
          actionable.
                2.   The words &#147;may include&#148; in section
          61(2) F.L.A. are not restrictive.  Therefore,
          a  claim  for &#147;loss of income&#148; is  actionable
          pursuant to this section.
                3.   Since Jeremy Macartney died as the
          result  of the use and operation of  a  motor
          vehicle in the Province of Ontario on the 7th
          day  of July 1990, the &#147;potential defendants&#148;
          are  not  immune from liability in an  action
          for  loss  or damage.  (See Meyer  v.  Bright
          (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.) at 145.)</pre>
    <pre>[7]   Thus, Yates J. held that the respondents could pursue their
nervous shock claim under both s. 266 of the Insurance Act and s.
61(1) of the Family Law Act.
[8]  The resolution of this appeal depends upon the
interpretation of s. 266 of the Insurance Act, and s. 61 of the
Family Law Act.  I will deal first with s. 266.</pre>
    <pre> 1.  The nervous shock claim under s. 266 of the Insurance Act</pre>
    <pre>     The positions of the parties</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  provisions of the Insurance Act respecting the ability
of  a  plaintiff to pursue a tort claim arising out  of  a  motor
vehicle   accident  in  Ontario  have  been  frequently  amended.
Section  266 of the Act, which applies in this case, was  enacted
by  the  Ontario  Motorists&#146; Protection  Act.   The  OMPP  scheme
applies  to  accidents that occurred between June  21,  1990  and
December 31, 1993.  It enacts a broad immunity from liability for
the  protected  parties, such as the driver  of  the  automobile,
subject to certain exceptions.  At this point, I need only  refer
to s. 266(1):

               266. &#150; (1) In respect of loss or damage
	  arising directly or indirectly from the  use
	  or  operation,  after  the 21st day of June,
          1990, of an automobile and despite any other
	  Act, none of the owner of an automobile, the
	  occupants of  an automobile  or any   person
	  present  at the  incident are  liable in  an
	  action in Ontario  for loss or  damage  from
	  bodily  injury  arising  from  such  use  or
          operation in Canada, the  United  States  of
	  America or any other jurisdiction designated
	  in the No-Fault Benefits Schedule  involving
	  the automobile  unless, as a result of  such
	  use  or  operation, the injured  person  has
	  died or has sustained,

          (a)  permanent serious disfigurement; or

          (b)  permanent serious impairment of an
          important    bodily   function   caused  by
          continuing   injury  which  is  physical in
          nature.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[10]  The  positions of the parties may be summarized as follows.
The  parties  agree that nervous shock is &#147;bodily injury&#148;  within
the  meaning of s. 266(1).  Further, the appellant Warner, as  an
occupant of the vehicle, is a party protected by the legislation.
Accordingly,  the respondents agree that they can  bring  a  tort
claim arising out of the accident only if they fall within one of
the  three  exceptions.  The respondents also concede  that  they
cannot  come  within  the part of the exception  for  an  injured
person  who  has  sustained  permanent serious  disfigurement  or
permanent serious impairment of an important bodily function that
is  physical  in nature.  Rather, they rest their  claim  on  the
exception  where &#147;the injured person has died.&#148;  In  short,  they
argue  that since Jeremy died, the immunity created by s.  266(1)
is  displaced  and  all claims arising from  that  death  may  be
pursued in the courts.
[11] The appellant&#146;s position may also be shortly stated.  He
argues that s. 266(1) removes the immunity from tort action only
for &#147;the injured person&#148; who has died or sustained serious bodily
injury as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b).  Since neither of
the respondents died or sustained the requisite degree of bodily
injury, the immunity created by the section remains in place.

     Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[12] The positions of the parties are represented by the majority
and  dissenting reasons of the Divisional Court in Aerts v. Olson
(1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 741.  In that case, O&#146;Leary J., Cusinato  J.
concurring, held that a claim for nervous shock, as the result of
the  death  of  the  plaintiffs&#146; child,  could  not  be  brought.
O&#146;Leary  J. placed particular emphasis on the use of the  article
&#147;the&#148;  in  the  phrase &#147;the injured person&#148;.  His  reasoning,  in
part, as set out at pp. 744-45 is as follows:

          . . . Section 266(1) creates an exemption  to 
	  the immunity it confers on potential defendants
	  where &#147;the injured person has died&#148; not where 
	  &#147;an injured person has died?&#148;  If the section had
          read where &#147;an injured person has died&#148; then all 
 	  who suffered  injuries &#147;directly or indirectly&#148; 
	  because of the accident would be able to sue for 
	  those injuries if the accident caused the death 
	  of anyone.  But the section says in effect that 
	  the potential defendants &#147;are liable in an action
	  &#133; for loss or damage from bodily injury&#148; where
	  &#147;the injured person has died or has sustained, 
	  (a) permanent serious disfigurement; or (b)
          permanent serious impairment of an important 
	  bodily function caused by continuing injury which
	  is physical in nature&#148;.
                     It is to be noted that it must  be
          the  injured  person who has  died  or  whose
          injuries  satisfy  cls.  (a)  or  (b)  quoted
          above,  before  there is  an  exemption  from
          immunity.  Here the injured persons  who  are
          attempting  to  sue for their  nervous  shock
          injuries obviously have not died nor do  they
          fit within cls. (a) or (b). [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Southey  J.,  in  his dissenting  opinion,  held  that  the
plaintiffs could pursue their nervous shock claim.  In his  view,
it  is the existence of the injuries to the requisite degree that
removes the immunity.  He held as follows at p. 748:

                    In the case at bar, the immunity for
	  potential defendants otherwise created by 
	 s. 266(1) is removed because the injured person
	 died.  With the removal of that immunity, all
         claims arising out of the injuries to the injured
	 person remain actionable, including claims for 
	 damages suffered by third persons for nervous 
	 shock resulting from those injuries.  It is
         immaterial that nervous shock may not fall within 
	 the conditions described in cls. (b) or (c).

                     I  can see nothing in s. 266  that
          limits  the  claims arising out  of  injuries
          that  have  caused death to claims under  the
          Family  Law Act.  The claims under the Family
          Law  Act  have been described as  &#147;derivative
          claims&#148;.  That description applies equally to
          claims  for damages for nervous shock arising
          out of the injuries to the deceased person.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  In my view, the appellant must succeed on this part of  the
appeal.   I agree with O&#146;Leary J. that the use of the word  &#147;the&#148;
is  significant and the immunity created by s. 266(1) is  removed
only  if  the  injured person has died or suffered the  requisite
degree  of physical injury.2  The phrase &#147;the injured person  has
died  or  has  sustained&#133;&#148; must be read in context.  The  earlier
reference  to &#147;loss or damage from bodily injury&#148; in  the  phrase
that  creates  the immunity must, in my view, refer  to  loss  or
damage from bodily injury suffered by the injured person.
[15] Subsection (3) is of some assistance in this regard, if only
because some of the intervening language is stripped away.  That
subsection provides as follows:

          (3) In an action for loss or damage from
	  bodily injury arising directly or indirectly 
	  from the use or operation of an automobile, a
	  judge shall, on motion made before or at trial,
          determine if the injured person has, as a result 
	  of the accident, died or has sustained,

          (a)  permanent serious disfigurement; or

          (b)  permanent serious impairment of an
          important bodily  function caused  by
          continuing injury which is physical in
          nature.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[16]  The respondents did not sue for the injuries to their  son.
Their  claims  are based on their own injuries.   They  are  &quot;the
injured  persons&quot;.  But, since their injuries  do  not  meet  the
requirements  of paragraphs (a) or (b), they cannot pursue  their
claim.
[17] The respondents relied upon the decision of this court in
Meyer v. Bright (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129.  One of the issues
considered in that case was whether a plaintiff whose injuries
fell within paragraph (a) or (b) could only sue for damages
relating to those injuries.  The court held, at p. 145, that once
the plaintiff fell within the exemption from immunity, he or she,
could sue for any loss or damage from bodily injury.  The court
reasoned as follows:

                    We think that the answer to this
	  difference of opinion is found in the statute.
	  For ease of expression when discussing s. 266(1)
	  we will use the words &#147;potential defendants&#148; in
	  place of the words &#147;the owner of the automobile,
	  the occupants of the automobile, or any person
	  present at the scene&#148;.  Section 266(1) creates 
	  an immunity for potential defendants from liability
	  in an action for loss or damage.  We stress that
	  the words used by the legislature are that no
	  potential defendant is &#147;liable in an action &#133; 
	  for loss or damage from bodily injury&#148;.  The result
	  is that potential defendants are immune from 
	  actions for damages.  The legislature has, however,
	  created exceptions.  The immunity exists &quot;unless&quot; 
	  the injured person has died or sustained injuries
          which fall within cls. (a) or (b).  The statute in 
	  express terms therefore has said that the immunity
	  does not apply if one of the statutory exceptions
	  is satisfied.  If the statutory exception is
          satisfied the immunity created by the statute 
	  ceases to exist and there is no bar to an action.  
	  Because the immunity does not apply in such case an
	  injured person retains his right to sue &#147;for 
	  loss or damage from bodily injury&#148; at large.

                       It    is   not   necessary    to
          differentiate  between those  injuries  which
          fall  within  s. 266(1)(a) or (b)  and  those
          which do not.  The action would proceed as if
          s.  266(1)  had never been enacted. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[18]  The  issue raised in this case was not before the court  in
Meyer v. Bright.  In my view, that decision does not support  the
respondents&#146; position.  Neither of these respondents are  injured
persons  within  the meaning of s. 266(1) and thus  the  immunity
remains.   They  cannot sue for the bodily injury  (here  nervous
shock)  that  they sustained as a result of the  operation  of  a
motor vehicle by the appellant.</pre>
    <pre> 2.  THE NERVOUS SHOCK CLAIM UNDER S. 61 OF THE FAMILY LAW ACT</pre>
    <pre>     The positions of the parties</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The respondents&#146; claim for damages for nervous shock  under
s.  61 of the Family Law Act is narrower than it would be if they
could  maintain an independent action, notwithstanding s.  266(1)
of  the  Insurance  Act.  The respondents  argue  that  they  are
entitled to bring a claim for their &#147;pecuniary loss&#148; arising from
the  death  of Jeremy.  That pecuniary loss is a loss  of  income
caused by the nervous shock.  The respondents claimed that  as  a
result of the nervous shock, Dana Macartney was completely unable
to  resume  employment and Cecil Macartney  could  only  maintain
employment in a less stressful and lower paying job.  They submit
that they can bring their claim for loss of income under s. 61 of
the Family Law Act.  The relevant part of s. 61 is as follows:

               61. &#150; (1) If a person is injured or killed
	  by  the  fault  or  neglect  of  another  under 
	  circumstances  where  the person is entitled to 
	  recover damages, or would have been entitled if
	  not killed, the spouse, as defined in  Part III 
	  (Support Obligations), children, grandchildren, 
	  parents, grandparents, brothes and  sisters  of
	  the  person  are  entitled  to  recover   their
	  pecuniary  loss  resulting  from  the injury or
	  death  from  the  person  from whom  the person 
	  injured  or  killed  is  entitled to recover or
	  would have  been entitled if not killed, and to 
	  maintain an action for the  purposes in a court 
	  of competent jurisdiction.

          (2)  The damages recoverable in  a  claim under
	  subsection (1) may include,

          (a)  actual expenses  reasonably  incurred  for
	  the benefit of the person injured or killed;

          (b)  actual funeral expenses reasonably incurred;

          (c)  a reasonable allowance for travel expenses
	  actually incurred in  visiting  the  person
	  during his or her treatment or recovery;

          (d) where, as a result of the injury, the
	  claimant  provides nursing, housekeeping
          or   other   services  for  the  person, a
          reasonable  allowance for loss of income or
          the value of the services; and

          (e) an amount to compensate for the loss of
	  guidance, care and companionship that the
          claimant might reasonably have  expected to
          receive from the person if the injury  or
          death had not occurred.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[20]  As I indicated earlier, the appellant does not dispute that
the   respondents  may  bring  a  claim  under  s.  61(2)(e)  for
compensation  for  the  loss  of  Jeremy&#146;s  guidance,  care   and
companionship  notwithstanding s. 266(1) of  the  Insurance  Act.
See  A.  O&#146;Donnell,  Automobile Insurance  in  Ontario  (Toronto:
Butterworths, 1991) at p. 225.
[21] The appellant argues, however, that &#147;pecuniary loss&#148; in s.
61(1) is limited to the actual or expected loss of the pecuniary
benefits arising from the relationship that would be derived from
the continuance of the life.  The respondents&#146; loss of income
from their own employment is not such a loss.  Put another way,
the appellant argues that s. 61(1) creates a statutory basis for
pecuniary losses to the designated family members as a result of
the injury suffered by the accident victim, but it is not a basis
for injuries suffered by the family members themselves.  Claims
based on these latter injuries must be pursued in independent
actions, unless they have been provided for in s. 61(2).

      The reasons of Yates J.</pre>
    <pre>[22]  In  his reasons in the motion made under Rule 21, Yates  J.
appears  to have decided that the respondents&#146; claim for loss  of
income  from  nervous shock was compensable under s.  61  of  the
Family Law Act.  His complete reasons on the issue read:

      The words &#147;may include&#148; in section 61(2) F.L.A. are not
      restrictive.  Therefore, a claim for &#147;loss of income&#148; is
      actionable pursuant to this section.</pre>
    <pre>[23]  In  his reasons at the conclusion of trial, Yates  J.  held
that the claim for loss of income was not available under s.  61.
He  cited Frawley v. Asseltine (1990), 77 O.R. (2d) 525 (H.  Ct.)
in  support  of  this  conclusion and made no  reference  to  his
earlier decision of the Rule 21 motion.</pre>
    <pre>      Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[24]   It  is  not  possible  to  justify  recognition   of   the
respondents&#146; claim under s. 61(2) and, before us, no attempt  was
made to do so.  The respondents argument was based entirely on s.
61(1)  of  the Family Law Act.  In my view, Yates J. was  correct
when  he  denied  the claim at trial.  I agree with  the  general
approach to the issue reflected in the reasons of Rosenberg J. in
Frawley v. Asseltine, which relied upon the analysis of s.  60(1)
of the Family Law Reform Act, 1978, S.O. 1978 c. 2 in the reasons
of  Robins J.A. for this court in Mason v. Peters (1982), 39 O.R.
(2d)  27.   For the purposes of this appeal, there is no material
difference between s. 60(1) of the Family Law Reform Act  and  s.
61(1) of the Family Law Act.  Robins J.A. said at p. 31 of Mason:

          Although this section, like its predecessors and
	  its English counterpart, speaks of &#147;damages&#148;, and
	  is silent on the nature and extent of the 
	  compensation that can be awarded, the courts have
          long held that damages can be given for pecuniary 
	  loss only.  Blake v. Midland R. Co. (1852), 18 Q.B.
	  93, 118 E.R. 35.  As a matter of judicial 
	  interpretation, recovery has been restricted
          to the actual or expected loss of the pecuniary 
	  benefits arising from the relationship which would
	  be derived from the continuance of the life; 
	  recovery for non-economic or non-material advantages
          to the surviving family members has been excluded.

          &#133;

          Pecuniary   loss   may   consist   of     the
          support, services or contributions which  the
          claimant  might reasonably have  expected  to
          receive  from the deceased had  he  not  been
          killed.  There need be no legal right to such
          benefits;   a   reasonable   expectation   of
          deriving   economic   advantage   from    the
          deceased&#146;s  remaining alive is sufficient  to
          sustain a claim. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[25]  At  p.  37,  Robins J.A. expressed  the  opinion  that  the
jurisprudence under the Fatal Accidents Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.  164
was  applicable  to the interpretation of the Family  Law  Reform
Act:

        Subsection 1 of s. 60, apart from creating a new
	action allowing recovery of losses resulting from 
	non-fatal injuries, constitutes, basically, a 
	restatement of the law as it stood before the new 
	Act was passed.  The courts, as we have seen, have
        read a pecuniary limitation into the Fatal Accidents 
	Act by interpreting &#147;damages&#148; to mean &#147;pecuniary 
	damages&#148; or &#147;pecuniary loss&#148;, and have restricted 
	recovery for wrongful death to the pecuniary or 
	economic loss suffered by eligible survivors of the
        deceased.  By substituting &#147;pecuniary loss&#148; in the new
        legislation for &#147;damages&#148; in the old, the Legislature 
	expressly placed recovery, insofar as s. 60(1) of the 
	Family Law Reform Act is concerned, on the same 
	monetary basis that existed under the Fatal Accidents 
	Act and effected no change one way or the other
        in the measure of damages.   [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[26] As I indicated, there is no relevant distinction between  s.
60(1) of the Family Law Reform Act and s. 61(1) of the Family Law
Act.
[27] Admittedly, in Mason, Robins J.A. was principally concerned
with the proper interpretation of s. 60(2)(d) [now s. 61(2)(e)]
and whether that provision allowed for awarding damages for lost
guidance, care and companionship on a non-pecuniary basis.  The
scope of pecuniary damages under s. 60(1) was not expressly
before the court.  As well, Robins J.A. was careful to state that
pecuniary loss &#147;may&#148; consist of the support, services or
contributions which the claimant might reasonably have expected
to receive from the deceased.  Nevertheless, I adopt his
statement the new provision constitutes basically a restatement
of the law as it stood before the Family Law Reform Act.  In my
view, the Legislature did not intend a wholesale revision of the
basis for recovery under the new statutory equivalent to s. 2 of
the Fatal Accidents Act.
[28] In this regard I attach some significance to the fact that
if the respondents are correct and if the family member could
recover any pecuniary loss associated with the death or injury,
paragraphs (a) to (d) of the present s. 61(2) would have been
unnecessary and mere surplusage.  It seems to me that the
Legislature has provided for recovery of those pecuniary losses
in s. 61(2) such as nursing and housekeeping services precisely
because they would not have been recoverable under s. 61(1), or
the predecessor legislation, not being an actual or expected loss
of the pecuniary benefits arising from the relationship that
would be derived from the continuance of the life.
[29] While there are no Supreme Court of Canada decisions
precisely dealing with this issue, obiter statements in two
judgments from that court interpreting s. 2 of the Fatal
Accidents Act, which as I have noted is worded similarly to s.
61(1) of the Family Law Act, support the view that recovery is
limited to the actual or expected loss of the pecuniary benefits
arising from the relationship which would be derived from the
continuance of the life.
[30] In The St. Lawrence &amp; Ottawa Railway Company v. Lett (1885),
11 S.C.R. 422, Ritchie C.J. referred to a number of English and
American authorities that were all to the effect that damages
were limited to &#147;prospective advantages of a pecuniary nature
which have been cut off by the premature death of the person&#148;.3
The legislation was, in other words, intended to &#147;indemnify&#148; the
family members for the loss of the parent or child as the case
may be, see p. 433.
[31] To a similar effect is the decision of Ritchie J. in Vana v.
Tosta el al., [1968] S.C.R. 71 at 87, where he adopted a summary
of the law by Ruttan J. in DeBrincat v. Mitchell (1958), 26
W.W.R. 634 (B.C.S.C.) at 635:

        The guiding principle as contained in the judgment 
	of Chief Justice Ritchie in the Supreme Court decision 
	of Lett v. St. Lawrence and Ottawa Elec. Ry. (1885), 
	11 S.C.R. 422, keeps re-appearing in extensive 
	quotation in many of the cases that have been decided 
	in the succeeding 70 years.  Pecuniary loss is the
        loss of some benefit or advantage which is capable of 
	being estimated in terms of money, as distinct from 
	mere sentimental loss.  Here we must value the loss 
	of the services of a young wife to a young husband, 
	their respective ages being 30 and 32 at the time of 
	the accident; and the loss of a mother of two small
        children, aged three and five years.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[32] Recent decisions in the trial courts, in addition to Frawley
v.  Asselstine,  4 support this limitation on the  recovery.   In
Kemppainen (Litigation Guardian of) v. Winter (1997), 143  D.L.R.
(4th) 760 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) at 764, Hockin J. held that loss
due to nervous shock could not be recovered:

        In the result, in the case of a fatal accident,
	members of the deceased&#146;s immediate family pursuant 
	to the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3, are 
	permitted by s. 266 of the Act to bring action in 
	respect of their claims for loss of guidance, care and
        companionship and for their pecuniary loss.  What 
	they may not do, in my view, is sue under the Family 
	Law Act for their &quot;nervous shock&#148; claims since such 
	claims plainly do not fall within the purview of the 
	Family Law Act.  Their nervous shock claims are not 
	derivative claims but are claims which must stand
        alone.</pre>
    <pre>[33]  In a number of cases, the British Columbia Court of  Appeal
has  similarly held that pecuniary losses occasioned by the death
of  the  family  member are not recoverable under the  comparable
legislation unless special provision is made, as in s.  61(2)  of
our  Act, for matters such as funeral expenses.  For example,  in
Cogar  Estate  v. Central Mountain Air Services Ltd.  (1992),  72
B.C.L.R.  (2d)  292 (C.A.) at 312 the court held that  no  amount
could  be  recovered for the expenses incurred by the  family  in
attempting to find the deceased&#146;s body:

      The loss that section contemplates is the loss to the
      dependants of the deceased by reason of his financial
      contribution to his or her dependants being lost as a
      result of his or her death.</pre>
    <pre>[34]  Finally, there would be no basis for limiting the claim  to
pecuniary  loss from nervous shock.  Any pecuniary loss traceable
to the fatal accident would be recoverable, even if nervous shock
were  not  made out.  This could include any loss of income  from
the normal (or even abnormal) bereavement process.  This case  is
an  example.  The trial judge subsequently dismissed the  nervous
shock  claim in part because he found Dana Macartney&#146;s  loss  was
the  result  of a &#147;profound grief reaction&#148; rather  than  nervous
shock.   Similarly,  with respect to Cecil Macartney,  the  trial
judge found that he was &#147;sad, sorrowful and depressed&#148;, but again
not  from nervous shock.  In my view, section 61 was not intended
to encompass such claims.5
[35] To conclude, in my view, the respondents cannot bring their
claim for nervous shock under s. 61(1) of the Family Law Act.

DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal and answer the  three
questions as follows:

     1. It is unnecessary to answer this question.</pre>
    <pre>     2. Loss of income whether from nervous shock or otherwise
        are  not  pecuniary   losses that may be recovered under 
	s. 61(1) of the Family Law Act.

     3.  The plaintiffs&#146; claims for nervous shock are barred by
	 s. 266 of the  Insurance Act.

                                   (signed) &quot;M. Rosenberg J.A.&quot;</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[37]  In July 1990, Jeremy Macartney was killed in a car accident
near  the house where he lived with his parents, the respondents,
Dana  and  Cecil Macartney.  He was 19 years old.  Mr.  and  Mrs.
Macartney  sued for damages for nervous shock and for their  loss
of  income  resulting from their son&#146;s death under  s.61  of  the
Family  Law Act (&#147;F.L.A.&#148;).  On a motion under Rule 21, Yates  J.
decided  that Mr. and Mrs. Macartney could proceed  to  trial  on
both claims.  The defendant David Warner appealed the decision.
[38] My colleague, Rosenberg J.A., would allow the appeal.  He
concludes that Mr. and Mrs. Macartney&#146;s claim for damages for
nervous shock is barred by s.266 of the Insurance Act, and that
their loss of income cannot be recovered under s.61(1) of the
F.L.A.  I agree with my colleague that s.266 of the Insurance Act
precludes the nervous shock claim.  However, I disagree with my
colleague on his interpretation of s.61 of the F.L.A.  In my
opinion, Mr. and Mrs. Macartney may maintain an action for their
loss of income resulting from their son&#146;s death under s.61(1) of
the F.L.A.
[39] As Rosenberg J.A. points out, despite Warner&#146;s appeal on the
Rule 21 motion, the action was tried.  Yates J. dismissed the
claim for damages for nervous shock, and in an apparent reversal
of his earlier ruling, held that Mr. and Mrs. Macartney could not
sue for their loss of income under s.61 of the F.L.A.
[40] Because of my conclusion on s.61, I would set aside the
trial judgment and order a new trial on the loss of income claim.
A new trial is needed because the trial judge did not make the
necessary factual findings to decide Mr. and Mrs. Macartney&#146;s
claim.  In my opinion, Mr. and Mrs. Macartney need not prove that
their loss of income was caused by nervous shock to succeed in
their claim under s.61(1).  They need only prove that their
income loss is a pecuniary loss resulting from Jeremy&#146;s death.

Discussion

[41]  At  common law, a living plaintiff could not sue  a  living
defendant  for the death of a third person, even when  the  death
caused  financial loss.  This common law rule, first set  out  in
England in 1808 in Baker v. Bolton6, was accepted and followed in
Canada.   However, as Robins J.A. wrote in Mason v.  Peters:  &#147;as
society grew more industrialized and the number of fatal accident
increased,  the  harshness of the notion that  the  family  of  a
person  tortiously  killed  was entirely  without  remedy  became
repugnant.&#148;7
[42] In 1846, England modified the common law rule by statute,
passing Lord Campbell&#146;s Act,8 which became the model for
Ontario&#146;s Fatal Accidents Act and other wrongful death statutes.
The Fatal Accidents Act, passed in 1847, permitted the husband,
wife, parent and child of the deceased to sue for damages the
person whose tortious conduct caused the death.  The statutory
cause of action was found in s.2 of the Act:

        2.  Where the death of a person has been caused 
	by such wrongful act, neglect or default, as, if 
	death had not ensued, would have entitled the 
	person injured to maintain an action and recover 
	damages in respect thereof, the person who would have
        been liable, if death had not ensued, is liable to an 
	action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the 
	person injured, and although the death was caused 
	under circumstances amounting in law to culpable homicide.</pre>
    <pre>[43]  Judicial interpretation of s.2 restricted its scope in  two
ways:  first, damages were awarded only for pecuniary loss;9  and
second, the pecuniary loss itself was restricted to the pecuniary
benefits  the  surviving  family members  might  reasonably  have
expected  to  receive from the deceased had he or  she  not  been
killed.   Although  an  income loss is a pecuniary  loss10,  this
second  restriction precluded recovery for the kind  of  loss  of
income  claim  now  asserted by Mr. and Mrs. Macartney.   Whether
this  restriction  applies to a claim for  pecuniary  loss  under
s.61(1) of the F.L.A. is the issue on which Rosenberg J.A. and  I
disagree.
[44] The Ontario Legislature repealed the Fatal Accidents Act in
1978.  In its place, the Legislature enacted s.60 of the Family
Law Reform Act (&#147;F.L.R.A.&#148;), and then s.61 of the F.L.A.  For the
purpose of this appeal, the two provisions are not materially
different.  Section 61 of the F.L.A. provides:

          61(1) If a person is injured or killed by the
	  fault or neglect of another under circumstances
	  where the person is entitled to recover damages,
	  or would have been entitled if no killed, the
	  spouse, as defined in Part III (Support Obligations),
          children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents,
	  brothers and sisters of the person are entitled 
	  to recover their pecuniary loss resulting from 
	  the injury or death from the person from whom
          the person injured or killed is entitled to recover
	  or would have been entitled if not killed, and to
	  maintain an action for the purpose in a court of 
	  competent jurisdiction.

          (2)  The damages recoverable in a claim under
          subsection (1) may include,
            </pre>
    <pre>            (a) actual expenses reasonably incurred for
	        the benefit of the person injured or killed;

            (b) actual funeral expenses reasonably incurred;
            </pre>
    <pre>            (c) a reasonable allowance for travel expenses
	        actually incurred in visiting the person 
	        during his or her treatment or recovery;

	    (d) where, as a result of the injury, the
	        claimant provides nursing, housekeeping or
	        other services for the person, a reasonable
	        allowance for the loss of income or the value
	        of the services; and

 	    (e) an amount to compensate for the loss of guidance,
	        care and companionship that the claimant might
		reasonably have expected to receive from the 
		person if the injury or death had not occurred.</pre>
    <pre>[45]  Rosenberg  J.A.  concludes that  s.61(1)  is  &#147;basically  a
restatement  of  the law&#148; under s.2 of the Fatal  Accidents  Act.
Therefore,  in  his view, &#147;recovery is limited to the  actual  or
expected  loss  of  the  pecuniary  benefits  arising  from   the
relationship which would be derived from the continuance  of  the
life&#148;.   Except  for the judgment of Rosenberg J.  in  Vaiman  v.
Yates,11 trial decisions in this province and decisions elsewhere
in  Canada  under comparable legislation support  my  colleague&#146;s
interpretation.   In  my  view, it is time  to  reconsider  these
decisions.
[46] The ordinary meaning of the words in s.61(1) would permit
recovery for the loss claimed by Mr. and Mrs. Macartney.  Their
income loss is a pecuniary loss.  Each claims to have suffered
profoundly because of Jeremy&#146;s death, and as a result, Mrs.
Macartney was incapable of working, and Mr. Macartney was capable
of working only in a less stressful, lower-paying job.  If Mr.
and Mrs. Macartney prove the necessary facts, they can establish
a &#147;pecuniary loss resulting from the &#133; death&#148; of their son.
Nothing in the wording of s.61(1) restricts Mr. and Macartney&#146;s
recovery for pecuniary loss to the pecuniary benefits that they
would have received from their son had he not been killed.
[47] A basic principle of statutory interpretation is that the
ordinary meaning of a legislative provision should prevail absent
a good reason to reject it.12  The ordinary meaning is presumed to
be the intended or most appropriate meaning unless the context or
the purpose and scheme of the legislation, or the consequences of
adopting the ordinary meaning suggest otherwise.  Professor Ruth
Sullivan, who edited the third edition of Driedger on the
Construction of Statutes, sets out the presumption in favour of
the ordinary meaning at p. 7:

          (1) It is presumed that the ordinary meaning
	  of a legislative text is the intended or most
	  appropriate meaning.  In the absence of a
	  reason to reject it, the ordinary meaning
          prevails.
          (2) Even where the ordinary meaning of a
          legislative  text appears to  be  clear,  the
          courts  must consider the purpose and  scheme
          of  the legislation, and the consequences  of
          adopting  this meaning.  They must take  into
          account    all   relevant   indicators     of
          legislative meaning.
          (3) In light of these additional considerations,
	  the court may adopt an interpretation in which
	  the ordinary meaning is modified or rejected.
	  That interpretation, however, must  be  plausible;
          that  is,  it  must  be  one  the  words  are
          reasonably capable of bearing.</pre>
    <pre>[48]  Three main reasons are put forward for departing  from  the
ordinary  meaning  of s.61(1) of the F.L.A. and  restricting  the
scope  of  pecuniary  loss: the wording of s.61  shows  that  the
Legislature intended largely a restatement of the law  under  the
Fatal  Accidents  Act; the judgment of this  court  in  Mason  v.
Peters;  and permitting Mr. and Mrs. Macartney&#146;s claim for  their
income  loss  would  open  the door too  wide  for  claims  under
s.61(1).   In my view, none of these reasons supports restricting
the  ordinary  meaning of s.61(1) of the F.L.A.  I  will  address
each of them.
[49] Rosenberg J.A. adopts the statement in Mason v. Peters that
s.60(1) of the F.L.R.A. (and now s.61(1) of the F.L.A.)
&#147;constitutes, basically, a restatement of the law as it stood
before the new Act was passed&#148;.  In my colleague&#146;s view, &#147;the
Legislature did not intend a wholesale revision of the basis for
recovery under the new statutory equivalent of s.2 of the Fatal
Accidents Act&#148;.  Determining what the Legislature did intend in
enacting s.61(1) is not an easy task.  But it is a task best
accomplished by considering the overall purpose of the statute,
the wording of s.61(1) itself, the relationship between s.61(1)
and s.61(2) and the legislative history of s.61; and then
determining whether any of these indicators of legislative intent
justify departing from the ordinary meaning of s.61(1).
[50] I begin with the overall purpose of the F.L.R.A. (and the
F.L.A.).  In my view, restricting the scope of pecuniary loss is
inconsistent with the purpose of the Act.  The F.L.R.A. was path-
breaking legislation when enacted in our province in 1978.  Other
provisions of the Act, dealing with support obligations, the
division of family property, the matrimonial home, and domestic
contracts radically altered family law in Ontario.  The preamble
recognized the Act&#146;s important purpose of strengthening family
relations by reciting: &#147;whereas it is desirable to encourage and
strengthen the role of the family &#133;&#148;.  Moreover, the scheme of
the Act as a whole reflected the Legislature&#146;s intention to
provide much greater protection to family members in the case of
family break-up or family loss than previously available.  Why
then, I ask rhetorically, when we come to interpret one section
of this modern, progressive legislation, do we ignore the Act&#146;s
purpose and instead harken back to judicially imposed
restrictions on another statute passed over 150 years ago.
[51] Indeed, s.60(1) itself (and now s.61(1) of the F.L.A.) did
not &#147;basically&#148; codify the existing law.  It dramatically
expanded recovery.  For the first time, family members could sue
for compensation for injury to their relatives.  In doing so, as
Linden J. observed in Thornborrow v. MacKinnon13, &#147;the Legislature
of Ontario meant to rectify that dreadful page of our legal
history in the new Family Law Reform Act, 1978.  Subsection (1)
of the Act was a codification of the existing law to an extent
but it also expanded it.&#148;  The new language of the F.L.R.A., the
new philosophy that underpinned that language, reflected not an
intent to march backward in time, not an intent to restrict
compensation by previous authority, but an intent to reform the
law, an intent to develop new principles of compensation founded
on the words of the statute.  In my view, this court should be
very reluctant to saddle this new legislation with an
interpretation applied to a statute long outdated.  I agree with
Sutherland J. who, in denying leave to appeal in Vaiman v. Yates,
said that courts should not &#147;read into the differently worded
provision of the Family Law Act, 1986  a restriction developed by
the courts with respect to Lord Campbell&#146;s Act a long time ago
when a quite different conception of family life and spousal
roles was the norm and model.&#148;14
[52] What then of the immediate context of s.61(1), or the
relationship between subsection (1) and subsection (2) of s.61?
Rosenberg J.A. relies on s.61(2) for his restrictive
interpretation of s.61(1).  In his view, if a family member could
recover any pecuniary loss resulting from another member&#146;s death
or injury, &#147;paragraphs (a) to (d) of the present s.61(2) would
have been unnecessary and mere surplusage.&#148;  I disagree.  I
acknowledge, however, that the relationship between s.61(1) and
s.61(2) is an important indicator of legislative intent.  But I
do not read s.61(2) as limiting the scope of s.61(1).
[53] In my view, there are three reasons why s.61(2) does not
restrict the scope of pecuniary loss in s.61(1).  First, the
ordering of subsections (1) and (2) is significant.  The general
category &#147;pecuniary loss&#148; in s.61(1) precedes the list of
specific kinds of awards in s.61(2).  Because this general or
broad category precedes rather than follows the list of specific
examples, I infer that the Legislature did not intend to restrict
the general category.  In other words, when the general precedes
the specific, the limited class or ejusdem generis rule of
statutory interpretation ordinarily does not apply.15
[54] Second, the specific examples in s.61(2) are introduced by
the words &#147;may include&#148;.  The words &#147;may include&#148; show that the
list of examples is not intended to be an exhaustive definition
of the general category &#147;pecuniary loss.&#148;16
[55] Third, providing specific examples introduced by the words
&#147;may include&#148; can have only two possible purposes, neither of
which restricts the general category.  The legislative drafter
may have used specific examples either to remove any ambiguity
whether these examples are included in the general category or to
evidence that the general category extends to matters otherwise
thought to fall outside it.  Both purposes seem to be present in
s.61(2).  Clauses (a) to (d) (including &#147;funeral expenses&#148;, added
to s.61(2) when the F.L.A. replaced the F.L.R.A.),17 are examples
of awards of pecuniary loss, likely specifically provided for in
s.61 to ensure &#147;compensation for certain items which were either
confusing or not compensated under the case law&#148;.18
[56] Indeed, clause (d) provides a reasonable allowance for loss
of income when, for example, a claimant instead of going to his
or her usual job, chooses to provide nursing or housekeeping
services to an injured family member.  This kind of income loss
may not obviously have been compensable without specifically
providing for it.  But clause (d) does not preclude a
straightforward claim for loss of income because of a family
member&#146;s injury or death, under s.61(1).
[57] Clause 2(e) permitting an award for loss of guidance, care
and companionship was specifically provided for because it
contains elements of non-pecuniary loss.19  Full compensation for
the loss of guidance, care and companionship could not be awarded
under the rubric of pecuniary loss.  Thus, clause (e) extends the
usual or ordinary meaning of pecuniary loss.  But the important
point is that whether included to remove ambiguity or to extend
the meaning of the general category &#147;pecuniary loss&#148;, the
specific examples in s.61(2) were not intended to limit the scope
of s.61(1).
[58] My discussion about the relationship between s.61(1) and
s.61(2) and the meaning of &#147;may include&#148; relies on the reasons of
LaForest J. in National Bank of Greece v. Katsikonouris20, dealing
with the interpretation of a mortgage clause in an insurance
policy providing coverage for the mortgagee&#146;s interest
&#147;notwithstanding any act, neglect, omission or misrepresentation
attributable to the mortgagor &#133; including &#133;&#148;.  LaForest J. first
discussed the significance of a list of examples following,
rather than preceding, a general category, at 203:

          &#133; Whatever the particular document one is
	 construing, when one finds a clause that sets
	 out a list of specific words followed by a
	 general term, it will normally be appropriate to
         limit the general term to the genus of the narrow
	 enumeration that precedes it.  But it would be
	 illogical to proceed in the same manner when a
	 general term precedes an enumeration of specific
	 examples.  In this situation, it is logical to infer
         that the purpose of providing specific examples from
	 within a broad general category is to remove any
	 ambiguity as to whether those examples are in fact
	 included in the category.  It would defeat the
	 intention of the person drafting the document if
	 one were to view the specific illustrations as an
	 exhaustive definition of the larger category of
	 which they form a part.</pre>
    <pre>[59] He then discussed the meaning of the word &#147;include,&#148; when it
precedes a list of examples, at 203:

          Moreover, in this instance, the very language
	  used to introduce the list of  omissions  and
	  misrepresentations confirms that it  would be
	  erroneous to view them as exhaustive.  In the
	  English  version  of  the  clause,  the  term
	  &#147;including&#148; precedes the list of  examples of
	  omissions and misrepresentations, &#133;.  I  note
	  that  the  concise  Oxford Dictionary 7th ed.
	  (1982),  defines  &#147;include&#148; as  &#147;comprise  or
	  embrace (thing, etc.) as part of a whole&#148;, &#133;.
	  This  meaning  finds  confirmation  in  legal
	  lexicons as well: the entries under &#147;include&#148;
	  and   &#147;including&#148;   in   Stroud&#146;s    Judicial
	  Dictionary  5th ed.  (1986),  vol. 3, to take
	  but  one  example, again make it  clear  that
	  these words are terms of extension,  designed
	  to  enlarge  the  meaning of preceding words,
	  and, not, to limit them.
                As  I have noted, the natural inference
          is  that  the drafter will provide a specific
          illustration of a subset of a given  category
          of things in order to make it clear that that
          category   extends  to  things   that   might
          otherwise be expected to fall outside it.  As
          I  see  it,  it  is precisely this  reasoning
          which  explains  the  reference  to  specific
          omissions  and  misrepresentations   in   the
          standard mortgage clause.
          </pre>
    <pre>Thus, I conclude that s.61(2) does not provide a reason to depart
from the ordinary meaning of s.61(1) or to restrict its scope.</pre>
    <pre>[60]  In  his  concurring reasons, my colleague Morden  J.A.  has
reviewed  the  legislative history of s.61 and  its  predecessor,
s.60 of the F.L.R.A.  The F.L.R.A. was based in large part on the
1969  Ontario  Law Reform Commission Report on  Family  Law.   In
dealing  with  what became s.60 of the F.L.R.A.,  the  Commission
Report  was mostly concerned to allow for recovery for  pecuniary
loss  when a family member was injured as well as when  a  family
member  was  killed.   The Report did not  discuss  or  make  any
recommendation  on  the  scope of pecuniary  loss.   Indeed,  the
Report noted &#147;that it will be necessary, at some future date,  to
undertake  a full study of compensation problems with respect  to
family losses arising out of both fatal and non-fatal injuries.&#148;21
Therefore, the legislative history of s.61 of the F.L.A. does not
provide  a justification for departing from the ordinary  meaning
of s.61(1).
[61] I now come to Mason v. Peters.  That case dealt with a claim
under s.60(2)(d) of the F.L.R.A., so, strictly speaking, it did
not decide the scope of recovery for pecuniary loss under
s.60(1).  More important, to suggest that Mason v. Peters stands
in the way of my interpretation of s.61(1) of the F.L.A. is to
misread what that case is about.  The statement by Robins J.A.
that s.60(1) of the F.L.R.A. &#147;constitutes, basically, a
restatement of the law as it stood before the new Act was passed&#148;
has to be read in its context.  Robins J.A. was simply observing
that just as the courts read a pecuniary restriction into s.2 of
the Fatal Accidents Act, by interpreting &#147;damages&#148; to mean
&#147;pecuniary damages&#148;, so too had the Ontario Legislature expressly
limited recovery under s.60(1) to pecuniary loss.  Thus, in the
same passage of his reasons, Robins J.A. said:

        By substituting &#147;pecuniary loss&#148; in the new
	legislation for &#147;damages&#148; in the old, the
	Legislature expressly placed recovery,
        insofar as s. 60(1) of the Family Law Reform 
	Act is concerned, on the same monetary basis 
	that existed under the Fatal Accidents Act 
	and effected no change one way or the other 
	in the measure of damages.22</pre>
    <pre>[62]  But  this passage says nothing about the scope of pecuniary
loss.   Indeed  Robins J.A. commented on the scope  of  pecuniary
loss  later  in  his  reasons  in these  words,  which  I  adopt:
&#147;Clearly, recovery, may be had under s.60(1) for losses of  every
kind and character suffered as a result of the death [or injury],
subject to only one restriction &#150; the losses must be pecuniary.&#148;23
Giving  effect to these words would allow Mr. and Mrs.  Macartney
to  maintain their claim for their loss of income resulting  from
their son&#146;s death.
[63] Moreover, the decision in Mason v. Peters itself is the
antithesis of a restrictive view of s.60 of the F.L.R.A.  In
permitting the claimants to recover as part of their damages for
the loss of guidance, care and companionship under s.60(2)(d),
the &#147;imponderable elements of loss&#148; which &#147;are essentially non-
pecuniary in character&#148;, this court broke away from the
restrictive awards of the past, awards that were &#147;wholly
incommensurate with the true loss sustained by a child&#146;s death&#148;,
and in their place, significantly increased the amount of
compensation.  Thus, I find support for my interpretation of
s.61(1) of the F.L.A. both in the words and the philosophy of
Mason v. Peters.
[64] Finally, my colleague expresses concern about the
consequences of my interpretation of s.61(1).  In his view, my
interpretation would open the door too wide, and could, for
example, compensate a loss of income because of the normal
bereavement process.  I do not share this concern.  In each case,
the court will have to apply the words of the statute and ask
whether this is a &#147;pecuniary loss resulting from the injury or
death.&#148;  These words may well raise difficult questions of
causation.  Undoubtedly, the courts will have to develop a set of
principles to resolve these causation questions and to govern
compensation under s.61(1).  I observe, however, that trial
decisions have already held that a claim under s.61 does not
depend on questions of foreseeability or remoteness, questions
that are relevant to a nervous shock claim.24  I observe as well
that the Saskatchewan Fatal Accidents Act25 expressly permits
family members to recover for their income loss in causal terms
similar to s.61(1) of the Ontario statute.  Clause 4(2)(d) of the
Saskatchewan Act provides:

          (2) In an action brought under this Act damages
	  may also be awarded in respect of:
             (d)  loss  of earnings for the  period  in
             which  the  persons by whom or  for  whose
             benefit  the action is brought are  unable
             to work because of the death; and
          if  those expenses have been incurred by  any
          of the parties for whom and for whose benefit
          the action is brought.

As under the Saskatchewan statute, so too under the F.L.A.,
courts will  have to decide when a plaintiff has established the
necessary causal relationship between the loss claimed and a
family member&#146;s injury or death.</pre>
    <pre>[65]  Thus,  I am not persuaded that the wording of s.61  of  the
F.L.A.  or its legislative history, or the purpose and scheme  of
the  Act as a whole provide any justification for departing  from
the  ordinary  meaning of s.61(1).  Nor am I persuaded  that  the
scope  of pecuniary loss should be restricted by caselaw  decided
in  a different era and under a different statute.  And I do  not
see  any  policy  justification for restricting  pecuniary  loss.
Limiting the scope of pecuniary loss in the face of the words  of
s.61(1) is contrary to our contemporary notions of justice.
[66] For these reasons, I would permit Mr. and Mrs. Macartney to
maintain their claim for loss of income resulting from their
son&#146;s death.  Therefore, I would dismiss the appeal from the part
of Yates J.&#146;s pre-trial ruling permitting the F.L.A. claim to
proceed to trial, and I would allow the appeal from the part of
his ruling permitting the claim under s.266 of the Insurance Act
to proceed to trial.  Because success is divided, I would order
no costs either of the motion before Yates J. or of the appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>                              Signed: &#147;John Laskin J.A.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>MORDEN J.A. (concurring):</pre>
    <pre>[67] I agree with Rosenberg J.A.&#146;s decision on the application of
s. 266 of the Insurance Act to the nervous shock claim.
[68] The persuasive reasons of Rosenberg J.A. and of Laskin J.A.
each reflect a reasonable interpretation of ss.61(1) and (2) of
the Family Law Act and, accordingly, indicate that the question
whether the Macartneys&#146; claim for loss of income is allowable
under s.61(1) of the Act is a difficult one.  In approaching the
question, I have taken into account the legislative history and
evolution of s.61.
[69] Should s.61(1) be interpreted as providing for a claim for
all kinds of pecuniary loss resulting from the death?  Its
material wording is based on that contained in its predecessor,
s.60 of the Family Law Reform Act, 1978, S.O. 1978, c.2 (which
became s.60 in the Family Law Reform Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.152)
which, in turn, replaced ss.2 and 3(1) of the Fatal Accidents
Act, R.S.O. 1970, c.164.
[70] The Fatal Accidents Act was loosely expressed.  Its material
wording on the scope of the remedy it conferred was &#147;&#133;the person
who would have been liable, if death had not ensued, is liable to
an action for damages&#133;&#148; (s.2) and &#147;in every such action such
damages may be awarded as are proportioned to the injury
resulting from the death to the persons respectively for whom and
for whose benefit the action is brought&#133;&#148; (s.(3(1)).  As my
colleagues have said, the courts have interpreted these
provisions in such a way as to restrict recovery to &#147;loss of the
pecuniary benefits arising from the relationship which would be
derived from the continuance of the life&#148;.
[71] While the wording of s.60(1) of the Family Law Reform Act
(&#147;pecuniary loss resulting from the injury or death&#148;) contains no
restriction on the kind of pecuniary loss covered (apart from the
express limitation to pecuniary loss), I am not sure that it is
any clearer on this point than the predecessor legislation
(&#147;liable&#133;for damages&#148; and &#147;damages&#133;proportioned to the injury
resulting from the death&#148;).  It appears, therefore, that s.60(1),
in itself, did not clearly signal an intention to change the law.
Other indications of legislative intent should be considered.
[72] When the examination of the question takes into account the
legislative history of the legislation, it will be seen that s.60
was based on the Ontario Law Reform Commission, Report on Family
Law, Part I (1969).  In Chapter X of this report, the Commission
dealt with &#147;situations in which a member of a family should be
compensated for a loss he suffers as a result of injury inflicted
on another family member by a third party&#148;  (p.106).  With
respect to this the Commission said that &#147;[t]here are two main
questions.  What losses should be compensable and who should be
entitled to compensation?&#148; (p.106).  One of the issues referred
to in the report under this subject was &#147;[t]o what extent are the
principles of compensation which would be appropriate with
respect to an injury not causing death to a family member,
appropriate to an injury causing death?&#148; (p.107).  Following this
the Commission said:

               The last question  involves a  study  of
	  The  Fatal  Accidents  Act and  the  case law
	  under  it.   That  statute  enables  a single
          action for pecuniary  loss  to be brought  on
	  behalf of or  by certain members of a  family
	  (as specified by the statute) where a  family
	  member  is killed by the wrongful conduct  of
	  a third person.  Except where there  is  good
	  reason,  such  as  the  avoidance  of  double
	  recovery,  the  same  general  principles  of
	  compensation should be applicable whether the
	  injury causes death or not.
                It will be necessary for the Commission
          to  undertake at some future time  a  general
          study  of family losses arising out  of  both
          injury  or  death  to a family  member  as  a
          result  of  the unlawful conduct of  a  third
          person.   For  the time being,  however,  the
          Commission believes that the law relating  to
          injuries not causing death should be  similar
          in  principle  with the law under  The  Fatal
          Accidents   Act.    This  would   avoid   the
          confusion  that would result from having  two
          different schemes.
                So  far as the Commission is aware  the
          fatal  accidents legislation, in general,  is
          working  well.   It would be  a  considerable
          step forward to provide for compensation  for
          non-fatal injuries on a similar basis to that
          awarded under The Fatal Accidents Act.</pre>
    <pre>[73] Bill 59, An Act to Reform the Law respecting Property Rights
and  Support  Obligations between Married Persons  and  in  other
Family Relationships, 1st Sess., 31st Leg., Ontario, 1977,  which
became  the  Family  Law  Reform Act,  contained,  in  its  first
reading,  the following explanatory note with respect to sections
60 to 64:

            SECTIONS 60 to 64.  This Part replaces  The
	  Fatal Accidents Act and extends that  Act  to
	  cover non-fatal injuries, as  recommended  by
	  the Ontario Law  Reform Commission in  Part I
	  of its Report on Family Law. It also replaces
	  the  actions for loss of consortium and  loss 
	  of services of a child (see section 69).
                With  the  abolition of  the  husband&#146;s
          property in the services of his wife and  the
          parent&#146;s property in the services of a child,
          and   the   creation  of  a  new,   qualified
          obligation of support under this Act,  a  new
          basis is created on which family members  can
          recover  expenses they incur for the  benefit
          of  an  injured  person.  This  section  will
          allow  them  to  recover  the  same  kind  of
          pecuniary loss as can now be recovered  under
          The Fatal Accidents Act.
               Section 60 extends the right to claim to
          a  broader class of related person than under
          The   Fatal  Accidents  Act.   Subsection   2
          codifies   the  case  law  under  The   Fatal
          Accidents Act.
                The following sections are based on the
          provisions  of  that  Act  and  require   all
          claimants  to join in one action.   Insurance
          payments   are   not  to  be  considered   in
          assessing damages.  The $800 limit on funeral
          expenses  is  removed to  allow  recovery  of
          reasonable    funeral    expenses    actually
          incurred.</pre>
    <pre>[74]  I  note,  at this point, that the subsection (2)  of  s.60,
referred to in this note, is not the one that was in it when  the
Bill was finally enacted &#150; which I shall deal with shortly.   The
subsection (2) in the note became subsection (3) in the  Act  and
it  provided  that  &#147;the  right to  damages  is  subject  to  any
apportionment of damages due to contributory fault or neglect  of
the  person  who was injured or killed&#148;.  This was a codification
of  the  case law which applied to The Fatal Accidents  Act;  see
Littley  v.  Brooks &amp; C.N.R., [1932] S.C.R. 462  and  Wiksech  v.
General News Co., [1948] O.R. 105 (C.A.).
[75] Bill 59 was altered in the course of its passage through the
Legislature.  The version of it reported as amended in the
Committee of the Whole House included a new subsection (2) which
read:

                 (2) The damages recoverable in a claim
	  under subsection 1 may include,
                 (a)    actual  out-of-pocket  expenses
          reasonably  incurred for the benefit  of  the
          injured person;
                (b)   a reasonable allowance for travel
          expenses  actually incurred in  visiting  the
          injured   person  during  his  treatment   or
          recovery;
                (c)   where, as a result of the injury,
          the  claimant  provides nursing, housekeeping
          or  other services for the injured person,  a
          reasonable  allowance for loss of  income  or
          the value of the services; and
                (d)   an  amount to compensate for  the
          loss of guidance, care and companionship that
          the  claimant might reasonably have  expected
          to  receive  from the injured person  if  the
          injury had not occurred.</pre>
    <pre>[76]  The  Attorney  General  explained  the  amendment  to   the
Committee in the following way:

          Hopefully, the amendment is clear, to give the
	  courts guidance  as to  the  kinds  of damages
	  recoverable  in a  new  action for a non-fatal
	  injury.  And also I want to emphasize that the
	  list is not exclusive.</pre>
    <pre>[77]  (See  Legislature of Ontario, Debates (March 16,  1978)  at
p.767.
[78] Based on the foregoing, it could reasonably be said that the
view, at that time, on the law respecting the scope of the remedy
under The Fatal Accidents Act was that it did not contain any
&#147;mischief&#148; to be remedied.  In fact, in so far as the awareness
of the Ontario Law Reform Commission was concerned, &#147;fatal
accidents legislation, in general, is working well&#148;.  The
Commission believed that the new law &#147;should be similar in
principle with the law under the Fatal Accidents Act.&#148; The
changes in the law that were clearly made were (1), most
importantly, to extend the remedy to cases of non-fatal accidents
and (2) to expand the class of relatives who could claim.
[79] In the course of the legislative evolution affecting the Act
(treating judicial interpretation as part of the statute&#146;s
evolution), Mason v. Peters (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 27 (C.A.),
discussed in the reasons of my colleagues, held that s.60(2) was
not confined to cases of non-fatal injuries (as seems to have
been suggested by the Attorney General when it was added to Bill
59) and, also, that the damages provided for in s.60(2)(d)
relating to loss of care, guidance and companionship were not
confined to pecuniary damages.  At this stage in the evolution of
s.61, it is clear that s.60(2) covered both non-fatal and fatal
cases.
[80] The next and final step, as far as we are concerned, in the
statutory evolution, was the enactment of the Family Law Act,
1986, S.O. 1986, c.4.  Section 61 of this Act, set forth in full
in Rosenberg J.A.&#146;s reasons, follows the same general format as
s.60 in the Family Law Reform Act but it contained changes in
s.61(2) expressly stating that its clauses (depending on the
facts of a case) were applicable to fatal and non-fatal
accidents.  Accordingly, it is clear in the Family Law Act, 1986
that the Legislature intended to adopt the Mason v. Peters
holding that s.60(2) was also applicable to cases of fatal
accidents.
[81] The task now, in light of the foregoing, is to make as much
sense as possible out of the legislation.  The &#147;court&#146;s own real
and responsible business [is to try] to make sense out of the
legislation, so far as text and context may allow&#148;:  Llewellyn,
The Common Law Tradition &#150; Deciding Appeals (1960) at pp. 528-29.
The legislative history and evolution, as well as the text,
strongly support the view that the same kinds of losses should be
recoverable as a result of fatal and non-fatal accidents &#150;
depending, of course, on the facts of the particular case.
Accordingly, it is preferable to treat the clauses in s.61(2)
(apart from 61(2)(e):  Mason v. Peters) as being examples of some
of the kinds of loss which are covered by s.61(1) and not as
extensions of the scope of s.61(1).  Ruth Sullivan, Driedger on
the Construction of Statutes, 3rd ed. (1994) at p.559 (setting
forth the provision in the Drafting Conventions of the Uniform
Law Conference of Canada on the use of &#147;includes&#148;).  The &#147;may&#148;
before &#147;include&#148; emphasizes that the items listed in s.61(2) are
not exhaustive but, rather, are illustrative of the general reach
of s.61(1).
[82] Accordingly, I would not confine claims for loss of income
only to those specifically provided for in s.61(2)(d).  I think
our responsibility should be to read the legislation as providing
for a coherent and internally consistent scheme of compensation.
[83] No doubt, this interpretation of the legislation may give
rise to issues relating to the extent of the pecuniary loss
recoverable and courts will be required to wrestle on a case by
case basis with difficult questions of causation, particularly
with where the chain of causation ends, in applying the words
&#147;loss resulting from the injury or death&#148;.
[84] For the foregoing reasons, I agree with the disposition of
this appeal proposed by Laskin J.A.

                                   (signed) &quot;J W Morden J.A.&quot;

1     At  the  same  time, the court also heard  a  third  appeal
arising  out  of  a  separate  motor  vehicle  accident  in  1987
involving  Dana  Macartney.   The reasons  in  that  appeal  were
previously released.
2     The  decision  of  O&#146;Leary J. is  in  accord  with  earlier
decisions  of  the  General  Division in  Kemppainen  (Litigation
Guardian  of) v. Winter (1997), 143 D.L.R. (4th) 760 (Hockin  J.)
and   Villeneuve  v.  Carson  (September  6,  1996,   unreported,
MacKinnon J.).

Company, 24 N.Y. 474.
4     I have not overlooked the earlier decision of Rosenberg  J.
in  Vaiman et al. v. Yates (1985), 60 O.R. (2d) 696 (H.C.J.).  In
that  case, the plaintiff sought to recover damages for  loss  of
income from a heart attack she suffered from the strain of having
to  care  for  her  husband after he was involved  in  two  motor
vehicle  accidents.  The defendant was the  driver  allegedly  at
fault in the second of the two accidents.  Rosenberg J. heard  an
appeal  from  the  Master allowing the plaintiff  to  deliver  an
amended  statement of claim to include the loss of  income  under
the  Family Law Act claim.  Rosenberg J. distinguished  Mason  v.
Peters and dismissed the appeal.  A motion for leave to appeal to
the  Divisional Court was dismissed by Sutherland J.  (1987),  63
O.R.  (2d) 211 (H.C.J.). In my view, Rosenberg J.&#146;s view  in  the
later decision in Frawley is to be preferred.
5    To the same effect see, Montgomery v. Murphy (1982), 37 O.R.
(2d)  631 (H.C.J.) at 637, where Galligan J. held that s.  60  of
the  Family  Law Reform Act does not deal with personal  injuries
suffered  by  the  injured  person  himself;  in  that  case  the
plaintiff&#146;s  future  loss of income was due  to  depression  from
witnessing the death of his wife.
