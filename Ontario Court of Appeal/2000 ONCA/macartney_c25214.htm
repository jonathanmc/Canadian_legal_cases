    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Yates dated June 27, 1996
</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A. :

</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellants, Dana and Cecil Macartney, appeal from  the
judgment of Yates J. dismissing their claim for nervous shock and
dismissing  their  claim  for pecuniary  loss  (loss  of  income)
pursuant to s. 61(1) of the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.  F.3.
They  also  appeal  the quantum of damages awarded  for  loss  of
guidance, care and companionship under s. 61(2)(e) of the  Family
Law  Act  and  the  reduction of their  damages  by  the  amounts
received  in no-fault wage-loss benefits and disability benefits.
For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal in part, as
it  relates  to the reduction of the award under s. 61(2)(e)  and
from  the  dismissal  of the claim for loss of  income  under  s.
61(1).  In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>HISTORY OF THE PROCEEDINGS</pre>
    <pre>[2]   This  is  one  of three appeals involving  Dana  and  Cecil
Macartney  arising out of proceedings before Yates J.   In  1987,
Dana  Macartney was involved in a collision with a vehicle driven
by  Mladen Islic.  The reasons for the disposition of the  appeal
by  the  Macartneys in relation to that accident have  previously
been released.
[3]  The other two appeals arise out of the death of the
appellants&#146; son Jeremy.  On the morning of July 7, 1990, Jeremy
was killed while he was a passenger in a car driven by the
respondent David Warner.  The accident occurred about one-quarter
mile from the appellants&#146; home.  They heard the crash from the
accident.  The principal claim brought by the appellants was for
nervous shock because of this event.
[4]  Following the death of their son, Dana Macartney was unable
to return to work and Cecil Macartney could only undertake less
stressful and lower-paying employment.  Prior to trial, the
respondent brought a motion under Rule 21 for a determination
that the appellants&#146; claim for nervous shock was barred by s. 266
of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  He also sought a
ruling that they could not recover their loss of income under s.
61(1) of the Family Law Act.  Yates J., who heard this motion,
found in favour of the appellants on both issues.  Mr. Warner
appealed from that judgment.  The trial proceeded in the
meantime.
[5]  At trial, Yates J. held that, on the facts, the claims for
nervous shock were not made out.  He also appeared to reverse
himself on the Family Law Act issue, and held that the loss of
income was not recoverable under s. 61(1) of that Act.  He did,
however, make awards to the appellants for loss of care, guidance
and companionship under s. 61(2)(e) of the Act.  There is no
dispute that in law it was open to the trial judge to make those
awards, notwithstanding s. 266 of the Insurance Act.  The
appellants contend, however, that the awards are too low, and
that the trial judge erred in making certain deductions from the
amounts awarded.
[6]  In the reasons for judgment in the companion appeal from
Yates J.&#146;s decision on the Rule 21 motion, which reasons are
being released contemporaneously, I have held that the appellants
are precluded from asserting a claim for nervous shock because of
the provisions of s. 266 of the Insurance Act.  I have also held
that the appellants may not claim for their loss of income, due
to nervous shock or for any other reason, under s. 61(1) of the
Family Law Act.  On my interpretation of s. 61(1) it is
unnecessary to consider the appellant&#146;s claim for nervous shock.
Morden and Laskin JJ.A. agree that the appellants may not assert
a claim for nervous shock under s. 266 of the Insurance Act, but
may make a claim for loss of income under s. 61(1).  In view of
the unanimous decision with respect to s. 266 of the Insurance
Act, the appellants are not entitled to assert a claim for
nervous shock and it is therefore unnecessary to consider whether
the trial judge was correct in dismissing that claim on the
merits.  The claim for loss of income under s. 61(1) that a
majority of this court would permit does not depend upon a
finding of nervous shock.  Therefore, it is also unnecessary to
consider the reasons of the trial judge with respect to nervous
shock in that context.  For those reasons, I need not deal with
the appellant&#146;s appeal from the trial judge&#146;s decision that, on
the facts, the claim for nervous shock was not made out.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[7]   In  view of my conclusion concerning the claim for  nervous
shock  it  will only be necessary to give a brief review  of  the
facts.  Jeremy Macartney and the respondent spent the evening  of
July 6, 1990 with friends.  The respondent consumed a substantial
amount of alcohol.  At 7:00 a.m. the following day, he and Jeremy
left  the  party.  The respondent was to drop Jeremy off  at  his
home.   On  the way, the respondent lost control of the  vehicle.
The  vehicle  left the road and struck two trees.  The  collision
was  so  violent  that the car was severed in  two.   Jeremy  was
killed.   The  trial  judge found that the  respondent  was  100%
responsible for the collision.
[8]  At the time of the accident, Dana Macartney was in her house
waiting for her sister and niece.  She was going to accompany
them to the niece&#146;s riding lesson.  She was also expecting Jeremy
to return home around the same time.  Dana then described what
happened:

   . . . I believe I had just come down from upstairs, from our
   bedroom, and the windows were opened and I heard this loud,
   terrifying crash, and I grabbed &#150; put my hand up to my chest, up
   to my heart, and I said to Cec &quot;Did you hear that?&quot; And he said
   &quot;Yeah&quot;.  And I said, &quot;What was it?&quot; And he said, &quot;I don't know&quot;.
   And then I proceeded to go to the bathroom.  We always had the
   bathroom window open and you could, when you &#150; when you were
   sitting on the toilet you can see out on to the road, on to Ridge
   Road, and I seen a, I think it was a beige Tempo or a Topaz go by
   with a police red siren on top.  And I came out of the bathroom
   and I said, &quot;Did you see that, Cec?&quot;  And he said, &quot;Yeah, that's
   unusual that they would use that kind of car.&quot;  And then we seen
   ambulances go by.  And we were sitting at the living room window,
   looking up the road.  And as we watched all the vehicles go by,
   there's fire trucks, ambulances and police cars, and we just
   looked at each other and said &quot;Where's Jeremy?&quot;  And Cec just
   said, &quot;No, not Jeremy.&quot;  And we just watched.  I got the
   binoculars and tried to see what I could see.  And I see a water
   truck up there and hoses and everything and, uhm, could see all
   the neighbours coming out because they had all heard it, and they
   were all out on their front lawns.  And we went outside and Cec
   went up the road to see if he could see what it was.  And when he
   came back he said he couldn't get through because they had the
   road blocked off.  And one of the neighbours had told him that it
   was a gas leak or something.&quot;
          
</pre>
    <pre>[9]   Dana  testified that the moment she heard  the  crash,  she
believed  that Jeremy had died.  Nevertheless, she went with  her
sister  and niece to the riding lesson.  When she returned  home,
her  husband told her that Jeremy had died in the accident.   She
went outside and knelt on the front porch.  A short time later  a
flatbed truck went by with the respondent&#146;s car on it.
[10] Dana was deeply affected by the death.  She virtually
abandoned any household chores, leaving them to Cecil and her
other son.  She never returned to regular employment.  She did,
however, eventually take on other work, such as training dogs,
part-time.  She had difficulty sleeping, lost interest in eating,
and experienced panic attacks.  She was prescribed drugs for
depression.
[11] Cecil also heard the crash.  After being unable to get to
the scene of the crash to see what had happened, he went to the
store.  About two hours later, the police informed him of
Jeremy&#146;s death.  Cecil testified that he could not get that day
out of his mind, especially the loud noise from the collision.
He had difficulty sleeping and was prescribed medication for
depression.  He had been employed at Stelco since 1973.  His job
at the time of the accident required considerable concentration.
After the death, he found that he was unable to concentrate and
he was given a less stressful and lower paying job at Stelco.
Both appellants received no-fault wage-loss benefits from their
automobile insurer and Cecil received disability benefits.
[12]  The  parties called several expert witnesses and filed  the
reports  of  other experts.  Most of the expert and,  indeed  the
other evidence, was directed to proof of the nervous shock claim.
In  summary, the expert evidence called by the appellants  showed
that  the  death  of  their son had a profound  impact  upon  the
appellants.   There  was a serious dispute at  the  trial  as  to
whether  the impact upon the appellants reached the  point  of  a
recognized  psychiatric  disorder such as  post-traumatic  stress
disorder.   However, in view of my conclusion  in  the  companion
appeal I need not review that evidence.</pre>
    <pre>THE TRIAL JUDGE&#146;S REASONS</pre>
    <pre>[13]  As  indicated,  the trial judge held  that  the  claim  for
nervous shock was not made out.
[14] With respect to the claim under s. 61(2)(e) of the Family
Law Act for loss of guidance, care and companionship, the trial
judge held that while the loss of a 19 year old son was a most
traumatic and sad event, the evidence did not disclose any basis
for anything other than &#147;conventional awards&#148;.  He awarded Dana
$25,000 and Cecil $15,000.  He did not give any reasons for
distinguishing between the two appellants.
[15] In supplementary reasons, the trial judge dealt with the
effect of s. 267 of the Insurance Act.  He held that the no-fault
benefits paid to the appellants by their automobile insurer and
the disability benefits paid to Cecil by his disability insurer
were to be deducted from the Family Law Act awards.  Finally, the
trial judge noted that the appellants conceded that the $10,000
death benefits paid in accordance with s. 11 of the Statutory
Accident Benefits Schedule had to be deducted from the awards.
In the result, the appellants did not make any recovery on their
claims.</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
          </pre>
    <pre>      The Family Law Act awards</pre>
    <pre>[16]  The trial judge made awards under s. 61(2)(e) of the Family
Law  Act  of $25,000 to Dana and $15,000 to Cecil.  These  awards
were  made for loss of Jeremy&#146;s care, guidance and companionship.
At  the  time of his death, Jeremy was 19 years of age and living
at  home.   He had a close, loving relationship with his  parents
and brother.
[17] As indicated earlier, the trial judge made what he
considered to be &#147;conventional awards&#148;.  To date, this court has
not recognized conventional awards in these cases.  Rather, the
amount of compensation in any given case will depend on the facts
and circumstances in evidence in the case.  See Nielsen et al. v.
Kaufmann (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 188 (C.A.) and Reidy et al. v.
McLeod et al. (1986), 54 O.R. (2d) 661 (C.A.).
[18] Nevertheless, in my view this error did not affect the
correctness of the awards.  While it is my view that these awards
are low, they were within the accepted range for this type of
case, albeit at the very bottom of that range.  The limits of
appellate review of damage awards are well settled.  The Court of
Appeal should not interfere merely because it would have come to
a different conclusion:  Woelk v. Halvorson, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 430
at 435; Koukounakis v. Stainrod (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 299 (C.A.)
at 305 and Howes v. Crosby (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 449 (C.A.) at
459.
[19] The evidence called by the appellants at the trial was
almost solely directed to the impact of Jeremy&#146;s death upon the
appellants, rather than the loss of Jeremy&#146;s care, guidance and
companionship.  There can be no question of the enormous grief
and mental anguish suffered by the appellants but as this court
said in Reidy et al. v. McLeod et al. at 662, &#147;losses of this
kind are non-compensable&#148;.  There was no evidence to take this
case out of the general range of damages that has been awarded in
cases involving the death of a teenage child.  This case is not
unlike Hamilton v. Canadian National Railway Co. (1991), 80
D.L.R. (4th) 470 (Ont. C.A.) at 472, where the court observed
that it would not be overstating the case to say that &#147;there was
very little evidence on the record that would have entitled
members of the &#133; family to damages in addition to those
attributable to their immediate relationship with the deceased.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>      The  impact of s. 267 of the  Insurance Act</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The  trial judge reduced the Family Law Act awards  to  the
appellants  by  the amounts they received for no  fault  accident
benefits  from  their  automobile insurer and  the  amount  Cecil
received  from  his disability insurer.  In doing so,  the  trial
judge  purported to apply s. 267 of the Insurance  Act.   Section
267 provides, in part, as follows:

          267(1) The damages awarded to a person  in  a
	  proceeding for loss or damage arising directly
	  or indirectly from the use or operation of an
	  automobile shall be reduced by,

                    (a)         all  payments that  the
          person  has  received or  that  were  or  are
          available  for no-fault benefits and  by  the
          present  value  of any no-fault  benefits  to
          which the person is entitled;
               &#133;
                    (c)         all  payments that  the
          person  has  received or  that  were  or  are
          available for loss of income under  the  laws
          of   any  jurisdiction  or  under  an  income
          continuation benefit plan and by the  present
          value  of  any  such payments  to  which  the
          person is entitled;</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  trial judge&#146;s decision was in accord with  a  line  of
cases  in the General Division.1  Those cases had interpreted  s.
267(1)(a)  of  the Insurance Act as requiring that  all  no-fault
benefits  be  deducted from any damages awarded in a tort  action
arising  out of an automobile accident regardless of whether  the
damages  were awarded for a type of loss akin to that  for  which
the   no-fault   benefits  were  intended  to  compensate.    The
respondent  conceded  that in light of this court&#146;s  decision  in
Bannon  v.  McNeely  (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 659  (C.A.),  only  the
$10,000  death benefits paid to each of the appellants should  be
deducted  from  the  Family Law Act awards.  I  agree  with  that
concession as it applies to the awards made under s. 61(2)(e).  I
will  return to this issue below as it applies to an award  under
s. 61(1).
[22] In oral argument of the appeal, counsel for the appellants
raised the deductibility of the death benefits.  Counsel for the
appellant had conceded this issue at trial and it is not raised
in their factum.  In any event, I agree with the respondent that
these death benefits are properly deducted.  There will not
always be an exact correspondence between the head of damage in
the tort award and the benefit made in accordance with the
Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 672.  In
the words of Finlayson J.A. in Bannon v. McNeely at p. 679, &#147;if
at all possible&#148; any no-fault benefit must be deducted from a
head of damage &#147;akin to&#148; that for which the benefit was intended
to compensate.  In my view, the award under s. 61(2)(e) is akin
to the death benefit.  Both attempt, in some measure, to
compensate the parents solely for the loss of the child
(&#147;dependant&#148; under the Schedule), outside of any other pecuniary
losses that the parents may have incurred, such as funeral costs
or income losses that are covered in other parts of the Schedule.
[23] In my view, this result does not conflict with this court&#146;s
decision in Dall Estate v. Adams (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 93.  In
that case, this court held that benefits received by a spouse
under the Public Service Superannuation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. P-
36, and the Canada Pension Plan, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 could not be
deducted from an award made under the Family Law Act.  The
provision under consideration in that case was s. 267(1)(c) of
the Insurance Act.  Austin J.A. gave two reasons for this
conclusion.  First, he held that the survivor's payments the
spouse received in accordance with these statutes could not be
said to be &quot;for loss of income&quot; or a &quot;continuation&quot; of any income
she had received before within the meaning of s. 267(1)(c).
[24] However, Austin J.A. also held that s. 267(1)(c) could not
apply in light of the provisions of s. 63 of the Family Law Act.
He reasoned as follows at p. 192:

               On a more general basis, the interpretation
	  of s. 267(1)(c) urged by the defendants, appears
	  to conflict with s. 63 of the  Family Law   Act,
	  which reads as follows:

                         63. In assessing damages in an
               action brought under this Part, the courts
               shall not take into account any sum paid or
               payable as a result of the death or injury
               under a contract of insurance.

                 In  Canadian  Pacific  Ltd.  v.  Gill,
          [1973]  S.C.R.  654,  37  D.L.R.  (3d)   229,
          the  Supreme  Court  of Canada  held  that  a
          similar    provision    in    the    Families
          Compensation  Act,  R.S.B.C.  1960,  c.  138,
          was   applicable  to  payments   under   that
          Canada  Pension  Plan.  In  Crew  Estate   v.
          Nicholson  (1989),  68  O.R.  (2d)  232,   58
          D.L.R.  (4th)  111,  this  court  held   that
          survivors'   benefits   payable   under   the
          Public     Service    Superannuation     Act,
          R.S.O.  1980,  c.  419,  were  equally   non-
          deductible.
                The  defendants argue that s. 267(1)(c)
          is of more recent origin and is more specific
          and  accordingly should override s. 63 of the
          Family  Law Act in the case of claims arising
          out  of  motor  vehicles only.  In  my  view,
          having regard to the degree to which the non-
          deductibility  of  the type  of  benefits  in
          issue   in   these   proceedings   had   been
          established in Ontario, as well as  elsewhere
          in  Canada, it would have taken the  clearest
          of  language to displace it. That description
          does  not  fit the language of s.  267(1)(c).
          More   particularly,  the  legislation  which
          brought about the new approach in the fall of
          1989 referred with particularity to a host of
          affected   statutes,  including  the   Health
          Insurance  Act,  R.S.O.  1990,  c.  H.6,  the
          Corporations Tax Act, R.S.O. 1990,  c.  C.40,
          the Credit Unions and Caisses Populaires Act,
          R.S.O.  1990,  c.  C.44, and  the  Registered
          Insurance Brokers Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.  R.19.
          It  did not, however, refer to the Family Law
          Act,  s. 63, leaving the inference that there
          was  no  legislative intention to alter  that
          provision.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The language of s. 267(1)(a) is different from that  in  s.
267(1)(c).  It expressly refers to &#147;all payments that the  person
has  received  &#133; for no fault benefits&#148;.  In my view,  the  death
benefits  were properly deducted from the Family Law Act  awards.
See  Gorrie et al. v. Gill (1975), 9 O.R. (2d) 73 (C.A.) and Fong
v. Bamford (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 147 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)).</pre>
    <pre>      Loss of income under s. 61(1) of the Family Law Act</pre>
    <pre>[26]  The majority of this court in the companion appeal has held
that  the  appellants are entitled to make a claim  for  loss  of
income under s. 61(1) of the Family Law Act.  The trial judge did
not  deal with this issue because he reversed his earlier  ruling
made  on  the Rule 21 motion and, following Frawley v.  Asseltine
(1990), 77 O.R. (2d) 525 (H. Ct.), held that the appellants  were
not  entitled to make a claim for loss of income.  In the result,
he  did  not  make any of the findings required to determine  the
validity  and amount of the Family Law Act claim.   In  my  view,
this  court  is  in  no position to determine  those  issues  and
accordingly  there  must  be  a new trial  with  respect  to  the
appellants' Family Law Act claim.
[27] Should the appellants succeed in proving a loss of income
claim under s. 61(1), it will be necessary for the trial judge on
the new trial to consider whether the no-fault accident benefits
from the automobile insurer and the amount received by Cecil from
his disability insurer should be deducted from that award in
light of Bannon v. McNeely, supra.  The deductibility of those
benefits from a s. 61(1) award for loss of income was not argued
before this court and in any event cannot be finally dealt with
until the validity of the s. 61(1) claim is determined.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[28]  Accordingly,  I  would  allow  the  appeal,  in  part.   In
accordance  with  s. 267 of the Insurance Act, only  the  $10,000
death  benefits are to be deducted from the Family Law Act awards
made  at  trial.   I would allow the appeal with respect  to  the
claim for loss of income under s. 61(1) of the Family Law Act and
order a new trial on that matter.  It will be for the trial judge
at  the new trial to consider whether the other accident benefits
should be deducted from that claim, if established.  In all other
respects I would dismiss the appeal.
[29] The appellants have achieved sufficient success on the
appeal that in my view, they are entitled to their costs of the
appeal.  At trial, apparently as a result of offers to settle
from the respondent, Yates J. ordered that the respondent pay the
appellants their party-and-party costs up to and including August
5, 1992 and thereafter the appellants pay the respondent his
party-and-party costs.  It may be that because of the disposition
of the appeal, this costs order is no longer appropriate.  I
would invite the parties to make written submissions concerning
the costs at trial.
