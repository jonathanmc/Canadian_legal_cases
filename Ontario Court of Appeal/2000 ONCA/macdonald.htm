</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from conviction by Whealy J., with a jury, dated  June
4, 1997.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants, Phillip MacDonald and Timothy Varcoe, were
tried together before Whealy J. sitting with a jury in Newmarket
in the late spring of 1997.  MacDonald was charged with two
counts of aggravated assault and one count of dangerous driving.
Varcoe was charged with possession of a restricted weapon,
possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace, and assault
with a weapon.
[2]  The trial lasted about three weeks.  On their second day of
deliberations, the jury found MacDonald guilty of aggravated
assault, the included offence of assault (in relation to the
second count of aggravated assault), and dangerous driving.  The
jury found Varcoe guilty of possession of a restricted weapon and
possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace.  The jury
acquitted Varcoe of assault with a weapon.
[3]  The trial judge sentenced MacDonald to concurrent sentences
of ten years for aggravated assault, four years for simple
assault, and four years for dangerous driving, for a total of ten
years.  Varcoe received an 18-month conditional sentence.
[4]  MacDonald and Varcoe both appeal their convictions.
MacDonald also appeals his sentence.  Some of the grounds of
appeal are common to both appellants; other grounds relate only
to one appellant.  In our view, the appeal raises important
issues concerning the manner in which a trial judge can exhort a
jury during their deliberations, the admissibility of video
reconstruction evidence in a criminal trial, and the manner in
which a trial judge deals with a Corbett application by an
accused.</pre>
    <pre><strong>A.   FACTUAL BACKGROUND</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  There was an agreed statement of facts at the trial dealing
with MacDonald’s status before the crucial events of June 20,
1995. On that date MacDonald was a fugitive.  In early May 1995
he had been in hospital, recovering from a gunshot wound
inflicted by a non-police assailant.  He was in custody and under
police guard at the hospital.  Three men, one of whom was armed,
helped him escape from the hospital.
[6]  On June 14, 1995, the police encountered MacDonald in
Markham during a traffic stop.  He escaped after a foot chase
during which he kicked a police officer in the chest.  A loaded
semi-automatic pistol was found in the back seat of MacDonald’s
car.
[7]  On June 19 and 20, 1995, the police staked out a residence
in Markham.  In mid-afternoon on June 20, MacDonald and Varcoe
left the residence and drove off in a black Toyota.
[8]  Eleven police officers from the Metropolitan Toronto Police
Service and the York Region Emergency Response Unit decided to
‘takedown’ MacDonald on the street.  They moved a police van and
several unmarked police vehicles into position.  When MacDonald’s
vehicle stopped at a traffic light, the police vehicles attempted
to surround MacDonald’s car and several officers leaped out and
moved rapidly towards it.  They wore gray uniforms and black
baseball hats, with the word “police” in white letters on the
front of their hats.  They shouted to identify themselves.
[9]  The ‘takedown’ didn’t work.  According to the testimony of
various police officers, MacDonald reversed quickly, banged into
the police car behind him, and then accelerated forward.  Officer
Rodgers jumped out of the way and fired his gun, striking
MacDonald.  Officer Brown was thrown onto the hood of the car.
Varcoe jumped or fell from the car.  He was shot and fell on a
lawn.  A gun was found lying under him.  MacDonald, wounded,
managed to drive around a police van and speed away.  The police
chased him for 5-7 minutes, through backyards, a school yard,
chain-link fences, and then on to a busy main street.
Eventually, a police car rammed the Toyota and MacDonald was
arrested at gunpoint.
[10] The defence version of the unsuccessful ‘takedown’ differed
from the Crown’s version in several respects.  MacDonald
testified that he did not reverse his vehicle quickly and then
accelerate forward.  He testified that, while he was stopped at
the intersection, he heard Varcoe screaming beside him.  He
turned and saw a man in a blue uniform pointing a gun at him from
about two feet.  He did not recognize the man as a police officer
and did not hear anyone shout “police”.  The man shot him in his
side and arm.  He tried to curl up to avoid being shot again.
His car was bumped from behind and began to move forward.  The
car hit the curb.  Another man appeared on the hood, pressed
against the windshield.  At that juncture, MacDonald accelerated
and drove away because  he feared that he was going to be killed.
He did not see Varcoe exit the car.  He knew that he was being
chased, but saw no flashing lights or sirens.  He did not realize
that the police were pursuing him until he was apprehended at
gunpoint at the end of the chase.
[11] At the trial, the jury convicted MacDonald of aggravated
assault relating to his vehicle hitting Officer Brown, assault
relating to Officer Rodgers who managed to step away from the
onrushing vehicle, and dangerous driving for the pursuit.  The
jury convicted Varcoe of possession of a restricted weapon and
possession of a weapon dangerous to the public peace, both
relating to the gun found under him on the lawn.  However, he was
acquitted of assault with a weapon, a charge that was grounded in
Officer Brown’s testimony that he saw Varcoe appear to reach for
something inside his waistband while he was still in the
passenger seat of MacDonald’s vehicle.
[12] Other facts are relevant to the appeal.  However, it is
convenient to set out those facts in the context of the specific
grounds of appeal to which they relate.</pre>
    <pre><strong>B.   ISSUES</strong></pre>
    <pre>[13] The issues in this appeal can be grouped in three categories
– issues relating to both MacDonald and Varcoe, issues relating
to MacDonald, and issues relating to Varcoe:</pre>
    <pre><strong>Common Issues</strong></pre>
    <pre>(1)  Did the trial judge err by giving the jury an exhortation
     and setting a deadline for their deliberations?</pre>
    <pre>(2)  Did the trial judge err by admitting into evidence a police
     video re-enactment of the ‘takedown’?</pre>
    <pre><strong>MacDonald Issues</strong></pre>
    <pre>(3)  Did the trial judge err in his ruling on MacDonald’s Corbett
     application?
</pre>
    <pre>(4)  Did the trial judge err in taking away from the jury the
     issue of excessive police force?</pre>
    <pre>(5)  Did the trial judge err in principle and impose a manifestly
     unfit sentence on MacDonald?</pre>
    <pre><strong>Varcoe Issues</strong></pre>
    <pre>(6)  Did the trial judge err in his instruction to the jury on
     how to assess credibility and the effect of prior inconsistent
     statements on the issue of credibility?</pre>
    <pre>(7)  Did the trial judge err in his instruction to the jury on
     the requisite elements of the offence of possession of a weapon
     for a purpose dangerous to the public peace?</pre>
    <pre><strong>C.   ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>     <u>COMMON ISSUES</u></strong>     </pre>
    <pre><strong>(1)  The exhortation issue</strong></pre>
    <pre>[14] The jury commenced their deliberations at approximately
11:07 a.m. on June 3, 1997.  They continued deliberating after
dinner until 9:00 p.m.  They resumed their deliberations at 9:00
a.m. on June 4, 1997.  At 12:37 p.m. on that day, the trial judge
called the jury into court and inquired whether they were making
progress.  The trial judge and the jury foreperson had the
following exchange:</pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:   Ladies and gentleman, I called
	  you in to ask through your foreperson whether
	  you think you are making progress.  Can you
 	  answer that?</pre>
    <pre>          JURY FOREPERSON:  Yes, Your Honour, we
          are making progress.

          THE COURT:   All right.

          JURY FOREPERSON:   But we still are
          indecisive.

          THE COURT:  All right.  Are you in a position
          to say that you have at least reached
          verdicts in some of the counts?

          JURY PERSON:  Yes, we have.

          THE COURT:  And I take it then further
          consultations should produce verdicts in the
          remaining counts.  I can’t let this go too
          much farther.  I am acutely aware that you
          are working in a tiny room with no windows
          and inadequate air conditioning.  I am going
          to advise you at this time, you will not be
          spending another night in a hotel.  So there
          is, in my mind at least, a deadline, although
          it is not quite firm.  So, thank you for the
          advice and I would ask you now to continue
          with your deliberations.</pre>
    <pre>[15] The jury retired after this exchange and the trial judge
informed counsel:</pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:   I can tell counsel if at 5:30 they
	  have not reached a verdict, I am going to declare
 	  a mistrial on those counts on which no verdict
	  has been reached.  I will take whatever verdicts
 	  they have at 5:30.</pre>
    <pre>[16] At 12:47 p.m., in response to a question from the jury, the
trial judge provided an instruction on a matter of law.  Before
the jury left to continue their deliberations, the trial judge
informed them that they could give verdicts on some of the
charges and not have a unanimous  decision on others.  Again,
this was in response to a question from the jury.
[17] When the jury again retired, the trial judge asked counsel
whether they had any comments.  Counsel for the Crown and for one
of the accused expressed concern with the trial judge’s
exhortation to the jury:          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:  Does the Crown have any
          comments?

          CROWN COUNSEL (Mr. Westgate):  … The
          other concern I have is indicating to the
          jury that they wouldn’t be sitting another
          night.  It may have the impression of giving
          the jury a deadline. …

               …..
          </pre>
    <pre>          THE COURT:  Mr. Derry?

          DEFENCE COUNSEL (Mr. Derry):  … My
          concern in response to what you just
          mentioned to Mr. Westgate is that at 5:30, if
          they’re somewhat indecisive, if they reflect
          back upon what you told them about their not
          going to stay another night, they may feel
          the effect of a deadline.  If they’re working
          at it, then I don’t know that that deadline
          idea should be implanted in their minds.
          That’s the concern I have.

          THE COURT:  Well, the only deadline they
          know about is that they are not going to
          spend another night in a hotel.  I did not
          mention…

          DEFENCE COUNSEL (Mr. Derry):  Well, I
          guess, that’s the one I’m concerned about,
          Your Honour.</pre>
    <pre>[18] At 3:48 p.m. the jury returned with verdicts on all counts.
[19] The leading case dealing with issues relating to a trial
judge’s exhortation to a jury is R. v. G. (R.M.) (1996), 110
C.C.C. (3d) 26 (S.C.C.).  After a review of jurisprudence in
Canada, the United Kingdom and New Zealand, Cory J. summarized
the relevant principles, at p. 38:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The following principles can, I believe, be derived 
from these cases.  (1)  Pursuant to their oath, 
jurors must endeavour to render a verdict based 
upon the evidence which has been adduced before them.
(2)  The strength and genius of trial by jury is that
members of the community reason together to reach a
verdict based solely upon the evidence.  (3)  It 
follows from the last principle that it is important 
to allow a jury to deliberate without imposing any 
form of pressure upon them.  (4)  If a jury has 
apparently reached an impasse, any exhortation given 
should avoid introducing factors which are extraneous 
and irrelevant to the task of reaching a verdict, and 
should not encourage a juror, by reference to 
extraneous considerations or by exerting unwarranted 
pressures, to abandon an honestly held view of the
evidence.  The exhortation must not interfere with the 
right of jurors to deliberate in complete freedom 
uninfluenced by extraneous pressure.  (5)  It follows 
that a juror should not be encouraged or exhorted to 
change his or her mind simply for the sake of conformity.  
(6)  A deadline for reaching a verdict should not be 
imposed and a jury should never be rushed into returning 
a verdict. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] In R. v. G. (R.M.), Cory J. also considered the issue of
appellate review of exhortations given by trial judges.  In a
section of his reasons he titled The Test for Appellate Review of
Instructions Given to the Jury as an Exhortation, he stated, at
p. 45:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Not every improper reference in an exhortation will 
lead to a new trial.  Instead, the exhortation must 
be viewed as a whole and in the context of the 
proceedings.  The length of the deliberations, the 
nature of the question asked by the jury, and the 
length of the deliberations following the exhortation 
are all relevant.  In considering all of these factors, 
an appellate court must determine whether there is a 
reasonable possibility that the impugned statements 
either coerced the jury or interfered with its right 
to deliberate in complete freedom from extraneous 
considerations or pressures, or caused a juror to
concur with a view that he or she did not truly hold.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21] Applying G. (R.M.) to the present appeal, in our view the
trial judge’s exhortation to the jury suffers from two serious
defects.
[22] First, the exhortation was unnecessary.  The jury had not
signalled that they needed any assistance, let alone that they
were deadlocked.  Counsel did not request that the trial judge
call in or exhort the jury.  And when the jury returned to the
courtroom and were asked by the trial judge if they were making
progress, they provided an affirmative response.  Indeed, the
jury indicated that they had reached verdicts on some of the
counts.  Moreover, it should be recalled that the trial involved
two accused and six counts and had lasted for three weeks.  In
these circumstances, the jury’s response to the trial judge’s
questions should have been accepted.  The jury appeared to be
functioning smoothly and properly.  No exhortation was needed.
[23] Second, and fundamentally, the contents of the trial judge’s
exhortation were very unfortunate.  He appeared to impose a
deadline on their deliberations when he told them: “I am going to
advise you that at this time, you will not be spending another
night in a hotel.  So there is, in my mind at least, a deadline,
although it is not quite firm.”
[24] The principle enunciated by Cory J. in G. (R.M.) is
explicit: “A deadline for reaching a verdict should not be
imposed and a jury should never be rushed into rendering a
verdict” (at p. 38).  Other Canadian appellate courts have also
said emphatically that a trial judge should not impose a deadline
on a jury’s deliberations: see R. v. B. (D.D.) (1995), 99 C.C.C.
(3d) 232 (Ont. C.A.); R. v. Halliday (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 481
(Man. C.A.); and R. v. Stewart, [1994] A.J. No. 91 (C.A.)
[25] The Crown submits that the “deadline” language in the trial
judge’s remark was softened by its context, namely his expressed
concern for the jury’s comfort.  Moreover, the Crown submits that
the jury never indicated that it was deadlocked and that it
rendered its verdicts at 3:48 p.m., approximately five hours
before the time, based on their previous night’s experience, they
might have expected the trial judge to terminate their
deliberations.  Accordingly, contends the Crown, the exhortation
did not coerce the jury, or interfere with their right to
deliberate in complete freedom from extraneous considerations and
pressures, or cause a juror to concur with a view that he or she
did not hold.
[26] We do not agree with these submissions.  Unfortunately, they
are grounded in speculation about how the jury reacted to the
trial judge’s exhortation.  Although the trial judge mentioned
the jury’s comfort, this was only a reason for the essence of his
message to the jury – namely, there was a deadline on their
deliberations.  Moreover, the fact that the jury returned with
their verdicts at 3:48 p.m. is inconclusive.  It is true, as the
Crown contends, that this might indicate that the jury was
uninfluenced by a perceived deadline of around 9:00 p.m.  On the
other hand, the timing of their verdicts might indicate that the
jury, having heard the exhortation, felt that they had to hurry
up their deliberations and reach verdicts.
[27] In summary, the Supreme Court of Canada said clearly in G.
(R.M.) that a trial judge should not impose a deadline on a
jury’s deliberations.  The trial judge imposed a deadline in this
case; indeed, he used the word “deadline”.  Moreover, he did so
in an exhortation that was unnecessary in light of the length of
the trial, the duration of the jury’s deliberations, the jury’s
clear indication that it was making good progress, and the
absence of any suggestion from counsel that an exhortation was
required (a factor underlined by the objection to the exhortation
taken by both Crown counsel and counsel for one accused after it
was delivered).  In our view, there is a reasonable possibility
that the trial judge’s exhortation either coerced the jury or
interfered with their right to deliberate free of extraneous
pressures. Accordingly, we are of the view that this ground of
appeal succeeds.  On this ground alone, both appellants are
entitled to a new trial.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(2)  The police video re-enactment of the &quot;takedown&quot;</strong></pre>
    <pre>[28] The attempted takedown of MacDonald and Varcoe took place in
the afternoon of June 20, 1995.  Twenty months later, on a
morning in February 1997, the police made a video in which they
attempted to reconstruct and re-enact the takedown.
[29] The video was disclosed to the defence only three days
before the trial began. The defence did not ask for an
adjournment because of the late disclosure.  However, they
objected to the admissibility of the video on the ground that it
was more prejudicial than probative.  After a voir dire, the
trial judge ruled that the video was admissible.  He held that it
was “relevant to important issues such as time, fields of view,
relative position of the parties, and the like”, and “it is not
more prejudicial than oral testimony on the same subject”.  He
concluded that the video would help the jury by clarifying the
evidence of Officer Rodgers:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The examination and cross-examination illustrate 
better than can in words how inadequate mere words 
are to create for the jury a realistic understanding 
of a brief traumatic and important instant in this 
case.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[30] The Crown played the video twice during Rodgers’ examination-
in-chief, pausing it as it was played.  It was not played again
and it was not given to the jury during their deliberations.
Nonetheless, both appellants submit that the trial judge
committed a reversible error in admitting the video and in
permitting the Crown to use it during the prosecution’s case.  We
agree that admitting the video re-enactment was a reversible
error.  Its admission, however, prejudiced only the case against
MacDonald because it depicted MacDonald’s driving; it had no
effect on the case against Varcoe.
[31] We will first describe how the video was made and its
contents, then discuss the applicable principles governing its
admissibility, and finally apply the principles to this case.
[32] The evidence on the voir dire explained how the video re-
enactment was produced and what it showed.  The police acquired a
car similar to the car MacDonald was driving and another car to
be positioned behind the “suspect car”.  During the takedown, the
car behind had been a large sport-utility vehicle, a Ford
Explorer; its replacement in the video was much smaller, a 1987
Toyota.  The location chosen for the video, apparently a deserted
sand quarry, differed from the location of the actual incident, a
controlled intersection with a traffic light in the town of
Markham.  The video lasted twenty seconds.  Officer Brown
testified that it showed the cars moving “much slower” than they
did during the actual incident, and therefore the length of the
video was also longer than the time of the incident.
[33] The video re-enacts the police’s version of what occurred
during the attempted takedown.  Four police officers – Brown,
Wright, Rodgers and Giangrande – played themselves, recreating
what each claimed to have done during the incident.  The video
shows the four officers getting out of the emergency response
unit van, which is partly blocking the suspect car.  Three
officers take up positions several feet in front of the car with
their guns aimed at the occupants.  All three are shouting
loudly: “Police, don’t move”.  Four seconds elapse between the
police first shouting and the suspect car backing up.  The camera
shows the police from behind facing the suspect car.  The camera
is then set inside the car to show the driver’s perspective
looking out at the officers through the windshield.  The police
are clearly visible to the driver of the suspect car.
[34] After the suspect car backs up a considerable distance, the
camera shows the car from the outside, advancing on the officers.
Brown, the officer nearest the passenger side, shoots twice into
the windshield on that side of the car.  Rodgers, the officer at
the driver’s window, fires four shots in rapid succession at the
windshield on the driver’s side.  Red lines were added to the
video to show the trajectory of the bullets but the trial judge
ruled they be deleted before the video was shown to the jury.  As
the car moves forward on the video it hits Brown, who rolls onto
the hood in a fetal position.  The video ends with the car
driving away, Brown still on the hood.
[35] The video re-enactment took two hours to make.  The finished
product reflected the recollections of the four officers.
Although each officer tried to recreate his own actions, the four
discussed the incident among themselves before making the video.
[36] We turn now to the applicable legal principles.  A serious
concern with videotaped re-enactments, particularly those created
without the participation of the accused, is their potential to
unfairly influence the jury’s decision-making.  Because a video
re-enactment has an immediate visual impact, jurors may be
induced to give it more weight than it deserves and,
correspondingly, to discount less compelling or less vivid
evidence which is nonetheless more probative of the facts in
dispute.  Several commentators and courts have warned against
this danger.  Dean Wigmore adverted to it in his classic treatise
on evidence, Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law (1970), at
ss. 798a:</pre>
    <pre>          In so far as such a [motion] picture has any 
	  value beyond a still picture, this value
	  depends on the correctness of the artificial
	  reconstruction of a complex series of movements
 	  and erections, usually involving several actors,
 	  each of them the paid agent of the party and
	  acting under his direction.  Hence its
	  reliability, as identical with the original
	  scene, is decreased and may be minimized to the
	  point of worthlessness.</pre>
    <pre>          Where this possibility is serious, what
          should be done?  Theoretically, of course,
          the motion picture can never be assumed to
          represent the actual occurrence: what is seen
          in it is merely what certain witnesses say
          was the thing that happened.  And, moreover,
          the party’s hired agents may so construct it
          as to go considerably further in his favor
          than the witnesses’ testimony has gone.  And
          yet, any motion picture is apt to cause
          forgetfulness of this and to impress the jury
          with the convincing impartiality of Nature
          herself… [Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[37] So too did Professor McCormick in his evidence text,
McCormick on Evidence 4th ed. (1992) Vol. 2, at pp. 3-4:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It has already been noted that evidence from 
which the trier of fact may derive his own 
perceptions, rather than evidence consisting 
of the reported perceptions of others, possesses
unusual force.  Consequently, demonstrative 
evidence is frequently objected to as 
prejudicial, a term which is today generally 
defined as suggesting “decision on an improper 
basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an 
emotional one.”  A great deal of demonstrative 
evidence has the capacity to generate emotional 
responses such as pity, revulsion, or contempt, 
and where this capacity outweighs the value of 
the evidence on the issues in litigation, exclusion 
is appropriate.</pre>
        <pre>Again, even if no essentially emotional response 
is likely to result, demonstrative evidence may 
convey an impression of objective reality to the 
trier.  Thus, the courts are frequently sensitive 
to the objection that the evidence is “misleading”,
and zealous to insure that there is no misleading 
differential between objective things offered at 
trial and the same or different objective things 
as they existed at the time of the events or 
occurrences in litigation.</pre>

    <pre>[38] This danger increases when the videotape depicts not just
the undisputed positions of persons and things, but one side’s
version of disputed facts.  McCormick makes this point in
discussing the admissibility of photographs, at p. 17:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>A somewhat … troublesome problem is presented by 
posed or artificially reconstructed scenes, in 
which people, automobiles, and other objects are 
placed so as to conform to the descriptions of the 
original crime or collision given by the witnesses. 
When the posed photographs go no further than to 
portray the positions of persons and objects as 
reflected in the undisputed testimony, their 
admission has long been generally approved.  
Frequently, however, a posed photograph will 
portray only the version of the facts supported 
by the testimony of the proponent’s witness.  The
dangers inherent in this situation, i.e., the 
tendency of the photographs unduly to emphasize 
certain testimony and the possibility that the 
jury may confuse one party’s reconstruction with 
objective fact, have led many courts to exclude 
photographs of this type … the current trend would 
appear to be to permit even photos of disputed 
reconstructions in some instances [e.g. if pressing 
necessity].</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[39] In a comprehensive article on the subject, “Manufacturing
Evidence for Trial: The Prejudicial Implications of Videotaped
Crime Scenery Re-enactments” (1994), 142 U. Pa. L. R. 2125, David
B. Hennes examined the high sensory impact of video images and
their tendency to stay at the front of the viewer’s mind.  He
summarized why admitting videotaped re-enactments may be unfair
at pp. 2179-80:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The danger of unfair prejudice presented by the 
videotaped re-enactment is a function of both the 
manner of the presentation and the content of the 
presentation.  That danger is only accentuated by 
its stark lack of probative value.  The availability 
heuristic suggests that the re-enactment will be
readily recalled and heavily relied upon during the 
decision-making process.  Individuals learn more 
readily through sight, and a key component of the 
learning process comes through the use of the 
television, an everyday source of entertainment and
information.  A television videotape, much more than 
other forms of demonstrative visual evidence, leaves 
a lasting impression on jurors’ mental processes, 
since its vividness dictates that it will be readily 
available for cognitive recall.  The videotaped
re-enactment, because of its mental impressionability, 
is exactly the type of vivid information to which the 
availability heuristic grants cognitive priority 
during decision-making.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Mr. Hennes approved of the majority opinion of the Texas Court of 
Appeals in Lopez v. State (1983), 651 S.W. 2d 413 at 416, banning 
video re-enactments.  Burdock J. wrote:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>… We find that any staged, re-enacted criminal acts 
or defensive issues involving human beings are 
impossible to duplicate in every minute detail and 
are therefore inherently dangerous, offer little in 
substance and the impact of re-enactments is too 
highly prejudicial to insure the State or the
defendant a fair trial.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[40] In addition to the concerns about video re-enactments
discussed by courts and commentators, we cannot ignore the
reality that usually only the Crown has the resources to produce
a video and thus, in many cases, the re-enactment will be an
“extra witness for the state”.
[41] Despite these concerns, however, we think it would be unwise
to lay down rigid rules governing the admissibility of video re-
enactments.  In an era of rapidly changing technology we would
take a step backward were we to prohibit the use of video re-
enactments in the courtroom.  Further, an outright prohibition
would hinder the efforts of today’s advocates to devise new and
creative ways to promote their clients’ causes.
[42] In our view, the preferable approach recognizes the dangers
of video re-enactments but adopts a case-by-case analysis.  As
with the admissibility of other kinds of evidence, the overriding
principle should be whether the prejudicial effect of the video
re-enactment outweighs its probative value.  If it does, the
video re-enactment should not be admitted. In balancing the
prejudicial and probative value of a video re-enactment, trial
judges should at least consider the video’s relevance, its
accuracy, its fairness, and whether what it portrays can be
verified under oath.  See R. v. Creemer, [1968] 1 C.C.C. 14 at 22
(N.S.C.A.).  Other considerations may be material depending on
the case. And as with rulings on the admissibility of other kinds
of evidence, the trial judge’s decision to admit or exclude a
video re-enactment is entitled to deference on appeal.
[43] The appellants contend that another consideration should be
necessity, whether the video is needed in the light of the other
evidence in the case.  According to the appellants, if a taped re-
enactment merely repeats what witnesses have already testified
to, it adds nothing new and accordingly should not be admitted.
This argument, however, applies equally to other kinds of
demonstrative evidence – charts, graphs, diagrams and photographs
– that courts routinely admit to help the trier of fact
understand the testimony of witnesses.  The question of necessity
is, therefore, better dealt with as yet another aspect of
evaluating the prejudicial effect and probative value of a video
re-enactment in a given case.
[44] With these principles in mind, we consider the use of the
video by the Crown in this case.  We accept that the video was
relevant because it sought to portray the incident that gave rise
to the charges against the appellants.  We also accept that
Officer Rodgers testified under oath about the video and
explained it to the jury.  In our view, however, the trial judge
erred in admitting the video for two main reasons: first, he
failed to appreciate that its many inaccuracies undermined its
probative value; and second, he was not sensitive enough to the
prejudice caused by re-enacting one side’s version of events.
[45] A video’s probative value rests on the accuracy of its re-
enactment of undisputed facts. This video failed to meet this
requirement.  It did not accurately represent the undisputed
facts and even ventured into the realm of disputed facts.
Variation from the actual facts may be permissible but only if
the variation can be fully explained to and properly understood
by the trier of fact.  No explanation was given to the jury in
this case.
[46] Accuracy imports many different factors.  LeSage J. observed
in R. v. Maloney (No. 2) (1976), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 431 at 436 (Ont.
Co. Ct.) that accuracy means “consistent with facts, agreeing
with reality … reality therefore includes not only material
objects but also the immaterial such as light, sound, and the
dimensions of space and time”.  [Emphasis in original.]
Discrepancies in various factors may affect the accuracy of a
videotaped re-enactment including: time of day, time of year,
weather conditions, lighting or visibility, speed of action,
distance, location, physical characteristics of the individuals
portrayed, physical characteristics of the “props”, and
complexity of the events depicted.  Many of these factors are
inaccurately represented in this video re-enactment.  The
following table shows how the undisputed evidence at trial about
the attempted takedown differed from the video re-enactment of

    <pre>[47] These inaccuracies distorted the reality of the takedown.
The jurors were given a powerful and misleading image of what
occurred, which could only have undermined their ability to
fairly determine the crucial fact in the case, whether MacDonald
could see that those who surrounded his car were police officers.
Moreover, the video re-enactment was superfluous.  The jury heard
ample evidence from the Crown and the defence about what happened
during the takedown.  They were also given maps and diagrams of
the scene.  Overall, in our view, the video re-enactment had
little or no probative value.
[48] In contrast, the video was highly prejudicial.  The trial
judge dismissed the claim of prejudice by stating that the video
re-enactment “is not more prejudicial than oral testimony”.  This
is surely wrong.  All of the authorities say the opposite.  The
video permitted the prosecution to put before the jury its own
version of what occurred, distilled into a neatly packaged,
compressed, and easily assimilated sight and sound bite.  The
violent, visual, highly impressionistic imagery gave the Crown an
unfair advantage in this trial.  Courts must be sensitive to how
a video re-enactment that depicts only the Crown’s version of
disputed facts may distort the jury’s decision-making and thus
prejudice an accused’s right to a fair trial.
[49] In this case, the Crown’s video re-enactment contradicted in
material ways not just MacDonald’s testimony but even the
evidence of the Crown’s ballistics expert.  For example, the
video depicts the police van cutting off MacDonald’s car;
MacDonald testified that he did not see the van.  In the video
the police are yelling loudly; MacDonald testified that he did
not hear the police announce their presence.  In the video the
police are plainly visible in front of the car; MacDonald said
that he did not see the police at first and then mistook them.
On the video MacDonald’s car backs up; MacDonald testified that
the unmarked police car bumped him from behind.   The video
showed two shots fired into the front windshield on the
passenger’s side and four shots into the windshield on the
driver’s side; MacDonald’s evidence, supported by the Crown’s
ballistics expert, was that shots were fired though the window on
the driver’s door.
[50] These examples demonstrate how one-sided the video re-
enactment was.  This one-sided depiction of what occurred,
presented in vivid and forceful imagery, was highly prejudicial.
The distortion of even undisputed facts only added to the
prejudice.
[51] Ms. Reid, in her able argument on behalf of the Crown,
contended that this case is indistinguishable from R. v. Able,
[1993] O.J. 366, in which this court deferred to the trial
judge’s decision to admit a video re-enactment showing a witness’
opportunity to recognize an accused.  The video showed the
motionless shadow profile of a man for about ten seconds; in
reality the witness could see the shadow profile only for a few
seconds and in the course of a struggle.  However, a still
photograph of the same scene was admitted without objection.
Because the ten-second video was so similar to the still
photograph, its prejudicial effect was minimal.
[52] This case is different.  For the reasons we have outlined,
the police video re-enactment was high prejudicial and its
prejudicial effect vastly outweighed its limited probative value.
The trial judge exercised his discretion unreasonably in
admitting it.
[53] The Crown submits that even if the trial judge erred in
admitting the video, its admission caused no substantial wrong.
We disagree.  Apart from the video, the case against MacDonald
was strong, but not overwhelming.  Under the best of
circumstances a trial judge would be hard-pressed to craft a jury
instruction that could neutralize the powerful imagery of a
partisan video re-enactment.  The jury instruction in this case
was both inaccurate and inadequate.
[54] After telling the jury that diagrams introduced through a
witness depended on the credibility and reliability of that
witness, the trial judge said simply “Similarly, the re-enactment
video is entirely dependent upon the reliability that you attach
to the testimony of Staff Sergeant Rodgers”.  This instruction
was inaccurate because the re-enactment depended on the
recollection and reliability of all four officers, not just
Rodgers.  It was inadequate because he failed to alert the jury
to any of the dangers in relying on a video re-enactment, or to
warn them to use caution before accepting the video as an
accurate portrayal of what occurred, or even to identify the
discrepancies between the video re-enactment and the undisputed
evidence at trial.  We would therefore not apply the curative
proviso to the trial judge’s error in admitting the video re-
enactment.  This ground of appeal succeeds but only for
MacDonald, whose conduct alone was in question in the video.  The
video did not affect the case against Varcoe.</pre>

    <pre>[56] After the Crown completed its case in-chief, counsel for
MacDonald brought a Corbett application to have the two 1987
weapons convictions and the 1991 conspiracy convictions edited
from the record.  Given that MacDonald was facing two counts of
aggravated assault, it was defence counsel’s position that the
three weapons convictions portrayed him as a dangerous person
prone to violence and as such, their prejudicial effect
outweighed any marginal probative value they might have on the
issue of credibility.1
[57] In the midst of defence counsel’s submissions, the trial
judge made it clear that he would not entertain the Corbett
application at that juncture.  In his view, the application was
premature and he instructed defence counsel to renew it after
MacDonald testified in-chief.  The court then recessed for lunch.
[58] On resuming, before defence counsel opened to the jury, he
invited the trial judge to reconsider his position on the issue
of prematurity.  At a minimum, he requested that the Corbett
ruling be made before the completion of MacDonald’s evidence in-
chief so that he could lead the admissible portions of the record
in-chief.  Otherwise, as he pointed out, in assessing MacDonald’s
credibility, the jury might well be left with the erroneous
impression that he was trying to hide his record from them.
[59] Part way through defence counsel’s submissions, the trial
judge made it known that he was not about to reconsider his
ruling on the timing of the application.  At this point, Crown
counsel [not Ms. Reid] interceded in support of defence counsel’s
position and the following exchange among counsel and the trial
judge occurred:</pre>
    <pre>          CROWN COUNSEL:  What I can do in regards to 
	  this matter, if I just may respond, is if
	  Your Honour makes the ruling in regards to
	  this and it’s not in favour of defence counsel,
	  and you allow the record to go in, he can
	  conclude his examination in-chief – he can get
 	  to a certain point in his examination in-chief
	  and then say to Your Honour, would you excuse
	  the jury.  We can do the argument.  If Your
	  Honour rules against him, I have no difficulty
	  if he continues with his examination in-chief
	  and then puts that record to him.

          THE COURT:  No, no, no.  It’s either now
          or at the end of his evidence.

          CROWN COUNSEL:  That’s fine.

          DEFENCE COUNSEL:  I’m sorry, I didn’t
          understand your response to what Crown
          counsel was suggesting.

          THE COURT:  He said, in effect, why
          don’t you make your application halfway
          through the examination in-chief.  Well,
          that’s no help.  It’s either now or at the
          end of his examination.

          DEFENCE COUNSEL:  I’m sorry, I didn’t
          understand him to say that.  I thought it was
          essentially when MacDonald had finished the
          substantive portion of his evidence.  When
          they’ve heard it all, other than the issue of
          the record, we make the application, you make
          a ruling.  If it’s adverse to me, then I say
          I have one more question …

          THE COURT:  No, no.  You design your
          case, you do it your way.  I’m not going to
          make the decision until I hear his evidence.          
</pre>
    <pre>[60] As a result of the trial judge’s position, defence counsel
did not know whether MacDonald’s criminal record was admissible
in whole or in part.  Accordingly, he made no mention of it in
examination in-chief; nor was it raised by counsel for the co-
accused in cross-examination.  It was not until Crown counsel had
partially completed his cross-examination of MacDonald that a
final ruling on the Corbett application was given.  For reasons
that need not be detailed, the trial judge ruled that the entire
record was admissible and Crown counsel proceeded to lead it in
cross-examination.
[61] In our view, the procedure adopted by the trial judge raises
two issues of concern.  The first relates to his refusal to rule
on the application at the completion of the Crown’s case; the
second to his refusal to decide the application until MacDonald
completed his evidence in-chief.
[62] As indicated, the trial judge refused to rule on the Corbett
application at the completion of the Crown’s case in-chief.  In
this, he was clearly wrong.  MacDonald was entitled to a ruling
before taking the stand to testify.  See R. v. Underwood (1998),
121 C.C.C. (3d) 117 (S.C.C.).  In fairness, we note that the
trial judge did not have the benefit of Underwood at the time of
trial.
[63] On behalf of the respondent, Ms. Reid concedes the error but
argues that it did not prejudice MacDonald.  She submits that the
timing of the ruling did not deprive MacDonald of his right to
make a meaningful choice whether or not to testify.  Viewed
realistically, she contends that the case against MacDonald was
overwhelming and if he had any hope of being acquitted, he had to
take the stand and present his version of the events, regardless
of the outcome of the Corbett application.  On behalf of
MacDonald, Mr. Harris takes a different position. He mantains
that MacDonald may well have chosen not to testify had he known
that his entire criminal record would be before the jury.
[64] Mr. Harris’ position is not borne out by the record. Defence
counsel made it clear from the outset that it was MacDonald’s
firm intention to testify regardless of the outcome of the
Corbett application.  Accordingly, we cannot conclude that
MacDonald was prejudiced by the trial judge’s failure to rule on
the application at the completion of the Crown’s case.
[65] The second concern is far more problematic.  The trial judge
refused to finally rule on the application until after MacDonald
completed his evidence in-chief.  In light of Underwood, it is
axiomatic that MacDonald was entitled to a ruling on the
application before completing his examination in-chief and the
trial judge erred in ruling otherwise.
[66] In our view, this error was serious. Defence counsel made it
known that he wanted to lead the record in-chief to avoid leaving
the jury with the erroneous impression that MacDonald was
attempting to conceal it from them.  This was a valid concern.
MacDonald found himself in the difficult position of having to
overcome the evidence of close to a dozen police officers.  His
defence depended largely on the jury’s assessment of his
credibility and if he had any hope of success, it was crucial
that he present as an open and forthright witness.  To do so, he
had to be in a position to disclose his criminal record to the
jury in-chief.  The trial judge’s intransigence on the timing of
the ruling made this impossible.
[67] Defence counsel could not lead the record because he did not
know whether it was admissible in whole or in part.  This only
became known during MacDonald’s cross-examination when the trial
judge finally ruled on the application.  As a result, through no
fault of his own, MacDonald was left in the untenable position of
having to disclose his criminal record for the first time in
cross-examination.
[68] There is no telling what effect this had on the jury’s
assessment of MacDonald’s credibility.  Suffice it to say that
given the length and severity of his record, in all likelihood,
the jury was left with the impression that he was being anything
but forthright and candid in his testimony.
[69] On behalf of the respondent, Ms. Reid concedes that the
trial judge was wrong in withholding his ruling until after
MacDonald completed his evidence in-chief and she accepts that
the error may well have been prejudicial. She maintains, however,
that this is a proper case to apply the curative proviso because
the case against MacDonald was overwhelming and the verdict would
inevitably have been the same had the error not been made.
[70] We disagree.  Although the case against MacDonald was
strong, the forensic evidence lent some support to his version of
the events at the “takedown” scene, while at the same time
belying the testimony of the Crown’s key witness, Officer
Rodgers.  As indicated, the success or failure of MacDonald’s
defence depended largely on the jury’s assessment of his
credibility.  That assessment was skewed as a result of the trial
judge’s refusal to rule on the Corbett application until after
MacDonald had completed his evidence in-chief.  Accordingly, we
are not persuaded that the verdict would necessarily have been
the same had the error not been made.  We would therefore give
effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(4)  Excessive Police Force</strong></pre>
    <pre>[71] The trial judge instructed the jury that MacDonald was
relying on two possible defences to the charges of aggravated
assault, the first that he did not intentionally assault anyone,
the second that if he did commit an intentional assault, he was
justified in doing so under either s. 34(1) or s. 34(2) of the
Code.  On the charge of dangerous driving, the trial judge
instructed the jury that MacDonald’s defence was that he was
justified in driving as he did to save his life.
[72] Having summarized the defences upon which MacDonald was
relying, the trial judge then told the jury that the success or
failure of his defence really boiled down to one factual issue,
whether MacDonald genuinely believed that his assailants were not
police officers:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>  Let me deal with the law which surrounds that
  defence.  If you accept MacDonald’s testimony
  that he honestly believed that his assailants
  were not police, given that the assault that he
  described had caused grievous bodily harm and/or
  placed his life in danger, then the law allows
  him to flee and in the process to use a similar
  level of force to do so.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[73] The trial judge then read ss. 34(1) and (2) of the Code to
the jury and continued as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>  The whole point of reading that to you is that 
  the law does not apply to MacDonald if he did
  not genuinely hold the belief that his
  assailants were not police officers.  It is for
  you jurors to determine as reasonable people
  whether in the circumstances it was reasonable
  for MacDonald to hold that belief.  If the
  assault was not unlawful, then section 34 has no
  application.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[74] The trial judge next turned to ss. 25(1) and (4) of the Code
and after reading those provisions, he instructed the jury as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>          In this case, the police acted under the
	  authority of an arrest warrant vis a vis
	  MacDonald, but not Varcoe.  They were
          therefore armed with the authority given
	  by section 25. Obviously when making an
	  arrest, the police must identify themselves.
	  If you as jurors accept the evidence of the
	  police witnesses that they identified
	  themselves by uniform and/or voice, then
	  their use of force when the suspect does not
	  submit is not an unlawful assault.  If it is
	  not an unlawful assault, it doesn’t fit
	  within section 34.

          It is not for the suspect to decide if
          the level of force is excessive. There is no
          right of self-defence to force when it is
          being used by the police to make a lawful
          arrest.  The level of force employed in this
          case is not an issue for you to decide.  The
          only issue arising out of this defence is the
          one factual issue, whether MacDonald held an
          honest belief that his assailants were not
          policemen.

          If he held the belief, you should acquit
          him because section 34 applies and he is
          entitled to use force to escape.  If you do
          not accept his evidence on that point,
          examine the Crown evidence and if you are
          satisfied with it, MacDonald has no right to
          flee and no right to use force.  [Emphasis
          added.]         
</pre>
    <pre>[75] MacDonald submits that the trial judge erred in directing
the jury that the level of force used by the police in effecting
his arrest was irrelevant.  He maintains that the jury should
have been told that if they believed or had a reasonable doubt
that the degree of force used by the police was excessive, then
MacDonald was entitled to forcibly resist arrest and flee.  We
agree with this submission.
[76] On the facts of this case, it was open to the jury to
disbelieve MacDonald and find that he knew that his assailants
were police officers from the outset. That said, it was also open
to the jury to find that MacDonald took no steps to resist arrest
until after he had been shot and that his flight and the ensuing
consequences, though intentional from the outset, were justified
as a result of the excessive life-threatening force used by the
police in effecting his arrest.  Manifestly, this line of defence
was available on the charges of aggravated assault and possibly
on the charge of dangerous driving as well.  Alternatively, the
common law defence of necessity may have been available.
[77] In view of our conclusion that MacDonald is entitled to a
new trial on other grounds, we need not finally decide whether,
standing alone, this ground of appeal would require a new trial.
Depending on how the evidence unfolds at the re-trial, the trial
judge may have to decide if the defences of self-defence and
necessity are available to MacDonald.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(5)  MacDonald’s Sentence Appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre>[78] MacDonald is entitled to a new trial.  Accordingly, we do
not have to address his appeal against sentence.</pre>
    <pre><strong>VARCOE ISSUES</strong></pre>
    <pre>[79] On behalf of Varcoe, Mr. Lomer submits that the trial judge
misdirected the jury on the use of prior inconsistent statements
in assessing the credibility of various police officers and that
he further misdirected the jury on the requisite elements of the
offence of possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous to the
public peace.
[80] We see no merit in either ground.  Nonetheless, Varcoe is
entitled to a new trial because of the trial judge’s improper
exhortation of the jury.</pre>
    <pre><strong>D.   CONCLUSION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[81] Because of the errors made by the trial judge, both
appellants are entitled to a new trial.  Accordingly, the appeals
against conviction are allowed, the convictions are set aside and
a new trial is ordered.
