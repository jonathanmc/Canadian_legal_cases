    <pre><strong>On appeal from the Order of Pedlar J. dated April 1, 1999.

[1]   Although  the  argument has focussed  on  the  reasons  for
various  aspects  of the delay the fundamental analysis  must  be
whether  taking  all considerations into account the  appellant&#146;s
s.11(b) rights were violated.
[2]  We agree with the summary conviction appeal judge that the
primary consideration here is the absence of reasonable diligence
on the part of the appellant in seeking the special disclosure in
February 1998. While we do not condone the delays of the police
first in disclosing the notes of the arresting officers for June
2, 1997 and second, in complying with the order of Justice Baker,
given the lack of diligence of the appellant in seeking this
order we cannot view these time frames as running consecutively
for the purposes of the s.11(b) analysis.
[3]  In light of this and the very limited prejudice shown by the
appellant, together with the nature of the charge in this case,
we agree that there was no violation of the appellant&#146;s s.11(b)
rights.
[4]  The appeal must be dismissed.</pre>
