</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This is a Crown appeal from the
decision of a summary conviction appeal court judge quashing the conviction of
the respondent Patricia MacPherson for driving with over 80 milligrams of
alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood contrary to s.&nbsp;253(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>On May 30, 1998, MacPherson was
involved in a one-car accident. She was alone in her car at the time. There
were witnesses to the accident, one of whom, Margaret Whitmore, testified at
trial. Upon witnessing the accident, Whitmore immediately called 911 from her
car phone and the police were dispatched. Constable Cheeseman attended on the
scene within minutes of being dispatched. Upon her arrival, officer Cheeseman
spoke to some of the witnesses and learned that MacPherson’s vehicle had
suddenly lost control, hit a guardrail, crossed over the highway and come to
rest partly on the shoulder and partly in the lane. The witnesses identified
MacPherson as the driver of the vehicle. At the time the officer approached
MacPherson, she was standing alone, immediately behind her vehicle, possibly
two feet away. There was no one else around and nobody in her car. MacPherson
identified herself to officer Cheeseman as the driver of the car. Officer
Cheeseman testified that she could immediately detect an odour of alcohol on
MacPherson’s breath and observed that MacPherson appeared to be a little
disoriented. MacPherson told the officer that she drank a beer approximately
one hour previously. On the basis of this investigation, officer Cheeseman
testified that she formed a suspicion that MacPherson had alcohol in her system
and, consequently, she administered a roadside screening test pursuant to
s.&nbsp;254(2) of the <i>Criminal Code. </i>The
roadside screening device registered a “fail”. The officer then placed
MacPherson under arrest and made a demand for breath samples pursuant to
s.&nbsp;254(3)(a). The subsequent analyses of MacPherson’s breath samples
revealed blood alcohol concentration levels over the prescribed limit. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In brief reasons, the trial judge
held, on the evidence of Whitmore and officer Cheeseman, that MacPherson was
the driver of the motor vehicle and that she had never given up care and
control of it. The trial judge was also satisfied that the officer had formed a
suspicion that MacPherson had alcohol in her body. On the question of timing,
the trial judge held, even considering that thirty minutes may have elapsed
between the time Whitmore and others saw MacPherson driving her vehicle, and
the time the demand for breath samples was made, that “there was no more time
than necessary in the circumstances for the officers to discharge their
duties.” The trial judge therefore registered a conviction. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The summary conviction appeal judge
held that the roadside screening device demand was invalid because officer
Cheeseman failed to articulate in her evidence any reasonable suspicion that
MacPherson was the operator, or that she had care or control of her vehicle.
Rather, the officer stated only that she suspected that MacPherson had alcohol
in her body. On this sole basis, the summary conviction court judge excluded
the breathalyzer results and quashed the conviction.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This appeal turns on the
interpretation of s.&nbsp;254(2):</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-indent:0cm'><span lang=EN-US>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Where a peace officer reasonably suspects
that a person who is operating a motor vehicle</i> or vessel or operating or
assisting in the operation of an aircraft or of railway equipment <i>or who has the care or control of a motor
vehicle</i>, vessel or aircraft or of railway equipment, whether it is in
motion or not, <i>has alcohol in the
person’s body</i>, the peace officer may, by demand made to that person,
require the person to provide forthwith such a sample of breath as in the
opinion of the peace officer is necessary to enable a proper analysis of the
breath to be made by means of an approved screening device and, where
necessary, to accompany the peace officer for the purpose of enabling such a
sample of breath to be taken. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The issue raised on this appeal was
authoritatively determined by this court in <i>R.
v. Swietorzecki</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 285 (Ont. C.A.). Before making a
demand under s.&nbsp;254(2), a peace officer must reasonably suspect that <i>a person</i> who is operating or who has the
care or control of a motor vehicle <i>has
alcohol in her body</i>. Hence, the officer’s suspicion is in relation only to
alcohol in the body. While the Crown must also prove beyond a reasonable doubt
that the person to whom the demand was made was <i>in fact</i> operating the motor vehicle, or had care or control of it,
in order for the demand to be legal, the officer’s suspicion does not have to
extend to that additional fact. Therefore, the summary conviction appeal court
judge erred in quashing the conviction on the basis that he did.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>While counsel for the respondent did
not dispute the fact that <i>Swietorzecki</i>
is dispositive of the issue raised in the Crown’s appeal, he argued that the
summary conviction appeal court judge was nonetheless correct in quashing the
conviction because there was no evidence that MacPherson was operating, or was
in care or control of, her vehicle at the time the demand was made under
s.&nbsp;254(2). More particularly, counsel submitted that the trial judge misapprehended
the evidence in finding that the keys were in the ignition at the time the
officer approached MacPherson, when the record reveals that officer Cheeseman,
in cross-examination, conceded that she did not remember if the keys were in
the ignition. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although the trial judge may have
overstated the evidence in finding that the car keys were actually in the
ignition, that fact is not determinative of the issue of care or control. It is
clear on the evidence that MacPherson was driving her vehicle at the time of
the accident and that she was the sole occupant of her vehicle. Therefore,
shortly before the police arrived on the scene, MacPherson was not only
operating her vehicle, she was the only person who had the care and control of
it. Although there was a suggestion in Whitmore’s evidence that some persons at
the scene were contemplating moving the vehicle, there was no clear evidence
that anything had been done about it other than possibly moving it further onto
the shoulder. Whitmore testified that MacPherson got out of her vehicle after
the accident, but that she wanted to go back to it to find her glasses. At the
time officer Cheeseman approached MacPherson, the vehicle was still on the side
of the road and MacPherson was standing no more than two feet behind it.
Although uncertain about it, officer Cheeseman believed that the keys were
still in the ignition at the time. In my view, it was open to the trial judge,
on the basis of this evidence, to conclude that MacPherson “never gave up care
and control of her vehicle.”  Given this
finding of care or control, it is not necessary to determine whether MacPherson
was also operating her vehicle within the meaning of s.&nbsp;254(2) at the time
the roadside screening test was administered. The Crown need only prove one of
the two factual bases. Therefore, there was no basis to find that the roadside
screening demand was invalid. </span></p>
