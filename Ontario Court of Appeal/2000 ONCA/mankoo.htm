    <pre><strong>               J. Sandy Tse, for the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         May 25, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Matheson J. dated
October 7, 1998 and from the sentence imposed by Matheson J.
dated February 4, 1999.

    <pre>[1]  The appellant pleaded guilty to possession of counterfeit
American Travellers Cheques, forged identification and embossing
plates capable of producing more counterfeit cheques and
identification papers. These articles were found in his vehicle
upon his re-entry into Canada at Buffalo. On his conviction
appeal he sought to have his plea withdrawn.
[2]  The affidavit of the appellant&#146;s trial lawyer submitted by
the Crown, which we accept, is very clear that the appellant&#146;s
plea of guilty was a fully informed and voluntary acknowledgement
of his guilt in the face of an overwhelming case for the Crown.
We will not permit him to withdraw the plea.  The appeal against
conviction is dismissed.
[3]  The appellant asked at trial for a conditional sentence.
The appellant was a courier of counterfeit currency that exceeded
$300,000 as well as plates capable of providing additional
counterfeit currency and international passports.  He had a prior
criminal record and was on probation at the time of the offence
in question.
[4]  We can see no error in principle in the trial judge&#146;s
decision to impose a custodial term of twenty-three-and-a-half
months.  We agree that a conditional sentence was not
appropriate.
[5]  Leave to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is
dismissed.
