    <pre><strong>CATZMAN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>The appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants appeal against their convictions for
manslaughter, conspiracy to commit robbery, possession of a
weapon and wearing a disguise arising out of events that resulted
in the killing of Steven Tomlinson during a botched robbery
attempt in Ottawa.  They also ask leave to appeal the nine-year
sentence imposed on the appellant Marks and the eight-year
sentence imposed on the appellant Farrell.</pre>
    <pre>The grounds of appeal</pre>
    <pre>[2]  At the opening of the appeal, counsel for the appellants
abandoned two of their grounds of appeal:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (1)  the Crown&#146;s closing address was unfair and occasioned a
     miscarriage of justice; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     (2)  the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury
     on the subject of reasonable doubt.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  They argued the following three grounds of appeal:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (3)  the trial judge erred in the manner in which he exhorted the
          jury;</pre>
    <pre>     
     (4)  the trial judge failed to give a proper instruction
     regarding bad character evidence elicited from the appellant
     Farrell in relation to the appellant Marks; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     (5)  the trial judge erred in failing to give the jury a
     Vetrovec warning with respect to the evidence of the
     principal Crown witness.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  I have concluded that the appellants succeed on all three of
the grounds of appeal against conviction, and that I need not
deal with their appeal against sentence.</pre>
    <pre>The first ground: the exhortation</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The jury commenced deliberations on April 17th, 1996, and
continued to deliberate for almost seven full days before
rendering their verdict on April 23rd, 1996.
[6]  Deliberations on the last day commenced at 9:30 a.m.   Some
time after noon, the jury sent a note that, following a thorough
examination of all the evidence, they had reached an impasse, and
that they did not feel that further re-examination of the
evidence without guidance would resolve the impasse.   At 12:19
p.m., the trial judge provided the jury with an exhortation.  At
12:52 p.m., the jury advised that they were would resume
deliberations after lunch.  At 4:07 p.m., the court was advised
that the jury had reached a verdict.
[7]  The impugned portions of the exhortation fell into two
categories.  The first involved Rutherford J.&#146;s comments
regarding failure to reach a verdict; the second and, in my view,
the more significant, involved his comments regarding the
majority and the minority views of the jury.</pre>
    <pre>(a) failure to reach a verdict</pre>
    <pre>[8]  In his charge to the jury on April 17th, 1996, Rutherford J.
had said:</pre>
    <pre>          And when I say you must be unanimous, it is
          the right of a jury to find ultimately &#150; and
          it occasionally happens &#150; that they simply
          can&#146;t agree.
          I don&#146;t want to invite you to think much
          about that because I can&#146;t imagine how any
          other jury could be in any better position
          than you are to complete this trial by
          reaching unanimous verdicts on the charges,
          and I know you will do the best to come to
          that agreement.
          The trial has involved considerable time and
          resources, and the community and the persons
          involved in here and everyone counts on you
          to do your best to reach unanimous verdicts.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  In his exhortation to the jury on April 23rd, 1996, he said:</pre>
    <pre>          If you are unable to reach a unanimous
          verdict on one or more or indeed all of the
          counts, that count or those counts will have
          to be retried before another jury.  Although
          I cannot see how any other twelve people will
          be in any better position than you are to
          reach a unanimous verdict.
          Before coming to the conclusion that any such
          retrial will be required in this case, I&#146;m
          going to ask you to retire and try a little
          longer.</pre>
    <pre>[10] Mr. Tanovich submitted that these instructions introduced
irrelevant and extraneous considerations into the jury
deliberations and ran afoul of the principles enunciated in R. v.
G. (R.M.) (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 26 (S.C.C.). If these were the
only complaints made against the exhortation, I would not accede
to the appellants&#146; argument.  The quoted passages did not, as the
exhortation in R. v. G. (R.M.) did, advert to the expense,
hardship and inconvenience of a second trial and were, in my
view, a relatively benign admonition regarding the task the
jurors were to perform.
(b) the majority and minority views of the jury</pre>
    <pre>[11] At three places in his exhortation, Rutherford J. adverted
to the views held by the minority of jurors in their
deliberations.  In sequence, he said:</pre>
    <pre>          If any one or more of you finds yourself in a
          small minority, disposed to differ from the
          views of the rest, I would ask that you give
          very careful reconsideration to your position
          and weigh the reasons for and against the
          view that you have taken so far.  You should
          remember that it is possible that you are
          wrong in your view.  If upon careful
          consideration you can honestly bring yourself
          to a different view and thus concur with the
          majority, you should do so.</pre>
    <pre>          &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          Continue your deliberations, in the course of
          which I ask, as I have said, that any one or
          more of you that find yourself holding views
          that constitute a minority against a
          substantial majority, if that be the case &#150; I
          don&#146;t know &#150; if that be the case, I would ask
          the holder or holders of the minority views
          to do what I&#146;ve said.</pre>
    <pre>          &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          Weigh very carefully the reasons for and
          against your position and have a good look at
          them and reconsider the position and the
          reasons for it and see whether within the
          process of seeking agreement through the
          combined wisdom and experience of you all,
          and within the scope of your sworn duty, you
          can honestly bring yourself to concur with
          the majority.</pre>
    <pre>[12] These instructions run directly counter to the principles
outlined in R. v. G. (R.M.) at page 38 and to the view expressed
by Cory J. at page 42:</pre>
    <pre>          In my view, it would be preferable for a
          trial judge to avoid putting the situation in
          confrontational terms of opposing sides.
          Rather the exhortation should appeal to the
          individual jurors to once again reason
          together.  At the very least, if such a
          suggestion is made, it must state that both
          sides should listen to each other and
          consider the opinion of others.  If that is
          not done, the jury may quite rightly assume
          that the trial judge is directing them that
          the majority opinion is right simply because
          it is the view of the majority and that the
          minority should no longer try to convert the
          majority to their point of view.</pre>
    <pre>[13] If anything, Rutherford J.&#146;s exhortation in the present case
went even further than the exhortation disapproved in R. v. G.
(R.M.).  That exhortation, as Cory J. indicates, implicitly
suggested to the jury that the majority was right and the
minority wrong; the exhortation in the present case, in the first
of the three passages set out above, expressly suggested that
possibility.</pre>
    <pre>The second ground: the bad character evidence against Marks</pre>
    <pre>[14] It was the theory of the Crown that the appellant Farrell,
in the presence of the appellant Marks, shot the deceased during
a botched robbery that both of them were attempting to commit.
Farrell testified at the trial. Marks did not.
[15] In his testimony, Farrell gave evidence of Marks&#146; bad
character in a number of respects.  He testified that:
          </pre>
    <pre>       (a)  Marks was a drug dealer;
          </pre>
    <pre>       (b)  Marks owned an automatic gun which Farrell had
            seen in Marks&#146; possession;
          </pre>
    <pre>       (c)  after the shooting, the two were at a wake and
            Farrell saw Marks fire a gun at a car that was
            leaving the house;
          </pre>
    <pre>       (d)  four months after the shooting, a pair of pants
            and gloves, on which an expert found gunshot
            residue, were seized from the apartment of Marks&#146;
	    girlfriend; and</pre>
    <pre>       (e)  about two years before the shooting, Marks assaulted
            his pregnant girlfriend by punching her in the face
            and kicking her in the chest and stomach.</pre>
    <pre>[16] No instruction was given to the jury with respect to the use
that they could make of this evidence.
[17] Where evidence of bad character is tendered by the Crown,
the jurors must be instructed that they may not infer from such
evidence that the accused is guilty because he is the sort of
person likely to commit the offences for which he is being tried:
R. v. B. (F.F.) (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 112 (S.C.C.), at 138-139;
R. v. N. (R.K.) (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 40 (Ont. C.A.), at 47.
Unlike the Crown, an accused person is permitted to lead
propensity evidence against his co-accused and, in such a case,
the usual instruction has limited application:  R. v. Valentini
(1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (Ont. C.A.), at 279.  Where an
accused leads evidence of his co-accused&#146;s propensity for
violence, a proper balance of the competing interests requires
that the jury be told how it can use the evidence in considering
the case of the accused and how it cannot use the evidence in
considering the case of the co-accused: R. v. Suzack  (2000), 141
C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.).  In such a case, the jury should be
told that it may consider evidence of the co-accused&#146;s
disposition to commit the offence charged in deciding whether it
has a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the offence,
but that it must not use the evidence to find the co-accused
guilty of the offence.  A specimen instruction is set out in
Suzack, at page 490.
[18] In the present case, the jury should have been instructed
that it might consider  the evidence of Marks&#146; disposition to
commit the offences charged against him in deciding whether it
had a reasonable doubt that Farrell committed them, but that it
must not use evidence of Marks&#146; disposition to find him guilty of
them.  Although  no such instruction was requested, and no
objection was made to the trial judge&#146;s failure to give such an
instruction, I agree with Mr. Tanovich that the difficulty of the
legal application of this evidence was such that the failure to
give the necessary instruction may have occasioned serious
prejudice to the appellant Marks.</pre>
    <pre>The third ground: no Vetrovec warning</pre>
    <pre>[19] The principal Crown witness was Hugh Wilkins, known by his
street name of &#147;Jimbo&#148;.  Jimbo drove with the appellants from
Toronto in a stolen car in order to assist them in consummating a
sale of illegal drugs to a purchaser in Ottawa with whom he was
to put them in contact.   Rutherford J. described Jimbo in his
charge to the jury in these words:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The Crown&#146;s case against the two on all the counts is
essentially based on the account of what happened as 
given by Jimbo.  The central evidence, I suggest, in 
the case of the Crown is Jimbo&#146;s description of the 
purpose and the manner by which the three of them came 
to Ottawa, and when it comes to the actual incident in 
which Tomlinson was shot, the Crown relies specifically 
on the description of Jimbo of the other two going in 
for the express purpose of robbing the occupants, taking 
masks and guns with them.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] No Vetrovec warning was given to the jury with respect to
Jimbo&#146;s evidence against the appellants.  While Rutherford J. did
describe Jimbo as &#147;a participant in this gang of three that came
to Ottawa to do something illegal&#148;, he said only this on the
subject of &#147;unsavoury witnesses&#148;:</pre>
    <pre>          You have to examine each witness, and some of
          them you have good cause to examine rather
          carefully. The more unsavoury the character,
          particularly insofar as characteristics that
          you may have noted about them that go to
          their integrity and the likelihood of telling
          the truth, are factors for you to take into
          account.  The witnesses who had criminal
          record information that was brought out about
          them, or had been involved in illegal
          activities even if not convicted for, that
          was brought out to try to bring to your
          attention that these people maybe aren&#146;t
          trustworthy people.  If they do things that
          we in civilized society think shouldn&#146;t be
          done, maybe they are prepared to tell you
          under oath things that aren&#146;t true, and
          particularly when you look at the criminal
          records of any of the people that gave
          evidence you should ask yourselves, more in
          relation to records for offences that go to
          integrity and honesty whether that has a
          bearing and whether you can rely or to what
          extent you can rely on their evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[21] There were a number of reasons why the jury might have felt
concern about Jimbo&#146;s evidence.  He was an accomplice, who
participated in the conspiracy to sell drugs in Ottawa;  he was a
participant in the robbery;  he had falsely deposed at the
preliminary inquiry that he had no criminal record;  he was
working illegally in Canada, using his brother&#146;s name and a
forged passport; and he may have implicated the appellants in the
crimes in an effort to ensure that he would not be charged as
well.
[22] The recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.
Brooks (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 321 dealt with the question of the
failure of a trial judge to provide a Vetrovec warning with
respect to the danger of relying on the testimony of two
jailhouse informants to whom the accused had allegedly made
inculpatory admissions.  Both Bastarache J., writing for himself,
Gonthier and McLachlin JJ., and Major J., writing for himself,
Iacobucci and Arbour JJ., quoted from the same passage of an
article written by Marc Rosenberg on the subject of the
relationship between the importance of the impugned evidence and
the necessity to give the appropriate warning.  As Major J. said,
at page 347:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>I agree with the view expressed in &quot;Developments in the 
Law of Evidence: The 1992-93 Term&quot; (1994), 5 S.C.L.R. 
(2d) 421. The author, Marc Rosenberg (now Rosenberg J.A.),
concluded that Vetrovec and Bevan require the trial judge 
to focus on two different elements of the case in 
determining whether or not a warning is necessary. At 
p. 463 he stated:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The judge should first in an objective
way determine whether there is a reason to
suspect the credibility of the witness
according to the traditional means by which
such determinations are made. This would
include a review of the evidence to determine
whether there are factors which have properly
led the courts to be wary of accepting a
witness's evidence.  Factors might include
involvement of criminal activities, a motive
to lie by reason of connection to the crime
or to the authorities, unexplained delay in
coming forward with the story, providing
different accounts on other occasions, lies
told under oath, and similar considerations.
It is not then whether the trial judge
personally finds the witness trustworthy but
whether there are factors which experience
teaches that the witness's story be
approached with caution. Second, the trial
judge must assess the importance of the
witness to the Crown's case. If the witness
plays a relatively minor role in the proof of
guilt it is probably unnecessary to burden
the jury with a special caution and then
review the confirmatory evidence. However,
the more important the witness the greater
the duty on the judge to give the caution. At
some point, as where the witness plays a
central role in the proof of guilt, the
warning is mandatory. This, in my view, flows
from the duty imposed on the trial judge in
criminal cases to review the evidence and
relate the evidence to the issues.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[23] In the present case, there was reason to suspect the
credibility of Jimbo who, as the trial judge noted,  played a
central role in the proof of the appellants&#146; guilt, and a
Vetrovec warning should have been given to the jury to approach
his evidence with great caution.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[24] Although the Crown&#146;s factum invited us to do so, I am unable
to conclude that there is no reasonable possibility that the
verdict at trial would not have necessarily been the same if the
errors identified in these reasons not been made.
[25] Accordingly, I would allow the appeals against conviction,
set aside the convictions and order a new trial.
