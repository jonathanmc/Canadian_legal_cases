[1]  This is an appeal from conviction and sentence.  On the
conviction appeal the appellant raises two arguments.  The first
is that the trial judge failed to consider the inconsistencies
between the evidence of the complainant and that of his brother-
in-law, Mr. Said.
[2]  In our view, those inconsistencies were not significant and
in any event, the trial judge did address them in an appropriate
manner.
[3]  The second ground was that the trial judge failed to
consider aspects of the physical evidence as corroborative of the
appellant&#146;s version of events and contradictory to the
complainant&#146;s version.  Counsel referred to three pieces of
evidence: 1) the rocks shown beside the taxi on the police
diagram, 2) the blood on the taxi, and 3) the broken exacto knife
blade with blood on it embedded in the steering wheel of the
complainant&#146;s car.
[4]  In our view, the first two would have been of little or no
assistance.  In the case of the location of the rocks, the
diagram standing alone is not sufficient to deal with the
possible existence of other rocks elsewhere in the alley.  With
respect to the blood on the taxi, the accused gave an explanation
in re-examination which it was open to the trial judge to accept.
[5]  On the third point, we agree that the presence of the bloody
blade of the knife in the steering wheel of the complainant&#146;s car
is inconsistent with the complainant&#146;s version of the sequence of
events and that the trial judge did not address that issue.
However, even if the complainant was wrong on the sequence of
events, in our view that evidence of the action of the appellant
after slashing the complainant would not have been of assistance
to the appellant&#146;s claim that he acted in self defence.
[6]  We are therefore dismissing the conviction appeal.
[7]  The appellant received a sentence of fifteen months to be
followed by three years probation.  Mr. Breen urges the court to
impose a conditional sentence.  The appellant is a first time
offender and by all accounts a hardworking decent person.
Despite his positive background we are satisfied that the
sentence imposed was fit.  The offence rose out of an incident
involving what the appellant regarded as the complainant&#146;s
reckless driving.  The appellant followed the complainant intent
upon exacting revenge.  He introduced a dangerous weapon into the
confrontation and used that weapon to inflict a very serious
injury on the complainant.  As the trial judge said, the facts
&#147;called out for a deterrent sentence&#148;.
[8]  We are not satisfied that the trial judge erred in rejecting
the imposition of a conditional sentence in these circumstances.
[9]  The appeal against sentence is therefore also dismissed.</pre></td>
