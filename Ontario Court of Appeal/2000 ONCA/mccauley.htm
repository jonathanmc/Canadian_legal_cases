    <pre><strong>HEARD:         March 30, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On  appeal  from conviction and sentence by Kennedy  J.,  with  a
jury, dated May 14, 1998 and September 17, 1998 respectively.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals his conviction for fraud and his
sentence of 18 months in jail.  The appellant acknowledges that
the undisclosed conflict of interest amounted to a dishonest act.
The issue on the conviction appeal is whether the trial judge
properly instructed the jury on deprivation.
[2]  The trial judge told the jury that deprivation could occur
if the complainant, Conference Cup, ordered goods from the
appellant&#146;s company, Dezine Engineering and, moreover, that it
did not matter if the goods were cheaper, better and sold faster,
which was the qualification insisted on by the appellant.
[3]  In our view, the trial judge&#146;s instruction on deprivation
was correct.  It was consistent with the Supreme Court of
Canada&#146;s decision in Theroux and this court&#146;s decision in
Knowles.  The conviction appeal therefore fails.
[4]  On sentence, the appellant asked for a conditional sentence
or a reduction in the custodial term.  He submits that the trial
judge erred by imposing a significantly greater sentence than on
the co-accused, Ridout, and by failing to recognize that
denunciation and deterrence could also be achieved by a
conditional sentence.
[5]  We decline to interfere with the trial judge&#146;s discretion to
refuse to give a conditional sentence.  This fraud involved a
considerable amount of money, was committed over an extended
period of time, and amounted to a breach of trust.  However, we
think that the trial judge failed to give adequate recognition to
the principle of disparity.  The application of that principle
warrants a reduction in the appellant&#146;s custodial term.  The co-
accused Ridout received only a 90 day intermittent sentence.
Although Ridout pleaded guilty and co-operated with the
authorities, unlike the appellant he had a previous record, and
he appeared to have benefited as much from the fraud as did the
appellant.  Taking into account all the relevant circumstances,
in our view a fit sentence for the appellant is 9 months.
[6]  Accordingly, the conviction appeal is dismissed.  Leave to
appeal sentence is granted, the sentence appeal is allowed, and
the sentence is reduced to 9 months.</pre>
