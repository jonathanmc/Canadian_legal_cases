    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Smith
A.C.J.S.C., Ferrier and Crane JJ.), dated May 31, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>McMURTY C.J.O.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the decision of the Divisional Court
dated May 31,       1999 which granted the application for
judicial review brought by  the respondent, McKenzie Forest
Products Inc. (McKenzie), in respect of a decision of the
respondent Board of Inquiry.  The majority of the Divisional
Court held that when the Ontario Human Rights Commission
(Commission) took steps to surrender active carriage of the
complaint, the Board of Inquiry lost jurisdiction to hear the
complaint.</pre>
    <pre>Background</pre>
    <pre>[2]  In his complaint, the respondent, Adam Tilberg (Tilberg),
alleged that McKenzie infringed his right to equal treatment with
respect to employment by discriminating against him because of
his physical handicap, contrary to the Human Rights Code.
[3]  Initially, the Commission staff recommended to the
Commissioners that they not appoint a Board of Inquiry.  However,
by letter dated February 7, 1997, the Commission advised McKenzie
that it had decided to refer Tilberg&#146;s complaint to a Board of
Inquiry.  There is no explanation in the record for this turn of
events.
[4]  The hearing into the complaint commenced by a telephone
conference call.  The parties agreed to a schedule for the filing
of pleadings and the disclosure of documents.  A mediation was
held and a second mediation date was scheduled.
[5]  Prior to the second mediation, the Commission informed the
Board of Inquiry, Tilberg and McKenzie that it had decided that
it would &#147;no longer participate&#148; in the hearing before the Board
of Inquiry.  The Commission also stated in its letter that
Tilberg was &#147;aware of his right to proceed with this matter on
his own&#148;.
[6]  The Commission requested &#147;as a condition of its withdrawing
from the proceedings&#148; a letter of assurance from McKenzie stating
the following:         </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)  McKenzie does not consider it discriminated against 
Tilberg.
(b)  McKenzie understands the importance of the Code.
(c)  McKenzie acknowledges that the Code plays a significant 
role in the employment practices of employers within Ontario.
(d)  McKenzie&#146;s human resources policies adopt procedures and
policies that reflect and conform with the provision of the 
Code.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>McKenzie complied with the condition by delivering a letter of
assurance.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The respondent realized, before providing the letter of
assurance, that the complainant had not abandoned his claim.
Furthermore, the complainant had received no personal benefit
from the letter of assurance and was expected to pick up the
costs of legal representation for the continued hearing.
[8]  The hearing into Tilberg&#146;s complaint resumed with Tilberg
retaining his own counsel and revised pleadings were filed.
McKenzie then moved before the Board of Inquiry for an order
dismissing Tilberg&#146;s complaint on the basis that the Commission
had withdrawn from the complaint and &#147;relinquished carriage of
the matters&#148; leaving the Board of Inquiry &#147;without jurisdiction
to entertain the matters&#148;.
[9]  The Board of Inquiry ruled that it would continue with the
hearing of Tilberg&#146;s complaint as it had retained jurisdiction
for the following reasons:</pre>
    <pre>
          1.   The Commission,</pre>
    <pre>               (a)   had not withdrawn and cannot
               withdraw as a party before the Board  of
               Inquiry;

               (b)  lacks the authority itself to
               withdraw  a  complaint  which  has  been
               referred for a hearing; and

               (c)  is only one of at least three
               parties before any Board of Inquiry  and
               therefore  cannot on its own  cause  the
               tribunal to lack jurisdiction

          2.   In the absence of the Commission, the 
	       complainant can rely on his statutory 
	       status as a party to the proceeding to 
	       present the evidence and arguments in 
	       support of the merits of the complaint.</pre>
    <pre>[10] As indicated above, the Divisional Court granted McKenzie&#146;s
application for judicial review.  The majority held that:</pre>
    <pre>          (a)  the Code mandates that the public interest 
	  represented by the Commission prevails, in the 
	  event of a conflict, over the private interest 
	  represented by the complainant, and</pre>
    <pre>          (b)  the presence of the Commission is
          prerequisite to a hearing of the Board of
          Inquiry given the statutory scheme.</pre>
    <pre>Questions on Which Leave to Appeal was Granted</pre>
    <pre>[11] On the Commission&#146;s motion seeking leave to appeal the
Divisional Court&#146;s decision, this court granted leave to appeal
on the following questions:
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.  Did the Divisional Court err in failing to
          recognize the independent status of the complainant as
          a party before the Board of Inquiry in light of the
          policy and procedure of the Code?
          </pre>
    <pre>          B.  Did the Divisional Court err in failing to
          recognize the change in the Commission&#146;s role upon its
          referral of the subject matter of a complaint to the
          Board of Inquiry?
          </pre>
    <pre>          C.  Did the Divisional Court err in holding that the
          Board of Inquiry is not an autonomous tribunal
          independent of the Commission?
          </pre>
    <pre>          D.  Did the Divisional Court err in holding that the
          Board of Inquiry lost its jurisdiction to continue with
          the hearing of the complaint when the Commission
          decided not to participate further in the proceedings?</pre>
    <pre>Synopsis of Relevant Statutory Framework</pre>
    <pre>[12] The Human Rights Code contains substantial rights and
protections.  Section 8 explicitly empowers individuals to seek
to enforce their rights under the Code in the following language:</pre>
    <pre>     Every person has a right to claim and enforce his or her
     rights under this Act, to institute and participate in
     proceedings under this Act&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The Commission receives complaints from individuals.  It is
responsible for the investigation of a complaint and will
determine whether to refer a complaint to the Board of Inquiry
for adjudication.  A complainant may request the Commission to
reconsider its refusal to refer the complaint.  Where a decision
to refer is made, respondents have no right to a reconsideration
of that decision:  (ss.33(1)(2), 34(1), 36(1), 37(1))
[14] Upon referral, s.39 requires the Board of Inquiry to hold a
hearing.  Section 39(2) identifies the parties to a hearing
before the Board, in part, as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
     39(2)  The parties to a proceeding before the board of
     inquiry are:</pre>
    <pre>               (a)  the Commission, which shall have
               carriage of the complaint;</pre>
    <pre>               (b)  the complainant;</pre>
    <pre>               (c)  any person who the Commission
               alleges has infringed the right;</pre>
    <pre>               (d)  any person appearing to the board 
	       of inquiry to have infringed the right;</pre>
    <pre>               &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[15] A principal issue before the Board of Inquiry, the
Divisional Court and this court is the interpretation and
application of the provision in s.39(2)(a) that the Commission
&#147;shall have carriage of the complaint&#148;.  As stated earlier, the
majority of the Divisional Court held that the jurisdiction of
the Board of Inquiry was dependent upon the Commission&#146;s
&#147;carriage&#148; and participation in the hearing.


Summary of Judgments Below</pre>
    <pre>Board of Inquiry</pre>
    <pre>[16] The Board held that the Commission does not have authority
to withdraw as a party before the Board of Inquiry even if it
chooses not to participate in the hearing.  The Board further
concluded that the Commission lacks authority to withdraw a
complaint after it has been referred to a hearing and that the
Commission is only one of at least three parties before any Board
of Inquiry.
[17] The Board also emphasized that s.36(1) of the Code states
that the &#147;Commission may refer the subject matter of the
complaint to the board of inquiry&#148; and s.39(1) then mandates that
the board of inquiry hold a hearing.
[18] The Board concluded that &#147;[I]n the absence of the
Commission, the complainant can rely on his statutory status as a
party to the proceeding to present the evidence and arguments in
support of the merits of the complaint&#133;.Specific statutory
language would be required to support a finding that the
complainant&#146;s party status, and the right to a hearing on the
merits, could not survive a Commission decision to not
participate in the hearing of a complaint&#148;.


Divisional Court</pre>
    <pre>[19] Crane J. for the majority held that the issue raised by the
Board&#146;s decision was jurisdictional in nature and applied the
correctness standard of review.
[20] Crane J. further stated that, &#147;I cannot and do not
understand the Code or s.39, or the intentions of the Legislature
to be that a board of inquiry is an autonomous body empowered to
act contrary to the will of the Commission&#148;.  He then concluded
that there cannot be a hearing of the Board without the presence
of the Commission, which is charged pursuant to s.39(2) of the
Code  with carriage of the complaint.
[21] Crane J. held that where private and public interests
diverge, the &#147;Code mandates that the public interest prevails&#148;.
He then concluded &#147;that a Board of Inquiry may only proceed and
continue a hearing at the direction and carriage of the
Commission.  Further I find it repugnant to the Code that a Board
of Inquiry direct the Commission in the administration of the
Code&#148;.
[22] A further concern expressed by Crane J. is that there will
be no incentive for a respondent to settle with the Commission
and agree to amend its practices if it would still face a hearing
with the complainant.


<strong>Ferrier J. (dissenting)</strong></pre>
    <pre>[23] Ferrier J. agreed that the applicable standard of review of
the decision of the Board of Inquiry is correctness.
[24] He did not agree with Crane J. that the public interest
necessarily prevails over the private interest.  He expressed the
view that the public interest is connected with the private
interest and that the latter is also integral to the Code.
[25] Ferrier J. also drew the following distinction between the
role of the Commission and the status of a complaint after
referral to the Board:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Upon referral, the Commission in effect passes the wand 
of decision-making authority to the Board.  The Board 
must and does have independent authority to consider the 
interests of the Commission, complainant and respondents, 
all of whom are accorded independent party status.  
Pursuant to the Statutory Powers Procedures Act, the 
Board has a duty to hold a hearing once the matter has 
been referred to it, unless all parties consent to a
disposition without a hearing.  The dispute may remain 
alive even after the Commission withdraws, for the 
complainant is a separate party and the Commission&#146;s 
carriage of a complaint is only a procedural, not a 
substantive, matter.  [emphasis added]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[26] Ferrier J. concluded that the phrase &#147;carriage of the
complaint&#148; in s.39(2) refers to &#147;procedural leadership&#148; on the
part of the Commission and not total effective control of the
Commission over the complainant&#146;s rights.

Analysis of Issues</pre>
    <pre>Issue A.  Did the Divisional Court err in failing to recognize
the independent status of the complainant as a party before the
Board of Inquiry, in light of the policy and procedure of the
Code?</pre>
    <pre>[27] I agree with the appellant that the Code does not establish
a hierarchy of interests in its protection of human rights.
Nowhere in the Code is it mandated that the public interest is
accorded greater protection.  Indeed, the preamble suggests that
the Code seeks to protect both the interests of a complainant and
those of society as a whole.
[28] Section 8 of the Code explicitly recognizes the rights of
the individual complainant in stating that &#147;every person has a
right to claim and enforce his or her rights under the Act, to
institute and participate in proceedings under this Act&#133;&#148;.
[29] In Seneca College of Applied Arts and Technology v.
Bhadauria (1981) 124 D.L.R. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), the court held
that a complainant could not bring an independent civil action
based on a breach of the Code in the courts because the Code was
specifically designed to vindicate the public policy expressed
therein.  It therefore follows that if such complainants are
prohibited from procuring their remedies under the Code, they
will have no forum for obtaining relief.
[30] The Code provides the Board of Inquiry with broad remedial
powers, many of which are specifically directed toward the
individual complainant.  For example, s.41(1)(b) of the Code
empowers the Board of Inquiry to order restitution to the
complainant, including monetary compensation for a complainant&#146;s
losses and mental anguish.
[31] In my view, it would require specific wording in the Code to
find that a complainant in the position of Tilberg is unable to
pursue his right to an individual remedy.
[32] It is therefore my conclusion that the majority of the
Divisional Court did err in failing to recognize the independent
status of the complainant as a party before the Board of Inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>Issue B.  Did the Divisional Court err in failing to recognize
the change in the Commission&#146;s role upon its referral of the
subject matter of a complaint to a Board of Inquiry?</pre>
    <pre>[33] I agree with the appellant that, once the Commission
exercises its discretion to refer a complaint to the Board of
Inquiry, the role of the Commission fundamentally changes.  It no
longer acts as an investigative and screening body, but becomes a
part of the proceeding.  At this point, the determination of the
complaint then becomes the responsibility of the Board of
Inquiry.
[34] The Commission does, of course, have a responsibility to
advocate its view of the public interest and in so doing, may
also advocate for the interests of the individual complainant.
However, the Commission&#146;s role as a party to the proceeding
cannot derogate from the independent status of an individual
complainant.
[35] Under s. 39(1) of the Code, it is the Board of Inquiry which
determines if a right of a complainant has been violated and, if
so, the appropriate remedies under s.41, both in respect of
individual interests and of any broader public interest.
[36] I must, therefore, conclude that the majority of the
Divisional Court further erred in failing to recognize the change
in the Commission&#146;s role upon its referral of the subject matter
of a complaint to the Board of Inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>Issue C.  Did the Divisional Court err in holding that the Board
of Inquiry is not an autonomous tribunal independent of the
Commission?</pre>
    <pre>[37] In Canadian Pacific Ltd. v. Matsqui Indian Band (1995), 122
D.L.R. (4th) 129 (S.C.C.), Chief Justice Lamer made the following
observation in relation to administrative tribunals at p.158:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>I agree and conclude that it is a principle of natural
justice that a party should receive a hearing before a 
tribunal which is not only independent, but also appears 
independent.   Where a party has a reasonable apprehension 
of bias, it should not be required to submit to the 
tribunal giving rise to this apprehension.  Moreover, the 
principles for judicial independence outlined in Valente 
are applicable in the case of an administrative tribunal, 
where the tribunal is functioning as an adjudicative body 
settling disputes and determining the rights of parties.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[38] In Re Communications, Energy and Paperworkers  Union of
Canada et al.  and Bell Canada (1988), 167 D.L.R. (4th) 432, the
Federal Court of Appeal was dealing with the role of a human
rights tribunal appointed by the Canadian Human Rights
Commission.  At p.450, Décary J.A., on behalf of the Court,
emphasized the independent role of the tribunal as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It will be the duty of the tribunal to determine whether the
complaints are well founded or not and the tribunal will in 
no way be bound by the interpretation given to section 11 by 
the investigator and presumably adopted by the Commission.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[39] In the majority judgment of the Divisional Court, it was
stated that &#147;I cannot and do not understand&#133;the intentions of the
Legislature to be that a board of inquiry is an autonomous body
empowered to act contrary to the will of the Commission&#148;.  In my
view, this passage is clearly in error as a Board of Inquiry is
an administrative tribunal which is not only independent but
which must appear to be independent.
[40] I therefore conclude that the Divisional Court erred in not
finding that the Board of Inquiry is an autonomous tribunal
independent of the Commission.</pre>
    <pre>Issue D.  Did the Divisional Court err in finding that the Board
of Inquiry lost its jurisdiction to continue with the hearing of
the complaint when the Commission decided not to participate
further in the proceedings?</pre>
    <pre>[41] Once a complaint has been referred to the Board of Inquiry,
there is no provision in the Code which limits the Board of
Inquiry&#146;s obligation to conduct a hearing into a complaint.
[42] In my view, it is not unreasonable for the Commission to
withdraw from participating in the hearing before the Board of
Inquiry when its public interest mandate has been satisfied.
[43] The majority of the Divisional Court held that the
Commission has a statutory duty pursuant to s.39(2)(a) to have
the carriage of the complaint &#147;and that there was no authority in
the Code for the Commission to delegate such carriage to the
complainant&#148;.
[44] I agree with the submission of the appellant that an
interpretation of the Code that would not allow the complainant
to proceed in the absence of the Commission is inconsistent with
both the independent party status accorded the complainant in the
proceedings and with the Board of Inquiry&#146;s independent status
and its duty to hold a hearing.
[45] In Re Ontario Human Rights Commission et al. and Simpson-
Sears Ltd. (1985), 23 D.L.R. (4th) 321, the Supreme Court of
Canada at p.328-9 emphasizes the importance of interpreting the
provisions of the Code in a manner which will serve the policy
goals of the legislation:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It is not, in my view, a sound approach to say that
according to established rules of construction no broader 
meaning can be given to the Code than the narrowest 
interpretation of the words employed. The accepted rules 
of construction are flexible enough to enable the court 
to recognize in the construction of a human rights code 
the special nature and purpose of the enactment &#133; and 
give it an interpretation which will advance its broad 
purposes.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[46] This purposive approach of interpretation was enunciated
again in Action Travail des Femmes v. Canadian National Railway
Co. et al. (1987), 40 D.L.R. (4th), 193 (S.C.C.) by Dickson
C.J.C. at p.206:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Human rights legislation is intended to give rise, amongst
other things, to individual rights of vital importance, 
rights capable of enforcement, in the final analysis, in a 
court of law.  I recognize that in the construction of such 
legislation the words of the Act must be given their plain 
meaning, but it is equally important that the rights 
enunciated be given their full recognition and effect.  We 
should not search for ways and means to minimize those 
rights and to enfeeble their proper impact.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[47] In my opinion, the narrow interpretation given to s.39(2)(a)
of the Code by the majority of the Divisional Court that would
require the presence of the Commission for the complaint to
proceed would unduly frustrate the fundamental policy goals of
the Code.  I therefore agree with the minority opinion of Ferrier
J. who stated that &#147;[t]o hold that carriage gives the Commission
what would amount to total effective control over the
complainant&#146;s Code given substantive rights, would offend the
object and scheme of the Code and abrogate the SPPA&#148;.
[48] The word &#147;carriage&#148; is not defined in the Code.  To give it
a restrictive and narrow interpretation would indeed do violence
to the overall scheme of the Code.  It is therefore essential to
interpret the word &#147;carriage&#148; in a manner that best relates to
the statutory context.
[49] I therefore conclude that the proper interpretation of
s.39(2)(a) of the Code with respect to the Commission having
&#147;carriage of the complaint&#148; should relate to procedure and not to
substantive rights.  I agree with the appellant that the
s.39(2)(a) provision should be interpreted as instructing the
Board of Inquiry that, as between the Commission and a
complainant or complainants, carriage is to be assigned to the
Commission.  It is therefore my view that the Divisional Court
erred in finding that the Board of Inquiry lost its jurisdiction
to continue with the hearing of the complaint when the Commission
decided not to participate further in the proceedings.
[50] There is one further issue that I would like to address
given the view expressed by the majority of the Divisional Court
that it was important to give public interest settlements
priority over the right of the individual complainant to proceed
with the hearing of the complainant.  Crane J., for the majority
expressed the opinion that there would be little or no incentive
for a respondent to enter into a public interest settlement with
the Commission if the complainant could still proceed with the
complaint before a Board of Inquiry.
[51] There is no material that would support the majority&#146;s
incentive theory.  In my opinion, there could be many reasons
which would serve the interests of a respondent to enter into a
settlement with the Commission knowing that the complainant could
still proceed to seek an individual remedy.  On the other hand,
the Commission might well be reluctant to enter into a public
interest settlement with a respondent knowing that a complainant
could not proceed to seek individual remedies in its absence.

Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[52] The appeal is allowed and it is ordered that the decision of
the Divisional Court dated May 31, 1999 setting aside the interim
decision of the Board of Inquiry dated October 2, 1998 be set
aside and the matter be remitted back to the Board of Inquiry for
further hearing.
[53] The appellant, Adam Tilberg and the Board of Inquiry are
entitled to their costs of this appeal, the motion for leave to
