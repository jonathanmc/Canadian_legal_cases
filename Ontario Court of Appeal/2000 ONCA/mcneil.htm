    <pre><strong>On appeal from conviction by E. Browne J. with a jury dated
December 2, 1997
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MOLDAVER J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was tried by the Honourable Mr. Justice Browne
and a jury on a multi-count indictment consisting of the
following offences:  assault with a weapon, kidnapping, unlawful
confinement, aggravated assault, extortion, using a firearm in
the commission of an indictable offence and pointing a firearm.
All of the offences arose out of a single incident involving the
complainant, Robert Cudney, a drug dealer and addict who owed
money to the appellant and others.
[2]  The appellant was found guilty on all counts and sentenced
to a term of imprisonment totalling nine years.  He appeals from
conviction and seeks a new trial.
[3]  In broad terms, the appellant submits that the trial judge
committed several errors in his charge to the jury and that Crown
counsel [not Ms. Fairburn] engaged in improper conduct that
rendered the trial unfair and resulted in a miscarriage of
justice.  For reasons which follow, I am of the view that the
charge contains two errors of significance.  I am also satisfied
that on two occasions, once during cross-examination of the
appellant and once in her closing address, Crown counsel engaged
in improper conduct that was prejudicial to the appellant and
compromised his right to a fair trial.  It follows, in my view,
that the convictions cannot stand and a new trial must be
ordered.  Accordingly, I do not propose to review the evidence in
detail except where necessary to flesh out a particular issue.</pre>
    <pre>OVERVIEW</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On June 17, 1995, Robert Cudney was sleeping in a motel room
with his wife Dorothy and a friend Kate Cajander.  Two men
entered the room during the night.  They assaulted Cudney and
kidnapped him.
[5]  Cudney was placed in the trunk of a car driven by a third
person and taken to a farmhouse.  In the basement of the
farmhouse, he was tied to a chair and beaten with various
objects, including a rifle, following which the middle toe of his
right foot was severed with a pair of hedge clippers.
[6]  Cudney was then driven back to the motel and released.  A
short time later, he went to the hospital for treatment.
According to the medical evidence, his injuries were serious and
life threatening.
[7]  It was common ground that two of the three people involved
in the kidnapping were Emanuel Bonello and William Garner, both
of whom testified as Crown witnesses.
[8]  Bonello testified that he was retained by the appellant to
collect a drug debt from Cudney.  He said that on the night in
question, after learning Cudney&#146;s whereabouts, he and the
appellant went to the Americana Motel.  After gaining entry into
the room, they subdued and assaulted Cudney.  The appellant
placed a call from the motel room to his roommate Garner and
Garner drove to the motel.  Cudney was forced into the car and
driven to the farmhouse where the appellant and Garner lived.
En route, he was placed in the trunk of the car.  At the
farmhouse, Cudney was removed from the trunk and a large bag was
placed over his head.  He was then taken to the basement, tied to
a chair, and beaten by Bonello and the appellant.  The appellant
then asked Garner to retrieve a pair of hedge clippers and
Bonello and the appellant used the clippers to cut off the middle
toe of Cudney&#146;s right foot.  Shortly thereafter, Cudney was
returned to the motel and released.
[9]  Garner&#146;s version of the events essentially dovetailed with
Bonello&#146;s account. Cudney&#146;s wife Dorothy and Kate Cajander also
testified for the Crown.  Each confirmed that the appellant was
present with Bonello at the motel room and that he actively
participated in the beating and abduction of Cudney.
[10] Bonello and Garner were involved in the drug subculture in
London, Ontario.  They, as well as Cudney and his wife, had
lengthy criminal records.  The appellant also had a lengthy
criminal record and was well known to the London police.  Indeed,
after learning of the Cudney incident on July 5, 1995, Detective
Heslop and Constable Allen, the investigating officers, targeted
the appellant as a prime suspect before interviewing any of the
eye witnesses.  They then made &#147;deals&#148; with Cudney, his wife,
Bonello and Garner to procure their co-operation.
[11] Cudney and his wife first implicated the appellant in August
1995 when the police offered to withdraw charges against members
of their family.  When Bonello and Garner were arrested, they too
offered to implicate the appellant in exchange for reduced
sentences and other benefits.  The only Crown witness who did not
receive a benefit was Kate Cajander.
[12] In her initial statement to the police, Ms. Cajander did not
implicate the appellant.  She later made a second statement
identifying the appellant as one of the men responsible for
Cudney&#146;s abduction.  She testified that she knew the appellant
was in the motel room because she heard others refer to him by
name and swore that she had mentioned this in her videotaped
statement to the police.  Crown counsel acknowledged that this
was not so and Cudney himself testified that nobody referred to
the appellant by name while he was in the motel room.  Given that
Ms. Cajander had only seen the appellant once before the night in
question and twice thereafter, her ability to recognize the
appellant as one of the abductors was a live issue.
[13] The appellant testified and denied any involvement in the
abduction of Cudney.  He was not charged in relation to the
incident until August 1995 and by that point, he had no
recollection of his whereabouts on the night of June 18th.  He
attributed this in part to the fact that he had no reason to
recall his activities on that night because he was not involved
in the abduction.  Moreover, given his lifestyle as a heavy crack
cocaine user, one day flowed into the next and dates and times
meant nothing to him.
[14] The appellant admitted that Cudney owed him money for drugs.
He also agreed that he had retained Bonello in the past to
collect drug debts from people other than Cudney.  The appellant
maintained, however, that he was not worried about being paid by
Cudney.  Cudney was a friend who always paid his debts and
therefore, there was no reason to enlist the services of Bonello.</pre>
    <pre>CHARGE TO THE JURY</pre>
    <pre>[15] The appellant raises three grounds of appeal in relation to
the charge:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)  the trial judge&#146;s instructions undermined the burden 
of proof;
(b)  the trial judge erred in failing to warn the jury to
proceed with caution before relying upon the evidence of 
Dorothy Cudney to convict the appellant; and
(c)  the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that if
the appellant&#146;s evidence was found to be a fabrication put
forward to deceive, the jury could use that finding as 
positive evidence of guilt.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[16] The first and second grounds can be dealt with in short
order.
[17] Commencing with the first ground, I accept that the trial
judge made several slips which, viewed in isolation, may have
created some confusion about the burden of proof.  On balance,
however, when the charge is read fairly as a whole, I am
satisfied that the jury would have appreciated that the onus of
proof rested squarely on the Crown.
[18] Turning to the second ground, I am not persuaded that the
trial judge was obliged, as a matter of law, to provide a
Vetrovec warning with respect to the evidence of Dorothy Cudney.
It was open to the trial judge to conclude that her character,
though by no means pristine, did not reach the &#147;unsavoury&#148; level.
Notably, the trial judge did alert the jury to Ms. Cudney&#146;s
criminal record and her addiction to drugs and he instructed the
jury to take these factors into account in assessing her
credibility and reliability.  In the circumstances, I am not
persuaded that anything more was required.
[19] That brings me to the third ground.  As indicated, the
appellant testified and denied any involvement in the abduction
of Cudney.  In accordance with the principles set forth in R. v.
W. (D.) (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.), the trial judge told
the jury that if they believed or had a reasonable doubt that the
appellant was &#145;elsewhere&#146; on the night in question, as he
claimed, they must acquit.  He also told the jury that if they
rejected the appellant&#146;s testimony, his evidence should be
removed from the hopper and the jury should examine the remainder
of the evidence to determine whether the Crown had proved its
case beyond a reasonable doubt.  The trial judge then continued
as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Fourthly, you may go further than rejection and find 
the testimony [of the appellant] to be a lie, that it 
was a fabrication.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Several pages later, after reviewing portions of the appellant&#146;s 
evidence and providing legal instruction on the defence of alibi, 
the trial judge returned to the &#147;fabrication&#148; theme and instructed 
the jury as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It is for you to determine whether the &#145;elsewhere&#146; 
testimony of Stephen McNeill is to be accepted or rejected.  
If you find that the evidence is not just to be rejected, 
but is a lie or fabrication put forward to deceive, you may 
add that conclusion to the body of circumstantial evidence. 
[Emphasis added.]      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] As a result of this instruction, the jury was led to believe
that if the appellant&#146;s evidence of his whereabouts on the night
in question was found to be a fabrication designed to deceive,
they could use that finding as positive evidence of guilt.
[21] On behalf of the Crown, Ms. Fairburn concedes that the
impugned instruction was wrong in law.1   As she points out at
paragraph 15 of her factum:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Rejection of an accused&#146;s evidence can only be used as
circumstantial evidence of guilt where there is independent
evidence of concoction.  The appellant is correct that there 
was no independent evidence of concoction in this case.  The 
jury should never have been instructed to use the evidence 
in this fashion.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[22] Ms. Fairburn submits, however, that the error was harmless
and occasioned no prejudice to the appellant.  In support of her
position, she points to other passages in the charge in which the
trial judge made it clear that the appellant was not obliged to
prove anything and that the rejection of his testimony did not
constitute evidence of guilt.  In her submission, these &#147;proper&#148;
instructions served to neutralize the erroneous instruction.
[23] With respect, I do not share Ms. Fairburn&#146;s optimism. The
case for the Crown rested primarily on the evidence of a handful
of unsavoury witnesses who stood to gain by co-operating with the
police and fingering the person whom the police suspected from
the outset.  By the same token, the appellant was also a person
of unsavoury character and as counsel for the appellant points
out, this may have been one of those cases where the jury could
not decide who to believe.
[24] In these circumstances, it is as least conceivable that the
jury followed the impugned instruction, made a finding of
fabrication and used that finding to tip the scales against the
appellant.  In the final analysis, I cannot say that the verdict
would necessarily have been the same had the jury not been
misdirected.
[25] The second error in the charge, although not specifically
raised as such by the appellant, is integrally related to one of
his complaints about the conduct of Crown counsel.  In
particular, it arises in the context of his submission that his
right to remain silent was impinged in cross-examination.  For
reasons which will become apparent when I address that issue, I
am of the view that the error is sufficiently serious that it
cannot be overlooked.</pre>
    <pre>IMPROPER CONDUCT OF CROWN COUNSEL</pre>
    <pre>[26] The appellant points to five separate instances of improper
conduct on the part of Crown counsel.  Of the five, I am
satisfied that three merit attention.</pre>
    <pre>(a)  Cross-examination impinging on the appellant&#146;s right to
remain silent</pre>
    <pre>[27] In her examination in-chief of Detective Heslop, Crown
counsel asked the following question:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Q.   Now you told us officer that you were involved
personally in the negotiations with Mr. Garner and 
personally --- or not personally, but in a supervising 
capacity with respect to the negotiations with Mr. 
Bonello and Mr. Cudney.  Can you tell me, did you 
ever obtain a statement from Stephen McNeill?          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>    A.   No.
</pre>
    <pre>[28] The trial judge intervened at this point and the following
exchange occurred in the presence of the jury:
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>THE COURT:  What are we doing here?
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>    CROWN COUNSEL:  I asked the officer if
    he&#146;d ever obtained a statement from Stephen
    McNeill sir.
          </pre>
    <pre>    DEFENCE COUNSEL:  I guess the point is,
    because Mr. McNeill chose to rely on his
    right to remain silent that&#146;s somehow
    relevant to this trial?
          </pre>
    <pre>    CROWN COUNSEL:  Sir I never asked the
    officer whether he ever asked Mr. McNeill for
    a statement. I simply asked whether the
    officer had ever obtained one.  In my
    submission sir that&#146;s perfectly admissible.
          </pre>
    <pre>    THE COURT:  You shouldn&#146;t have asked
    that question.</pre>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <pre>[29] The trial judge gave the following mid-trial instruction to
the jury:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Members of the jury I&#146;ll try to repair that.  An 
individual has the right to remain silent, and 
there&#146;s nothing untoward about relying upon a 
right.  Everybody has that right to remain silent, 
so it&#146;s quite prejudicial to have asked that question.
The inference from the question is something that 
shouldn&#146;t be in your minds.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[30] Crown counsel then posed another question to the officer
which resulted in the jury being excused.  In the absence of the
jury, defence counsel moved for a mistrial on the basis that
Detective Heslop&#146;s response to the previous question had caused
irreparable prejudice to the appellant.  The trial judge refused
to order a mistrial.  In his view, the mid-trial instruction was
sufficient to cure the prejudice.
[31] That is how matters stood until the appellant took the
stand.  At the tail end of the appellant&#146;s examination in-chief,
defence counsel posed the following question and received the
following response:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   When Detective Heslop was testifying the
	  crown attorney asked him if he had a statement
	  from you in relation to this incident and his
	  answer was no.  Did you give the police any
          statement in relation to this incident?
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I don&#146;t make statements. &#133;  I was
          instructed by a lawyer a long time ago that
          any statement I make that&#146;s going to help me
          will not be heard.  The only statement that
          will be heard is one that hurts me.  I
          basically have nothing to say to them.  If
          it&#146;s not going to help me I sure  --- - I&#146;m
          not going to tell them anything.  I will
          remain silent as my right.          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[32] It is unclear why defence counsel chose to revisit the issue
of the appellant&#146;s failure to provide a statement to the police.
Perhaps he felt compelled to confront the issue directly.
Whatever the reason, rather than leaving the matter alone, Crown
counsel seized upon the opportunity and cross-examined the
appellant at great length about a prior occasion when he was
arrested for breaking and entering and provided an exculpatory
statement to the police which resulted in the charge being
withdrawn.
[33] The appellant contends that this line of questioning was
improper and highly prejudicial because it was designed to leave
the jury with the impression that he was the type of person who
provided exculpatory statements to the police if innocent but not
if guilty.  Using this prohibited line of reasoning, he submits
that it would be but a short step for the jury to conclude that
his failure to give a statement in relation to the Cudney
incident was a sure sign of guilt.
[34] On behalf of the respondent, Ms. Fairburn seeks to justify
the cross-examination on the basis that the appellant&#146;s
explanation for not giving statements to the police opened the
door to an attack on his credibility and the questions posed by
Crown counsel were directed towards that end.
[35] I accept Ms. Fairburn&#146;s assessment of the issue and agree
that it was legally permissible for Crown counsel to proceed as
she did.  That said, it seems to me that having created the
problem to begin with, it would have been preferable had Crown
counsel not seized upon the appellant&#146;s response to launch a full
scale attack on his credibility.  In the circumstances, the
fairer course would have been to leave the matter alone.
[36] The problem, however, does not end there.  As indicated, the
cross-examination was permissible to discredit the appellant.
The evidence, however,  could not be used to show that he was the
type of person who provided exculpatory statements if innocent
but not if guilty and a limiting instruction to this effect was
required.
[37] In his charge, the trial judge specifically warned the jury
not to draw an adverse inference against the appellant for having
exercised his right to remain silent.  He did not, however,
instruct the jury on the use that could be made of the
appellant&#146;s evidence concerning the exculpatory &#147;break and enter&#148;
statement,  nor did he tell the jury how that evidence could not
be used.  In my view, the trial judge was obliged to tell the
jury that they could only use the evidence to assess the
appellant&#146;s credibility and not to show that he was the type of
person likely to provide statements if innocent but not if
guilty.  The trial judge&#146;s failure to give the appropriate
limiting instruction constituted error.</pre>
    <pre>(b) Cross-examination of the appellant on defence counsel&#146;s
    failure to pose specific questions to the Crown witness
    Bonello</pre>
    <pre>[38] In his examination in-chief of the appellant, defence
counsel asked whether the appellant had spoken to Bonello after
the Cudney incident.  The appellant answered in the affirmative
and the following series of questions and answers ensued, without
objection from Crown counsel:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   And what did Mr. Bonello say about it?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I was --- I was probably a little
          aggressive with him at first, and he became
          aggressive right back saying that ... you
          know &#133; I told him that Bob Cudney --- you did
          this for me; and he said:  No, no, no, no.
          This was done for &#145;killer&#146;.  It had nothing
          to do with you.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   For who?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   &#145;Killer&#146;.  I know that sounds a
          little bit cliché, but &#133; as you heard other
          people testify &#133; this is actually somebody&#146;s
          name.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.   Did you force the issue with
          Bonello?
          </pre>
    <pre>          A.   I wouldn&#146;t force any issue with
          Bonello.  He just told me that it was Cud ---
          or &#145;killer&#146;s&#146; beef and it had nothing to do
          with me.          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[39] For reasons unknown, defence counsel did not question
Bonello about this conversation.  He was obliged to do so under
s. 11 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5, if it was
his intention to lead evidence of a prior statement inconsistent
with Bonello&#146;s testimony.  Had Crown counsel raised the
appropriate objection, it would have been for the trial judge to
decide whether the appellant should be permitted to testify about
the purported conversation (see R. v. P. (G.) (1996), 112 C.C.C.
(3d) 263 at 278-287 (Ont. C.A.).
[40] Defence counsel&#146;s failure to question Bonello about the
conversation did not go unnoticed by the Crown.  No doubt, she
was concerned that Bonello had not been given the opportunity to
confirm, deny or explain it.   To the extent she felt the matter
was worth pursuing, in my view, the proper procedure would have
been to raise the issue with the trial judge in the absence of
the jury.   That way, the trial judge could have determined
whether her concern was valid and if so, what steps should be
taken to remedy the situation.
[41] Regrettably, Crown counsel did not pursue this course.
Instead, she chose to confront the appellant with the fact that
defence counsel had not questioned Bonello about the purported
conversation either at the preliminary hearing or at trial:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   The gentlemen that you named &#133;. that
	  you said Bonello named as having been the whole
	  cause of the Cudney incident; you said his name
	  was &#146;killer&#146;?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   He said it was &#145;killer&#146;s gig&#146;, that
          he was involved with Cudney over, not me;
          &#145;killer&#146;s gig&#146;.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   You were present at the preliminary
          hearing as well as at the trial of this
          matter, isn&#146;t that true?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   Absolutely.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   You never heard Mr. Bolnello asked
          if it was &#145;killer&#146;s gig&#146; did you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   I never heard him &#133;?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   Anybody ask Bonello anything about
          &#145;killer&#146;s gig&#146;, or if he said that to you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               A.   No.  I believe &#145;killer&#146; was
          mentioned somewhere in this.  I think by Bob
          Cudney.  I don&#146;t believe Bonello ever used
          his name.  He may have but I don&#146;t recall off
          the top of my head.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Q.   That was my point sir.  You&#146;re
          telling us about a conversation that you had
          with Mr. Bonello, but no one ever suggested
          to Bonello that that conversation occurred,
          correct?</pre>
    <pre>[42] In my view, this line of questioning was improper because it
was capable of leaving the jury with the impression that the
appellant should be held responsible for what may have been a
tactical decision or mere oversight on the part of defence
counsel.  (See R. v. Henderson (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 131 at 141-
2 (Ont. C.A.)).
[43] As explained, defence counsel&#146;s failure to question Bonello
about the purported conversation involved a breach of s. 11 of
the Canada Evidence Act.  That, however, is not the way the issue
was presented to us.  Rather, it was framed as a breach of the
rule in Browne v. Dunn (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.).  Accordingly, I
propose to address that rule, primarily with a view to
considering the options available when it is breached.
[44] The rule in Brown v. Dunn was succinctly stated by Labrosse
J.A. in R. v. Henderson, supra, at p. 141:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>This well-known rule stands for the proposition that 
if counsel is going to challenge the credibility of 
a witness by calling contradictory evidence, the 
witness must be given the chance to address the 
contradictory evidence in cross-examination while he 
or she is in the witness-box.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[45] In R. v. Verney (1997), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 363 at 376 (Ont.
C.A.), Finlayson J.A. outlined the purpose and ambit of the rule:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Browne v. Dunn is a rule of fairness that prevents the
&#147;ambush&#148; of a witness by not giving him an opportunity 
to state his position with respect to later evidence 
which contradicts him on an essential matter.   It is 
not, however, an absolute rule and counsel must not 
feel obliged to slog through a witness&#146;s evidence-in-
chief, putting him on notice of every detail that the
defence does not accept.  Defence counsel must be free 
to use his own judgment about how to cross-examine a 
hostile witness.  Having the witness repeat in cross-
examination, everything he said in chief, is rarely the 
tactic of choice.  For a fuller discussion on this 
point, see Palmer and Palmer v. The Queen (1979), 50
C.C.C. (2d) 193 at pp. 209-10, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, 14
C.R. (3d) 22 (S.C.C.).</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[46] While these decisions explain the rule and its underlying
purpose, they do not address the options available to a party who
feels aggrieved by the failure of his or her opponent to adhere
to it.  To that end, I offer these suggestions.
[47] In cases such as this, where the concern lies in a witness&#146;s
inability to present his or her side of the story, it seems to me
that the first option worth exploring is whether the witness is
available for recall.  If so, then assuming the trial judge is
otherwise satisfied, after weighing the pros and cons, that
recall is appropriate, the aggrieved party can either take up the
opportunity or decline it.  If the opportunity is declined, then,
in my view, no special instruction to the jury is required beyond
the normal instruction that the jury is entitled to believe all,
part or none of a witness&#146;s evidence, regardless of whether the
evidence is uncontradicted.
[48] The mechanics of when the witness should be recalled and by
whom should be left to the discretion of the trial judge.
[49] In those cases where it is impossible or highly
impracticable to have the witness recalled or where the trial
judge otherwise determines that recall is inappropriate, it
should be left to the trial judge to decide whether a special
instruction should be given to the jury.  If one is warranted,
the jury should be told that in assessing the weight to be given
to the uncontradicted evidence, they may properly take into
account the fact that the opposing witness was not questioned
about it.  The jury should also be told that they may take this
into account in assessing the credibility of the opposing
witness.
[50] Depending on the circumstances, there may be other
permissible ways of rectifying the problem.  The two options that
I have mentioned are not meant to be exhaustive.  As a rule,
however, I am of the view that they will generally prove to be
the fairest and most effective solutions.
[51] Returning to the issue at hand, Ms. Fairburn does not
attempt to justify the impugned line of questioning.  Instead,
she submits that the trial judge&#146;s instructions to the jury were
sufficient to overcome any prejudice occasioned to the appellant.
The trial judge dealt with this issue in general terms as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The procedure of cross-examination is a procedure I regard
as one of fairness; a rule of professional practice.  It is
applicable where it is intended to suggest the witness is not
speaking the truth on a particular point.  The question, by the
suggestion made, often sets the stage, as I have tried to
indicate, for defence evidence to be led in support of the
suggestion.  If put to a witness in cross-examination, the
witness has the opportunity to explain.  If not put to the
witness in cross-examination, but put later to other witnesses,
the suggestion is then perhaps impossible to explain, and triers
of fact can be left with the inference that the witness&#146;s story
is untrue and the witness unworthy of credit &#133; believability.</pre>
      <pre>There is therefore the practice of cross-examining counsel to 
put to the witness all significant matters upon which they seek 
to contradict.  I emphasize the words &#145;all significant matters&#146;, 
as some matters may be so obvious as not to be of significance, 
and likewise some matters may be so insignificant or 
interrelated with other matters so as not to require a singling 
out, and the use of time that might be involved in that singling
out.</pre>
      <pre>It is for you to decide if there were any significant matters 
upon which crown witnesses were not cross-examined, which
matters were put forward by other witnesses with a view to 
suggesting the particular crown witness was not worthy of 
belief.  It is for you to decide if there were any such lapses 
or failure to cross-examine, and if so, what weight to be 
given to the particular evidence to be called for which there 
was no opportunity to explain. [Emphasis added.]
      </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[52] In my view, these instructions were deficient in two
respects.  First, to the extent the jury understood them to
relate to defence counsel&#146;s failure to question Bonello about the
purported conversation, the trial judge left the jury with the
impression that Bonello (and inferentially the Crown), was left
in the impossible position of being unable to explain the
conversation.  With respect, that was both inaccurate and
misleading.  Had Crown counsel wished to have Bonello&#146;s
explanation before the jury, she could have sought permission to
have him recalled.  There was nothing to suggest that Bonello was
unavailable or that his recall would have posed any difficulty.
As it is, she made no effort to do so.  Accordingly, it was wrong
to leave the jury with the impression that defence counsel&#146;s
failure to question Bonello rendered it impossible for him to
offer an explanation.
[53] Secondly, although the jury was instructed on the use that
could be made of defence counsel&#146;s failure to question Bonello,
they were not told that the appellant should not be held
responsible for what may have been a tactical decision or mere
oversight on the part of his counsel.</pre>
    <pre>(c)  The suggestion that Bonello had been believed by another
jury</pre>
    <pre>[54] Defence counsel cross-examined Bonello with a view to
showing that he had testified in the past as a Crown witness in
exchange for favourable treatment.  Bonello was shown a
transcript of a preliminary inquiry held in Calgary in 1990 in
relation to two individuals charged with murder.  In the
transcript, a person named Emanuel Bonello testified that he was
present when the two accused cut off the victim&#146;s toes and killed
him.  He also testified that he had agreed to co-operate with the
authorities in exchange for the withdrawal of weapons charges.
[55] Bonello denied being the person in the transcript and
accused defence counsel of having fabricated it.  Crown counsel,
however, admitted that Bonello did testify in the earlier case
and that the transcript was accurate.
[56] In her closing address, Crown counsel sought to restore
Bonello&#146;s credibility as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>I&#146;ve admitted to this court and I&#146;ve admitted to defence
counsel that all of those things that he said that he didn&#146;t
remember in Calgary, occurred.  We&#146;ve admitted that; but remember
as well, just because he testified before in a previous hearing
and doesn&#146;t want to say anything about it, doesn&#146;t mean he&#146;s
lying now.  I mean, you know that those two people are in the
penitentiary.  You know that those two people were convicted, and
they&#146;ve been in that penitentiary since 19 --- well 1989, with
the date of the offence, and they&#146;ve been in the penitentiary
from --- they are now and have been since the date of this
incident, June 18th, 1995.  So you have to assume there wasn&#146;t an
appeal.  So you have to assume that on a previous occasion his
evidence was believed and these people were convicted.  Just
because someone testifies for the Crown doesn&#146;t mean they&#146;re
lying.  Just because someone gets a benefit doesn&#146;t mean they&#146;re
lying.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[57] Counsel for the appellant submits that it was improper for
the Crown to suggest that Bonello was obviously believed by
another jury.  He correctly points out that there was no evidence
that Bonello even testified at the trial in Calgary.  In
addition, he maintains that even if Bonello did testify at the
trial, without knowing what other evidence was tendered, it was
pure speculation to conclude that Bonello was believed.  Finally,
even if Bonello was believed by another jury, this was a
completely irrelevant consideration and the jury ought not to
have been invited to take it into account.
[58] I agree with each of those submissions.  Apart from being
misleading and inaccurate, the impugned remarks invited the jury
to speculate and take irrelevant considerations into account.
[59] Ms. Fairburn does not seek to justify the impugned remarks.
Rather, she submits that the trial judge repaired the damage in
his charge.  With respect, I do not entirely agree.
[60] While it is true that the trial judge told the jury that
there was no evidence that Bonello had testified at the trial in
Calgary, in my opinion, he should have gone further and
instructed the jury that they were to take nothing from the fact
that the two men charged in Calgary were convicted.  Absent this
instruction, the jury may well have concluded that Bonello was
telling the truth at the preliminary hearing and that his
evidence in the instant case could therefore be safely relied
upon.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[61] The charge contained two errors of significance that were
potentially prejudicial to the appellant. Two instances of
improper conduct on the part of Crown counsel have been
identified.  Each was capable of occasioning prejudice to the
appellant.
[62] Although the case for the Crown was strong, in my view, it
was not overwhelming.  In all of the circumstances, I cannot say
that the verdict would necessarily have been the same despite the
legal errors and inappropriate conduct of Crown counsel.
Accordingly, this is not an appropriate case to apply the
proviso.  To the contrary,  the interests of justice require that
a new trial be ordered.
[63] In the result, the appeal is allowed, the convictions are
quashed and a new trial is ordered.
