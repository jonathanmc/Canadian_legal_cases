                      ENDORSEMENT
                                

[1]   The  appellants move for an extension of time to  file  the
appeal.   It is conceded that the delay was brief, the  intention
to  appeal was there all along and that there is no prejudice  to
the respondents consequent on the delay.
[2]  The argument is that there is no merit to the appeal.  In my
view, there are issues of law raised.  At this point I cannot say
that they have so little merit that in the face of the other
factors no leave should be granted.  Further, it remains arguable
that the appeal period has not yet started to run as the issue of
costs remains outstanding.  I need not decide that point at this
time.
[3]  In all the circumstances, leave is granted to the appellant
extending the time to file the notice of appeal to Monday,
January 17, 2000.
[4]  The respondents move for security for costs against the
joint venture corporation.  The evidence as to the ability of
that appellant to pay costs is unclear. However, the other
appellant I am told, is able to pay.  As I understand it these
appeals will stand or fall together, therefore the costs should
be recoverable.  If that is not necessarily the case, or if the
evidence of the inability of the joint venture company to pay
costs becomes clearer, this order is made without prejudice to
the renewal of the motion for security for costs by the
respondents as advised.
[5]   Costs of today shall be to the appellants in the  cause  of
the appeal fixed at $1,000.00.</pre></td>
