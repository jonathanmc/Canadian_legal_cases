    <pre>McMURTRY C.J.O.:</pre>
    <pre>NATURE OF THE APPEAL
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The plaintiff appeals from an Order of Mr. Justice Crane dated
May 4, 1999 striking out certain paragraphs of the statement of claim
for failure to comply with the notice provisions of the Libel and
Slander Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.L.12.
[2]   The plaintiff also purports to appeal to this court from the
order of Crane J. granting leave to amend various paragraphs of the
statement of claim, failing which they would be struck out.  That
order was clearly interlocutory, and could only be appealed to the
Divisional Court with leave of a judge of the Superior Court of
Justice: sec. 19(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act.  No leave having
been sought and obtained, this court does not acquire jurisdiction to
entertain that appeal under the provisions of sec. 6(2) of the Act:
Albert v. Spiegel (1993), 17 C.P.C. (3d) 90; Chitel v. Bank of
Montreal, [1999] O.J. No. 3988; Manos Foods International Inc. v. Coca-
Cola Ltd., [1999] O.J. No. 3623.
[3]  I would therefore make no disposition of that portion of the
appeal, without prejudice to any motion the plaintiff might make, if
so advised, to a judge of the Superior Court of Justice for leave to
appeal to the Divisional Court.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The statement of claim alleged some twenty-three separate
defamatory articles published in the Hamilton Spectator by the
defendant Southam Inc.  The alleged defamatory words are
particularized in the statement of claim in relation to each article
as well as the identity of the specific defendants that are alleged to
be responsible for each article.
[5]  The Hamilton Spectator, a daily newspaper, published the articles
between October 1997 and April 1998.  The articles referred to the
plaintiff who had been a long-standing alderman on city council until
he lost the November 10, 1997 election.
[6]  The Libel and Slander Act requires that written notice of libel
in a newspaper be given to a defendant within six weeks of the alleged
libel coming to the notice of a plaintiff. The Libel and Slander Act
further provides that an action for libel in a newspaper must be
commenced within three months of the alleged libel coming to a
plaintiff&#146;s knowledge.
[7]  It is agreed that the appellant had knowledge of the alleged
libels on the dates that the articles were published.  The appellant
delivered three libel notices to the respondents on December 23, 1997,
March 26 and May 29, 1998, complaining about the twenty-three
articles.  Three of these articles were published during the election
campaign but seven weeks or more before the first libel notice.  Nine
of the articles complained of in the second libel notice were
published more than six weeks before that notice was received.  The
only article complained of in the third libel notice was published
more than six weeks before that notice was received.
[8]  The motions judge struck out all of the paragraphs of the
statement of claim whose notices had not been served within six weeks
after the alleged libel had come to the appellant&#146;s attention.
[9]  The issues in relation to the appeal are as follows:      </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1. Would it be open to a trial judge to find that the series
of 23 articles complained of could be treated as a &#147;single libel&#148;
for purposes of the notice requirements of section 5(1) of the 
Libel and Slander Act?

2. Does section 5(3) of the Libel and Slander Act exempt the
appellant from any requirement to provide a libel notice under
section 5(1) of the Act because the appellant was a candidate
in the November 10, 1997 municipal elections and therefore
exempted from the notice requirements of s. 5(1) of the Act?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10] The relevant sections of the Libel and Slander Act are as
follows:

  5(1) No action for libel in a newspaper or in a broadcast lies
  unless the plaintiff has, within six weeks after the alleged
  libel has come to the plaintiff&#146;s knowledge, given to the
  defendant notice in writing, specifying the matter complained
  of, which shall be served in the same manner as a statement
  of claim or by delivering it to a grown-up person at the
  chief office of the defendant.

   (2) The plaintiff shall recover only actual damages if it
   appears on the trial,

       (a) that the alleged libel was published in good faith;</pre>
    <pre>       (b) that the alleged libel did not involve a criminal charge;

       (c) that the publication of the alleged libel took place in
        mistake or misapprehension of the facts; and

       (d) that a full and fair retraction of any matter therein
       alleged to be erroneous,

           (i)  was published either in the next regular issue
           of the newspaper or in any regular issue thereof
           published within three days after the receipt of the
           notice mentioned in subsection (1) and was so
           published in as conspicuous a place and type as was
           the alleged libel, or

           (ii)  was broadcast either within a reasonable time
           or within three days after the receipt of the notice
           mentioned in subsection (1) and was so broadcast as
           conspicuously as was the alleged libel.

   (3)  This section does not apply to the case of a libel against
   any candidate for public office unless the retraction of the
   charge is made in a conspicuous manner at least five days before
   the election.  R.S.O. 1980, c. 237, s. 5.

  6.  An action for a libel in a newspaper or in a broadcast shall
  be commenced within three monthsafter the libel has come to the
  knowledge of the person defamed, but, where such an action is
  brought within that period, the action may include a claim for
  any other libel against the plaintiff by the defendant in the
  same newspaper or the same broadcasting station within a period
  of one year before the commencement of the action.  R.S.O.
  1980, c. 237, s.6.</pre>
    <pre>                                   
Issue Number 1: Could the 23 articles be treated as a &#147;single libel&#148;?</pre>
    <pre>[11] In support of the appellant&#146;s submission that the twenty-three
separate publications could be considered as a single libel by the
trial judge we were referred to Botiuk v. Toronto Free Press, [1995] 3
S.C.R. 3.  In Botiuk the Supreme Court of Canada held that in the
special circumstances of that case several defendants could be held
jointly and severally liable for the defamatory publications.
[12] Cory J. noted at p. 17 that &#147;[t]he trial judge observed that
counsel for all parties proceeded on the basis that although the
contents of each document could be taken individually as to its
defamatory nature, all three were to be considered together as
creating a single act of libel.  He proceeded on this basis.&#148;
[13] Furthermore, in relation to the issue of joint liability, Cory
J., at pp. 27-28,  referred to Fleming&#146;s The Law of Torts, 8th ed.
1992, and the author&#146;s comments at p. 225:

   A tort is  imputed to several persons as joint tort
   feasors in three instances: agency, vicarious liability,
   and concerted action &#133;. The critical element of the third
   is that those participating in the commission of the tort
   must have acted in furtherance of a common design.... 
   Broadly speaking, this means a conspiracy with all
   participants acting in furtherance of the wrong, though
   it is probably not necessary that they should realize
   they are committing a tort.
</pre>
    <pre>[14] It should also be noted that Major J. in concurrent reasons made
some observations with respect to defamatory publications where more
than one defendant is involved.  I infer from the comments of Major J.
that he was somewhat skeptical about treating separate defamatory
publications as one libel.  In any event, he made the following
observation at p. 41:

   It is not clear how the trial judge concluded that he
   would treat all the defamatory publications as one libel.
   It was open to him to consider each act of publication
   as a separate cause of action.  However, the trial judge
   had a discretion to combine the several closely related 
   publications and to make a single award of damages in
   relation to those publications.          
</pre>
    <pre>[15] Major J. went on to state (p. 42) that the trial judge &#147;must have
concluded that all the appellants acted in concert with one another
and that the defamatory statements were published in furtherance of a
common design.&#148;
[16] In this case, it is pleaded in the appellant&#146;s statement of claim
that the &#147;defendants embarked upon a deliberate campaign to defame,
damage and discredit&#148; the appellant &#147;with a view to securing his
defeat as a candidate for alderman.&#148;  It should be noted, however,
that the election was held on November 10, 1997 after only three of
twenty-three articles complained of had been published.
[17] With respect to the defamatory statements in Botiuk, there was no
requirement  under the Libel and Slander Act to deliver a notice
within six weeks after learning of the alleged libel.  The important
policy consideration in relation to correcting the public record as
soon as possible in so far as a newspaper or broadcaster is concerned,
therefore, had no application.
[18] The appellant also relies on a decision of this court, Misir v.
Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd., [1997] O.J. No. 4960. In that action the
plaintiffs claimed that they were defamed in a series of twelve
articles with respect to abuses in Ontario&#146;s car insurance system
which were published in the Toronto Star in May and September, 1995.
Only the last article, published on September 30, 1995, actually named
the plaintiffs.
[19] The defendants brought a motion to dismiss all claims other than
the libel alleged in the September 30th  article on several grounds,
the first being that the libels alleged in the May articles were
statute barred because the required notice was not given.
[20] Laskin J.A. describes the purpose of section 5(1) of the Libel
and Slander Act as follows at para. 13:

   Section 5(1) is a condition precedent to the bringing of an
   action for libel.  Lack of notice bars the action.  The court
   has no power to relieve against or excuse non-compliance with
   the notice requirement.  Notice enables the newspaper to publish
   a retraction, correcting, withdrawing or apologizing for
   statements alleged to be erroneous and to mitigate damages if
   the statements are found to be defamatory.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Laskin J.A. goes on to state, in part, that &#147;section 5(1),
however, includes the element of discoverability.  &#133; [and] the
material before the motion judge does not disclose when [the
plaintiffs] became aware of the publication of the May articles.  On
that ground alone, the alleged libels in the May article cannot now be
held to be barred by s. 5(1) of the Act.&#148;
[22] Laskin J.A. also states that he would not give effect to the
limitation period defence even if the plaintiffs had knowledge of the
May articles when they were published.  While the May articles may
have been defamatory, they were not reasonably capable of defaming the
plaintiff until they were raised in the September 30 article.  Laskin
J.A. also stated that even &#147;had the plaintiffs given notice within six
weeks of the publication of the May articles and issued their
statement of claim before September 30, 1995, the defendants
undoubtedly would have moved to dismiss the action because the
articles did not refer to the plaintiffs.&#148;
[23] In Misir, Laskin J.A. also referred to Botiuk and the comments of
Major J. (at para. 20) where he stated that the &#147;various defamatory
publications in these appeals were closely intertwined and no basis
has been shown that would warrant interfering with [the trial judge&#146;s]
discretion.&#148;
[24] In conclusion, Laskin J.A. states at para. 18:

   Applying these principles, the trier of fact will be
   entitled to find that the May articles were defamatory
   of the plaintiffs because of the publication of the
   September 30th article.  Alternatively, the trier of
   fact may be entitled to treat the separate publications - the
   May and the September articles - as a single libel.          
</pre>
    <pre>[25] In the appeal before us, the appellant alleged a separate libel
in relation to each of the articles.  While it could be argued that
the Southam defendants &#147;may have acted in furtherance of a common
design&#148; adopting the words of Fleming in The Law of Torts, quoted
earlier, I am of the view that it would be incorrect to treat the
articles as a single libel.  The circumstances were quite different in
Botiuk where counsel for all parties proceeded on the basis that the
three documents were to be considered as capable of creating a single
act of libel.  Furthermore, the Botiuk case did not raise any issue
with respect to section 5(1) of the Libel and slander Act.  In the
special circumstances in Misir, Laskin J.A. held that the earlier
articles were not reasonably capable of defaming the plaintiffs until
the publication of the last article. Therefore, the notice provisions
of the Libel and Slander Act did not apply before that time.  In that
case, the important policy reasons behind s. 5(1) of the Libel and
Slander Act were not frustrated by such an interpretation.  However,
the policy reasons would be frustrated if the trier of fact was
permitted to treat the twenty-three articles in the case before us as
a single libel.
[26] In Misir, the court held that all of the articles together could
be viewed as having a combined effect that was defamatory.  There is
no similar allegation by  the appellant in this case, as he is clearly
identifiable in each of the twenty-three articles. It is also
acknowledged that the appellant had knowledge of the alleged libel on
the various dates they were published.
[27] I am of the view that separate instances of alleged defamatory
publications cannot be combined for notice purposes unless they depend
on other publications for their defamatory meaning. The trier of fact
may well be able to combine the defamations so found in an assessment
of damages.
[28] I conclude that the twenty-three articles complained of cannot be
treated as a &#147;single libel&#148; for the purposes of the notice
requirements of s. 5(1) of the Libel and Slander Act.</pre>
    <pre>Issue No. 2 &#150; Was the appellant, as a candidate for public office,
excepted from giving notice by virtue of subsection 5(3) of the Libel
and Slander Act?
</pre>
    <pre>[29] The appellant submits that the notice provision of section 5(1)
does not apply to him by reason of section 5(3) which states that
&#147;this section&#148;, meaning s. 5 in its entirety, does not apply to the
case of a libel against any candidate for public office.
[30] There is no question that the appellant was a candidate for
public office up to the election of November 10, 1997.  The appellant
argues, however, that it should be left to the trial judge to
determine whether the appellant was still a candidate after that date,
perhaps for the next election.  In my view, the submission has no
merit as there was nothing in the material before us that would
indicate that the appellant was still a candidate for some public
office after the November 10th  election.
[31] The interpretation of section 5(3) is a more difficult issue. Sub-
section (3) states as follows:

   (3)  This section does not apply to the case of a libel
   against any candidate for public office unless the
   retraction of the charge is made in a conspicuous manner
   at least five days before the election.
</pre>
    <pre>[32] In my view, sub-section (3) is clearly ambiguous and the
objective of the legislation must be considered in order to resolve
the ambiguity, if possible.
[33] If a candidate for public office was excepted from giving notice
under sub-section (1) of the Libel and Slander Act then the publisher
of the libel could not reasonably have knowledge of any need to
publish a retraction.  This interpretation defeats the intention of
the legislature which was to inform the publisher of any alleged
libellous matter so as to afford the publisher an opportunity to
retract the material in a timely manner.  As stated earlier, there is
clearly a strong public interest component in providing the
opportunity for a retraction during an election campaign.
[34] Sub-section (3) of the Libel and Slander Act clearly contemplates
a retraction. A purposive interpretation of section 5 strongly
suggests that such a retraction contemplates the retraction referred
to in sub-section (2).  The phrase &#147;the retraction&#148; in sub-section (3)
must refer to the retraction in sub-section (2) or one would expect
that the Legislature would have used the phrase &#147;a retraction&#148;
instead.
[35] In Frisina v. Southam Press Ltd. et al. (1980), 30 O.R. (2d) 65
at 68, Robins J. made this observation in relation to section 5:

    It should be borne in mind that notice under s. 5 is
    intended to enable a newspaper to publish a full and fair
    retraction correcting, withdrawing or apologizing for
    statements alleged to be erroneous and to mitigate damages
    if the statements should be held to be defamatory.
    Clearly, it is prejudicial to a defendant to deprive it
    of the benefits of this section and in the absence of
    express language doing so, a construction importing this
    result should not, in my opinion, be given the statute.
</pre>
    <pre>[36] I am in agreement with the statement of Robins J. in Frisina and,
therefore, I interpret sub-section (3) of section 5 to be applicable
only to sub-section (2) and not sub-section (1).  The appellant was
required to give proper notice pursuant to section 5(1) of the Libel
and Slander Act.
[37] For these reasons, it is my view that the motions judge was
correct in striking out certain paragraphs of the statement of claim.
I would dismiss the appeal with costs.
