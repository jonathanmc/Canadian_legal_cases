    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Keenan J. dated September 5, 1997.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>FINLAYSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal by Sylvio Monachino from the judgment of
the Honourable Mr. Justice Keenan dated September 5, 1997
dismissing his claim for care benefits under ss.7 and 6(1)(f) of
the No-Fault Schedule in O. Reg. 672/90 of the Insurance Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8 and dismissing the claim for a declaration
regarding entitlement to care in accordance with a plan for
future care prepared by Jane Staub.  The appellant does not
appeal those parts of the judgment regarding the claims for no-
fault income benefits and a special award.
[2]  The respondent Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company cross-
appeals from that part of the judgment in which Keenan J.
absolved the respondent Axa Home Insurance Company of any
liability to pay no-fault benefits to the appellant arising from
the appellant&#146;s accident.  The appellant does not expressly
appeal from that part of the judgment which held the respondent
Liberty Mutual, and not the respondent Axa Home, liable to pay no-
fault benefits to the appellant, but if the appeal by Liberty
Mutual from this part of the judgment succeeds, then the
appellant seeks an order making the respondent Axa Home liable to
make those payments.
</pre>
    <pre>Facts as they relate to the appeal of the appellant</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant was severely injured in a motor vehicle
accident on November 12, 1991.  At the time, he was a third-year
student at the University of Toronto.  The tort action against
the driver of the vehicle was settled prior to the trial of this
action, but no details of that settlement were disclosed in
evidence other than that the tortfeasor&#146;s policy limits were
paid.
[4]  Following the accident, the appellant was in a coma for four
days and was hospitalised for six weeks.  The undisputed medical
evidence was that he had sustained significant brain damage and
was left with cognitive deficits and would never be able to lead
an independent life.
[5]  There was a large area of haemorrhage in both frontal lobes
of his brain and, subsequently, there was scarring and atrophy of
the lower frontal areas of the brain on both sides.  His period
of post-traumatic amnesia was estimated to be two to three weeks,
itself indicating a severe brain injury.  He presented with all
the classic signs of such an injury, behaviourally, socially and
emotionally.
[6]  The prognosis for persons with bilateral frontal brain
damage is generally very poor over the long term and that
prognosis applies to the appellant.  His condition will likely
deteriorate, rather than improve, over time.
[7]  The trial judge held that there was no question that the
appellant was totally and permanently disabled and was entitled
to benefits under the No-Fault Schedule.  However, there were no
professional caregivers in this case.  The care services that
were provided were reasonable and necessary but they were
provided without fee by members of the appellant&#146;s family,
particularly his mother.
</pre>
    <pre>Issues on appeal
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   Did the trial judge properly
          interpret s.7(1)(a) of the No-Fault Schedule
          by finding that the entitlement to the
          caregiver benefits is conditional on the
          costs of a professional caregiver having been
          incurred?
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   Should the appellant be granted a
          declaration regarding his entitlement to care
          in accordance with a plan for future care
          prepared by Jane Staub?</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Issue 1. The primary position of the appellant was that the
trial judge misinterpreted s.7(1)(a) of the No-Fault Schedule.
The section reads as follows:

          7.(1) The insurer will pay with respect to
          each insured person who sustains physical,
          psychological or mental injury as a result of
          an accident, for the care, if any, required
          by the insured person,

          (a) the reasonable cost of a
          professional caregiver or the amount of gross
          income reasonably lost by a person other than
          the insured person as a result of the
          accident in caring for the insured person;
          and

          (b) all reasonable expenses resulting
          from the accident in caring for the insured
          person after the accident.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding
that entitlement to caregiver benefits under that provision is
conditional on the cost of a professional caregiver having first
been incurred.  He submits that the correct interpretation is
that there is entitlement to caregiver benefits when care has
been provided by any person, whether or not that person is a
professional caregiver, the only condition being that the care
was necessary.  The reasonable cost of a professional caregiver
is the measure of the benefit provided.  The appellant submits
that not only does that interpretation accord with the plain
meaning of the language of s.7(1)(a), but it also promotes the
intent of the no-fault scheme, which is to ensure the prompt
availability of first-party no-fault benefits in exchange for the
limitation on the right to sue in tort.  It avoids both the
penalization of insured persons who do not have the financial
means to take the risk of incurring professional care costs
before making what might well be problematic claims for
reimbursement from the insurer, and the unfair discrimination
that would otherwise result as between income-earning and non-
income-earning family caregivers.
[10] I cannot accept the argument of the appellant.  It appears
to me that the language of the no-fault schedule is clear and
unambiguous.  There are three pre-conditions to entitlement: a
cost must be incurred, it must be reasonable and it must be for a
professional caregiver.  To accept the appellant&#146;s interpretation
would be to rewrite the statute as opposed to applying its clear
language.  The trial judge correctly interpreted this provision
and his conclusion was sound.
[11] The appellant advanced as a supplemental argument that he
could rely upon s.7(1)(b), reproduced above, and s.6(1)(f), the
relevant language of which is as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          6.(1) The insurer will pay with respect
          to each insured person who sustains physical,
          psychological or mental injury as a result of
          an accident all reasonable expenses resulting
          from the accident . . .for,

          (f)  other goods and services , whether
	  medical or non-medical in nature, which the
	  insured person requires because of the
          accident.</pre>
    <pre>[12] The appellant stresses that the key word in both ss. 6(1)(f)
and 7(1)(b) is &#147;expenses&#148; and that this means &#147;cost incurred&#148;.
He submits that the appellant can be said to have incurred the
cost of care giving services as a result of the provision of
those services by his family, particularly his mother.  I do not
agree. Care giving services by members of a loving family are not
an expense or a cost in the contemplation of this statutory
framework.  They can sometimes be compensated for in other areas,
such as under the Family Law Act in a proper case, but they do
not fit within the language of the sections of the no-fault
schedule we are dealing with.
[13] Furthermore, there is a problem of the sufficiency of the
record in this case.  The trial judge found:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Furthermore, the state of the record is
          such that I cannot make any reasonably
          reliable determination of the amount of time
          claimed that could be compensable. &#133;
          Similarly, the record does not permit any
          reliable calculation of the amount of care
          given at home as a percentage of the grossly
          exaggerated total claimed.  I, therefore,
          must decline to attempt any such calculation,
          not simply because of the difficulty
          involved, but because the state of the record
          does not permit it.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Essentially, the position of the appellant is that we should
not give these sections of the No-Fault Schedule close scrutiny
and should interpret them liberally in order to give relief in a
meritorious case.  In other words, we should read-in language to
prevent what the appellant described as discrimination between
parents who are not employed or who do not have incomes which
they sacrifice by remaining at home to provide care and those
parents who get the benefit of the income replacement provisions
of s.7(1)(a).  To this end, the court had the benefit of an
extended discussion about the significance of the requirement of
a professional caregiver to a family that prefers to provide the
care itself or is unable or unwilling to incur the costs of
retaining a professional caregiver when recovery of the expense
is not assured.   These concerns do not appear to have arisen in
this case.  Moreover, the discussion appeared to proceed on the
premise that the parents were facing an either or scenario;
choose professional care givers or look after the child yourself.
The reality is that the Monachinos are entitled to do both.  They
could opt to be the primary caregivers and bring in professional
caregivers to spell them off or provide specialized services
without in any way being supplanted in their roles as parents by
these surrogates.  They could manage their son&#146;s care with the
assistance of the professionals, and still can if they choose to
do so.
[15] In any event, I would be reluctant to second-guess the
framers of this no-fault scheme with respect to this item in
isolation.  We are not aware of the social and economic
considerations that went into the decisions to provide the
various benefits in the program.  It would be a mistake for this
or any other court to engage in what would amount to no more than
tinkering with the regulation where we have no evidence of the
cost significance of what is being put forward by the appellant.
This position is consistent, I think, with what this court said
about no-fault insurance in Meyer v. Bright (1993), 15 O.R. (3d)
129 at p.134:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In our view, the Ontario legislature
          enacted s.266 and other related amendments to
          the Act for the purpose of significantly
          limiting the right of the victim of a motor
          vehicle accident to maintain a tort action
          against the tortfeasor.  The scheme of
          compensation provides for an exchange of
          rights wherein the accident victim loses the
          right to sue unless coming within the
          statutory exemptions, but receives more
          generous first-party benefits, regardless of
          fault, from his or her own insurer. The
          legislation appears designed to control the
          cost of automobile insurance premiums to the
          consumer by eliminating some tort claims.</pre>
    <pre>[16] Issue 2.  Jane Staub, a psychologist who specializes in
future care plans for brain injured persons, prepared a long-term
care program as part of the appellant&#146;s tort action against the
motorist at fault.  The plan, dated December 30, 1994,  was not
put forward initially as part of the claim for no-fault benefits.
The report was directed to replacing the present dependence of
the appellant on his family with a plan whereby the appellant
would be provided with separate living quarters, a case manager
and a life skills coach.  The plan also provided for continuing
psycho-therapy, social skills retraining and day-to-day issues
such as medication, house cleaning, vacations and financial
management.  Ms. Staub testified that the plan was reasonable and
necessary and that it must be implemented in its entirety.  It
has not been implemented to date and there is no indication of
when it will be implemented.
[17] The appellant in his factum asks for a declaration that the
appellant is and shall continue to be entitled to receive both
weekly income benefits and care benefits under the No-Fault
Schedule to the same extent as heretofore provided in the
judgment until such time as the limits set out in the schedule
are exhausted or until a court orders otherwise.  In argument, he
expanded his claim to argue that he was entitled to a declaration
that the appellant was entitled to implement the Staub report.
[18] I agree with the respondents that it would be premature to
impose obligations upon the respondents arising from Ms. Staub's
plan for future care.  Her plan was submitted in conjunction with
the appellant&#146;s tort action against the at-fault motorist and it
has yet to win judicial recognition as a concrete and practical
scheme for assisting the appellant.  To the contrary, the trial
judge wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The evidence that Sylvio or the
          Monachino family intend to implement the
          Staub plan is not convincing.  There is real
          doubt that Sylvio wants or would accept a
          case manager and life skills coach or someone
          accompanying him on his social outings. There
          is no evidence that his parents want to have
          the Staub plan implemented in its entirety,
          including separate accommodation.</pre>
    <pre>[19] Lord Dunedin&#146;s judgment in Russian Commercial and Industrial
Bank v. British Bank for Foreign Trade Ltd., [1921] 2 A.C. 438
(H.L.), furnishes a classic statement of the criteria a court
should consult when deciding to grant declaratory relief.  He
affirmed at page 448:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The question must be a real and not a
          theoretical question; the person raising it
          must have a real interest to raise it; he
          must be able to secure a proper contradictor,
          that is to say, someone presently existing
          who has a true interest to oppose the
          declaration sought.</pre>
    <pre>[20] In  Solosky v. The Queen, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 821, Dickson J.,
writing for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada,
developed the statement of the criteria for declaratory relief
that Lord Dunedin advanced in Russian Commercial and Industrial
Bank.  Dickson J. proposed two criteria at pages 832-3:  the case
before the court must be genuine, not moot or hypothetical; and
the declaration must be capable of having some practical effect
in resolving the issues the case raises.
[21] There have been circumstances where Ontario courts have
granted declaratory judgments entitling an insured to recover
under an insurance policy.  In MacDonald v Travelers Indemnity
Co. of Canada (1987), 60 O.R. (2d) 385 (H.C.J.), Osler J. stated
at page 436:

          There will be a declaration that products,
	  services and accommodations of the kind
	  described and approved in this judgment are
	  reasonably necessary for the care, recovery
	  and rehabilitation of Lynne MacDonald and
	  that expenses on the scale approved herein
	  constitute reasonable charges.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Similarly, in Placken v. Canadian Surety Co. (1990), 47
C.C.L.I. 268 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), Kurisko D.C.J. stated at page 273:
          </pre>
    <pre>          A declaratory judgment will therefore
          issue ordering the defendant to pay all
          expenses for repairs and replacement of the
          plaintiff's prosthesis after June 23, 1987,
          subject to the limit of $25,000 in s. B.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The instant case is distinguishable from MacDonald and
Placken and is outside the criteria for declaratory relief that
Dickson J. proposed in Solosky.  In both MacDonald and Placken,
the declaratory judgment addressed the object of a genuine
dispute.  In contrast, the evidence before the trial judge in the
case in appeal led him to doubt whether the appellant or the
appellant&#146;s family are genuinely committed to implementing the
Staub plan.  Any attempt to make the Staub plan a basis for the
appellant&#146;s future treatment must accordingly qualify as
hypothetical.  Moreover, in both MacDonald and Placken, the
declaratory judgment did resolve practical issues disputed by the
parties.  In the instant case, by contrast, it is unlikely that
this court can resolve effectively and realistically the dispute
by granting a declaration about the appellant&#146;s entitlement to
care under a plan to which he and his family have been found to
lack strong commitment.
[24] Accordingly, it is inappropriate to make a declaration with
respect to the Staub report.  Further, I would not make any
declaration with respect to entitlement to future no-fault
benefits where as here there is no evidence that the benefits
that the trial court and this court have found to be appropriate
have not in fact been paid without the intervention of the court.
Despite the issue between the two respondent insurers as to which
was liable for the payments, they co-operated with each other and
the appellant to ensure that all no-fault benefits were paid,
saving only the ones in issue in this appeal which the trial
judge disallowed.  These respondents have not refused to accept
Ms. Staub&#146;s plan for future care as re-presented in the no-fault
venue, they have simply stated that they will respond to whatever
future care plan is agreed to by the family.  Their reluctance to
buy a &#147;pig in a poke&#148; is quite understandable.  By dismissing the
action as framed by the appellant, the trial judgment does not
foreclose future entitlement to reasonable costs of this
appellant.  As explicitly stated by the trial judge, the injured
party has the right to present specific proposals for intended
treatment and services for consideration and approval by the
insurer and those claims will be paid as the costs are incurred
and the services are provided.
[25] However, it is conceded that the formal judgment of the
court does raise a potential problem.  It states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          5.     THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES
          that the plaintiff&#146;s claim for a declaration
          that he is totally and permanently disabled
          and is entitled to receive weekly income and
          supplementary medical, rehabilitation and
          care benefits for the balance and duration of
          his disability is dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[26] This is not accurate in that it suggests that the trial
judge&#146;s finding was that the appellant was not permanently
disabled and will not be entitled to no-fault benefits.  In
addition, paragraphs 3 and 6 dismiss portions of the plaintiff&#146;s
claim for no-fault benefits including a &#147;special award&#148;.  I think
it would be simpler if paragraphs 4, 5 and 6 were deleted and
replaced with a single paragraph reading;
          </pre>
    <pre>          4.  THIS COURT ORDERS AND ADJUDGES that
          the balance of the plaintiff&#146;s claim is
          dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Other than this adjustment, I would dismiss the appellant&#146;s
appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>Facts as they relate to cross-appeal</pre>
    <pre>[28] Section 268(1) of the Insurance Act mandates that every
motor vehicle liability policy shall be deemed to provide for
certain statutory accident benefits as set out in the then No-
Fault Benefits Schedule (now called Statutory Accident Benefits
Schedule &#150; Accidents before January 1, 1994).  Section 268(2) of
the Insurance Act combined with s.268(4) and (5) establish
certain priority rules for the payment of accident benefits.  It
is common ground that the application of these priority rules to
the instant case is such that the cross-appellant Liberty Mutual
as insurer of the at fault motor vehicle is responsible to pay
accident benefits to Sylvio Monachino unless the cross-appellant
Liberty Mutual can establish priority to pay on the part of the
respondent Axa Home.  The cross-appellant Liberty Mutual rested
its case in this regard upon the evidence relating to the efforts
of Salvatore Monachino to arrange insurance on the vehicle in
question through William Dusome.
[29] On June 18, 1991 (five months prior to the accident),
Salvatore Monachino, the father of the appellant, attended upon
his insurance agent of several years, William Dusome, because the
automobile insurance upon his three motor vehicles with
Commercial Union was about to expire.  Dusome was an independent
insurance broker having agency relationships with several
different insurers.  He could have placed Salvatore Monachino&#146;s
business with any of those several insurers.
[30] Dusome had Salvatore Monachino fill out two separate generic
application forms for insurance.  One application was in respect
of Salvatore Monachino&#146;s BMW and the other application was in
respect of both his Volkswagen and the Pontiac Firebird motor
vehicle involved in the accident.  These applications were
prepared in such a way that indicated they would be addressed to
Axa Home Insurance Company.  Dusome, on June 18, 1991, issued
generic temporary 30-day binder pink liability certificates in
respect of all three vehicles.  Several weeks thereafter, Dusome
caused pink liability certificates for the prospective policy
period of June 18 to December 18, 1991 to be prepared in respect
of all three vehicles and sent by mail to Salvatore Monachino.
Salvatore Monachino issued a cheque payable to William P. Dusome
Insurance Broker for the insurance.
[31] It was common ground at trial that Dusome was dishonest and
committed a fraud upon Salvatore Monachino and others.  He had no
authority to bind cover in respect of the Pontiac Firebird to be
operated by Sylvio Monachino because of its special category for
insurance purposes.  He never submitted any of the applications
for insurance to Axa Insurance Company at any time prior to the
accident.  The pink liability certificates that were issued in
the name of Axa Home Insurance Company contained fraudulent
policy numbers and were issued without authority.  Dusome
apparently pocketed the insurance premium monies and hoped that
no insurance claim would be advanced.  No policy was ever issued
on the 1988 Pontiac Firebird by Axa Home Insurance Company or any
other insurer covering the relevant timeframe from June 18 to
December 18, 1991.
</pre>
    <pre>Issue on cross-appeal
          </pre>
    <pre>          The sole issue on cross-appeal is
          whether or not these actions on the part of
          Dusome are sufficient to fix the respondent
          Axa Home with the responsibility to pay any
          accident benefits to which the appellant is
          entitled.
</pre>
    <pre>Analysis of cross-appeal</pre>
    <pre>[32] The issue as a matter of law falls to be decided on basic
principles of agency.  Was Dusome the agent of the respondent Axa
Home such that Axa Home would be bound his actions?  The trial
judge found that Dusome was not the agent of the respondent Axa
Home and this finding is consistent with the evidence and the
case law.  Accepting, as I think we must, that Dusome was not the
actual agent of the respondent Axa Home, the question still
remains as to whether the respondent Axa Home held Dusome out as
its agent with respect to the transaction that is material to
this action.  To put it another way, was there some  action on
the part of the respondent Axa Home which would justify Salvatore
Monachino in believing that Dusome had authority from the
respondent Axa Home to issue the coverage that he purported to
issue?
[33] Various authors use different terminology in describing what
authority other than actual authority can bind a principal to the
conduct of its agent.  It is referred to as apparent authority or
ostensible authority.  F.M.B. Reynolds, in Bowstead on Agency,
16th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell, 1996) makes the following
distinction at p.103:
          </pre>
    <pre>               The authority of an agent may be
               (a)  actual (express or implied) where
               it results from a manifestation of consent
               that he should represent or act for the
               principal expressly or impliedly made by the
               principal to the agent himself; or
               (b)  apparent, where it results from
               such a manifestation made by the
               principal to third parties.</pre>
    <pre>[34] The author defines actual authority at pp. 103-104:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Actual authority is the authority which
          the principal has given the agent wholly or
          in part by means of words or writing (called
          here express authority) or is regarded by the
          law as having given him because of the
          interpretation put by the law on the
          relationship and dealings of the two parties
          (called here implied authority).  &#147;An
          &#145;actual&#146; authority is a legal relationship
          between principal and agent created by  a
          consensual agreement to which they alone are
          parties.  Its scope is to be ascertained by
          applying ordinary principles of construction
          of contracts, including any proper
          implications from the express words used, the
          usages of the trade, or the course of
          business between the parties&#133;&#148; [Freeman &amp;

          L.J.]</pre>
    <pre>[35] The author defines the nature of apparent authority at
p.366:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Where a person, by words or conduct,
          represents or permits it to be represented
          that another person has authority to act on
          his behalf, he is bound by the acts of that
          other person with respect to anyone dealing
          with him as an agent on the faith of any such
          representation, to the same extent as if such
          other person had the authority that he was
          represented to have, even though he had no
          such actual authority.</pre>
    <pre>[36] Apparent or ostensible authority has also been defined by
Diplock L.J. in the leading case of Freeman &amp; Lockyer v.
Buckhurst Park Properties, at p.503:
          </pre>
    <pre>          An &#145;apparent&#146; or &#145;ostensible&#146; authority,
          on the other hand, is a legal relationship
          between the principal and the contractor
          created by a representation, made by the
          principal to the contractor, intended to be
          and in fact acted on by the contractor, that
          the agent has authority to enter on behalf of
          the principal into a contract of a kind
          within the scope of the &#147;apparent&#148; authority,
          so as to render the principal liable to
          perform any obligations imposed on him by
          such contract.</pre>
    <pre>[37] The latest authority on this subject is the decision of the
British Columbia Court of Appeal in Keddie v. Canada Life
Assurance Co. [1999] B.C.J. No. 2165 (Q.L.) wherein the court
upheld the trial judge who found, on facts more helpful to the
victim than in this case, that there was no conduct or
representation on the part of Canada Life to suggest to the
outside world that the fraudulent agent was its agent.  The
following statement of Rowles J.A., at para.37 of Keddie is
particularly relevant:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The appellant appears to have been taken
          in by [the agent] personally rather than to
          have acted on the strength of, or in reliance
          on, his association with Canada Life or any
          other organization.</pre>
    <pre>[38] The authority of Dusome was limited by his agency&#146;s contract
with the respondent Axa Home to writing up applications for
coverage and submitting them to the respondent Axa Home for
approval.  Any suggestion that Dusome had authority to issue a
policy or binder, even on a temporary basis, on the motor vehicle
involved in this accident, emanated from Dusome or was implicit
in his actions in writing the name Axa Home Insurance Company on
the blank forms used for both the applications and the temporary
and final binders.  There is no record of any representation of
any kind having been made by the respondent Axa Home to anyone,
much less to the father of the appellant, that there was any
relationship between Dusome and the respondent Axa Home, even the
limited one that did exist.  Dusome might just as well have
written in the name of Lloyd&#146;s London, England as insurer for all
the legal effect his actions had in binding whomever he
represented as his principal.</pre>
    <pre>[39] Accordingly, there is no basis for the cross-appeal.  I
would dismiss it.
</pre>
    <pre>Costs</pre>
    <pre>[40] This court heard two largely unrelated appeals.  The one was
by the appellant against Liberty Mutual, assuming, as transpired,
that Liberty Mutual did not succeed in its cross-appeal against
Axa Home.  Therefore the appellant should pay one set of costs of
his appeal to Liberty Mutual.  The other appeal was the cross-
appeal of Liberty Mutual against Axa Home with the appellant
taking no position.  Liberty Mutual should therefore pay the
costs of the cross-appeal to Axa Home.  It will be up to the
Assessment Officer to determine the respective amounts on
assessment.

WEILER J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[41] The primary issue on this appeal is whether the no-fault
benefits, payable under a standard automobile insurance policy in
force in 1991, include payment for the care provided to the
injured appellant, Sylvio Monachino (&#147;Sylvio&#148;), by his homemaker
mother and self-employed father.  If so, the appellant seeks an
order that one of the respondent insurance companies pay no-fault
care benefits up to the date of trial to the maximum amount
allowable under the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule (&#147;the
Schedule&#148;) plus prejudgment interest.  Secondly, the appellant
seeks a declaration that he is entitled to continue to receive
care benefits until such time as the limits in the Schedule are
exhausted.
[42] Section 7(1) of the  Schedule relating to accidents after
1990 and before January 1, 1994 (&#147;the 1990 Schedule&#148;) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The insurer will pay with respect to each
          insured person who sustains physical,
          psychological or mental injury as a result of
          an accident, for the care, if any, required
          by the insured person,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)   the reasonable cost of a professional
		care-giver or the amount of gross income
		reasonably lost by a person other than the
                insured person as a result of the accident
		in caring for the insured person; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  all reasonable expenses resulting for the 
		accident in caring for the insured person 
		after the accident.</pre>
    <pre>[43] Under s.7(1), the insurer is obligated to pay for the care
required by an insured person provided that the requirements of
either subsection (a) or (b) are met.  The maximum amount payable
per month in each case is $3,000 to a total of $500,000.1
[44] The respondents concede that Sylvio suffered severe head
injuries and cognitive impairment, that he is incapable of
independent living, and that he is entitled to payment of
benefits in accordance with the Schedule provided that the
requirements of s.7 are met.  With respect to the first issue,
Keenan J., whose reasons are reported at (1997), 49 C.C.L.I. (2d)
105, dismissed the appellant&#146;s claim for payment of care benefits
on the basis that the care provided by his parents did not fall
within the meaning of s.7.  The trial judge held that, even if
family members were entitled to claim for the value of services
under s.7, he would not have made any award because notice of the
claim was not provided until after the two-year limitation period
for making a claim had expired.  With respect to the second
issue,  the trial judge held that, although there was no issue
that Sylvio is totally and permanently disabled,  it would be
&#147;contrary to the principles found in the no-fault insurance
scheme&#148; to grant declaratory relief.  The trial judge&#146;s
conclusion is primarily based on his finding that there is little
evidence that a proposed plan of care, developed by the expert
Ms. Jane Staub, would be implemented.  Consequently, the trial
judge was not satisfied that the proposed costs of care envisaged
under the plan would be implemented.  As a result, he dismissed
the claim for a declaration.
[45] I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Finlayson
J.A.  Like the trial judge, he has concluded that s.7(1) does not
provide for payment for the care provided by Sylvio&#146;s parents.
Finlayson J.A. is also of the opinion that it would be premature
to grant the declaration sought.  As a result, he would dismiss
the appeal.
[46] For the reasons that follow, I  respectfully disagree with
the conclusion that the appeal should be dismissed.  Instead, I
would hold,  based on a purposive and contextual approach to s.7,
that  the appellant is entitled to claim under s.7 for the care
he has been receiving from his parents.  I would also make a
declaration in favour of  the appellant with respect to future
care benefits.</pre>
    <pre>The interpretation of s.7</pre>
    <pre>Section 7(1)(a)

[47] Section 7(1)(a) provides for payment of the &#147;cost&#148; to the
appellant of care benefits when that care is provided by a
&#147;professional caregiver&#148;.  In addition, if a parent who works
outside the home gives up employment to care for the insured
person, the parent is entitled to reimbursement for the loss of
gross income.  The appellant&#146;s parents, Mr. and Mrs. Monachino,
do not hold any certificates evidencing completion of health care
training.  Mr. Monachino operates his own small business and,
while he takes time from his work to supervise Sylvio and to take
him to doctors&#146; appointments, he has not given up employment per
se or lost  gross income.  Mrs. Monachino was, and continues to
be, a homemaker.
[48] The term &#147;professional caregiver&#148; is not defined in the
Schedule.  The evidence of Ms. Staub, the expert who testified
with respect to a proposed plan of care for Sylvio, was that
Sylvio&#146;s parents have become trained caregivers.  Ms. Staub
stated that Sylvio &#147;requires support and encouragement even with
small changes&#148;.  Consequently, it is important that he receive
care from &#147;somebody with a degree of training and understanding&#148;.
She stated: &#147;It&#146;s not just ordinary support and encouragement,
it&#146;s knowing the kind of support and when to give the
encouragement&#148;.  Ms. Staub also stated that an important aspect
of caring for Sylvio is training and encouraging him to apply
what he has learned in one situation to a different one.  She
expressed the opinion that &#147;&#133; given the supports from trained
people such as his parents really have become, then learning to
adapt to change can come about even though it is slow, over a
long period of time&#148;.  (Emphasis  added.)
[49] Similarly, Dr. Cancelliere, a neuropsychologist who had
treated the appellant for two years prior to trial, testified:
          </pre>
    <pre>          They [the plaintiff&#146;s parents] were also
          involved, I know, in terms of structuring his
          time, giving him tasks and activities to
          engage in.  They were also very, very
          concerned about, you know, they kept coming
          to me with questions like, &#145;How should we
          handle an angry outburst?&#146; &#145;What should we do
          with this particular problem or that
          particular problem?&#146;  So, to some degree,
          they had become an extension of the work that
          I was trying to do with him, the strategies
          that I was trying to instill in him.
          </pre>
    <pre>[50] The appellant submits that the words &#147; the reasonable cost
of a professional caregiver&#148; in s.7(1)(a) should be interpreted
as referring to the amount of money that would have to be paid to
retain the services of a professional caregiver.  I would agree.
Just as the law has recognized that an expert need not hold a
professional degree but may become an expert based on experience
and practical training, so, too, it seems to me, a family member
may become a professional caregiver based on experience and
practical training.  The evidence I have referred to supports the
conclusion that, on the particular facts of this case, Sylvio&#146;s
parents have become professional caregivers.  I would, therefore,
hold that, under s.7(1)(a), Sylvio is entitled to payment for the
equivalent cost of their services as a care benefit.</pre>
    <pre>Section 7 (1)(b)

[51] I now turn to the interpretation of s.7(1)(b) which provides
for payment of &#147;all reasonable expenses resulting from the
accident in caring for the insured person after the accident&#148;.
[52] The trial judge considered the Concise Oxford Dictionary
definition of the word &#147;expense&#148; and held, at 122, that &#147;the
plain and ordinary meaning of the word &#145;expense&#146; has to do with
the expenditure of money or financial costs&#148;.  He noted that
Black&#146;s Law Dictionary defines the word &#147;expense&#148; as including
the expenditure of &#147;time, labour, resources and thought&#148; and
rejected this definition.
[53] Before deciding which interpretation of the word &#147;expense&#148;
was appropriate, the trial judge was required to adopt a
contextual approach and to ascertain the purpose of the
provisions as a whole.  In  R. v. Monney, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 652 at
669, Iacobucci J., on behalf of the Court, stated:

          While reference to common parlance and
          standard dictionary definitions are often of
          assistance in interpreting legislative
          provisions, regard must be had not only to
          the ordinary and natural meaning of the
          words, but also to the context in which they
          are used and the purpose of the provisions as
          a whole: R. v. Lewis, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 921.
          The most significant element of this analysis
          is the determination of legislative intent.
          </pre>
    <pre>And, at 670:
          </pre>
    <pre>          As this court reiterated in Lewis, a
          legislative phrase should be given a meaning
          consonant with the purpose of the statutory
          provision unless the contrary is indicated,
          provided of course, that such an
          interpretation is consistent with
          constitutional limitations and conventional
          rules of interpretation.
          </pre>
    <pre>[54] The interpretation to be given to an insurance statute is no
different.  In Bapoo v. Co-operators General Insurance Company
(1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 616, Laskin J.A., on behalf of the majority,
stated at 620-1:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The modern approach to statutory
          interpretation calls on courts to interpret a
          legislative provision in its total context.
          The court&#146;s interpretation should comply with
          the legislative text, promote the legislative
          purpose and produce a reasonable and just
          meaning.  Professor Sullivan described the
          modern approach in the following passage in
          Dreidger on the Construction of Statutes,
          3rd.ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994) at p.
          131&#133;:
          </pre>
    <pre>               There is only one rule in modern
               interpretation, namely, courts are
               obliged to determine the meaning of
               legislation in its total context,
               having regard to the purpose of the
               legislation, the consequences of
               the proposed interpretations, the
               presumptions and special rules of
               interpretation, as well as
               admissible external aids.  In other
               words, the courts must consider and
               take into account all relevant and
               admissible indicators of
               legislative meaning.  After taking
               these into account, the court must
               then adopt an interpretation that
               is appropriate.  An appropriate
               interpretation is one that can be
               justified in terms of (a) its
               plausibility, that is, its
               compliance with legislative text;
               (b) its efficacy, that is, its
               promotion of the legislative
               purpose; and (c) its acceptability,
               that is, the outcome is reasonable
               and just.
          </pre>
    <pre>[55] In order to ascertain the purpose of the legislation during
the period with which we are concerned, namely 1990-1994, it is
of assistance to consider how the legislation in force both
before and after this period has been interpreted.  If the
legislation in force both before and after the period in question
enables family members to be compensated for their services to
the insured person, then the question is whether any change or
hiatus was intended between 1990 and 1994.  Legislative evolution
is a tool that may be used as an aid in construing a statute,
albeit with caution: Dreidger on the Construction of Statutes,
3rd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994) at 457-58.</pre>
    <pre>The pre-1990 accident benefits schedule

[56] In Migliore v. Co-operators Insurance Assn. (1987), 7 M.V.R.
(2d) 259 (Ont. H.C.), the parents of a severely-injured child
made a claim for payment under a standard automobile insurance
policy in force in 1981.  At that time, the applicable Schedule
(&#147;the pre-1990 Schedule) provided for payment of:
          </pre>
    <pre>          All reasonable expenses&#133;as a result of such
          injury for necessary medical,&#133;professional
          nursing and ambulance service and for any
          other service within the meaning of insured
          services under the Health Insurance Act and
          for such other services and supplies which
          are in the opinion of the physician of the
          insured person&#146;s choice and that of the
          insured&#146;s medical advisor essential for the
          treatment occupational retraining or
          rehabilitation of said person.2
          </pre>
    <pre>[57] O&#146;Brien J. held that the Pre-1990 Schedule should be given a
large and liberal interpretation as the legislation was remedial.
He interpreted the words &#147;such other services&#148;, which modifies
the word &#147;expenses&#148;, as including compensation to family members.
[58] The trial judge in the current appeal distinguished the
Migliore decision, at 121 of his reasons, on the basis that there
was evidence that the services provided by the parents were
essential for the rehabilitation of the  child, and on the basis
that the defence had made such a concession.  Here, the
respondents have conceded that Sylvio is permanently disabled and
requires care.  The only persons providing that care on a regular
basis are his mother and his father.  The respondents have
conceded that if Sylvio&#146;s parents were not providing the care he
is presently receiving from his parents, he would have to
purchase that care because he is incapable of caring for himself.
The defence has, therefore, conceded that the services provided
by Sylvio&#146;s parents are necessary for his care.  Migliore, supra,
cannot be distinguished on the basis set forth by the trial
judge.
[59] The trial judge also noted that in Migliore the insurer&#146;s
submission that the claim should properly have been made under
the Family Law Reform Act was not dealt with.  The case law
suggests, however, that it is inappropriate for a trial judge to
consider the issue of double recovery unless the insurer, who has
the onus of establishing that a payment would amount to double
recovery, has adduced the requisite facts in support of the
submission.  A bald allegation of double recovery will not
suffice: See Stante v. Boudreau (1980), 29 O.R. 1 (C.A.) at 4.
[60] Based on the Migliore decision, the accident benefits
schedule that existed prior to 1990 was interpreted in a manner
that permitted an injured person to receive payment for the
caregiving services provided by his parents.</pre>
    <pre>The post-1994 accident benefits schedule</pre>
    <pre>[61] The Schedule in force on or after January 1, 1994 (&#147;the Post-
1994 Schedule) provides for supplementary medical benefits to be
paid by the insurer for &#147;all reasonable expenses incurred by or
on behalf of the insured person as a result of the accident
for&#133;other&#133; services that the insured person requires.&#148;  This
phrase is found in s.40(5), which deals with rehabilitation
payments.  Similarly, in relation to care benefits, the insured
is entitled in s.47(1)(a) to &#147;all reasonable expenses incurred by
or on behalf of the insured person as a result of the accident
for&#133; services provided by an aide or attendant.&#148; [Emphasis
added.]
[62] Section 47(2) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)For the purposes of clause (1)(a), an aide
          or attendant may be any person who is capable
          of providing the services, including a family
          member or the insured person, even if the
          aide or attendant does not possess any
          special qualifications. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[63] The wording in s.47(2) indicates that, after the period in
issue in this appeal, the word &#147;expense&#148; is interpreted by the
legislature as including the expenditure of time and labour by a
family member in caring for the injured insured, and not just the
expenditure of money.
[64] When the legislation was considered in the Standing
Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs of the Ontario
Legislature on January 26, 1993, the principal features of the
Bill were described for the committee members by the deputy
minister.  In relation to the care benefits he stated, at F-428:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Long-term care, or attendant care as it is
          referred to in the draft regulation, will no
          longer be subject to a $500,000 life-time
          cap, and the maximum monthly benefit of
          $3,000 will now be indexed&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Entitlement to attendant care benefits has
          been clarified by describing attendant care
          as the services provided to assist the
          insured person in performing the activities
          of daily living&#133; [Emphasis  added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[65] The legislation with respect to benefits after 1994,
therefore, makes it clear that an insured person is entitled to
be compensated for the care provided by his parents even if the
parent does not possess any special qualifications.  Furthermore,
based on the prepared presentation of the deputy minister at the
time, the intention of the legislature was not to extend a new
benefit.  Rather, the purpose of the stated change in wording was
to clarify an existing benefit.
[66] Thus, both before and after the period 1990-1994, an injured
person is entitled to be paid for the care provided by his or her
parents.</pre>
    <pre>The accident benefits schedule in force in 1991</pre>
    <pre>[67] Was any change intended during the period in question here?
One of the major research reports prepared in anticipation of the
creation of the 1990 Schedule with which we are concerned was the
Report of Inquiry into Motor Vehicle Accident Compensation in
Ontario (1988) (the Osborne Report).3  At p. 573, the report
addresses the issue of compensation to family members for long-
term care to an injured insured as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;The family of the injured person should not
          be excluded from long-term care compensation
          entitlement.  Reasonable family participation
          in long-term care should not be discouraged,
          but rather encouraged.  The long-term care
          benefits should be paid to the injured person
          so as to permit the injured person as much
          freedom of movement as can be built into the
          system.

    <pre>[68] The authors of the text Financial Services Commission of
Ontario (Motor Vehicle Insurance), Law and Practice, Vol. 2,
James M. Flaherty and Catherine Zingg, Canada Law Book Inc. Sept.
1999, comment as follows, at 3:0202, concerning the care benefits
provisions in s.7 of the 1990 Schedule:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The care must be &#147;required&#148; by the insured
          person (s. 7(1)) which imposes a standard of
          need, and the costs must be &#147;reasonable&#148; (s.
          7 (1)(a) and (b))&#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The other care benefits coverage is broadly
          defined as &#147;all reasonable expenses resulting
          from the accident in caring for the insured
          person after the accident&#148; (s. 7(1)(b)).
          This may be read with the supplementary
          medical and rehabilitation benefits provided
          in s. 6(1)(f), &#147;Other Goods and Services
          Whether Medical or Non-Medical in Nature&#148;,
          and s. 6(2) relating to expenses incurred by
          family members visiting the insured person
          during his or her treatment and recovery.
          The care benefits coverage in s. 7 (1)(b) is
          not confined to family members and presumably
          would cover the transportation and other
          visiting expenses incurred by non-family
          members &#147;in caring for the insured person
          after the accident.&#148;
          </pre>
    <pre>[69] The quotation illustrates the authors&#146; view that care
benefits under s.7(1)(b) are payable to an injured person for
care received from family members.  Their conclusion appears to
be based on a number of awards and decisions that are mentioned
at pp. 3/40-3/42.  The first is MacAulay (CC/07000), in which the
applicant was awarded payment for cooking and cleaning performed
by her husband.  Also mentioned is Ferreyra  (CC/00430), where
the insured persons were entitled to be reimbursed for certain
services performed by their nineteen year-old son.  The services
included housekeeping, meal preparation, laundry and shopping
activities.  An allowance was also made to the son for assisting
his parents to attend medical appointments and for acting as an
interpreter.  In Bush (CC/01790), the applicant&#146;s spouse provided
home care services and the Ontario Insurance Commission awarded
her compensation for her services.  In  McNutt, the applicant
requested and was awarded compensation for her spouse driving her
to and from medical attendances.  In these cases, reimbursement
was calculated at the minimum wage rate for adults during the
relevant time period.  Reimbursement was not contingent on
demonstrating lost wages of the caregiver.
[70] The trial judge referred to the decision by the Commission
in Bush and simply stated that he did not agree with it.  He
preferred the reasoning in another decision by the Commission,
Whitney v. Co-operators General Insurance Co. (March 31, 1993),
Doc. A-001005, which held that &#147;Care provided by relatives or
friends, for which no loss is incurred or payments made is not
compensable under section 7&#148;.  The weight of authority appears,
however, to support the interpretation that family members are
entitled to be compensated under s.7(1)(b).  These decisions
accord with the Osborne Report&#146;s comments.</pre>
    <pre>Other similar provisions</pre>
    <pre>[71] The trial judge compared the wording respecting
rehabilitation benefits contained in s.6(2) of the Schedule with
wording respecting care benefits in s.7 of the 1990 Schedule and
noted that they were similar.  Section 6(2) provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The insurer will pay with respect to each
          insured person who sustains physical,
          psychological or mental injury as a result of
          an accident an allowance that is reasonable
          having regard to all of the circumstances for
          expenses actually incurred by a spouse,
          child, grandchild, parent, grandparent,
          brother or sister of the insured person in
          visiting the insured person during his or her
          treatment or recovery. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[72] The trial judge stated that it was clear that both s.6 (2)
and  s.7 were &#147;intended to indemnify a person who has suffered a
loss of income or has incurred an out-of-pocket expense&#148;.4  The
trial judge cited no authority for the interpretation he gave to
the word &#147;incurred&#148; in s.6(2).
[73] Comparing the language of ss.6(2) and 7(b) is helpful in
determining the scope of s.7(b).  Section 6(2), which has nothing
directly to do with this case, applies to a restricted group of
family members who &#147;actually incur&#148; expenses when visiting the
insured injured person during his treatment or recovery.  By
contrast, the language in s.7(b) is more general.  It does not
refer to expenses actually incurred  but to expenses &#147;resulting
from the accident in caring&#148; for the injured insured.  In my
opinion, had the legislature intended that the schedule require
that expenses in s.7(b) be &#147;actually incurred&#148;, the language in
s.7(b) would have clearly said so in the same terms as the
language used in s.6(2).  The words &#147;resulting from the accident&#148;
are words that are broader in scope and the emphasis is on
caring.  The trial judge did not take account of the broader
language of s.7(b).
[74] Even if s.7(b) were to be read as if the words &#147;expenses
incurred&#148; were present, payment to family members would not
necessarily be excluded.  To refer to a U.S. example that is very
much on-point, in Van Marter v. American Fidelity Fire Insurance
(1982), 318 N.W. (2d) 679 (Mich. App.), the Court of Appeals of
Michigan dealt with the interpretation of insurance benefits
under similar legislation that provided payment for:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Allowable expenses consisting of all
          reasonable charges incurred for reasonably
          necessary products, services and
          accommodations for an injured person&#146;s care
          recovery or rehabilitation. [Emphasis
          added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[75] The court held that the phrase should be interpreted so as
to provide for payment to the appellant&#146;s step-mother for the
care of her injured adult step-son.  She served him meals in bed,
bathed him, escorted him to the doctor&#146;s office, exercised him in
conformity with the doctor&#146;s instructions, assisted in
formulating his diet, administered medication, and assisted him
with speech and associational problems and exercises.  The court
concluded that the legislature could not have intended the
insurance company to receive a windfall by reason of the fact
that the claimant&#146;s step-mother performed these services.  Noting
that the insurer would be liable for the services if they were
performed by non-relatives, the court concluded at 683:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If we were to accept defendants&#146; reading of &#133;
          [the legislation], we would penalize both the
          injured insured and his family for providing
          care which would otherwise be performed by a
          less personalized health care industry.</pre>
    <pre>I would make the same observation in the case at hand.</pre>
    <pre>[76] The decision in Van Marter, supra, is not unique.5  The
terms of the Uniform Motor Vehicle Accident Reparations Act
(UMVARA) provide for reimbursement for an &#147;allowable expense&#148;.
The commentary on the Act in American Jurisprudence, 2d ed., Vol.
7A (1997) at title 513, at p. 333, states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Payments may be made to a family member as
          well as to a treatment center.</pre>
    <pre>[77] Similarly, Couch on Insurance, 3d, at title 171:63, at p.
171-86, comments:
          Stated otherwise, nothing in a no-fault
          statute suggests that a product or service
          must be provided by a licensed health-care
          provider in order to constitute an allowable
          expense: rather the focus of the statute is
          on whether a product or service is reasonably
          necessary for the injured person&#146;s care,
          recovery, or rehabilitation.
          </pre>
    <pre>[78] Where, as here, there is a paucity of Canadian authority to
deal with a question involving insurance law, American
authorities are entitled to the highest consideration based on
their discussion of the issues involved:  Seitz, Committee of the
Estate of Peter Kirkness v. Imperial Life Assurance Co. of Canada
(1993), 12 O.R. (3d) 285 at 289 (C.A.).
[79] The Van Marter decision was applied in MacDonald et al. v.
Travelers Indemnity Co. of Canada (1987), 60 O. R. (2d) 385 (Ont.
H.C.), a case in which an Ontario resident was severely injured
in an automobile accident in Michigan.  The facts in MacDonald
gave rise to initial litigation concerning whether the law of
Michigan or the law of Ontario should apply.  This court held, in
Travelers Canada v. MacDonald et al. (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 714
(C.A.), that Travelers, by the terms of its contract, had agreed
to be governed by Michigan law in the determination of its
liability for no-fault benefits and that no-fault benefits were
payable.
[80] Following this decision, Osler J. was required to determine
whether home care, as opposed to institutional care, was
&#147;reasonably necessary&#148; for the injured insured, the products,
services and accommodations reasonably necessary for the
insured&#146;s care, what charges were reasonable, and, finally, the
meaning to be given to the word &#147;incurred&#148; in s.3107 of the
Michigan Insurance Code.
[81] On the authority of Van Marter, supra, counsel for the
insurer agreed that the law of Michigan acknowledged that the
services of a relative could properly be compensated provided
that the services came within the provisions of s.3107 of the
Michigan statute.
[82] The insurer resisted the claims, however, on the basis that
it had not been established that they had been &#147;incurred&#148; at the
time the claims were made.  Before us, the respondent insurers
make the same argument, particularly in relation to the question
of whether there should be a declaration that Sylvio is entitled
to care benefits, an issue with which I will deal later.
[83] Osler J. noted that one of the definitions of the word
&#147;incur&#148; in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary was &#147;to render oneself
liable to&#148;.  He concluded, at 434 of his reasons, that, in the
context of the legislation, the word did not require a legal
obligation to make payment to another before expenses could be
said to have been incurred.  He held that, if a reasonable
necessity for the item claimed was established and the cost of
obtaining the service or product was shown, the expense could be
said to have been incurred and the insurer was obliged to make
payment.
[84] In the case at hand, even if s.7(b) is read as having the
word &#147;incurred&#148; in it, I agree with Osler J. that it is
sufficient to show what the equivalent cost of providing the
service is in order to trigger the obligation of the insurer to
pay.  As stated by Osler J. at 434 in relation to the injured
insured girl:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Suppose, for example, Lynne MacDonald had not
          had the support of her family and had been
          destitute.  She could never have made
          payments with respect to her care or
          rehabilitation and thus made herself entitled
          to be reimbursed.  It seems to me that if a
          reasonable necessity for the item claimed is
          established and the cost of obtaining the
          service or product is shown, the expense may
          be said to have been incurred and the
          obligation to pay within 30 days must then be
          assumed by the defendant.</pre>
    <pre>[85] The further submission of the respondents is that no expense
is &#147;incurred&#148; because there is no likelihood that Sylvio will
receive a bill from his parents.  This is a reversion to the
submission that a family member is not entitled to compensation,
a submission with which I have already dealt.  One further
comment is warranted in this regard, however.  Prior to 1990, the
Schedule placed heavy stress on medical and related services and
supplies, and payment was conditional upon the opinion of the
insured person&#146;s physician and that of the insurer&#146;s medical
advisor.  At the date of Sylvio&#146;s accident, the Schedule had been
amended to place the emphasis on the insured&#146;s &#147;care&#148; in a
broader and much more flexible framework.  As such, the
legislation concerning care benefits in the period in question
was broadened, not narrowed.  Having regard to the broader
approach to the provision of benefits and to the Osborne Report,
it seems unlikely that the legislature intended to remove the
ability of family members to be compensated for care provided to
an insured person that had been judicially recognized in
Migliore.</pre>
    <pre>The purposes of the Schedule</pre>
    <pre>[86] Interpreting the 1990 Schedule so as to enable payment to
family members for the care that they provide also accords with
the purposes of the 1990 Schedule.  One of the purposes of the
no-fault accident benefits in the 1990 Schedule is to benefit the
injured insured person by ensuring that he or she receives needed
care.  In other words, the injured insured is entitled to
reasonable and fair compensation.  By providing that the insured
receive the payment, as opposed to those providing the care, the
legislature intended to give the insured the maximum choice as to
who would provide necessary care.  It is clear that the
legislature intended that choice to include a parent, inasmuch as
a parent who gives up employment outside the home is entitled to
be reimbursed for lost gross income.  The respondent&#146;s
interpretation of the 1990 Schedule would lead to inequality
between parents who are employed outside the home and those who
have chosen to be homemakers or to be otherwise self-employed.
There is no discernible policy reason to adopt an interpretation
that promotes such inequality.
[87] A second purpose of the 1990 Schedule is to protect policy
holders from escalating insurance premiums by limiting the
amounts that injured persons are entitled to recover to what is
reasonable, in order to avoid unreasonable overcompensation.  At
the same time, however, the legislature could not have intended
that the insured person should be undercompensated and that the
insurance company receive a windfall whenever a close relative
reasonably cares for the injured insured.  The respondent does
not suggest that Sylvio would receive better care if his parents
did not care for him.  I fully subscribe to the view that to
force the injured insured to forego care provided by a loved one
who knows the injured person intimately, in favour of a less
personal health care provider who does not have this background
knowledge is to unduly penalize the injured insured.  To
interpret the legislation in the way suggested by the respondent
would lead to a conflict between the legislation&#146;s purpose of
providing fair compensation to an injured insured, and its
purpose of providing reasonable compensation in order to keep
insurance premiums down.  On the other hand, if the legislation
is interpreted so as to include payment to the insured for the
necessary and reasonable care provided by a family member, both
purposes of the legislation may be harmonized.  The trial judge
does not appear to have given sufficient appreciation to the need
to harmonize these dual legislative purposes.
[88] When s.7 is read as a whole, it becomes obvious that a third
purpose of the section is an evidentiary one aimed at protecting
insurers against fraudulent claims.  To allow the evidentiary
requirements of the section respecting a claim for care benefits
to dictate a narrow interpretation of its overall provisions,
however, is not appropriate, especially bearing in mind the
purpose of the section to provide fair compensation to the
injured insured.
[89] Given the concession that Sylvio is permanently disabled and
requires long-term care, there can be no suggestion that Sylvio&#146;s
claim, on behalf of his parents, is fraudulent.  It may be, as
the trial judge found, that the overall extent or monetary value
of the care provided has been exaggerated.  That factual finding
would affect the quantum of care benefits; it would not, however,
lead to the conclusion that the entitlement to claim for care
benefits is negated outright.  All of the evidence supports the
conclusion that Sylvio&#146;s parents are providing much-needed
physical and psychological care to him.  Indeed, it is worth
repeating that the respondents concede that Sylvio&#146;s parents are
providing the care he needs.
[90] Finally, in deciding whether to apply a restrictive or
liberal interpretation of the words in the section, I would
simply mention that s.10 of the Interpretation Act supports a
liberal construction of remedial legislation.  In addition, the
word &#147;care&#148; in a policy of insurance was given a liberal, non-
literal interpretation by this court in Kirkness Estate, supra.
The court held that the requirement in the insurance policy that
the insured be under the regular care of a psychiatrist in order
to receive benefits should not be read literally.  The purpose of
the requirement was an evidentiary one intended to protect
insurers from fraudulent claims.  Because the insured was
permanently disabled, the requirement that the insured be under
the care of a psychiatrist was futile.  The court held that to
insist on compliance with this requirement would defeat the
purpose of the policy, which was to provide indemnity in the case
of permanent disability.  It would be somewhat anomalous for this
court to take a broader, non-literal approach to the
interpretation of a private contract of insurance than to the
interpretation of remedial legislation aimed at providing fair
benefits to injured persons.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion regarding section 7 (1)(b)</pre>
    <pre>[91] Both before and after the relevant time period, the word
&#147;expense&#148; in the legislation was interpreted inclusively as
allowing a permanently disabled insured person to claim for the
expenditure of time and effort by members of his family.  There
is no suggestion that the legislature intended a different result
in the period in question here.  The usage of the same word,
&#147;expense&#148;, the recommendations contained in the Osborne Report,
and the broader phraseology with respect to care all suggest the
opposite conclusion.  Courts in the United States have also
interpreted similarly-worded and structured no-fault provisions
respecting expenses for the care of the insured to include
payment for services rendered by family members.  Interpreting
the word &#147;expense&#148; so as to permit payment to the appellant for
the care being provided by his mother does not offend the
legislative text and is in harmony with all of the purposes of
the legislation.
[92] Accordingly, I would hold that the appellant is also
entitled to claim for the care provided by his parents under
s.7(1)(b).</pre>
    <pre>Section 6(1)(f)</pre>
    <pre>Section 6(1)(f) of the  1990 Schedule provides:</pre>
    <pre>   (1)  The insurer will pay with respect to each 
	insured person who sustains physical, psychological 
	or mental injury as a result of an accident all 
	reasonable expenses resulting from the accident
        within the benefit period set out in subsection (3) for,
     </pre>
    <pre>    (f) other goods and services, whether medical or non-
        medical in nature, which the insured person requires
        because of the accident.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[93] The reasoning with respect to s.7(1)(b) above is equally
applicable to s.6(1)(f).  Accordingly, I would hold that  the
appellant  is entitled to claim for care provided by his parents
under this section as well.  I note that the limitations on
payment contained in s.6(3) as applied to this case are the same
as those respecting s.7.
     </pre>
    <pre>The request for a variation of the trial judge&#146;s order and the
request for an order for payment of care benefits</pre>
    <pre>The limitation period</pre>
    <pre>[94] Inasmuch as the appellant requests an order varying the
trial judgment by ordering that one of the respondent insurance
companies pay the maximum amount to the date of trial, it is
necessary for me to deal with the trial judge&#146;s comment at p.124
of his reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Even if family members were entitled to claim
          for the value of services under the No Fault
          Schedule, the claim in this case would fail.
          The first notice of a claim for care benefits
          was the letter from Thomson Rogers to Liberty
          Mutual dated August 8, 1994.  There are no
          details given in those documents in support
          of the claim.  The issue of care benefits was
          not resolved by mediation November 15, 1994.
          The mediation report referred to the Interim
          Agreement of August 25, 1992 and the issue
          whether it was still in effect and whether it
          could be enforced.
                                </pre>
    <pre>As such, I will review in some detail the relevant provisions in
the 1990 Schedule, as well as the relevant facts that were before
the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>[95] The relevant notice provision is contained in s.22 of the
1990  Schedule.  It provides:

          22(1) The insured person or the person
          otherwise entitled to make a claim shall,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a) give initial notice of a claim to the 
	      insurer, in writing, within thirty days
	      from the date of the accident or as soon
	      as practicable thereafter; and
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b) furnish to the insurer within ninety days
	      of the giving of the notice under clause
    	      (a) a completed application for no-fault
              benefits respecting the accident and the
	      resulting loss.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2) A failure to comply with a time limit set
          out in subsection (1) does not invalidate a
          claim if the claimant has a reasonable excuse
          and so long as there is compliance within two
          years of the accident.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (8) If the insurer refuses to pay an amount
          claimed in an application for statutory
          accident benefits, the insurer will forthwith
          give written notice to the insured person
          giving the reasons for the refusal.
          </pre>
    <pre>Section 25 states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          No person may commence a mediation proceeding
          under section 280 of the Insurance Act in
          respect of benefits under this Regulation
          unless the requirements of s. 22 have been
          satisfied and the insured person has made
          himself or herself reasonably available for
          any examination required under s. 23.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[96] The automobile accident occurred on November 12, 1991.  In
early December, 1991, the appellant&#146;s father notified Axa
Insurance, whom he believed to be his automobile insurer, that a
claim would be made under his Axa policy.  An undated application
for accident benefits was submitted to the respondent Axa on
behalf of  Sylvio Monachino in or about January 1992.  Due to a
dispute between Axa and Liberty Mutual as to who was responsible
for payment of the appellant&#146;s no-fault benefits, he was
initially left without benefits.
[97] On February 24, 1992, the appellant&#146;s counsel wrote to
counsel for Liberty Mutual requesting payment for benefits to
cover cognitive rehabilitation for the appellant with
Dr. Cancelliere, a psychologist.  The trial judge found that
these payments were made on a timely basis.
[98] On May 12, 1992, mediation failed to resolve the issue of
Axa&#146;s denial of coverage.  Finally, on August 25, 1992, an
interim agreement was reached between the appellant, Axa and
Liberty Mutual to each pay 50 per cent of the benefits owing to
the appellant.  The agreement states that &#147;all outstanding
medical and rehabilitation claims will be paid promptly&#148;.  It was
to remain in force until May 31, 1993 and arbitration on the
issue of Axa&#146;s liability was to take place by February 28, 1993.
Liberty Mutual was to be the lead insurer under the agreement.
The trial judge found that, for some reason never explained, the
arbitration did not take place.
[99] In July, 1994, the appellant&#146;s counsel applied for a
mediator on an Ontario Automobile Insurance Application Form 6.
[100]     At the request of the appellant&#146;s counsel, Dr. Franks
examined the appellant and produced a report dated August 4,
1994.  The eleven-page report discusses the accident, the
physical injuries to the appellant, the impact of these injuries
on the appellant&#146;s behaviour and personality, the appellant&#146;s
treatment since the accident, the role of the appellant&#146;s parents
in providing care and prospects for the appellant&#146;s future care.
[101]     Upon receipt of this report, the appellant&#146;s counsel
promptly wrote to Liberty Mutual on August 8, 1994 and stated:
&#147;Please take notice that a claim for care benefits in the amount
of $3,000 per month is being made&#148;.  Attached to the letter was a
list of care duties provided by the appellant&#146;s mother.  The
trial judge found that &#147;[t]here was no response from Liberty
Mutual at that time to the demand for care benefits&#148;.
[102]     On October 11, 1994, the appellant&#146;s counsel again
wrote to Liberty Mutual again enclosing Dr. Franks&#146; report, as
well as copies of three reports prepared by Dr. Cancelliere, and
copies of the appellant&#146;s medical records from the Mississauga
Hospital.
[103]     On October 24, 1994, Liberty Mutual denied the
appellant&#146;s claim for care benefits with this statement:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The applicant has not submitted any claim
          which represents an expense incurred in
          respect of the reasonable cost of a
          professional caregiver nor has the applicant
          submitted a claim representing an amount of
          gross income reasonably lost by a person in
          caring for the applicant.
          </pre>
    <pre>[104]     On November 15, 1994, the mediator completed a report
which noted a dispute between the parties over whether the
interim agreement of August 25, 1992 was still in force.
According to the trial judge:  &#147;[t]he issue of Axa or Liberty
Mutual liability remained unresolved&#148; and &#147;the issue of care
benefits was stalemated.&#148;
[105]     Section 22 of the 1990 Schedule requires that a &#147;claim&#148;
be made within certain time periods.  The 1990 Schedule does not
state that a claim must be made for all specific types of
benefits being claimed.  In this case, a claim was made by the
appellant approximately one month after the accident.
[106]     Section 24 requires that the insurer give written
notice of the reason for refusing to make payment on a claim.  In
its 1994 response to the appellant&#146;s notification that he was
claiming care benefits, the respondent insurer did not state, as
a reason for refusing payment, the fact that the benefits
claimed were in addition to rehabilitation benefits that had
previously been paid.
[107]     The interim agreement between counsel states that its
purpose is to fund no-fault accident benefits.  Section 25
stipulates that no mediation in respect of benefits can take
place unless the requirements of s.22 have been satisfied,
including, therefore, the requirement respecting timely
notification of the claim.  Inasmuch as mediation did take place,
it would appear that the respondents were satisfied that there
had been sufficient compliance by the appellant with the
requirements respecting notice of the claim.  Further, the
statements of defence do not raise a defence based on the
limitation period, and neither of the respondents&#146; facta filed on
this appeal contains the submission that the claim is out of
time.  Thus, the limitation period was not in issue at the trial
before Keenan J. and it is not in issue on this appeal.
[108]     In any event, I would conclude that such an argument is
untenable, having regard to the particular facts of this case.
Inasmuch as the accident occurred on November 12, 1991, the
application for no-fault accident benefits that was submitted in
or about January, 1992 was sufficient and timely notice to the
insurers, within the two-year period, that benefits were being
claimed.  As such, this claim acted as an umbrella for the
subsequent care benefit claim which was advanced after the
permanence and gravity of Sylvio&#146;s injuries were outlined in Dr.
Franks&#146; report of August, 1994.  The claim for care benefits was
made in a timely manner following this report.  The respondent is
therefore entitled to an order varying the trial judgment and
ordering payment of care benefits.</pre>
    <pre>The appropriate quantum for care</pre>
    <pre>[109]     I now turn to the question of the monetary amount that
should be ordered with respect to the claim for care benefits.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s comments concerning quantum</pre>
    <pre>[110]     The trial judge stated at 124:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Even if it could be found that the 24 hour
          family watch at the hospital was an &#147;expense&#148;
          on the part of the family members, it would
          be extremely difficult to classify it as
          &#147;reasonable&#148; entitling the family to claim
          compensation for the full amount of that time
          when Sylvio was under the active care of the
          hospital staff including doctors, nurses,
          technicians and other staff.  For the most
          part, the care giving was provided by the
          hospital staff and the attendance by
          Monachino family members was largely
          redundant.
          </pre>
    <pre>[111]     With respect to the day-to-day care that Sylvio
presently receives from his family, the trial judge observed at
125:
          </pre>
    <pre>          While there is no doubt that Sylvio is today
          very much dependent upon his mother for his
          care, it is difficult to accept the sharpness
          of the contrast that was sought to be drawn
          between the present condition and the pre-
          accident condition.  Clearly the evidence on
          this issue was exaggerated.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Exaggeration invites skepticism.  It calls
          into question both the motives and the
          reliability of the witness.  There can be no
          doubt that today Sylvio&#146;s mother devotes her
          time to selflessly and lovingly, with great
          personal sacrifice and anguish, to the care
          of her injured son.  It would be unthinkable
          for her not to respond in that way.  She
          summed it up quite eloquently with the simple
          statement &#145;I&#146;m his mother&#146;.  The suggestion
          that all that care is provided always at
          times independent of regular household
          activities is simply inconsistent with
          reality.  The assertion that this loving,
          caring, traditional mother did not provide
          any of those services to her son before the
          accident is incredible.  The only reasonable
          conclusion to be drawn is that the sharp
          contrast between the care before and after
          the accident was created to maximize the
          number of hours of care resulting from the
          accident.  It is highly unlikely that this
          tactic was conceived by Sylvio&#146;s mother.  It
          appears, rather, to be part of an overall
          dollar-driven plan to obtain maximum recovery
          under the No Fault Schedule.
          </pre>
    <pre>[112]     The trial judge then digressed to indicate that
s.61(2)(d) of the Family Law Act (1990) R.S.O. c. F.3, provided
for an award of damages for services provided by a family member
in a tort action and that the tort action had been settled for
the limits of the policy although the details of the settlement
were not disclosed.  He was concerned about the possibility of
double recovery, and explained that, in the event that he was
found to be wrong in excluding recovery under s.7(1)(b) of the
1990 Schedule, any evaluation he put on the family&#146;s services
would meet with the same problem of possible double recovery.
The trial judge concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Furthermore the state of the record is such
          that I cannot make any reasonably reliable
          determination of the amount of the time
          claimed that could be compensable.  As noted,
          the claim for the 1008 hours for care and
          services while Sylvio was in the hospital
          takes no account of the fact that Sylvio was
          being attended by doctors, nurses and other
          hospital staff.  Similarly, the record does
          not permit any reliable calculation of the
          amount of care given at home as a percentage
          of the grossly exaggerated total claimed.  I,
          therefore, must decline to attempt any such
          calculation, not simply because of the
          difficulty involved, but because the state of
          the record does not permit it.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
Discussion respecting quantum</pre>
    <pre>[113]     It is beyond dispute that the care provided to patients
in a hospital is less than optimal in many cases.  That family
members can and do provide reasonably necessary care to an
injured insured while in the hospital was recognized in
MacDonald, supra.  Osler J. concluded at 425 that, even during
the period of hospitalization, the insured&#146;s parents provided
valuable services to her and that in the circumstances these
services were &#147;reasonably necessary for her care and
rehabilitation&#148;.  While Osler J. was satisfied that the insured&#146;s
parents devoted substantial time to her rehabilitation, he also
found that much of the time at the hospital represented visiting
and nothing more.  Osler J. accepted the approach of the
defendant which acknowledged an average of two hours per day
devoted by each parent to their daughter&#146;s care while in
hospital.
[114]     Here, Sylvio was in the hospital for about six weeks.
His parents testified that, during this time, they engaged in
specific rehabilitation and care activities.  Examples are
accompanying and supervising the appellant on walks outside of
his room, reminding him about his past and introducing him to
friends and family whom he did not remember, and helping him to
cope with his depression.  In addition, his parents helped to
coordinate his care with the various doctors.  Bearing in mind,
however, the trial judge&#146;s comments that the care of family
members while Sylvio was in the hospital was largely redundant, I
would allocate an arbitrary figure of just over 2 hours per day
or 100 hours as &#147;reasonably necessary for care and
rehabilitation&#148; of Sylvio during this time period.
[115]     The trial judge also reasoned that, because Sylvio&#146;s
mother did his laundry and cooked his meals prior to the
accident, she should not be compensated for performing these
tasks after the accident.  Parents typically look after children
throughout childhood and often into their years of post-secondary
education in one fashion or another.  So long as Sylvio would
have been expected to stay in school to complete his education,
it may be that the respondents could make a case for paying a
reduced amount for Sylvio&#146;s post-accident care.
[116]     I am not aware of any evidence that suggests that,
prior to his accident, Sylvio planned to live at home and have
these tasks performed by his mother for the rest of his life.  On
the contrary, Ms. Staub testified that, prior to the accident,
the appellant was &#147;totally self sufficient, relative to someone
else his age&#148;.  In the normal course of events, most children
separate from their parents and become completely independent.
But for the accident, there appears to be no reason to think that
Sylvio would not have done the same.
[117]     The undisputed medical evidence is that Sylvio has been
left with cognitive deficits and that he will never regain the
self-sufficiency he had and will never be able to live
independently away from home.  His condition will deteriorate,
rather than improve, over time.  Because of Sylvio&#146;s head
injuries, the nature and extent of the domestic tasks performed
by Sylvio&#146;s mother has also changed as a result of the accident.
Dr. Cancelliere testified that Sylvio is now quite forgetful and
would be at risk of forgetting something on the stove if left
alone in the kitchen.  A normal adult does not require
supervision, for safety reasons, while heating up a prepared
meal.
[118]     Because Sylvio is permanently disabled, he will not be
able to leave home and live independently in the same way as most
other people at his stage in life.  Whether or not he continues
to live with his family, he will continue to require supervision.
The trial judge erred in his assumption that Sylvio&#146;s mother was
obliged to go on providing unpaid care services for her son, out
of natural love and affection, for the rest of her or Sylvio&#146;s
life, merely because she did so prior to the accident.
[119]     The trial judge emphasized that some of the care
provided by Sylvio&#146;s parents &#150; and in particular his mother &#150;
included household chores such as cooking meals and doing
laundry.  The unfortunate effect of this emphasis was to downplay
the necessity of the care that the parents have provided, in the
context of the appellant&#146;s injuries.  Among the extensive expert
evidence ignored by the trial judge, for example, was Ms. Staub&#146;s
testimony that Sylvio&#146;s parents, since the accident, &#147;are helping
him, cueing him to make executive function decisions that
otherwise his own non-impaired frontal brain would be able to
make&#148;.  Further, in structuring his day for him, the appellant&#146;s
parents were &#147;for the most part &#133;doing what he needs to have
done&#148;.
[120]     Similarly, Dr. Franks testified that, since the
accident, Sylvio&#146;s parents have provided care to meet his need
for daily supervision and assistance.  It was &#147;necessary&#148; for
them to do so, he testified; &#147;they, in essence, really didn&#146;t
have any choice&#148;.  I referred earlier to some of the relevant
portions of Dr. Cancelliere&#146;s testimony, but worth repeating is
his testimony that Sylvio&#146;s parents, in providing him with care,
&#147;had become an extension of the work that I was trying to do with
him&#148;.  None of this expert evidence concerning the necessity of
the care provided by the parents was contradicted at trial.
[121]     In order to make Sylvio independent of his parents in
the future, Ms. Staub recommended that he be provided with a life
skills coach for thirty hours a week during the first year, and
for twenty hours a week thereafter, at an estimated rate of $21
per hour, for 50 weeks a year.  Ms. Staub recommended an
additional $52 per month to pay for the life skills coach to
accompany the appellant on outings.  Also, Dr. Cancelliere
testified that he could see an individual working with Sylvio two
to four hours a day to help him manage the tasks of daily living,
structuring his time, accompanying him on outings, and assisting
him with social integration.
[122]     In addition to the life skills coach, Ms. Staub
recommended a case manager be provided for three hours a week
during the first year, and two hours a week thereafter, at an
estimated cost of $90 per hour, as well as a housekeeper to
perform heavy cleaning for the appellant in his own home once a
month, at an estimated cost of $60 per month.
[123]     Ms. Staub testified that most of the duties that would
be performed by a care manager and life skills coach are
currently provided by Sylvio&#146;s parents.  I am of the opinion that
the evidence of Ms. Staub and Dr. Cancelliere provides a
sufficient basis in the record on which to assess the approximate
number of hours of care per week that the appellant is receiving
from his parents.  Aside from housekeeping and the preparation of
meals, that total amounts to roughly thirty-three hours per week
the first year following Sylvio&#146;s discharge from hospital and
twenty-two hours per week thereafter.
[124]     Ms. Staub testified that, in circumstances such as the
present, she would normally apply a non-professional rate of $15
per hour for care services.  In decisions such as O&#146;Brien, supra,
non-professional family members have been compensated for care
provided to an injured insured persons at the hourly rate of the
adult minimum wage rate.  Based on a review of all of the expert
evidence at trial, I do not think that the minimum wage
adequately reflects the level of responsibility assumed by
Sylvio&#146;s parents for his care.  In the circumstances of this
case, and particularly in consideration of Ms. Staub&#146;s testimony,
I am of the opinion that an hourly rate of $12 per hour is
appropriate up to the date of trial.  I would apply this rate for
fifty-two weeks per year, rather than fifty, since Sylvio&#146;s
parents cared for him on a full-time basis.  Applying these
figures, the appellant&#146;s parents are entitled to recover the
following for care services provided:</pre>
    <pre>     Year One: 1,716 hours (33 hours per week times 52 weeks)
     times $12 per hour for a total of $20,592.</pre>
    <pre>     Year Two and subsequent years to the date of trial:  1144
     hours (22 hours per week times 52 weeks) times $12 per hour
     for a total of $13,728 per year.</pre>
    <pre>I would apply the same rate of $12 per hour to the 100 hours of
care I have allocated was given to Sylvio by his parents during
his stay in the hospital.
</pre>
    <pre>Concerns regarding double recovery</pre>
    <pre>[125]     Before ending the discussion, I must deal with the
spectre of double recovery raised by the trial judge.  As I have
indicated earlier, it was not appropriate for the trial judge to
consider double recovery inasmuch as the onus is on the insurers
to establish that double recovery would result, and they failed
to do so in this case (See Stante v. Boudreau, supra).
[126]     Furthermore, it is questionable whether the no-fault
benefits received by the appellant would be deductible having
regard to s.63 of the Family Law Act.  That section states:

          In assessing damages in an action brought
          under this Part, the court shall not take
          into account any sum paid or payable as a
          result of the death or injury under a
          contract of insurance.  1986, c. 4, s. 63.
          </pre>
    <pre>[127]     In addition, the persons entitled to maintain an action
under s.61 of the Family Law Act are the appellant&#146;s parents.
Section 267(1)(a) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8;
amended S.O. 1990, c.2 provides that damages awarded to a person
from the use of an automobile are to be reduced by the no-fault
benefits received by that person.  The person in s.267(1)(a) is
the appellant, and not his parents.</pre>
    <pre>The Claim for a Declaration</pre>
    <pre>[128]     The appellant seeks a declaration that he is and shall
continue to be entitled to receive weekly care benefits under the
no-fault schedule until such time as the limits set out in the
1990 Schedule are exhausted.  Having found that Sylvio is
entitled to weekly care benefits under the 1990 Schedule, on the
basis that they are reasonable and necessary, I would order that
he receive these benefits until such time as the limits set out
in the 1990 Schedule are exhausted, or until it is established
that such benefits are no longer reasonable and necessary.
[129]     In light of my earlier conclusion, such a declaration
is not hypothetical and it involves the resolution of a very real
and significant dispute between the parties.
[130]     In the event that Sylvio&#146;s parents are unable, whether
due to age, infirmity or just plain burnout, to continue to care
for him, it may be that the question of the level of care
benefits will need to be revisited so that it more accurately
reflects the market costs of substitute professional care.</pre>
    <pre>The Cross-Appeal</pre>
    <pre>[131]     I agree with Finlayson J.A.&#146;s disposition of the cross-
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Costs</pre>
    <pre>[132]     I would order that the appellant is entitled to his
costs of the appeal and of trial.  I agree with Finlayson J.A.
that, as the appellant took no position on the cross-appeal, no
costs on the cross-appeal should be awarded to the appellant and
that Liberty Mutual should pay the costs of the cross-appeal to
Axa Home.

1 s.7(2) and (3) of the Schedule.
2 At that time the legislation did not make a distinction between
services for care and services for rehabilitation.
3 The other major research reports prepared in anticipation of
the creation of the 1990 schedule were the Final Report of the
Ontario Task Force on Insurance (1986); and the Report of the
Ontario Automobile Insurance Board (1989).  Only the Osborne
Report specifically addressed the question of compensation of
family members for care.
4 s.6(2) reads: The insurer will pay with respect to each insured
person who sustains physical, psychological or mental injury as a
result of an accident an allowance that is reasonable having
regard to all of the circumstances for expenses actually incurred
by a spouse, child, grandchildren, parent, grandparent, brother
or sister of the insured person in visiting the insured person
during his or her treatment or recovery.
