</strong>
[1]  The defendant in this occupier&#146;s liability case appeals from
the jury&#146;s findings of liability and damages and the plaintiff
Yvonne Montague cross-appeals the jury&#146;s award of damages and the
trial judge&#146;s failure to award pre-judgment interest, and costs.
She also sought re-instatement as an employee with the defendant.
We advised her during the hearing that the court does not have
jurisdiction to deal with the last-mentioned claim.
[2]  The defendant&#146;s appeal is not based upon any errors of the
trial judge in the conduct of the trial or in her charge to the
jury but solely on the ground that the jury&#146;s findings and awards
were unreasonable.
[3]  We are satisfied that there was evidence on which the jury
could reasonably find want of due care on the part of the
defendant which caused the plaintiff&#146;s accident of February 18,
1991.  The defendant did not move for a non-suit at the
conclusion of the plaintiff&#146;s case.  From this, it may be
inferred that its counsel was of the view that there was a case
to be met.  In any event, following the verdict the defendant
moved before the trial judge to have the action dismissed
notwithstanding the verdict.  The trial judge held that there was
some evidence of negligence on the defendant&#146;s part &#150; the
evidence that the plaintiff fell as a result of water on the
floor and an absence of mats in the area of the fall.  We note
that, also, there was evidence of no signs in the area.  We
cannot say that the jury was unreasonable in acting on this
evidence and in not giving effect to the defendant&#146;s evidence,
which did not directly address the state of the premises for some
time before and at the time of the fall.
[4]  Further, we agree with the trial judge&#146;s reliance on the
evidence of Dr. Richards as supportive of the finding of general
damages of $75,000.00.  No doubt this amount is high but, having
regard to the high degree of deference that must be shown to the
assessment of damages by a jury, we do not think we are justified
in interfering with it..  Further, accepting that the jury found
that the plaintiff had used reasonable care for her own safety,
this amount should not be reduced by any degree of fault on the
plaintiff&#146;s part.  The jury&#146;s finding in this regard was clearly
wrong.
[5]  We are satisfied that the plaintiff gave no evidence which
could support a quantifiable award for loss of income and no
evidence relating to any other kind of special damages.
Accordingly the award of $80,000.00 for special damages cannot
stand.
[6]  No evidence was given by the plaintiff&#146;s husband which could
justify the Family Law Act award of $35,000.  His only loss was
the loss of income from his wife and this is not a compensable
item under s.61 of the Family Law Act.  The most that could be
justified under this heading would be $5,000.00.
[7]  The only matter of merit respecting the cross-claim is the
failure of the trial judge to award pre-judgment interest to the
plaintiff.  This should be awarded in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Courts of Justice Act.
[8]  In the result, the appeal is allowed but only to the extent
of deleting the award for special damages and reducing the Family
Law Act award to $5,000.00.  The cross-appeal  is allowed but
only to the extent of deleting the reduction of 20% in the
plaintiff&#146;s damages and of  awarding to the plaintiff pre-
judgment interest as stated.
[9]  We award no costs of the appeal or the cross-appeal.</pre>
