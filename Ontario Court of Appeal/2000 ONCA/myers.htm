    <pre><strong>HEARD:         June 1, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction of Finnestad J. on October 5, 1998
and from sentence imposed on October 30, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Despite Mr. Posner&#146;s able submissions, we are not persuaded
that the trial judge erred in her application of the second and
third categories of factors set forth in Collins in admitting the
evidence of the weapon.
[2]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in not
considering the degree of departure from reasonable and probable
grounds in effecting the search.  It is true that the trial judge
did not expressly refer to this factor but we think that, in all
of the circumstances shown in the evidence, the degree of
departure was not significant.  There was a risk to the safety of
the officers and to others in the area and little opportunity to
conduct further investigation.  Further, in so far as the
identification of the appellant as the person described by the
informant is concerned, the appellant, in accordance with the
informant&#146;s description, was the only male at the club wearing an
orange shirt with cream coloured pants. In our view, the trial
judge&#146;s finding of good faith is reasonably supported by the
evidence.
[3]  The appeal is dismissed.</pre>
