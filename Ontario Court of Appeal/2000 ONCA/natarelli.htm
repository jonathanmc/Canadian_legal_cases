    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction dated March 5, 1998 and sentence
dated April 9, 1998 of G.B. Smith J., sitting with a jury.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>SHARPE J.A.:
                                
</strong>
[1]  The appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine for the
purpose of trafficking.  He appeals on the ground that the trial
judge failed to charge the jury that the included offence of
possession was a possible verdict.
[2]  At trial, the appellant advanced two defences.  The primary
defence was that the Crown had failed to prove that the appellant
had possession of the narcotics found in the garage owned and
operated by the appellant and his brother.  The alternative
defence was that even if possession had been established, the
Crown had failed to prove that the possession was for the purpose
of trafficking.  The trial judge clearly charged the jury that
there were two elements to the offence of possession for the
purpose of trafficking, possession and an intention to traffic.
He reminded the jury at various points of the Crown&#146;s obligation
to prove both elements beyond a reasonable doubt.
[3]  At the conclusion of the charge, Crown counsel raised the
objection that the included offence of simple possession ought to
be left with the jury.  The trial judge dismissed this objection
on the ground that the way the indictment was drawn left only the
possibility of the full offence of possession for the purpose of
trafficking.
[4]   In my view there was nothing in the way the indictment was
drawn to suggest that simple possession was not an included
offence.  It is firmly established that a trial judge sitting
with a jury must instruct the jury on the principal offence as
well as any included offences and the possible verdicts that may
be returned: see Head v. R. (1986), 30 C.C.C. (3d), 481 (S.C.C.).
[5]  I do not accept the respondent&#146;s contention that the failure
to leave the jury with the included offence can be excused on the
basis that given the quantity of drugs found in the garage, there
was no air of reality to simple possession as a possible verdict.
This position is inconsistent with that taken by Crown counsel at
trial.  Moreover, although a very substantial quantity of cocaine
was found in the garage, there was clearly an issue as to whether
the appellant was the only person to be in possession of the
drugs.  Questions asked by the jury indicated that the jury was
troubled by this issue.  The jury&#146;s failure to agree on verdicts
with respect to other counts in the indictment relating to other
drugs found on the premises may indicate a similar concern.
Although the appellant did not testify, there was evidence that
he was a drug user.  The trial judge dismissed a motion for a
directed verdict solely on the basis that as the appellant had
been found in the possession of a small quantity of cocaine, it
would be open to the jury to conclude that he had possession of
the quantities of cocaine found in the garage.   The trial judge
indicated in his charge to the jury the issue of whether
possession was had for the purpose of trafficking was a live one.
Taking all these factors into account, it is my view that the
trial judge erred  in failing to leave the jury with the included
offence of simple possession as a possible verdict.
[6]  In my view, the case falls within the principle enunciated
by Sopinka J. in R. v. Haughton (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d), 99
(S.C.C.) at 107:
          </pre>
    <pre>        In cases in which an included offence is not left 
	with the jury, a conviction by the jury of the more 
	serious offence cannot generally be relied on by 
	reason of the fact that it may very well be a 
	reaction against a complete acquittal.  There is an
        apprehension that the jury convicted because they had 
	no other alternative than acquittal and acquittal was 
	unpalatable.
          </pre>
    <pre>[7]  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal against conviction and
direct a new trial.  In these circumstances, it is not necessary
for me to deal with the appeal from sentence.</pre>

                              &#147;I agree J.I. Laskin J.A.&#148;
                              &#147;I agree D. O&#146;Connor J.A.&#148;
