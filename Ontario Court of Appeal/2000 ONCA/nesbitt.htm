    <pre><strong>Appeal from endorsement of Wilson J. dated April 15, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>FELDMAN J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal raises two issues, one procedural, the other
substantive. The procedural issue is whether the respondent
should have been denied the opportunity to bring this pleadings
motion under Rule 21 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure,
R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, on issues which it had already raised in a
pending Rule 20 summary judgment motion on which many procedural
steps had been taken and costs expended. The substantive issue is
whether the motions judge was correct in striking out certain
defences from the Statement of Defence as disclosing no
reasonable defence in law, based on the Supreme Court of Canada
decision in Boma Manufacturing Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 463 (S.C.C.)


OVERVIEW OF THE FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[2]  James Bruce was an employee of Nesbitt Burns Inc. and a
customer of Canada Trustco Mortgage Company. In the Statement of
Claim it is alleged that he caused his employer to draw cheques
made out to Nesbitt clients, then fraudulently endorsed the
cheques to himself and presented them for payment at his own
bank. Nesbitt&#146;s action is a claim for damages for conversion
against Canada Trustco in respect of the payment on those forged
cheques.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Canada Trustco raises several defences in the Statement of
Defence. First it denies that the endorsements were forged.
Second it states that it became a holder in due course and relies
on s. 165 of the Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-4. It
also relies on the following defences raised in paragraphs 7 to
12 of the Statement of Defence which are set out in full as
follows:
</pre>
    <pre> 7. If  the payees&#146; endorsements on the Cheques were forged  or
     placed  thereon  without  their authority,  which  is  not
     admitted  but expressly denied, Nesbitt is precluded  from
     denying  the  genuineness  of the  endorsements  and  from
     relying  upon  the alleged forgeries.  Nesbitt  failed  to
     notify  Canada Trustco of the alleged forgeries  within  a
     reasonable  time  of  learning of the  alleged  forgeries.
     Canada  Trustco pleads and relies upon section 49  of  the
     Bills of Exchange Act.
          </pre>
    <pre> 8.  In the alternative, Nesbitt owed a duty and obligation  to
     Canada  Trustco to ensure that the Cheques  were  properly
     endorsed  by  the payees and negotiated by the  person  or
     persons entitled to receive payment of the Cheques  within
     a  reasonable  time of receiving its bank statements  from
     its banker. Nesbitt failed to notify its banker and Canada
     Trustco  of  the  forged  endorsements  within  the   time
     prescribed  by  its banker.  Accordingly,  Canada  Trustco
     states  that  Nesbitt is estopped from  relying  upon  the
     alleged forged endorsements.</pre>
    <pre> 9.  Alternatively, Canada Trustco states that:</pre>
    <pre>      
      (a) Nesbitt was in better position to determine whether
          the Cheques were properly endorsed; and</pre>
    <pre>      (b) Nesbitt  knew or ought reasonably to have  known  that
          the Cheques were not properly endorsed by the payees;</pre>
    <pre>     Accordingly, Nesbitt voluntarily assumed the risk that the
     Cheques   did   not   bear   authentic   endorsements   or
     endorsements placed thereon with the payees&#146; authority.
          </pre>
    <pre>10.  In  the  further alternative, Canada Trustco  claims  that
     Nesbitt  owed  a  duty  of care to Canada  Trustco,  as  a
     collecting bank, to ensure that the Cheques were delivered
     to   the  payees  and  that  the  Cheques  bore  authentic
     endorsements.   Nesbitt  breached  its  duties  to  Canada
     Trustco by:
          </pre>
    <pre>      (a) permitting Bruce to have access to the Cheques;
      </pre>
    <pre>      (b) cloaking Bruce with actual or ostensible authority  to
          deliver the Cheques to the payees;</pre>
    <pre>      (c) failing  to establish a system or any system  or  take
          any  steps  to ensure that Bruce did not  exceed  his
          authority with respect to the control of the Cheques;</pre>
    <pre>      (d) supervise and monitor its customers&#146; accounts;</pre>
    <pre>      (e) failing  to  make  timely enquiry as  to  the  alleged
          unauthorized dealings with the Cheques;</pre>
    <pre>      (f) failing  to carry out proper auditing procedures  with
          respect to its banking and financial affairs;</pre>
    <pre>      (g) failing  to  discover the alleged fraud  in  a  timely
          manner  and  within the time prescribed in  Nesbitt&#146;s
          operation of account agreement with its banker; and</pre>
    <pre>      (h) failing to notify Canada Trustco of the alleged  fraud
          or  unauthorized dealings and alleged forgeries in  a
          timely fashion.</pre>
    <pre> 11. In addition or in the alternative, Nesbitt breached a duty
     to Canada Trustco to ensure that it put into place an adequate
     means or system to ensure that Bruce did not have the ability,
     means and opportunity to fraudulently or improperly intercept the
     Cheques, in the event that it is found that the Cheques were
     fraudulently and improperly intercepted by Bruce and to ensure
     that the endorsements were not forged.  Canada Trustco states
     that Nesbitt, by the nature of its business as an investment and
     securities brokerage firm, was placed under such a duty to
     protect the general public, including Canada Trustco, from such
     risks.</pre>
    <pre> 12. Had Nesbitt informed Canada Trustco of the alleged forged
     endorsements within a reasonable time, Canada Trustco could have
     recovered the amount of the Cheques from Bruce.  As a result of
     Nesbitt&#146;s delay, Canada Trustco cannot charge the Cheques back to
     Bruce&#146;s account.  Accordingly, Canada Trustco has detrimentally
     relied upon Nesbitt&#146;s implied or express representation that the
     endorsements on the Cheques were proper and valid endorsements.
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  Nesbitt commenced the action in November, 1997 and Canada
Trustco defended in January, 1998. Nesbitt took no steps in the
action until October 1998 when it brought a motion for summary
judgment returnable in November. Canada Trustco obtained an
adjournment of the motion and an order for production of
documents to be made prior to the argument of the motion. On the
cross-examinations of witnesses on the motion, Nesbitt refused to
answer questions and provide documents relating to defences which
it said were not available in law, and were the subject of the
summary judgment motion. When Canada Trustco moved for an order
that Nesbitt provide the refused answers and documents, Nesbitt
responded with the Rule 21 motion seeking to strike out the
disputed paragraphs in the Statement of Defence.
</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Although no reference is made in the Endorsement of Wilson
J. to the issue of delay in bringing the Rule 21 motion, her
disposition of that issue is implicit in the fact that she
proceeded to deal with the Rule 21 motion on the merits, striking
out the defences contained in paragraphs 9,10 and 11 of the
Statement of Defence.</pre>
    <pre>THE PROCEDURAL ISSUE
</pre>
    <pre>[6]  I agree with the submission of the respondent that Wilson
J.&#146;s refusal to dismiss the Rule 21 motion for delay and her
decision to proceed with it before the summary judgment motion
were matters of an interlocutory nature involving the exercise of
discretion.  Any appeal from that decision would go to the
Divisional Court with leave: s. 19(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C. 43.  Section 6(2) of the Courts of
Justice Act provides:</pre>
    <pre>     The  Court  of  Appeal  has jurisdiction  to  hear  and
     determine  an appeal that lies to the Divisional  Court
     or  the  Superior Court of Justice if an appeal in  the
     same  proceeding lies to and is taken to the  Court  of
     Appeal.</pre>
    <pre>However, this court has held that that section does not apply to
appeals which require leave of the Divisional Court: Albert v.
Spiegel, (1993), 17 C.P.C. (3d) 90.1  As such no appeal lies to
this court from that order.

</pre>
    <pre>THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Wilson J. stated the issue before her in the following
paragraphs of the Endorsement:
</pre>
    <pre>  (3)In  the statement of defence Canada Trustco pleads in
     essence  in the relevant paragraphs that Nesbitt  was
     negligent  in  hiring  Bruce and  placing  him  in  a
     position of trust, and in failing to have appropriate
     safeguards  in  place to prevent fraud by  employees.
     The   plaintiff  seeks  to  strike  these  paragraphs
     relying upon the Supreme Court of Canada decision  in
     Boma Manufacturing Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank  of
     Commerce (1996), 140 D.L.R. (4th) 463 (Boma).
  </pre>
    <pre>  (4)The  issue raised in this motion is whether the  tort
     of  conversion is one of strict liability or  whether
     preclusion by way of contributory negligence  may  be
     pleaded.
  </pre>
    <pre>  (5)Is   the   collecting  Bank  (the  defendant   Canada
     Trustco),  in the case of a valid cheque fraudulently
     endorsed to a third party, entitled to rely  upon  s.
     48(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act (R.S.C. 1985 c. B-
     4)  (the  Act)  to assert against the drawer  of  the
     cheque (the plaintiff Nesbitt) that by its conduct it
     is  precluded  from asserting a claim in  conversion?
     The  defendant argues that the exception  in  section
     48(1)  applies  and that preclusion may  be  properly
     pleaded.
  </pre>
    <pre>  (6)Alternatively, is the drawer of the cheque  (Nesbitt)
     entitled  to  assert  that  conversion  is  a  strict
     liability tort, and that the exception in s. 48(1) of
     the   Act  and  the  issue  of  preclusion  have   no
     application   in   the  case  of   a   valid   cheque
     fraudulently  endorsed? It is  the  position  of  the
     plaintiff  Nesbitt  that although s.  48(1)  applies,
     preclusion  by  contributory negligence  may  not  be
     raised  in  the  case of a valid cheque  fraudulently
     endorsed.  The  plaintiff argues that, in  accordance
     with  Boma, conversion is a tort of strict liability,
     and  therefore those paragraphs of the  statement  of
     defence should be struck.
</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Section 48(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act provides as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>       48(1) Subject  to this Act, where a signature  on
             a   bill   is  forged,  or  placed  thereon
             without  the authority of the person  whose
             signature it purports to be, the forged  or
             unauthorized    signature     is     wholly
             inoperative,  and no right  to  retain  the
             bill  or  give a discharge therefor  or  to
             enforce  payment thereof against any  party
             thereto  can be acquired through  or  under
             that  signature, unless the  party  against
             whom  it  is  sought to retain  or  enforce
             payment  of  the  bill  is  precluded  from
             setting   up   the  forgery  or   want   of
             authority.
       
</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The issue as presented to Wilson J. was argued in the same
way in this court: the application of s. 48(1) of the Bills of
Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-4 and whether there is a defence
of preclusion by way of contributory negligence.
[10] However, there is no reference in the Statement of Defence
in this case to s. 48(1) of the Act, nor is there any plea of
contributory negligence in those words. There is reference in
paragraph 7 of the Statement of Defence, set out above, to
Nesbitt being &#147;precluded&#148; from relying on any forged endorsement
because of failure to notify Canada Trustco of the forgeries in a
timely way, relying on s. 49 of the Act. Counsel confirmed in
argument that this was not an error in the pleading and that the
intended reference is to s. 49 and not s. 48, although the term
&#147;precluded&#148; is not used in s.49. In any event, paragraph 7 is not
one of the paragraphs sought to be struck from the pleading.
[11] The crux of the three impugned paragraphs, 9,10 and 11, is
that Nesbitt as the drawer of the cheques voluntarily assumed the
risk that the endorsements were not authentic, that Nesbitt owed
a duty of care to Canada Trustco as collecting bank to ensure
that the endorsements were authentic, and that it owed a duty to
put in place an adequate system to ensure that an employee did
not have the opportunity and means to intercept and corrupt valid
cheques of the company. The Statement of Defence denies liability
for any relief claimed and seeks dismissal of the action. There
is no stated reference to an  apportionment of liability on the
basis of contributory negligence.</pre>
    <pre>THE DECISION OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</pre>
    <pre>[12] Wilson J. found that the Boma decision held: a) conversion
is a tort of strict liability, and b) contributory negligence is
therefore not available as a defence by a collecting bank. Wilson
J. equated a plea of contributory negligence to a plea of
preclusion under s. 48(1). This view accords with the submissions
of counsel for the respondent which were made in argument on the
appeal, that both the Boma case, and the case before this court
raised the issue of s. 48(1) preclusion.
[13] Wilson J. noted that Iacobucci J. did not use the word
&#147;precluded&#148; in the reasons for judgment, but he did quote s.
48(1) as one of the applicable statutory provisions. She also
concluded that there is an apparent conflict between s. 48(1) and
the Boma decision, and as a result awarded no costs of the
motion.
[14] Wilson J. concluded that paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 of the
Statement of Defence amounted to a plea of preclusion and
therefore, based on Boma, they must be struck out.</pre>
    <pre>THE BOMA DECISION
</pre>
    <pre>[15] The Boma case was an action tried on an Agreed Statement of
Facts. It also involved an employee, Alm, who issued fraudulent
company cheques which she deposited to her own account at her
Bank, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce  (&#147;CIBC&#148;), sometimes
by forging endorsements and sometimes without any endorsement.
Boma and a related company sued both their own bank, the Royal
Bank, and the collecting bank, the CIBC, in both negligence and
conversion. The Royal Bank succeeded in advancing defences at
trial to the majority of the claim and neither side appealed that
disposition. The appeals only concerned the liability of the
collecting bank, CIBC.
[16] Portions of the pleadings in Boma are set out in the Court
of Appeal decision ((1994), 120 D.L.R. (4th) 250 at 254).
Paragraphs 12 and 13 of the Statement of Defence of the CIBC are
the ones that raise the issues of estoppel and of contributory
negligence:
   </pre>
    <pre>   12.  The CIBC says that it is unfair or unjust that this
        claim   should  be  made  and  that  in   all   the
        circumstances  the  Plaintiffs  are  estopped  from
        bringing this action; these circumstances include:
   </pre>
    <pre>         (b) the Plaintiffs&#146; failure to supervise and monitor their
             employees, and in particular, Donna Alm;
          
         (c) the Plaintiffs&#146; failure to regularly check and verify 
	     their bank balances, documents, monthly statements, 
             cancelled cheques and vouchers with the Royal Bank;

	 (d) the Plaintiffs&#146; failure to recognize that they were
      	     regularly issuing cheques payable to payees to whom they
	     owed no money;</pre>
    <pre>         (e) the Plaintiffs&#146; failure to notify the CIBC of the
             defalcations committed by their employee promptly on 
	     learning of them when prompt notification could have
	     enabled recovery of a significant portion of the loss
	     claimed by the Plaintiffs.</pre>
    <pre>   13. In answer  to the allegations of negligence  made  in
       the  Statement of Claim the CIBC says that  the  sole
       cause, or, in the alternative, one of the causes,  of
       the   loss   alleged   by  the  Plaintiffs   is   the
       Plaintiffs&#146; own negligence, particulars of which  are
       set  out in the immediately preceding paragraph;  the
       CIBC  relies upon the Negligence Act, R.S.B.C.  1979,
       c. 298, s.1.
</pre>
    <pre>[17] At trial, the judge dismissed the plaintiffs&#146; negligence
claim against the collecting bank on two bases, first that a
collecting bank owed no duty of care to the plaintiffs, and
second because the plaintiffs&#146; negligence in failing to detect
the fraud of the employee over a long period far outweighed any
negligence by the collecting bank. There was no appeal of the
dismissal on this ground.
[18] The bank was held to be liable, however, for conversion. The
trial judge rejected four defences which were raised in response
to the claim for conversion: 1) the worthless paper defence, 2)
the s. 165(3) holder in due course defence, 3) the fictitious
payee defence, and 4) the inadequate notice defence. He further
found that the claim succeeded based on s. 49 of the Act which
the trial judge found to have the effect of making the collecting
bank the guarantor of the validity of the payee&#146;s endorsement. He
concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  system requires the collecting bank
          to  verify the endorsement ahead of  its
          own,  and  it  must  rely  on  its   own
          customer in that regard by ensuring that
          sufficient   funds   remain    in    the
          customer&#146;s account until the cheque  has
          cleared  or  count on that  customer  to
          cover  any  cheque not honoured  by  the
          drawee bank.
          CIBC&#146;s  own  negligence  in  failing  to
          obtain  an  endorsement  on  the   &#147;Lam&#148;
          cheques  (the  proffered  explanation  &#150;
          that  the name was mistaken for &#147;Alm&#148;  &#150;
          simply  does  not stand up to  scrutiny)
          and  in assuming that Donna Alm was  the
          principal  of the plaintiffs because  of
          the number of transactions, is a bar  to
          it  relying  upon  any estoppel  arising
          from  the  negligence of the plaintiffs.
          ((1993), 81 B.C.L.R. (2d) 197 at 209).
</pre>
    <pre>[19] In the Supreme Court, Iacobucci J. reviewed the analysis of
both the trial and appeal decisions, including the last-quoted
paragraph of the trial judge&#146;s conclusions. He then set out the
issues on the appeal and cross appeal and the three broad issues
under which he was considering the appeal to the Supreme Court:
          </pre>
    <pre>     IV.  Issues
          </pre>
    <pre>          
      A.   On Appeal
          </pre>
    <pre>      1.  Were the cheques in question made payable to fictitious or
          non-existing persons?
          </pre>
    <pre>      2.  Were the cheques in question &#147;delivered&#148; to the CIBC?</pre>
    <pre>      3.  Was the CIBC, as a &#147;collecting&#148; bank, prima facie liable to
          the appellants in conversion so that the cheques in question 
	  had to be properly negotiated to the CIBC in order for the
	  CIBC to obtain title to those cheques and thereby escape
	  liability?</pre>
    <pre>      4.  Is the defence of contributory negligence available to the
          respondent?2</pre>
    <pre>      B.  On Cross-Appeal
          </pre>
    <pre>      1.  What is the proper interpretation of s. 165(3), and in
          particular:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (f)  Must the cheque be deposited to the credit of its
	       payee for the subsection to apply?
          </pre>
    <pre>          (g)  Must the cheque be endorsed before the bank can credit
	       the person with the amount of the cheque?</pre>
    <pre>          (h)  Must the cheque be delivered with the authority of the
               drawer or endorser, or does simply handing it to the bank
	       teller for deposit suffice?
          </pre>
    <pre>          V.   Analysis
          </pre>
    <pre>          I have found it helpful to consider this appeal in
          terms  of  three  broad issues,  as  follows:  the
          doctrine of conversion with respect to cheques; s.
          20(5) [fictitious payee] as a defence to an action
          in  conversion;  and  s.  165(3)  [holder  in  due
          course]  as  a defence to an action in conversion.
          ([ ] added.)
          </pre>
    <pre>I  set out the issues considered by Iacobucci J. in full in order
to  demonstrate that the issue of the application of the doctrine
of preclusion under s. 48(1) of the Act was not raised in Boma.
[20] Iacobucci J. first discussed the tort of conversion of
cheques. He held that because conversion is a tort of strict
liability, the fault or innocence of the tortfeasor is
irrelevant, and therefore the concept of contributory negligence
by the owner of the cheque is also irrelevant and inapplicable.
Iacobucci J. referred to the discussion of the possibility of
applying the concept of apportionment of responsibility in
conversion actions in the text by Professor Ogilvie, Canadian
Banking Law (Scarborough, Ont.: Carswell, 1991), where she
recognizes that &#147;in most situations in which conversion occurs in
relation to cheques, there are varying degrees of innocence and
carelessness on both sides&#148;, and argues that it would be more
equitable to apportion liability than to expect banks to be
insurers, particularly because the banks would just pass the cost
along to all of their customers.
[21] However, Iacobucci J. rejected this approach on the basis
that &#147;the strict liability feature of conversion is well
engrained in the jurisprudence concerning bills of exchange.&#148;
(p.477) He concluded that to introduce the contributory
negligence approach into this area of the law would require a
legislative change by Parliament. This conclusion again makes it
clear that Iacobucci J. was not addressing the scope of
preclusion under s. 48(1) which is already part of the
legislative scheme.
[22] With great respect to Wilson J., in my view s. 48(1) is not
inconsistent with Iacobucci J.&#146;s analysis in Boma.  Iacobucci J.
held in Boma, that a bank which converts cheques is strictly
liable whether or not the conversion involved negligence on the
part of the bank.  The defence of preclusion is not an
apportionment of liability, but a complete bar to recovery by the
drawer of the cheque. The circumstances where the drawer could be
precluded from relying on the forgery to assert conversion
against the bank involve the drawer&#146;s own conduct in facilitating
the forgery, although arguably they could also arise where the
drawer&#146;s conduct after the forgery led the bank to rely on that
forgery.  As preclusion is a complete defence rather than a route
to apportionment of liability, the negligence or fault of the
bank is irrelevant; only the conduct of the drawer is relevant.
Therefore, because the defence of preclusion by negligence of the
drawer of the cheques is not dependent on a finding that the bank
which converted the cheques was negligent in so doing, s. 48(1)
is not inconsistent with nor affected by the Boma analysis.
[23] The other reason why it is clear that Iacobucci J. did not
intend to overrule the s. 48(1) preclusion defence was that he
did not refer to the recent leading Supreme Court of Canada case
on that section in Canadian Pacific Hotels Limited v. Bank of
Montreal and Morris Sands et al, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 711.
[24] That case involved an action against its own bank by the
drawer of cheques forged by an employee. The issue was whether
the plaintiff was precluded under s. 48(1) (then s. 49(1) of the
Bills of Exchange Act, R.S.C. 1970, c. B-5) from recovering its
loss from its bank, based on a breach of an alleged duty to
examine bank statements and report discrepancies within a
reasonable time and to maintain a system of internal controls to
prevent or minimize loss through forgery. LeDain J. rejected such
a wide duty after a full and thorough review of the Canadian case
law and the English and American case law on which it is based,
including many cases where employees of drawers had defrauded
their employers by issuing or intercepting forged cheques,
sometimes over long periods of time, and where the issue was
whether the bank or the drawer which allowed this situation to
develop and continue, should bear the loss.
[25] The established rule allowed a very narrow defence for a
bank to set up against its customer for preclusion.  For a bank
customer to be precluded from recovering against its own bank for
conversion of forged or altered cheques, there were two
requirements: 1) The negligence of the drawer must have been in
the transaction itself, that is, in the mode of drawing the
cheque, such as leaving space to fill in a different amount or
signing in blank, as opposed to negligently allowing the
circumstances to develop which could facilitate a fraud such as
leaving a cheque book around.  2) The negligence in the
transaction had to be the proximate cause of the loss. The
customer could also be precluded if it delayed in reporting the
forgery to the bank.  However the customer had  to have actual
knowledge of the forgery, not merely imputed knowledge from its
own negligent failure to be aware of the forgery.
[26] LeDain J. essentially affirmed the narrow contractual duty
of the customer to its bank and rejected again any wider duty. He
concluded (p. 777):
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  conclusion, then, I am of the  opinion
          that a customer of a bank does not, in the
          absence of a verification agreement, owe a
          duty  to  the  bank  to examine  his  bank
          statements  and  vouchers with  reasonable
          care   and  to  report  any  discrepancies
          within  a  reasonable  time,  nor  does  a
          customer &#147;sophisticated&#148; or otherwise, owe
          a duty to its bank to maintain an adequate
          system of internal accounting controls for
          the  prevention and minimization  of  loss
          through forgery.
</pre>
    <pre>[27] The court in Canadian Pacific also considered whether a
customer could owe a concurrent duty arising in tort even though
no such duty could be implied in contract. LeDain J., speaking
for the majority, stated that although a tort duty was not fully
argued,  there could be no duty of care in tort arising where the
same duty had been rejected as an implied term of a concurrent
contract.3 However, earlier in the judgment, LeDain J. did
specifically limit the scope of the decision to determining
whether a customer had by contract, the specific duties contended
for in the case, that is a duty to examine bank statements with
reasonable care and to report discrepancies within a reasonable
time. He stated (p.725):
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  do  not  find it necessary or desirable
          for  purposes  of  the present  appeal  to
          express a view as to the extent to which a
          party may be precluded by negligence under
          s. 49(1) [now s. 48(1)] from setting up  a
          forgery.  I am satisfied that whatever  be
          the   proper  scope  and  meaning  to   be
          assigned  to  the word &#147;precluded&#148;  in  s.
          49(1)  it  cannot be construed as freezing
          the  kinds of duties, the breach of  which
          may be properly characterized as resulting
          in an estoppel by representation.</pre>
    <pre>[28] LaForest J. in a concurring judgment agreed that any broader
duty in tort should be very limited but did not agree with the
rationale for rejecting consideration of a possibly broader duty
owed by a bank&#146;s customer in tort than could be implied by
contract. He based his analysis on policy considerations. He
considered that in developing the system for dealing in bills of
exchange, a policy decision had been made and implemented by
interpretation by the courts, whereunder the narrower duty of the
customer was established. He therefore concluded that (pp. 780-
781):
          </pre>
    <pre>          To  introduce a wider duty today under the
          rubric  of  the  tort of negligence  would
          effect  the  same uncertainties  as  those
          referred  to  by Parke B. in the  Bank  of
          Ireland  case [Bank of Ireland  v.  Evans&#146;
          Trustees  (1855), 5 H.L.C.  389,  10  E.R.
          950].  The  line between carelessness  and
          negligence in many everyday situations can
          be  extremely  hard  to  draw,  and  as  I
          mentioned  before there is need  for  more
          precise boundaries in this area.
     </pre>
    <pre>          It   was  against  the  background   above
          described that the Bills of Exchange  Act,
          now R.S.C. 1970, c. B-5, and in particular
          s.  49(1),  [now  s. 48(1)]  was  enacted.
          Generally, what Parliament sought to do by
          the  Bills  of Exchange Act was to  codify
          the  pre-existing law.   It  must,  as  in
          other cases, be presumed to have known the
          law  in  enacting the provision  that  now
          governs  the situation.  I cannot  believe
          Parliament, by the word &#147;precluded&#148; (which
          embodies  the  only  exceptions   to   the
          general   rule),  would  have   meant   to
          authorize  at  this  late  date   a   wide
          divergence   from  the  rules   for   loss
          allocation that it sought to codify.  This
          does  not  mean that the law is completely
          frozen, but it does mean that it cannot be
          expanded  in  such a way as to  give  rise
          under a new label to a wider duty that  is
          inconsistent with the basic policy  choice
          it sought to codify. ( [  ] added.)</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS
</pre>
    <pre>[29] The issues on this appeal break down as follows:

   1)  If the applicable portion of the Boma case stands only
       for the proposition that the tort of conversion is a 
       strict liability tort and therefore cannot be the subject 
       of apportionment of liability based on contributory 
       negligence, can paragraphs 9, 10, and 11 of the Statement 
       of Defence be interpreted as a plea of contributory 
       negligence which therefore must be struck out?
     </pre>
    <pre>   2) (a) Is there a plea of preclusion under s. 48(1)
          in  paragraphs  9, 10 and 11 of the  Statement  of
          Defence?

      (b) If so, must that plea be struck out?
     </pre>
    <pre>   3) (a) If there is not, is the defendant entitled to
          leave  to  amend at this stage to plead  s.  48(1)
          preclusion?

      (b) Is such a plea barred by the Boma case?</pre>
    <pre>      (c) Is it barred by the Canadian Pacific case?
</pre>
    <pre>[30] With great respect to the motions judge, I am satisfied that
the decision of the Supreme Court in Boma does not purport to
override s. 48(1) of the Bills of Exchange Act to read out the
availability of the defence of preclusion, nor to overrule the
court&#146;s decision in Canadian Pacific, which deals fully with the
interpretation and application of that section as it applies to
the contractual duty of a customer to its bank.
[31] In paragraph 12 of the Statement of Defence in Boma, the
CIBC pleaded estoppel, which is akin to preclusion but did not
refer to s. 48(1). The trial judge dealt with that allegation by
holding that the CIBC&#146;s own negligence barred it from relying on
any estoppel arising out of the negligence of the plaintiffs.
Iacobucci J. referred to this disposition by the trial judge
without comment. In my view, to the extent that the pleading in
paragraph 12 can be taken to be equated to a pleading of
preclusion under s. 48(1), the Supreme Court effectively approved
the disposition of the issue by the trial judge. Although no
authority was cited, in Canadian Pacific LeDain J. noted that
part of the common law development of the preclusion defence
included the concept that the bank could only rely on the
negligence of the customer as a defence when it had not itself
been negligent. (p.732)
[32] What the Boma case does decide is that there is no defence
of contributory negligence available where the action against the
bank is for conversion.
[33] This action is a claim for conversion against Canada Trustco
as collecting bank. The decision in Boma is directly applicable.
If paragraphs 9, 10 and 11 purport to form the basis for a plea
of contributory negligence, then they must be struck out
following Boma. Although there is no reference to contributory
negligence or apportionment of liability in the pleading, the
allegations against Nesbitt of voluntary assumption of risk in
respect of forged endorsements on its cheques and breach of duty
to Canada Trustco as a collecting bank, are capable of providing
the foundation for a finding of contributory negligence.
[34] Paragraphs 9,10 and 11 of the Statement of Defence do not
refer to s. 48(1), nor to preclusion nor to estoppel by
negligence. However, they allege voluntary assumption of risk,
and duties alleged to be owed by Nesbitt to the Bank which would,
on their face, be beyond the narrow scope of the preclusion or
estoppel by negligence defence as articulated and confirmed in
the Canadian Pacific case.
[35] Having said that, this case was argued based on Boma, and
although the historical development of preclusion was referred
to, it was not argued as the basis for striking the impugned
paragraphs, nor directly as the basis for retaining them.
[36] The Canadian Pacific case dealt with the duty owed by a
customer under its contract with its own bank and not with any
duty which may arise between a drawer of a cheque and a
collecting bank which acts on a forged endorsement. Any such duty
would arise in tort alone on the basis of the test set out in
Anns v. Merton London Borough Council, [1978] A.C. 728, (H.L.)
requiring a relationship of proximity or neighbourhood between
such parties. Any recognition of such a duty would be subject to
the observations made by both LeDain J. and LaForest J. that
although the law is not frozen, any new developments will be
informed by what has been held to be the very narrow scope of the
contractual duty owed by a customer to its bank and the policy
behind that law.</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[37] Because there is no specific reference in paragraphs 9, 10
and 11 of the Statement of Defence either to contributory
negligence, or to preclusion by negligence under s. 48(1), the
legal intent of those paragraphs of the pleading is unclear. To
the extent that those paragraphs may be a pleading of
contributory negligence, they must be struck out.  A plea of
contributory negligence is not available in response to an action
for conversion.
[38] However, the appellant is entitled to leave to amend, if so
advised. Any such amendment is to state clearly the legal basis
of any defence being asserted.
</pre>
    <pre>[39] Therefore the answers to the issues set out in paragraph
[29] above are:</pre>
    <pre>     1)   Yes</pre>
    <pre>     2)  (a)  Not specifically.</pre>
    <pre>         (b)  Not necessary to decide in light of the answer to (a).</pre>
    <pre>     3)  (a)  Yes.</pre>
    <pre>         (b)  No.</pre>
    <pre>         (c)  This issue is left open to be decided if the
              pleading is sought to be amended.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
     The appeal is therefore dismissed with leave to amend.</pre>
    <pre>[40] As success on the appeal was divided, costs of the appeal
shall be in the cause of the action.
