    <pre>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice Ferrier on March 5,
1993 and from the sentence imposed on April 21, 1993</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]   In  1995,  this  court found that  the  conviction  of  the
appellant&#146;s  wife  on  virtually  the  same  set  of  facts   was
unreasonable.   The only distinguishing features referred  to  by
the  trial  judge were that the monies connected to the appellant
could be divided by twenty and that the appellant demonstrated  a
consciousness of guilt by retreating as the police entered.
[2]  In our view, despite the expert evidence the first factor is
simply not a distinguishing feature.  As to the so-called
retreat, there was no evidence that the appellant was attempting
to escape and it was not a reasonable inference that the
appellant was attempting to hide anything.  The officer said that
he guessed the appellant had something in his hand.  This was too
tenuous a basis to support a finding of consciousness of guilt.
[3]  In view of the disposition of the appeal of the appellant&#146;s
wife, this verdict as well cannot stand.  We agree with the
appellant that this verdict is also unreasonable.
[4]  Accordingly, we would allow the appeal, quash the
convictions and enter acquittals.
