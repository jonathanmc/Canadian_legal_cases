    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Zalev J. dated December 16, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>FINLAYSON J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  Nova Tool &amp; Mold Inc. appeals from the judgment of the
Honourable Mr. Justice Zalev of the Ontario Court (General
Division) dated December 16, 1998 which dismissed its action and
granted judgment for the defendant London Industries Inc. on its
counterclaim in the amount of $124,697.18 U.S., together with
interest and costs.</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The respondent is a parts supplier in the United States that
supplies parts for Honda Motors.  The respondent ordered a
program of seven molds to be manufactured by the appellant with
contractual payment terms in accordance with the industry norms
as follows: a) one-third on the signing of the purchase order; b)
one-third on the first try-out; and c) one-third on the final
shipment.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  As found by the trial judge, the appellant was slow in
getting started on jobs numbered 619 and 620 and did not advise
the respondent that these jobs would be delayed.  Job 620 was not
ready for its first try-out until December 4, 1996, more than a
month behind schedule, at which time certain deficiencies were
observed.  The appellant was anxious to comply with the timetable
called for in the contract but it became obvious to the
respondent that it would be unable to do so.  Problems persisted
through two more try-outs in January 1997, despite the fact that
Nova employees were working extra hours on the project.  A
further try-out originally scheduled for February 5, 1997 was
postponed by Nova until February 10, 1997, but, as the respondent
was under considerable pressure from its customer, Honda Motors,
it began to seek an alternative subcontractor for job 620.
Cambridge Tool and Die Corporation (an original bidder for the
job) agreed to complete the work, but could only do so on a &#147;time
and materials&#148; basis because there was no time to provide a quote
in advance of beginning work.  The try-out on February 10
revealed that serious deficiencies and problems still existed in
620.  London transferred the mold to Cambridge shortly after this
try-out.  London eventually paid Cambridge $335,220 US for
completion of 620.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The issues between the appellant and the respondent
crystallised when the final billing was issued by the appellant
to the defendant for $367,834 U.S. with respect to the balance of
six of the seven molds.  Nova chose not to submit an invoice for
the final one-third payment on 620, the other two-thirds having
already been paid.  The respondent asserted a counterclaim as set-
off for 620, stating that it expended $335,220 U.S. to complete
620 at Cambridge, and also claiming damages for defects in job
619, ($15,600 U.S.), graining costs for three of the molds, and
internal costs for late delivery of 620.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  The issue in appeal related to job 620 and, in particular,
to the conduct of the respondent when it became apparent that the
appellant could not perform its contract for 620 in time for the
respondent to meet its commitments to Honda Motors.  It is
suggested by the appellant that the conduct of the respondent
amounted to accord and satisfaction and relieved the appellant of
all responsibility to the respondent after it assisted in the
transfer of the balance of its contract for 620 to Cambridge.
Specifically, the appellants refer to a meeting between the
representatives of Nova and London after the February 10 try out.
It was at this time that London informed Nova that it was
transferring the mold to Cambridge.  Nova agreed to this
arrangement, including shipping, and undertook to answer any
questions and provide any information requested of it during the
completion of 620.  On February 12, 1997, a letter was written
from London to Nova informing Nova officially that 620 was being
transferred to Cambridge and that &#147;[a]ll responsibility for the
completion of this mold&#148; would transfer to Cambridge.  The
appellants rely on the meeting and letter taken together to
establish their argument.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In order to successfully claim accord and satisfaction, Nova
would have to show that there had been an agreement between the
parties discharging Nova&#146;s obligations under the original
contract, and some consideration to make that agreement
enforceable:  British Russian Gazette &amp; Trade Outlook Ltd. v.
Associated Newspapers Ltd. [1933] 2 K.B. 616 (C.A.).  The trial
judge found that there had been no discussion, let alone
agreement, between the parties as to responsibility for damages
arising out of the need to transfer the mold or any arrangement
that would absolve Nova of liability for its failure to complete
620.  On the evidence, we find no basis to disturb this finding.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellant also argued that London had not acted
reasonably in incurring the mitigation costs it paid to Cambridge
in order to complete 620.  In our view, this argument is without
merit.  The findings of the trial judge are very clear:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In any event, I find that it would have
          been extremely difficult to find a mold shop
          that would quote a fixed price on a
          transferred mold, particularly where it had
          no previous knowledge of it.  In any event it
          would take about 4 or 5 weeks to get a quote.
          In view of Honda&#146;s schedule and the pressure
          London was in, getting a quote, or several
          quotes from mold shops which had time
          available, if any, was not an option.  I find
          that Nova could not have corrected the
          problems and deficiencies in 619 and 620 on
          time even if it could work 24 hours per day.
          Those molds were required to be ready 18
          weeks from first try-out.  Nova did make
          efforts to its limits, but was not
          successful.  It was not and would not
          ultimately be successful because its
          employees lacked the skill and talent
          necessary to do so.  620 had not improved
          significantly from the first try-out.  It was
          scheduled for completion in May 1997.  Honda
          needed a small number of parts at that time
          to begin with.  It first made 5 to 30 cars to
          acquaint its workers with the new model, for
          advertising purposes and to do the tests
          necessary to comply with Government
          regulations before mass production could
          start.  London worked hand in hand with the
          Honda engineers to see what adjustments were
          necessary for mass production.  Honda
          representatives attended each scheduled event
          and subsequent evaluations.  Nova well knew
          that London was obliged to supply the parts
          necessary on time for each event according to
          Honda&#146;s schedule.  If London did not have the
          parts ready to supply Honda, Honda could not
          pass Government regulations and be certified
          for mass production for the new model year.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Accordingly, what the respondent did was a necessary
operation to mitigate its damages and the appellant&#146;s co-
operation was in its own interests because the respondent faced a
potential loss to Honda that was significant.  Accordingly, we
reject the appellant&#146;s arguments with respect to the respondent&#146;s
action in contracting out the balance of Job 620 to Cambridge.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The trial judge accepted the respondent&#146;s counterclaim in
the amount stated and in the result the counterclaim exceeded the
appellant&#146;s claim by $124,697.18 U.S.  The only exception we have
to the trial judge&#146;s accounting is that we accept, and the
respondent in the last analysis concurred, that the trial judge
failed to credit the appellant with $62,200 (U.S.), being the
cost that the respondent would have incurred to the appellant if
the appellant had completed the final one-third of its contract
on job 620.</pre>
    <pre>[10] As to the question of graining or texturing, it was dealt
with by the trial judge in the following language:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I find that graining by Nova was
          required under the specifications on which it
          quoted.  Unfortunately for Nova its costs
          estimator failed to include the cost of
          graining in his estimate of total cost for
          the work on jobs 620, 621 and 667.  The cost
          estimate was an internal document of Nova and
          kept in its files until produced for the
          purposes of this litigation.  When Nova
          quoted it did not specify that graining was
          not included in its price, as it ought to
          have done if it was not included in its
          price.  London was entitled to assume that it
          was included.  London is entitled to recover
          the sum of U.S. $ 43,740.00 paid to Midwest
          Mold &amp; Texture, the graining sub-contractor
          approved by Honda.  Midwest had to be used,
          as it was the shop required by Honda.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The trial judge was entitled to come to this conclusion.
The engineering prints provided by the respondent from which the
appellant quoted for these jobs clearly identified texturing as
the appellant&#146;s responsibility.  One of the appellant&#146;s own
employees, Thomas Swan, admitted this. The quotations for the
jobs in issue did not indicate that texturing was not included in
the price quoted.</pre>
    <pre>[12] Accordingly, the appeal is allowed in part. The judgment
below is varied to the extent that the appellant is entitled to a
credit of $62,200 U.S. from the amount by which the trial judge
found that the counterclaim exceeded the claim, which was
$124,697.18 U.S.  Counsel will have to make whatever adjustments
are necessary with respect to interest to give effect to this
judgment.</pre>
    <pre>[13] As to costs, there were four issues argued in all and the
respondent was successful with respect to three of them.
Accordingly, it has been preponderantly successful and it is
entitled to three-quarters of its costs of this appeal.
