<p><b>On appeal from the judgment of  Ferguson J. dated December 18, 1998.</b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appeal by Transamerica Life Insurance Company of Canada 
  (Transamerica) from the judgment of Ferguson J., reported in (1998), 43 O.R. 
  (3d) 114, which held that the rule of public policy that the courts will not 
  recognize a benefit accruing to a criminal from his or her crime did not bar 
  the claim of the beneficiary named in a life insurance policy issued by Transamerica.  
  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
<h3><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent, Maria Oldfield, and Paul Oldfield were married 
  on April 1, 1984.  They are the parents of two children who are now 10 and 14 
  years of age.  They were separated in January, 1995, and were not subsequently 
  divorced.  Although there was no written separation agreement, the respondent 
  and her husband had an oral agreement that he would maintain sufficient life 
  insurance coverage to provide child and spousal support until the children reached 
  the age of eighteen, with Mrs. Oldfield to be maintained as the beneficiary 
  of the insurance proceeds. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the time of the Oldfields separation, there were four policies 
  of insurance in the total amount of $600,000 on the life of Paul Oldfield, with 
  the respondent named as the beneficiary.  One of the policies, in the amount 
  of $250,000, was issued by the appellant, Transamerica.  The other policies 
  were issued by The Manufacturers Life Insurance Company, which did not participate 
  in the appeal.  The appeal concerns only the Transamerica policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On December 4, 1993, Transamerica issued a policy, owned by Paul 
  Oldfield, insuring his life for $250,000, and naming Mrs. Oldfield as beneficiary.  
  The policy contained the following provisions:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Incontestability 
  of the Policy</span></b><span lang=EN-US> - In the absence of fraud this policy 
  will be incontestable after it has been in force during the Insureds lifetime 
  for 2 years from the date of issue, or the date of reinstatement or change, 
  whichever is latest, except for non-payment of premiums.</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>If the Insured dies while this policy is in force during its term period, 
  Transamerica Life Insurance Company of Canada will pay the face amount to the 
  Beneficiary subject to the provisions of this policy.</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Who Receives 
  the Proceeds</span></b> -  Any proceeds payable because of the death of the 
  Insured will be paid to the Beneficiary.  Unless changed as provided in this 
  policy, the Beneficiary will be as designated in the application.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Proof of 
  Death</span></b><span
lang=EN-US>  Any proceeds payable because of the death of the Insured will be 
  paid when we receive due proof of the Insureds death.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On April 27, 1996, Paul Oldfield died in Bolivia.  The cause 
  of death was cardio-respiratory arrest due to cocaine intoxication resulting 
  from the release of cocaine due to the rupture of one of 30 bags or condoms 
  of cocaine which were found in Mr. Oldfields stomach.  The Bolivian Coroner, 
  Dr. Satt, reported that Mr. Oldfields death was accidental.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The proximate cause of Mr. Oldfields death was his own criminal 
  action in ingesting narcotics and, more particularly, the rupture in his stomach 
  of one of 30 bags or  condoms which he had ingested.  The action of Mr. Oldfield 
  was contrary to public policy, the laws of Canada (ss. 3(1) and (2) of the <i>Narcotics 
  Control Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.N-1) and the laws of Bolivia.  Consequently, 
  Transamerica took the position that the respondent was precluded from receiving 
  the proceeds of the insurance on the life of Paul Oldfield on the ground that 
  a person should not be allowed to insure against his or her own criminal act 
  irrespective of the ultimate beneficiary of the insurance policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> All of the above facts were agreed to by the parties in a special 
  case which they submitted to the court pursuant to Rule 22 of the Rules of Civil 
  Procedure.  The special case contained, in part, the following questions of 
  law for the opinion of the court:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'>1.    Is there a principle of 
  contractual interpretation or an element of public policy that provides that 
  a person should not be allowed to insure against his or her own criminal act 
  irrespective of the ultimate payee of the proceeds of the insurance policy?</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'>2.    Are the insuring provisions 
  of each of the Policies to be construed to provide for payment of a death benefit, 
  when the proximate cause of the death of the owner/life insured was his own 
  criminal act namely, ingesting narcotics?  For the purposes of this matter, 
  the insuring agreements to be construed are as follows:</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ferguson J. described the issue contained in 
  the special case as follows at p. 116:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>The issue here is whether the rule that the courts will not recognize 
  a benefit accruing to a criminal from his or her crime bars the claim of an 
  innocent beneficiary named in a life insurance policy when the life insured 
  dies accidentally as the result of his own criminal act.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge outlined the facts arising from the special case 
  agreed to by the parties.  The following facts are relevant in respect to the 
  conclusion which I have reached:</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Oldfield purchased the life insurance policy

<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Under the terms of the policy, Transamerica 
  was contractually bound to pay Mrs. Oldfield the face amount of the policy, 
  $250,000, if Mr. Oldfield died while the policy was in force.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Pursuant to an oral separation agreement entered 
  into between Mr. &amp; Mrs. Oldfield at a time when the Transamerica policy 
  had been issued and was in force, Mr. Oldfield agreed to maintain sufficient 
  life insurance coverage in lieu of child and spousal support and that Mrs. Oldfield 
  would be maintained as the beneficiary of the policy until the children reached 
  age 18.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-family:
Wingdings'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Oldfields criminal act of being in possession

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Mr. Oldfields death was accidental. He did

  proceeds.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-family:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Although the policy was in force on the date 
  of Mr. Oldfields death, Transamerica refused to pay Mrs. Oldfield the amount 
  for which Mr. Oldfield had insured his life on the ground that it was relieved 
  from doing so by the rule of public policy which precludes a criminal from obtaining 
  a benefit as a result of his or her crime.</span></p>

  </span></span> Because I have reached the conclusion that Transamerica must 
  honour its contractual obligation to pay Mrs. Oldfield the insurance proceeds 
  on the basis of reasons somewhat different than those of the trial judge, I 
  do not propose an extensive review of his reasons.  However, it is helpful to 
  set out the following outline of his analysis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge stated that there are two common law rules 
  which relieve an insurer from its contractual obligations.  At p. 118, he described 
  the first rule in these terms:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>Unless it provides otherwise an insurance policy contains an implied 
  term that the insurance will not be payable if the person buying the policy 
  intentionally causes the insured loss to occur.</span></p>
<p class=MsoFooter>He referred to this rule as the rule against deliberately causing 
  the insured loss, stating that it is a rule that applies to the interpretation 
  of insurance policies, and not a rule of public policy.  I would give, as an 
  example of this rule, the case where an insurer, under a homeowners policy, 
  is relieved from indemnifying an insured for a loss intentionally caused by 
  the insured, such as intentionally setting fire to his or her property, absent 
  a term to the contrary in the insurance policy.  The trial judge concluded that 
  this rule did not apply to the circumstances of this appeal because Mr. Oldfield 
  did not kill himself intentionally to enable Mrs. Oldfield to obtain the insurance 
  proceeds payable on his death.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As for the second rule, the trial judge described 
  it in these terms on p. 118:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>It is an absolute rule (unless modified 
  by statute as in the case of contracts of indemnity) that the courts will not 
  recognize a benefit accruing to a criminal from his or her crime and that rule 
  extends to anyone representing the criminals estate or claiming a share of 
  the estate as a beneficiary under his or her will or on intestacy or as a creditor.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER>He referred to this rule as the rule against persons benefitting 
  from their crimes.  Ferguson J. stated that this is a rule of public policy, 
  referring to <i>Beresford v. Royal Insurance Co Ltd.</i>, [1938] 2 All E.R. 
  602 (H.L.) in which each of the two rules was discussed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With due respect to the trial judge, I have difficulty in understanding 
  his analysis of this rule and his admittedly complicated review of  the earlier 
  cases (p. 130), although there is no mistaking his reasons for his ultimate 
  conclusion, which are reproduced below.  Among the authorities which he discussed 
  in addition to <i>Beresford</i> are <i>Irwin Estate v. Cumis Life Insurance 
  Co.</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 634 (Gen. Div.); <i>Stats v. Mutual of Omaha Insurance 
  Co.</i> (1976), 14 O.R. (2d) 233 (C.A.), affd [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1153; <i>Brissette 
  Estate v. Westbury Life Insurance Co.</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 87; <i>Cleaver v. 
  Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association</i>, [1892] 1 Q.B. 147 (C.A.); <i>Deckert 
  v. Prudential Insurance Co. of America</i>, [1943] O.R. 443 (C.A.); <i>Demeter 
  v. Dominion Life Assurance Co.</i> (1982), 35 O.R. (2d) 560 (C.A.); and <i>Schilling 
  Estate v. Transamerica Life Insurance Co.</i> (1997), 40 C.C.L.1 (2d) 237 (Ont. 
  Gen. Div.), affirmed by a brief endorsement of this court on December 12, 1997.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Relying on the decision of this court in <i>Stats</i>, Ferguson 
  J. concluded that the circumstances of this case did not bring it within the 
  public policy rule that the courts will not recognize a benefit accruing to 
  a criminal from his crime, nor to any person representing the criminals estate 
  or claiming a share of his estate as a beneficiary under his or her will.  In 
  doing so, he distinguished <i>Schilling</i> on its facts, as that case involved 
  a claim by the children of the insured criminal, through his estate, of life 
  insurance proceeds derived from the wrongdoing of the insured.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As well, the trial judge at p. 131 referred to <i>obiter dicta</i> 
  of Lord Atkin and Lord MacMillan in <i>Beresford</i> to the effect that the 
  public policy rule might not affect the rights of third parties, such as a lender 
  to whom an insurance policy has been assigned as security.  He then returned 
  to <i>Stats</i>, and at p. 132 of his reasons applied the following passage 
  from Blair J.A.s reasons in <i>Stats</i> at p. 240:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>The criminal act does not vitiate the policy but merely 
  prevents the enforcement of rights under the policy by the person guilty of 
  the criminal act and those who claim through him as representing his estate 
  or claiming a share of his estate as a beneficiary under his will or on intestacy 
  or as creditor: <i>MacGillivray &amp; Parkington on Insurance Law</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> 
  ed. (1975), p. 237, para. 576.  Certainly, not all persons who might benefit 
  from an insurance policy are barred, but only a limited group of persons whom 
  the law regards as successors of the assured.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Ferguson J. continued at p. 132:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>There is a long line of English authority acknowledging 
  that a person who claims on the ground of an interest acquired in good faith 
  for value is not in the prohibited class and I do not think our appellate courts 
  would reject that authority without expressly saying so.  It is clear that Lord 
  Atkin in <i>Beresford</i> thought the public policy had no application to such 
  situations. The Court of Appeal in <i>Stats</i> came to the same conclusion 
  although it did not review all the old cases (at p. 241).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge then discussed two 19<sup>th</sup> 
  century English cases which he believed created an exception to the public policy 
  rule, and concluded as follows at p. 134:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>My analysis is supported by the authors of <i>MacGillivray 
  &amp; Parkington on Insurance Law</i> at para. 480 and following although they 
  suggest that the only interests to which the public policy rule does not apply 
  are irrevocable interests such as those of an assignee or mortgagee: para. 483.  
  I do not understand what they mean by irrevocable interests because an assignment 
  or mortgage could be reversed.  It seems to me that the exception applies to 
  all <i>bona fide</i> interests acquired for value.  For example, as noted in 
  the quote from <i>Beresford</i> the court there recognized that a lender who 
  owned the policy was exempted from the public policy.  There are numerous cases 
  where the courts have taken a liberal view of how one can acquire an interest 
  which will not be affected by the public policy rule: <i>Cook v. Black</i> (1854), 
  1 Hare 390; <i>Dufaur v. The Professional Life Assurance Company</i> (1851), 
  25 Beav. 599; <i>White v. British Empire Mutual Life Assurance Co. </i> (1868), 
  L.R. Eq. 394; <i>City Bank v. Sovereign Life</i> (1884), 50 L.T. 565.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>In my view in the case before me the interest 
  of the wife in the policies owned by the husband was one she was legally entitled 
  to in consequence of a <i>bona fide</i> contract and is in the category which 
  is excluded from the public policy rule.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge gave the following reasons for 
  his conclusion that Mrs. Oldfield was entitled to the insurance on her husbands 
  life at pp. 134-135:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>There are two categories of policy here: 
  those owned by the life insured and those owned by the widow.</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>The issue with respect to the first category was decided 
  in <i>Stats</i>.  <i>Stats</i> established that the public policy rule does 
  not apply to the claims under the policy owned by the criminal in our case.   
  Apart from<i> Stats</i> the claims would not be barred in any event because 
  they fall under the exception for persons with a <i>bona fide</i> interest obtained 
  for valuable consideration.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE align=center style='text-align:center;'><span
lang=EN-US>..</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>The issue of whether the public policy ban applies to both 
  categories can be considered by asking two questions put by Plaxton J. in <i>Deckert</i>, 
  at p. 462: Would the enforcement of the policy against the insurer in the circumstances 
  of this case be contrary or obnoxious to public policy?  Is there any principle 
  of public policy, settled by the decisions, applicable to this case?  I agree 
  with Philp J. in <i>Irwin Estate</i> who pointed out that in answering these 
  questions one must focus on the claimant of the proceeds: at p. 641.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>The enforcement of the claims in each category 
  of policy here would not be contrary to public policy.</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>I return to the statement of the rule:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>It is an absolute rule (unless modified by statute as in

  under his or her will or on intestacy or as a creditor.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>The claimant wife is not a criminal claiming the benefit 
  of her crime.  She is not claiming as the representative of the criminal in 
  any of the categories listed.  The benefit is not accruing to the criminal but 
  to the named beneficiary.  The wifes claim is <i>bona fide</i>; she had no 
  part in the crime and her interest arose before the crime: <i>Stats</i>, at

  </span></span> It is my view that this appeal can be decided on the basis of 
  the interpretation of the insurance contract entered into between Mr. Oldfield 
  and Transamerica, the facts to which the parties have agreed and the application 
  to the facts of the decision of this court in <i>Stats</i>.  However, I would 
  be remiss were I not to acknowledge the assistance which I have received from 
  the general discussion of the subject of the unenforceability of contracts on 
  grounds of public policy in E.A. Farnsworth, <i>Contracts</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  ed., (1990), at pp. 345-355 and S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> 
  ed., (1999), at 399- 410, as well as the discussion of the public policy rule 
  that precludes a criminal, and those claiming under him or her, from claiming 
  any benefit by virtue of the crime committed contained in the reasons of<i> 
  </i>Phillips L.J. in <i>Dunbar v. Plant</i>, [1997] 4 All E.R. 289 at 304 <i>et 
  seq</i> (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have stated, the facts on which the appeal is to be decided 
  were agreed to by the parties and are stipulated in the special case which they 
  submitted to the court.  They were accepted by Ferguson J. at pp. 116-117 of 
  his reasons for judgment.  As for the significant facts, I begin with the insurance 
  contract.  Under the contract, Transamerica agreed to pay the face amount of 
  the policy, $250,000, to Mrs. Oldfield if the insured, Mr. Oldfield, died while 
  the policy was in force, subject to the provisions of the policy.  Mr. Oldfield 
  died while the policy was in force.  There are no provisions in the policy which 
  qualify in any manner Transamericas obligation to pay $250,000 to Mrs. Oldfield.  
  Mr. Oldfield died accidentally while committing the crime of being in possession 
  of a narcotic.  Mrs. Oldfield did nothing to assist her husband in the commission 
  of the crime. She did nothing that contributed to the death.   He had swallowed 
  a number of condoms which contained the narcotic.  There is no evidence that 
  he did so with the intent to kill himself in order that Mrs. Oldfield would 
  receive the insurance proceeds.  Mr. Oldfield owned the insurance policy for 
  some time prior to his death.  As a term of a separation agreement between himself 
  and Mrs. Oldfield, he agreed to keep the policy in good standing in lieu of 
  paying support to Mrs. Oldfield and their two children.  At the time of his 
  death, Mr. Oldfield was in compliance with this term of the separation agreement.

<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is a fundamental principle of the interpretation of insurance 
  contracts, where a contract is unambiguous, that a court should give effect 
  to the clear language, reading the contract as a whole: <i>Brissette Estate</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, at p. 92.  There is nothing ambiguous about the insurance contract.  
  As Mr. Oldfield died while the policy was in force, Transamerica is contractually 
  obligated to pay Mrs. Oldfield the face amount of the policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is in the context of these facts, to which the parties agreed 
  and Ferguson J. accepted, and the fundamental principle of the interpretation 
  of insurance contracts, that Transamerica submits the court should relieve it 
  from its contractual obligation to pay Mrs. Oldfield $250,000.  Counsel for 
  Transamerica advanced two grounds in support of his submission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first ground is said by counsel to be a rule of construction.  
  It is submitted that contracts of insurance are construed as protecting the 
  insured against misfortune, and not against the insureds own criminal misconduct.  
  Thus, an insurance policy should be construed to preclude coverage arising from 
  a loss caused by the criminal conduct of the owner of the policy.  Reliance 
  was placed on the following statement of Lord Atkin in <i>Beresford</i> at p. 
  604:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>On ordinary principles of insurance law an assured cannot 
  by his own deliberate act cause the event upon which the insurance money is 
  payable.  The insurers have not agreed to pay on that happening.  The fire assured 
  cannot recover if he intentionally burns down his house, nor the marine assured 
  if he scuttles his ship, nor the life assured if he deliberately ends his own 
  life.  This is not the result of public policy, but of the correct construction 
  of the contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>As pointed out in N. Leigh-Jones, <i>MacGillvray 
  on Insurance Law</i>, 9<sup>th</sup> ed., (1997), at&nbsp;p. 330:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>There is a presumption in the case of every insurance contract 
  that the assured cannot by his own intentional act bring about the event upon 
  which the insurance money is payable and then recover under the policy.  That 
  is not the result of any rule of public policy, but of a prima facie rule of 
  construction of the contract, by which it is presumed that the insurers have 
  not agreed to pay on that happening.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>As Mr. Oldfields death occurred as a 
  result of his commission of the crime of being in possession of narcotics, counsel 
  for Transamerica submitted that the policy should be construed to relieve Transamerica 
  from its contractual obligation to pay Mrs. Oldfield.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second ground is said to be a rule of public policy which 
  disentitles an insured to recover, or to be indemnified, under an insurance 
  policy if to do so would allow the insured, or any person claiming under the 
  insured, to benefit, directly or indirectly, from his or her own deliberate 
  criminal conduct.  Reliance is placed on this statement of MacKinnon A.C.J.O. 
  in <i>Demeter</i> at p. 562:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style='text-align:justify;'><span
lang=EN-US>The basic rule of public policy which is not disputed is that the courts 
  will not recognize a benefit accruing to a criminal from his crime nor to anyone 
  claiming through the criminal.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>Transamericas position is that to require 
  it to pay $250,000 to Mrs. Oldfield, who is the wife of the insured, would be 
  contrary to public policy.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As for the appellants first ground, it is my view that the facts 
  do not support its application.  Mr. Oldfield, by his criminal act, did not 
  cause his own death.  In the words of Lord Atkin in <i>Beresford</i>, he did 
  not cause the event upon which the insurance money is payable. To construe 
  the policy to give effect to the presumption that Transamerica did not agree 
  to insure Mr. Oldfield against a criminal act to bring about his own death, 
  the intentional act of Mr. Oldfield would have to have been swallowing the narcotics 
  for the purpose of taking his own life to make the insurance proceeds available 
  for his wife.  The agreed facts do not support this finding. The parties have 
  agreed that his death was accidental.  Although the appellant, in paragraph 
  12 of its factum, does not concede that the death is accidental, this is contrary 
  to the facts stipulated in the special case and upon which Ferguson J. decided 
  the application. This is not a case analogous to one of the fire assured [who] 
  cannot recover if he intentionally burns down his house.  The insurer would 
  have the court imply a term into the contract that the policy does not apply 
  to the <i>accidental</i> death of the insured occurring in the course of the 
  commission of a criminal offence.  I would not give effect to this ground of 
  appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Nor would I give effect to the second ground of appeal, which 
  is also not supported by the facts.  The insurance policy being in good standing 
  at the time of Mr. Oldfields death and the insurer being required to pay the 
  insurance proceeds to Mrs. Oldfield, the insurer would have the court relieve 
  it of its contractual obligation on the ground that it is contrary to public 
  policy to allow Mrs. Oldfield to benefit from her husbands criminal act of 
  being in possession of a narcotic.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Assuming that Mr. Oldfields ingestion of the narcotic-filled 
  condoms was a deliberate criminal act, neither he, because he is dead, nor his 
  estate, has sought to benefit, directly or indirectly, from his criminal act. 
  Mrs. Oldfields claim arose because she was named in the policy as  beneficiary 
  pursuant to Mr. Oldfields obligation to do so consequent to a provision of 
  their separation agreement.  She has not asserted her right to the insurance 
  proceeds as a successor of the insured, but as an ordinary beneficiary, with 
  the result that her claim is not tainted by any illegality on the part of her 
  husband.  Insurance monies payable to an ordinary beneficiary do not form part 
  of the estate of the insured:  <i>Kerslake v. Gray</i>, [1957] S.C.R. 516 at 
  518.</p>

lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the circumstances of this case come 
  within the decision in <i>Stats</i> where this court held that where a crime 
  is committed by the insured, and the insured did not intend to cause her death 
  through the commission of the crime, the beneficiary named in a policy insuring 
  against accidental death, not being the estate of the insured, was not precluded 
  from taking the insurance proceeds because the rule of public policy did not 
  apply. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Stats</i> a group accident policy provided for the payment 
  of $25,000 to a named beneficiary where the death of the insured resulted from 
  accidental bodily injuries  while driving  any private passenger automobile.  
  The insured died as a result of driving her car into a building while her ability 
  to drive was impaired by alcohol.  This court held that the insureds death 
  was accidental within the meaning of the insurance policy and that the beneficiarys 
  claim was not barred by the public policy rule.  The insured appealed to the 
  Supreme Court of Canada only in respect to the interpretation of the insurance 
  policy.  Therefore, in dismissing the appeal, the Supreme Court was not required 
  to decide the public policy issue: <i> Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co. v. Stats</i>, 
  [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1153.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Reference should be made also to <i>Vijeyekumar v. State Farm 
  Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 590 (Gen. Div.), in 
  which one of the issues was whether the rule of public policy relieved an insurer 
  from paying death benefits to the insureds widow and daughter under his automobile 
  insurance policy in circumstances where he was found dead of carbon monoxide 
  poisoning while sitting in his car, with its engine running, in a closed garage.  
  Molloy J. applied <i>Stats</i> in concluding that the public policy rule did 
  not apply.  In doing so, at pp. 628-629, she observed, as in this appeal, that 
  the claim under the policy was not made through the insureds estate, that the 
  claimants were not implicated in the insureds act of suicide and that there 
  was no evidence that the insureds act of suicide was undertaken for the purpose 
  of generating insurance proceeds for his widow and daughter.  An appeal to this 
  court by the insurer, but not in respect to the public policy issue, was dismissed:  
  (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 545; leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was 
  refused May 3, 2000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, to apply the public policy rule in favour of Transamerica 
  and to deny Mrs. Oldfield recovery would be to penalize her for Mr. Oldfields 
  criminal activities.  The public policy goal which the insurer has asked the 
  court to apply is the enforcement of the criminal law.  Penalizing Mrs. Oldfield 
  is not going to achieve the public policy goal of the enforcement of the law 
  pertaining to unlawful possession of drugs and narcotics. Mr.&nbsp;Oldfield 
  will not be deterred from committing further drug offences as he is dead.  As 
  I have indicated, Mrs. Oldfield neither slew her benefactor, nor was she implicated 
  in his death, nor did he kill himself to generate the insurance proceeds for 
  his widow.</p>

  concerned the public policy rule in the context of an indemnity policy, Salmon 
  L.J. pointed out:  Public policy is not static.  In <i>Dunbar</i>, at p. 304, 
  Phillips L.J. considered it important to observe that the public policy rule 
  is not absolute, and went on to demonstrate this from his review of the development 
  and evolution of the rule. I see no reason to conclude that the rule should 
  be regarded differently in Canada.  I have found nothing in the reasons of Sopinka 
  J. in <i>Brissette Estate</i> to suggest that it is different in Canada.  <i>Brissette 
  Estate</i> was not decided on the application of any rule of public policy,

  </span></span> To the extent that this court may be considered to have held 
  in <i>Schilling</i> that the rule of public policy is absolute when, in a brief 
  written endorsement, it agreed with the reasons of the trial judge, it is my 
  view that <i>Schilling</i> is distinguishable on its facts.  In <i>Schilling</i>, 
  the crime of the insured precluded his children from recovering the insurance 
  proceeds through his estate.  The insured had named his wife as beneficiary, 
  and provided that if she predeceased him, his estate would become the beneficiary.  
  He murdered his wife and killed himself, with the result that his estate became 
  the beneficiary.  Even though his children were free from any connection with 
  the crime, public policy precluded their recovery of the insurance proceeds 
  through the insureds estate because they were derived from the crime of the 
  insured.  As well, as a member of the panel that decided <i>Schilling</i>,  
  I would note that <i>Dunbar</i> was not brought to the attention of the court.</p>

  </span></span> In reviewing the evolution of the public policy rule in <i>Dunbar</i>, 
  Phillips L.J. referred to the reasons of Diplock L.J. in <i>Hardy v. Motor Insurers 
  Bureau</i>, [1964] 2 Q.B. 745 (C.A.), which considered the application of the 
  rule in deciding whether there was valid third party liability coverage for 
  the benefit of a person injured by the criminal conduct of the insured driver.  
  At p. 307 Phillips&nbsp;L.J. quoted a passage from Diplock L.J.s reasons  which 
  I consider to have application to the circumstances of this appeal:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>The rule of law on which the major premise is based, ex 
  turpi causa non oritur actio, is concerned not specifically with the lawfulness 
  of contracts but generally with the enforcement of rights by the courts, whether 
  or not such rights arise under contract.  All that the rule means is that the 
  courts will not enforce a right which would otherwise be enforceable if the 
  right arises out of an act committed by the person asserting the right (or by 
  someone who is regarded in law as his successor) which is regarded by the court 
  as sufficiently anti-social to justify the courts refusing to enforce that 
  right  The courts refusal to assert a right, even against the person who has 
  committed the anti-social act, will depend not only on the nature of the anti-social 
  act but also on the nature of the right asserted.  <i>The court has to weigh 
  the gravity of the anti-social act and the extent to which it will be encouraged 
  by enforcing the right sought to be asserted against the social harm which will 
  be caused if the right is not enforced</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> In England, legislation has intervened to temper the rigours 
  of the public policy rule, known in that country as the forfeiture rule, in 
  respect to the crime of murder.  The <i>Forfeitures Act U.K. 1982</i> recognized 
  the existence of the rule.  The Act does not consider the rule to be absolute 
  and, in s. 2, gives the court a discretion to make an order modifying the effect 
  of the rule where, as s. 2(2) provides, the justice of the case requires the 
  effect of the rule to be so modified.  Phillips L.J., however, was convinced 
  that had there not been legislative intervention, the same result would have 
  been achieved by the judiciary.  In my view, the conclusion of Phillips L.J. 
  at p. 310 applies to the circumstances of this case:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>  The rule is a judge-made rule to give effect to what 
  was perceived as public policy at the time of its formulation.  I believe that, 
  but for the intervention of the legislature, the judges would themselves have 
  modified the rule.  Furthermore, it seems to me that the only logical way of 
  modifying the rule would have been to have declined to apply it where the facts 
  of the crime involved such a low degree of culpability, or such a high degree 
  of mitigation, that the sanction of forfeiture, far from giving effect to the 
  public interest, would have been contrary to it.  Alternative suggestions that 
  the rule should be restricted to cases of deliberate killing, or deliberate 
  violence leading to death, do not cater for cases of diminished responsibility 
  or provocation, where the mitigating features may be such as to render it particularly 
  harsh to apply the forfeiture rule.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Were I of the view that the facts of this case attracted the 
  application of the rule of public policy, there are a number of reasons why 
  it would be harsh to apply it.  I have already referred to some of them in respect 
  to the consequences of relieving Transamerica from its contractual obligation 
  to pay the insurance monies to Mrs. Oldfield.  Another consideration is whether 
  the culpability of Mr. Oldfields criminal conduct was such as to justify the 
  application of the public policy rule.  From the agreed facts we know little 
  about the circumstances attending to Mr.&nbsp;Oldfield being in possession of 
  the narcotics.  It is known that his stomach contained 30 condoms of cocaine 
  and that he had puncture marks on his arms and wrists, from which it can be 
  inferred he was a drug user. In addition, the assets with which this appeal 
  is concerned were not derived from a criminal transgression engaged in by Mr. 
  Oldfield for the purpose of their acquisition for the benefit of Mrs. Oldfield.  
  As I have stated, they derived from his accidental death while he was in possession 
  of an unknown quantity of narcotics.  The assets are the fruits of the insurance 
  taken out by Mr. Oldfield, as the separation agreement obliged him to do, for 
  the benefit of his widow and children.  It is my opinion that to relieve against 
  the application of the public policy rule and to bind the insurer to the terms 
  of the insurance contract, in the circumstances of this appeal, would cause 
  no serious damage to the fabric of society.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In reaching this conclusion, I have commenced the balancing process 
  suggested by Diplock L.J. in the passage from his reasons in <i>Hardy</i>, quoted 
  earlier.  To complete the balancing it is necessary to consider the social harm 
  if the public policy rule were to be applied to relieve Transamerica from paying 
  the insurance proceeds to Mrs. Oldfield.  The social harm would be significant 
  as it would deny the fulfillment of the public policy goal of enforcing separation 
  agreements and support obligations.  What is at issue, in reality, is the balancing 
  of two rules of public policy. In my view, the policy of enforcing separation 
  agreements and support obligations should prevail over the policy requiring 
  the imposition of a sanction where a person seeks to benefit from his or her 
  anti-social acts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Lest it is not clear, I feel obliged to indicate that I have 
  not attempted to lay down a general rule.  It would be unwise to do so.  It 
  is wiser, as I have endeavoured to do, to confine my decision to the facts of 
  this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, based on my view of the proper disposition 
  of this appeal, it is unnecessary to consider whether Mrs. Oldfields entitlement 
  to the insurance proceeds is dependant on whether the policy had been assigned 
  to her to secure Mr. Oldfields obligations under the separation agreement.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant raises two bases upon which it 
  says that it is relieved from paying the benefit under the policy: </span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>1)  The rule of interpretation:  The appellant submits that 
  as a matter of contractual interpretation, a life insurance policy cannot be 
  construed to cover losses caused, whether deliberately or accidentally, by the 
  criminal acts of the policyholder. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""> 
  [1] </a></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>2)  The public policy rule:  Even if the contract does cover 
  such a loss, as a matter of public policy, the contract is not enforceable because 
  the law will not assist a criminal to benefit from his own crime.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellants first submission does not relate 
  to the undisputed rule of interpretation of insurance policies that there is 
  an implied term that the insurance will not be payable where the owner of the 
  policy deliberately causes the insured event to occur. That rule is not the 
  one relied on by the appellant and is irrelevant in this case, first, because 
  Mr. Oldfield did not deliberately cause his own death, and second, because if 
  he had, the insurance policy in this case is one that otherwise provides for 
  coverage in the event of suicide by the insured after one year.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Borins J.A. dealt with the appellants rule 
  of contractual interpretation argument on the basis that the appellant was limiting 
  its submission of no intended contractual coverage to a criminal act intended 
  by the insured to bring about his own death, and therefore the insured loss. 
  On that characterization, he found that because the death of the insured was 
  an <i>accidental </i>result of his criminal act of possession of narcotics, 
  the facts of the case would not support the application of such a rule of construction.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> My understanding of the appellants submission, however, was 
  that there is a  rule of interpretation that is not limited to criminal acts 
  by the insured deliberately intended by him to bring about his own death and 
  therefore cause the insured loss to occur.  This broader rule would include 
  criminal acts by the insured which, although not intended to cause death, did 
  have that consequence, as in this case.  As a result, I believe that we are 
  required to directly address the legal issue whether there exists such a rule 
  of contractual interpretation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The significance of the issue is that if there 
  is a rule of contractual interpretation which applies in this case to preclude 
  recovery of the insurance proceeds by the respondent, then the public policy 
  considerations in favour of her recovery would not be reached.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the motions judge was correct in rejecting the argument 
  of the appellant that such a rule of contractual interpretation exists at common 
  law. I agree with the motions judge that the case law referred to by the appellant 
  for that proposition does not so hold. Rather the cases relied on, including 
  <i>Beresford v. Royal Insurance Co. Ltd.,</i>[1938] 2 All E.R. 602 (H.L.)<i>, 
  Deckert v. Prudential Insurance Co.</i>, [1943] O.R. 448 (C.A.), <i>Brissette 
  Estate v. Westbury Life Insurance Co.,</i>[1992] 3 S.C.R. 87 and<i> Schilling 
  Estate v. Transamerica Life Insurance Co. </i>(1997), 40 C.C.L.I. (2d) 237 (Ont. 
  Gen. Div.), affd  (1997), 108 O.A.C. 306, all turn on the application of the 
  rule of public policy against allowing a criminal to benefit by his crime (the 
  second basis raised by the appellant), and do not add a rule of contractual 
  interpretation which deals with losses which may be accidentally caused by criminal 
  acts by the insured.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants submission with respect to <i>Beresford </i> and 
  <i> Deckert</i> is that those decisions do not foreclose the rule of contractual 
  interpretation for which the appellant contends. The appellant then relies on 
  <i>Brissette</i> <i>Estate </i>and <i>Schilling</i> <i>Estate</i> as the cases 
  which hold that the rule of contractual interpretation exists.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant relies heavily on one statement made by Sopinka 
  J. in his decision in <i>Brissette Estate</i>, <i>supra</i>.  In that case a 
  husband and wife had purchased a policy naming the survivor as the beneficiary. 
  The husband murdered the wife. The husband eventually renounced his rights as 
  beneficiary under the policy in favour of the wifes estate which claimed the 
  proceeds of the policy. The case was argued on two issues: could the contract 
  be interpreted to require payment to the victims estate; and if not, could 
  the court achieve that result through a constructive trust. On the first issue 
  the court held that the contract provided for payment to the survivor, not to 
  the estate of the life insured. However, public policy  not an implied term 
  of the contract  prevented the money being paid to the felonious husband.  
  Sopinka J. then turned to the issue of whether a constructive trust could be 
  imposed on the proceeds of the policy in order to achieve payment to the estate 
  of the victim. He approached the issue by asking whether the application of 
  the public policy against allowing a criminal to benefit from his crime worked 
  an injustice in that case, and concluded that it did not, as the victim had 
  no interest in the proceeds of the policy on her life but only on her husbands 
  life.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Sopinka J. then observed: The rationale of the policy which 
  denies recovery to the felonious beneficiary is that a person should not profit 
  from his or her own criminal act. <i>It is consistent with this policy that 
  a person should not be allowed to insure against his or her own criminal act 
  irrespective of the ultimate payee of the proceeds</i>. (p. 94) [Emphasis added.]  
  The appellant relies on the latter statement to support its submission that 
  the Supreme Court has recognized a rule of construction of life insurance policies 
  that implies a term which excludes coverage for a criminal act of the policy 
  owner, even if the act was not committed with the intention of causing the insured 
  loss. That submission is, in my view, without merit. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Sopinka J. does not say that he is stating a 
  rule of construction of insurance policies. Rather, his statement merely discusses 
  the logic of extending the rule of public policy to apply to the situation where 
  the wrongdoer (who was not only a beneficiary but also an insured) would not 
  himself benefit from his criminal conduct, but sought to assign the benefit 
  of the insurance policy to an innocent beneficiary. In any event, because the 
  facts of the case involved a deliberate act intended by the felonious beneficiary 
  to cause the loss, it is clear in my view, that Sopinka J. was not formulating 
  a new rule of interpretation or extending the established rule regarding deliberate 
  acts, to criminal conduct which was not done for the purposes of causing the 
  insured loss. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> <span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In  <i>Schilling Estate, supra,</i> Lederman J. referred to the 
  above statement by Sopinka J. as a principle of contract interpretation (p. 
  239). His decision was approved by this court in a brief endorsement. In <i>Schilling 
  Estate</i>,  the policy insured the husbands life with the wife as beneficiary 
  unless she predeceased the husband, in which event, his estate became the beneficiary. 
  Although the circumstances of his death are somewhat unclear, the decision states 
  that the husband murdered his wife and in the course of so doing or shortly 
  thereafter, he died by reason of his criminal acts. Although his own death, 
  the insured event, may not have been deliberate, the murder of his wife, which 
  caused his estate to become the beneficiary of his insurance, was deliberate 
  criminal conduct calculated to ensure that his estate benefited under the policy. 
  Again I am satisfied that the principle of contract interpretation to which 
  Lederman J. was referring is the well-established rule of construction regarding 
  conduct by an insured, criminal and otherwise, which is done deliberately for 
  the purpose of causing the insured loss.</p>
