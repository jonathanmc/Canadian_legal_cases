</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We are in substantial agreement with the careful and
detailed reasons of Spiegel J. and, accordingly, dismiss this
appeal.
[2]  Our agreement with Spiegel J. that a description of the
maximum statutory accident benefits available to the insured does
not constitute a commuted value of those benefits should not be
taken as an indication that a statement of the maximum benefits
available to the insured need not be included in the notice
provided by the insurer pursuant to s. 9.1(2) of the &#147;Settlement
Regulation&#148; (R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 664 as amended O. Reg. 780/93, s.
7).  Paragraph 1 of the Settlement Regulation requires:</pre>
    <pre>	A description of the benefits that may be 
	available to the insured person under the 
	statutory  accident benefits schedule and
        any other  benefits that may be available 
	to the insured person under a contract of 
	automobile insurance.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In our view, a description of the benefits available
requires a statement of any monetary limits which apply to any
particular benefit:  Anne Marie King v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance
Company, F.S.C.O. A96-000601 at p. 10 (Arbitrator Vanderbent).
The information provided by the appellant as a commuted value was
in reality a description of the benefits available under the
policy and not a commuted value.  The description of the maximum
benefits provided by the appellant complied with the requirement
of paragraph 1 of the Settlement Regulation and not paragraph 5.
[4]  Paragraphs 1 and 5 of the Settlement Regulation relate to
different informational requirements.  The two (maximum benefits
available under the policy and commuted value of certain
benefits) taken together provide the insured with information
that will assist the insured in determining whether the
settlement should be accepted.  We agree with Spiegel J.&#146;s
interpretation of commuted value as that term is used in
paragraph 5 and with his conclusion that nothing in the notice
provided by the appellant constituted a commuted value.
[5]  Paragraph 5 of the Settlement Regulation requires a commuted
value of those statutory accident benefits that are &#147;not a lump
sum benefit.&#148;  Spiegel J. assumed that all of the statutory
accidents benefits constituted benefits that were &#147;not a lump sum
benefit&#148; and, therefore, subject to the commuted value
requirement in paragraph 5 of the settlement regulation.  No
issue was taken with that assumption before Spiegel J. or in this
court, presumably because the arguments made before Spiegel J.
did not turn on whether all of the statutory accident benefits
were properly characterized as &#147;not lump sum benefits.&#148;  In Anne
Marie v. King Wawanesa Mutual Insurance Company, supra, at pp. 10-
11, arbitrator Vanderbent concluded that not all statutory
accident benefits can be properly characterized as &#147;not a lump
sum benefit&#148; and that some, e.g. medical benefits, are more
properly viewed as a series of lump sum payments for which the
insured must establish entitlement before the payment is made.
[6]  The meaning of the phrase &#147;not a lump sum benefit&#148; in
paragraph 5 of the Settlement Regulation is far from clear (as
are other parts of the Settlement Regulation).  We would not want
to determine the meaning to be given to that phrase in a case
where the issue is not raised.  The meaning to be given to the
phrase &#147;not a lump sum benefit&#148; must await a case where the issue
is fully argued.
[7]  Finally, we cannot agree with one observation made by
Spiegel J.  After outlining the approach to be taken to the
determination of commuted value for the purposes of paragraph 5
of the Settlement Regulation, Spiegel J. went on to hold that if
an insurer did not have sufficient information to provide a
commuted value, it was obliged to delay a final settlement of the
statutory acts and benefits claim until it had sufficient
information.  We do not think that the requirements of paragraph
5 of the Settlement Regulation place the insurer in that
position.  Under paragraph 5, the insurer must provide &#147;an
explanation of how the insurer determined the commuted value.&#148;
The insurer can make that determination only on the basis of the
information available to it.  As long as the assessment is made
in good faith and the explanation clearly indicates the factual
assumptions relied on to determine the commuted value, we do not
think that the insurer can be said to have failed to comply with
paragraph 5 of the Settlement Regulation because it did not
resist settlement until further and better information was
available.
[8]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
