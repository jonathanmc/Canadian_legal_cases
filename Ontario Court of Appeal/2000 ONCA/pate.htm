    <pre><strong>               Valerie Langs Wise, for the defendant/respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         July 7, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Flinn J. dated November 23, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The two  major issues on this appeal are:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(1)  whether there is any evidence which is capable of 
supporting the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that the parties had 
agreed to a condition precedent to the coming into effect of 
the agreement of purchase and sale in question; and</pre>
      <pre>(2)  whether reliance upon a condition precedent is foreclosed 
by the parol evidence rule.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[2]  In finding that there was a condition precedent, the trial
judge relied entirely upon a memorandum prepared by a solicitor
in June 1989 of information given to him by Mike Jakupi.  No
issue is taken with the admissibility of this document as
evidence of the truth of its contents.
[3]  The salient portions of this memorandum read as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          Jakupi then contacted Peter Stavrou and met
          with Peter Stavrou on, I think, April 6th and
          took an offer from Peter.  The next day he
          delivered the offer to Terry Farrell at his
          office.  It was about two days later that he
          received the offer signed back with changes
          from Farrell.

          &#133;

          On the Monday night he spoke with Farrell
          concerning the signed back offer and was
          informed by Farrell that he had not been able
          to get hold of Sergautis but that he knew
          Sergautis wanted out of that deal.  It was
          evident to Mike Jakupi that there was no
          actual formal release on the Sergautis deal.
          There was nonetheless no condition in the
          signed back offer that it was subject to the
          Sergautis deal not proceeding and Mike Jakupi
          got no indication from Terry Farrell that
          there would be any reason to expect that the
          release would not be forthcoming.  He then
          spoke with Peter Stavrou and passed along to
          Peter what he&#146;d been told by Terry Farrell.
          In his view Peter Stavrou knew that there was
          no formal release of the Sergautis deal yet
          but there was no reason to expect any
          difficulty in this regard.  Peter Stavrou
          therefore signed the counter offer and Jakupi
          sent it over to Farrell&#146;s office.

          &#133;

          Three or four days later after crossing
          telephone messages with Farrell several
          times, Mike Jakupi spoke with Farrell and was
          advised there was a problem with the release
          of the Sergautis deal.  At this point Farrell
          was taking the position that we knew there
          was no release of the Sergautis deal and we
          accepted the counter offer.  Mike Jakupi then
          informed Peter Stavrou that it looked like
          there was no deal because there had been no
          release obtained on the Sergautis deal, and
          he informed Peter Stavrou that the deal
          probably would not close.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  In our view, the contents of this memorandum clearly fall
short of stating that there was discussion about or agreement to
the suggested condition.
[5]  On the submissions before us, the respondent argued that the
following evidence given by Mr. Jakupi, in all of the
circumstances, supported the trial judge&#146;s conclusion:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Q.   It&#146;s fair to say that when Mr. Stavrou 
executed the counter offer thereby accepting it, 
you understood that he did it on the condition 
that there was no deal until you got the written 
release?</pre>
        <pre>A.   I was assured that there would be mutual 
releases by Mr. Farrell, sir.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   And by that you knew there had to be mutual 
written releases, right?</pre>
        <pre>A.   Yes.  Yes.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   You didn&#146;t have it in your hand?</pre>
        <pre>A.   No, sir.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   But you knew that you had to have the written 
release before this deal became operative?</pre>
        <pre>A.   I would never have the releases, no.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   You knew it had to exist?</pre>
        <pre>A.   It had to exist, yes.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   It&#146;s fair to say then you knew that you had 
to have a written release in existence before this 
deal could be operative?</pre>
        <pre>A.   Yes.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   Do you believe, based upon your conversations, 
that that was the assumption under which Mr. 
Stavrou executed?</pre>
        <pre>A.   I &#133;</pre>
        <pre>Q.   You can&#146;t tell me what he thought.  I&#146;m asking 
you if you believe based upon your conversations 
with him at that time that that is the assumption 
on which he executed?</pre>
        <pre>A.   I don&#146;t know, sir.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   But you gave him all the information that you 
had that led you to the conclusion that you just 
testified, right?</pre>
        <pre>A.   Yes.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   Do you know if he had any different information 
that would lead him to a different conclusion?</pre>
        <pre>A.   No, sir.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   Did you have any discussions at all with Mr. 
Stavrou about who was going to bear the risk 
associated with this deal if a written release 
wasn&#146;t forthcoming and the first offer went ahead?</pre>
        <pre>A.   No, sir.</pre>
        <pre>Q.   Did you even think about it?</pre>
        <pre>A.   No, sir.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[6]  This is not evidence on which a finding of agreement on the
suggested condition precedent could reasonably be based.  The
most it could be said to show  is what Mr. Jakupi&#146;s view of the
matter was, and not, as he himself acknowledges in these
passages, that of Mr. Stavrou.
[7]  Ms. Wise submitted that this evidence should be read in
conjunction with some pieces of circumstantial evidence and, when
taken as a whole, it supported the trial judge&#146;s conclusion.  We
do not agree.  In our view, none of these pieces of evidence,
taken individually or cumulatively, amount to anything more than
conjecture.
[8]  Because we have concluded that the evidence was not capable
of supporting the trial judge&#146;s conclusion, it is not necessary
for us to deal with the second issue indicated above.
[9]  The respondent sought to uphold the judgment on the basis of
mutual mistake on which the trial judge, in the alternative,
relied as a basis for dismissing the action.  We are satisfied
that there was no evidence on which a finding of mutual mistake
could be made.  The respondent&#146;s position was not, as stated by
the trial judge, that it thought that the Extra Realty agreement
had been terminated by mutual releases.  It is clear that its
position was to the contrary, that is, that that agreement was
alive and in difficulty, but no more.
[10] The appeal is allowed, the trial judgment is set aside, and
in its place we grant judgment in favour of the appellant and
declare that it is entitled to damages to be determined at a new
trial confined to that  question.   The appellant is entitled to
its costs of the trial before Flinn J. and of the appeal.</pre>
