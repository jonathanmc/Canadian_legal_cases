    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of MacKenzie J. dated September 11, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LASKIN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns a priority dispute between the
appellant General Motors Acceptance Corporation of Canada
(&#147;GMAC&#148;) and the respondent Gaston Patry.  Patry owned a boat,
the St. Tropez, which he delivered to Inter-Marine, a boat
dealer, to sell.  GMAC, which financed the inventory of Inter-
Marine, held a chattel mortgage on the boat.  When Inter-Marine
went bankrupt, GMAC seized and sold the inventory, including the
St. Tropez.  Patry sued GMAC for damages for conversion.  The
trial judge concluded that Inter-Marine held the St. Tropez on
consignment and that title remained with Patry.  He awarded Patry
damages of $44,021.67.  Although GMAC raised several issues
before us, this appeal turns on the narrow question of the
meaning of &#147;good faith&#148; in s. 2(1) of the Factors Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. F.1, a statute rarely considered by this court.  Section
2(1) provides that if a mercantile agent who possesses but does
not own goods, sells or mortgages the goods and the requirements
of the section are met, the buyer or the mortgagee is protected
from any claim by the owner of the goods.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The main issue at trial was who owned the boat &#150; Patry or
Inter-Marine &#150; when GMAC seized it in November 1991.  Patry had
owned the St. Tropez, a 32-foot motor cruiser, since 1985.  In
October 1989 he decided to sell it and buy a smaller boat that
would be easier to handle.  He asked Inter-Marine to sell the St.
Tropez under an arrangement that Inter-Marine called the
&#147;partnership purchase program.&#148;  Under the program Inter-Marine
would refurbish and sell the boat and assure Patry a fixed return
of $79,000 less refurbishing costs, regardless of the sale price.
In return, Patry agreed to buy a new or used boat from Inter-
Marine.
[3]  The program, which Inter-Marine detailed in a letter to
Patry dated October 24, 1989, provided that Patry could deliver
the St. Tropez to Inter-Marine on consignment or as a trade-in
for the boat he agreed to buy.  The letter also provided that the
St. Tropez &#147;will be treated in all aspects as part of our
inventory and will have the opportunity to be financed through
GMAC.&#148;
[4]  Patry decided to buy a 1990 Eclipse for approximately
$43,500.  He signed a standard marine purchase agreement on
November 2, 1989.  The agreement contained a box called
&#147;description of trade-in&#148; in which the St. Tropez was listed.
Another box called &#147;trade-in allowance&#148; showed a customer credit
of $30,195.25.  The agreement also contained a handwritten
notation &#147;balance due in full to customer upon completion of sale
of St. Tropez.&#148;
[5]  In mid-November Patry took possession of the Eclipse and
eventually sold it.  He also arranged for Inter-Marine to pick-up
the St. Tropez.  When Inter-Marine took possession of the St.
Tropez it borrowed $73,700 from GMAC on the security of a chattel
mortgage against the boat.  Under the terms of the chattel
mortgage Inter-Marine covenanted that it had clear title to the
St. Tropez.
[6]  Inter-Marine was unable to sell the St. Tropez.  Patry,
however, made no request for its return, although his lawyer
wrote Inter-Marine in November 1990 demanding payment of the
customer credit.  In November 1991 Inter-Marine went bankrupt.
GMAC seized the St. Tropez and sold it through an auction house
in June 1992 for $40,500.
[7]  At trial, GMAC contended that the purchase agreement of
November 2, 1989 unequivocally showed that Patry had sold the St.
Tropez to Inter-Marine as a trade-in for its purchase of the
Eclipse and therefore Inter-Marine owned the boat when it gave
GMAC the chattel mortgage. The trial judge, however, found the
written documents ambiguous and therefore admitted parol evidence
to assist him to decide whether Patry had sold the St. Tropez to
Inter-Marine or had merely delivered it on consignment.  Both
Patry and the sales manager of Inter-Marine testified that Inter-
Marine had taken the St. Tropez on consignment, not as a trade-
in, and that the standard marine purchase agreement was used for
convenience but did not reflect the true nature of the
arrangement.  The trial judge accepted their evidence and
concluded that the arrangement concerning the St. Tropez was a
&#147;true consignment.&#148;
[8]  He next considered whether GMAC could rely on s. 2(1) of the
Factors Act.  He concluded that GMAC had satisfied all the
requirement of the section but one, the good faith requirement.
He did not find that GMAC had been dishonest.  Nonetheless, he
found GMAC had acted in bad faith because, though knowing that
some of the boats in Inter-Marine&#146;s inventory were to be
brokered, it did not exercise due diligence to find out whether
Inter-Marine owned the St. Tropez.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[9]  I am sceptical whether the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that
Inter-Marine held the St. Tropez on consignment can be supported.
If it was a consignment then Patry owned two boats, one of which
he had not paid for, and the other he had not demanded back for
two years.  Even the sales manager for Inter-Marine conceded that
characterizing the arrangement for the St. Tropez as a
consignment made no commercial sense.
[10] However, even assuming that Inter-Marine held the St. Tropez
on consignment, in my opinion, the trial judge erred in holding
that GMAC could not rely on s. 2(1) of the Factors Act.  Section
2(1) provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>2. (1)  Where a mercantile agent is, with the consent 
of the owner, in possession of goods or of the documents 
of title to goods, a sale, pledge or other disposition 
of the goods made by the agent when acting in the 
ordinary course of business of a mercantile agent is, 
subject to this Act, as valid as if the agent were 
expressly authorized by the owner of the goods to make
the disposition, if the person taking under it acts in 
good faith and has not at the time thereof notice that 
the person making it has not authority to make it.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[11] Section 2(1) of the Factors Act, like several provisions of
the Sale of Goods Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.1, specifies the
circumstances under which a person who has possession of but not
title to goods may nonetheless sell or mortgage the goods and by
doing so preclude the true owner from claiming compensation from
the buyer or mortgagee.  Section 2(1) reflects a compromise
between two competing principles:  one principle is that owners
should not lightly lose their property; the other is that for
commerce to be workable the law needs to protect persons who buy
or take security on goods in good faith even though the seller
may have no right to sell or give security.  See Fridman, The
Sale of Goods, 4th ed. (1995), at pp. 130-131.
[12] To rely on s. 2(1) and preclude Patry from claiming
compensation from it, GMAC had to establish the following:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(i)  Inter-Marine was a mercantile agent;

(ii) Inter-Marine was in possession of the St. Tropez with
Patry&#146;s consent;

(iii)     Inter-Marine pledged or mortgaged the St. Tropez to
GMAC in the ordinary course of its business as a mercantile
agent;

(iv) GMAC had no notice that Inter-Marine did not have the
authority to give the chattel mortgage; and

(v)  GMAC took the chattel mortgage in good faith.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[13] The trial judge found that the first four requirements had
been satisfied and I agree with him.  A mercantile agent is
defined in s. 1(1) of the Factors Act to mean one who has &#147;in the
customary course of business as an agent, authority either to
sell goods or to consign goods for the purpose of sale, or to buy
goods, or to raise money on the security of goods.&#148;  Inter-Marine
met this definition.  Moreover, Inter-Marine had possession of
the St. Tropez with Patry&#146;s consent.  A pledge is defined in the
Factors Act to include giving security on goods.  Thus, the
chattel mortgage to GMAC was a pledge under s. 2(1).  And the
trial judge found on the evidence that GMAC did not have notice
Inter-Marine had no authority to give the chattel mortgage.
[14] Thus, whether GMAC could rely on s. 2(1) turned on whether
it took the chattel mortgage in good faith.  Normally, good faith
and notice will coincide.  If a party has notice of an agent&#146;s
lack of authority, it may not claim to be acting in good faith.
See M.G. Bridge, The Sale of Goods, (1997), at pp. 447-448.
Here, however, GMAC did not have notice of Inter-Marine&#146;s lack of
authority.  Still, Patry contends that GMAC did not act in good
faith.
[15] Patry submits and the trial judge found that good faith
under s. 2(1) imports a due diligence requirement.  I disagree.
In my view, acting in good faith under s. 2(1) means no more than
acting honestly.  Good faith is not defined in the Factors Act
but it is defined in the Sale of Goods Act.  Section 1(2) of the
Sale of Goods Act provides that &#147;a thing shall be deemed to be
done in good faith within the meaning of this Act when it is in
fact done honestly whether it is done negligently or not.&#148;  I
think good faith under the Factors Act should be interpreted in
the same way.  See M.G. Bridge, supra, at pp. 447-449.
[16] The two statutes have a similar purpose, to facilitate
commercial transactions.  And the contexts in which the good
faith requirement appears in the two statutes are similar.  Under
s. 2(1) of the Factors Act, a mortgagee acting in good faith can
acquire valid security though the mortgagor did not have the
authority to give it.  Under s. 24 of the Sale of Goods Act, a
buyer acting in good faith can acquire good title to goods even
though the seller&#146;s title was defective; and, under s. 25, a
person receiving goods in good faith may acquire good title
though the goods may previously have been sold to or be subject
to a lien in favour of another person.  In other words, both s.
2(1) of the Factors Act and ss. 24 and 25 of the Sale of Goods
Act address circumstances in which a person who does not have
good title to goods may nonetheless give valid title or valid
security to parties acting in good faith and without notice of a
defective title.  Therefore, good faith should not be interpreted
more restrictively under one of these acts than under the other.
[17] If good faith under the Factors Act means acting honestly,
even if negligently, then GMAC is entitled to rely on s. 2(1) to
defeat Patry&#146;s claim.  The evidence shows that GMAC acted
honestly.  Neither Patry nor the trial judge suggested otherwise.
[18] Even if a more expansive meaning of good faith is warranted,
bad faith should only be found if the court can infer from the
surrounding circumstances that the buyer or mortgagee suspected
something was wrong and refrained from asking questions because
it thought any inquiries would reveal a defective title.
Benjamin&#146;s Sale of Goods, 5th ed. (1997), at p. 346 considers
this broader meaning in discussing &#147;good faith&#148; under the
similarly worded English Factors Act of 1889:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The expression &#147;in good faith&#148; is not defined in the 
Act of 1889 but would appear to mean &#147;honestly,&#148; that 
is to say, not fraudulently or dishonestly.  It is 
submitted that negligence or carelessness is not in 
itself sufficient evidence of bad faith and the fact 
that the person dealing with the agent did not behave 
with the prudence to be expected of a reasonable man 
does not mean that he acted in bad faith.  On the other 
hand, negligence or carelessness, when considered in 
connection with the surrounding circumstances, may be 
evidence of bad faith.  But the facts and circumstances 
should then be such as to lead to the inference that 
the disponee must have had a suspicion that there was 
something wrong, and that he refrained from asking 
questions because he thought that further enquiry would 
reveal an irregularity.  [Footnotes excluded.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] Even adopting this broader meaning, the evidence in this
case falls far short of showing that GMAC suspected or should
have suspected Inter-Marine did not have good title to the St.
Tropez.  GMAC did know that Inter-Marine was brokering, and thus
did not own, some boats in its inventory.  But Inter-Marine had
assured GMAC it would only borrow money on the security of boats
it owned.  No evidence was led that Inter-Marine had previously
given security on a boat that it did not own.  And in the
document evidencing the chattel mortgage Inter-Marine warranted
good title to the St. Tropez.  At best, GMAC was aware of one
isolated and unrelated irregularity concerning its financing of
Inter-Marine&#146;s inventory.  That isolated incident did not warrant
further inquiry about the St. Tropez.
[20] And what if GMAC had inquired about title to the St. Tropez?
Presumably it would have been given a copy of the November 2,
1989 purchase agreement, which on its face showed that Inter-
Marine had received the St. Tropez as a trade-in.  To insist, as
Patry submits, that GMAC was obliged to make further inquiries of
Patry himself, goes far beyond what is required to satisfy the
good faith requirement in s. 2(1) of the Factors Act.  Indeed, to
impose this obligation on GMAC would defeat the very purpose of
s. 2(1), which is to permit business to be conducted
expeditiously without extensive and time-consuming inquiries into
title.
[21] I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of
MacKenzie J. and dismiss the action.  GMAC is entitled to its
costs of the trial and the appeal.</pre>
