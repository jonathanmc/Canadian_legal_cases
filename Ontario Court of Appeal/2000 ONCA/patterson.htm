<p>MACPHERSON J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] The applicant, Gary Wayne Gabriel Patterson (“Patterson”),
  applies for bail pending the hearing of his appeal. On May 17, 2000, following
  a two-week trial with a judge and jury, he was convicted of a substantial number
  of offences: attempt to obstruct justice, kidnapping, unlawful confinement,
  procuring, exercising control of a person engaged in prostitution, living off
  the avails of prostitution, uttering a threat to cause bodily harm, two counts
  of uttering a threat to kill, and extortion. On June 21, 2000, Ferrier J. sentenced
  Patterson to a term of seven years imprisonment. Patterson has appealed both
  his conviction and his sentence. </p>
<p>[2] All of the convictions against Patterson relate to offences
  committed against a single complainant.<a href="#1">[1]</a><a name="r1"></a> The
  offences occurred over the course of a week in 1997, and include a horrible
  array of criminal acts. </p>
<p>[3] The application for bail pending the hearing of the appeal
  is brought pursuant to section 679(1) and (3) of the <em>Criminal Code </em>: </p>
<p class="indent">679(1) A judge of the court of appeal may, in accordance with
  this section, release an appellant from custody pending the determination of
  his appeal if, </p>
<p class="indent">(a) in the case of an appeal to the court of appeal against
   conviction, the appellant has given notice of appeal …. </p>
<p class="indent">… </p>
<p class="indent">(3) In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph 1(a) … the
  judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending
  the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that </p>
<p class="indent">(a) the appeal … is
  not frivolous; </p>
<p class="indent">(b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance 
  with the terms of the order; and </p>
<p class="indent">(c) his detention is not necessary in the
    public interest. </p>
<p>(1) The Appeal is not Frivolous </p>
<p>[4] The Crown concedes that the appeal is not frivolous. </p>
<p>(2) The Applicant Will Surrender </p>
<p>[5] The applicant asserts that if he is granted bail pending
  the hearing of his appeal, he will stay in Toronto and surrender into custody
  at the appropriate time before the hearing. There is certainly some strong
  and objective evidence to support his assertion. </p>
<p>[6] First, and importantly, Patterson was on bail for approximately
  30 months while awaiting trial. The conditions of his bail were stringent.
  It appears that Patterson complied with his bail and, crucially, he appeared
  for his trial. </p>
<p>[7] Second, Patterson has deep roots in Toronto. His family,
  including wife, two children and mother, lives here. It is also fair to say
  that Patterson's personal, professional and social lives are centered in Toronto.
  It would not be a light decision to skip bail and leave, perhaps forever, his
  family and Toronto. </p>
<p>[8] Third, Patterson has a large number of supporters (family
  and friends) who are prepared to serve as sureties for him. Together, they
  are prepared to risk almost $300,000 on Patterson's promise not to abscond
  if he is granted bail. The normal expectation would be that a person would
  not do anything to place in jeopardy the substantial funds his family and friends
  are prepared to advance to support him. </p>
<p>[9] Fourth, Patterson is prepared to deposit $50,000 with the
  court as a personal guarantee of his intention to comply with all of the conditions
  of his bail if it is granted. He has already deposited $85,000 with the court
  with respect to bail relating to the charges involving a second complainant
  in Ontario (that trial is scheduled to commence in February 2001). If Patterson
  absconds, he faces the risk of losing $135,000, not an inconsequential amount
  for a man who professes an intention to support his wife and two young daughters. </p>
<p>[10] There are, however, several factors that cause me concern
  about whether Patterson would surrender into custody before the hearing of
  his appeal. </p>
<p>[11] First, Patterson has now been convicted of a series of very
  serious crimes and has begun to serve a seven year term of imprisonment. In
  my view, flight <em>before trial </em> and flight <em>after conviction </em> are
  very different scenarios. Before trial, an accused person might reject flight
  because of the role optimism and hope play in the decision-making process.
  However, once convictions are entered, for a prosperous professional man, successful
  in law and business, and acclaimed as a leader in well-known and respected
  organizations, the reality of lengthy incarceration must be a bitter pill to
  swallow. When optimism and hope recede, thoughts of flight might well advance. </p>
<p>[12] Second, Patterson must know that there is a substantial
  chance that his period of incarceration will increase dramatically in the near
  future. Within months, he faces a trial on a second set of pimping charges
  in Ontario. Also, there is a bench warrant for his arrest in Nevada on similar
  charges. If Patterson is convicted of either or both of these charges, he could
  well be in prison for something in the order 20 years. No matter how strong
  the ties of family, friends and Toronto, the legitimate possibility of prison
  time of this duration might weaken those ties. </p>
<p>[13] Third, Patterson has in the past demonstrated the inclination
  and resourcefulness to lie about his identity. When he was arrested in Nevada
  in a hotel room with one of the Nevada complainants, he was in possession of
  false identification, namely, a Nevada driver's licence and a birth certificate,
  both in the name of Brandon Slate. </p>
<p>[14] Fourth, and of particular importance, Patterson did not
  appear for his trial in Nevada which was set for May 12, 1995. The court record
  on that date records: </p>
<p  class="indent">John Lusk, Esq. present for Richard Wright, Esq. Mr. Lusk
  stated that the defendant was due to arrive in town last night and was going
  to appear. He further stated that he has not heard from him. </p>
<p  class="indent">A bench warrant
    for Patterson's arrest was issued. </p>
<p>[15] In his affidavit in support of his application for bail,
  Patterson states: “I was unaware that there was a warrant for my arrest outstanding
  in Nevada”. Patterson is silent in his affidavit about the events surrounding
  his failure to appear at his trial. I find it difficult to accept that he would
  not have had a conversation with a lawyer who informed the court that “the
  defendant was due to arrive in town last night and was going to appear”. The
  conclusion I reach is that Patterson made a conscious decision not to appear
  for his trial in Nevada. By analogy, I would be concerned that, if bail is
  granted, he might not appear for his appeal in Ontario. </p>
<p>[16] Fifth, Patterson has just been convicted for obstructing
  justice. If he absconded before his appeal, that could amount to an obstruction
  of justice. The spectre of engaging in this type of conduct does not seem to
  have troubled Patterson in the past. </p>
<p>[17] In summary, there are strong points that can be made on
  both sides of the ‘surrender into custody' factor in s. 679 of the <em>Code </em>.
  Although I admit that it is close, in the end the applicant has not persuaded
  me that he will surrender into custody if he is granted bail pending the hearing
  of his appeal. He has some history of lying about his identity (Nevada), of
  failing to appear for a trial (Nevada), and of obstructing justice (Ontario).
  Moreover, the combination of the seven year sentence he has already received
  and the prospect of additional incarceration for two other sets of serious
  charges makes flight a real possibility. </p>
<p>(3) The Public Interest </p>
<p>[18] The public interest factor in s. 679(3) of the <em>Criminal
    Code </em> requires a judge to weigh the values of reviewability and enforceability.
    A particularly useful guide concerning this balancing process is found in
    the judgment of Arbour J.A. in <em>R. v. Farinacci </em> (1993), 86 C.C.C.
    (3d) 32 at 47-48 (Ont. C.A.): </p>
<p class="indent">Section 679(3)(c) of the <em>Criminal Code </em> provides,
  in my opinion, a clear standard against which the correctness of any decision
  granting or denying bail pending appeal can be reviewed. The concerns reflecting
  public interest, as expressed in the case-law, relate both to the protection
  and safety of the public and to the need to maintain a balance between the
  competing dictates of enforceability and reviewability. It is the need to maintain
  that balance which is expressed by reference to the public image of the criminal
  law, or the public confidence in the administration of justice. The “public
  interest” criterion in s. 679(3)(c) of the <em>Code </em> requires a judicial
  assessment of the need to review the conviction leading to imprisonment, in
  which case execution of the sentence may have to be temporarily suspended,
  and the need to respect the general rule of immediate enforceability of judgments.  </p>
<p class="indent">Public confidence in the administration of justice requires
  that judgments be enforced. The public interest may require that a person convicted
  of a very serious offence, particularly a repeat offender who is advancing
  grounds of appeal that are arguable but weak, be denied bail. In such a case,
  the grounds favouring enforceability need not yield to the grounds favouring
  reviewability. </p>
<p class="indent">On the other hand, public confidence in the administration
  of justice requires that judgments be reviewed and that errors, if any, be
  corrected. This is particularly so in the criminal field where liberty is at
  stake. Public confidence would be shaken, in my view, if a youthful first offender,
  sentenced to a few months' imprisonment for a property offence, was compelled
  to serve his or her entire sentence before having an opportunity to challenge
  the conviction on appeal. Assuming that the requirements of s. 679(3)(a) and
  (b) of the <em>Criminal
    Code </em> are met, entitlement to bail is strongest when denial of bail
    would render the appeal nugatory, for all practical purposes. This same principle
    animates the civil law dealing with stays of judgments and orders pending
    appeal. It is a principle which vindicates the value of reviewability. </p>
<p>[19] In my view, the relevant factors relating to the offences
  for which Patterson has been convicted, and the timing and merits of his appeal,
  point strongly towards the conclusion that he not be released on bail pending
  the hearing of his appeal. </p>
<p>[20] First, the offences for which Patterson has been convicted
  are very serious ones and he has received a lengthy prison sentence. In <em>R.
  v. Baltovich </em> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 761 (C.A.), Rosenberg J.A. said, at
  p. 768: </p>
<p class="indent">The public interest ground takes on particular importance in
  cases where an applicant has been convicted of a very serious offence and faces
  the prospect of a lengthy period of incarceration. </p>
<p>[21] <em>Baltovich </em> was a murder case. Patterson has not
  been convicted of murder. However, the number and nature of the offences for
  which he has been convicted, and the downright cruel conduct in which he engaged
  when he committed them, place his offences at the serious end of the spectrum.
  Moreover, a seven year sentence certainly constitutes “a lengthy period of
  incarceration”. </p>
<p>[22] Second, one of the offences for which he was convicted was
  attempt to obstruct justice. The circumstances of this offence were that Patterson
  tried to coerce the complainant into changing her story which had led to criminal
  charges against a fellow pimp. Patterson still faces outstanding pimping charges
  in Ontario (relating to a second complainant) and in Nevada. I have serious
  concerns about what Patterson might attempt to do in relation to these charges
  if he is released on bail. The fact that he was willing to attempt to obstruct
  justice to assist a fellow pimp when he (Patterson) was free makes it reasonable
  to be concerned that he might engage in similar conduct when his own interests
  are at stake and he is already sentenced to a lengthy prison term. </p>
<p>[23] Third, although Patterson's appeal is not frivolous, it
  is not, subject to a qualification I will make in a moment, strong. In <em>Baltovich </em>,
  Rosenberg J.A. said, at p. 768: </p>
<p class="indent">[A]ppellate courts have recognized that, where the grounds of
  appeal are strong and where there is serious concern about the accuracy of
  the verdict, the public interest may well shift in favour of release. </p>
<p>[24] I do not have a serious concern about the accuracy of the
  jury's verdicts in relation to Patterson. However, I should qualify that remark.
  I do not have before me the entire trial record. In the application record
  there is (and I have read) the Notice of Appeal, the jury charge (including
  objections, recharge, jury questions and trial judge's answers) and the trial
  judge's reasons for sentence. I have also heard, and benefitted from, Mr. Gold's
  very able summary of the arguments he will make on the appeal. Based on all
  of this information, it is clear that the word ‘frivolous' does not apply to
  this appeal. However, in my view, the word ‘strong' is not appropriate either.
  It may be that with a full record, a well-crafted factum and comprehensive
  oral argument, the appeal will take on a complexion such that the panel hearing
  it has a “serious concern about the accuracy of the verdict”. All I can say
  is that at this juncture, and on the basis of the record before me, I do not
  have such a concern. </p>
<p>[25] Fourth, in the passage from <em>Farinacci </em> set out
  above, Arbour J.A. said that “entitlement to bail is strongest when denial
  of bail would render the appeal nugatory, for all practical purposes”. That
  is not this case. Patterson has served two months of a seven year sentence.
  This court can hear the appeal very soon, within 90 days of perfection. Indeed,
  I am prepared to order that the appeal be expedited if counsel makes such a
  request. I recognize that other factors, especially the preparation of transcripts,
  can delay the progress of the appeal. However, the trial of this matter took
  only two weeks. I would hope that this factor, coupled with the fact that Patterson
  will continue to be in custody until the hearing of the appeal, would incline
  the court reporter or reporters to give the preparation of the transcripts
  a high priority. </p>
<p>Disposition </p>
<p>[26] The application for bail pending appeal is dismissed. </p>
