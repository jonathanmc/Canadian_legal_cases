    <pre><u><strong>ABELLA J.A. (Dissenting):</strong></u></pre>
    <pre>[1]  During a television interview about her opposition to the
musical Show Boat, Stephnie Payne made what she subsequently
acknowledged to be an anti-Semitic remark.  She apologized
publicly for this statement, but refused to do so to her co-
workers, creating tension in the workplace.
[2]  Eleven months after she made the remark, Ms. Payne was
dismissed from her employment. As a result, she complained to the
Human Rights Commission alleging discrimination on the grounds,
among others, that she was a Black woman.
[3]  The Commission investigated her complaint and decided not to
refer it to a Board of Inquiry for a full hearing.  Ms. Payne
initiated judicial review proceedings of the Commission&#146;s
decision.  In addition, she sought to examine the Registrar of
the Commission extensively about all aspects of her complaint.
This is an appeal by Ms. Payne from a decision of the Divisional
Court upholding a decision of the motions judge that prevented
her from undertaking a wide-ranging examination of the
Commission&#146;s Registrar.</pre>
    <pre><u><strong>Background</strong></u></pre>
    <pre>[4]  Youth Clinical Services Inc. (YCS) is a publicly funded, non-
profit counselling organization serving young people in the Jane-
Finch and surrounding communities in Toronto.  It is managed by
an Executive Director who reports to a volunteer Board of elected
directors.
[5]  Stephnie Payne was hired by YCS in 1987 as a part-time
counsellor, then promoted to Community Outreach Group Worker and
School Group Co-ordinator.  She was also a Trustee for the North
York Board of Education.
[6]  In early 1993, Ms. Payne was active in leading the
opposition to the musical Show Boat, scheduled for the opening of
the North York Centre for the Performing Arts later in the year.
Several of her co-workers at YCS, including the Executive
Director, supported Ms. Payne&#146;s opposition to Show Boat in
principle.
[7]  During a television interview conducted on the premises of
YCS which aired on March 7, 1993, Ms. Payne said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Most of the plays that portray Blacks or any other 
ethnic groups in a negative way is always done by 
a white man, and always usually a Jewish person is 
doing plays to denigrate us.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[8]  These remarks attracted intense public criticism.  The Mayor
of North York called for Ms. Payne&#146;s resignation as a School
Board Trustee, and she was censured by the North York Board of
Education.
[9]  Three days after the television show, fearing the potential
impact of Ms. Payne&#146;s statement on the credibility of YCS, the
Executive Director relieved her of her responsibilities as School
Group Co-ordinator.  She continued in her position as Community
Worker.
[10] At a press conference on March 10, 1993, Ms. Payne issued a
formal public apology, acknowledging that her remarks were anti-
Semitic.  Her apology included the following comments:
          </pre>
    <pre>          My purpose at this Press Conference is to try 
	  to apologize for remarks which I made which 
	  can be correctly characterized as anti-Semitic.  
	  I say &#147;try to apologize&#148; because mere words 
	  cannot fully describe the depth of sorrow I 
	  feel for those hurtful comments.
          </pre>
    <pre>          They are offensive, in particular, to
          members of the Jewish community.  My comments
          are, as well, offensive to members of other
          communities:  to members of the Black
          community, and also to constituents of my
          ward who placed their trust in me when they
          elected me.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I wish to state as clearly as words
          would allow, that such comments are out of
          character with me.  I am, and have been a
          staunch opponent of all forms of negative
          discrimination.  I have worked long and hard
          to help create a better climate of tolerance
          and mutual respect in the community of North
          York, and I hope to be able to continue doing
          so, and with sensitivity, with greater
          sensibility in the future.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Despite requests at YCS that she also apologize personally
to her co-workers, especially those who were Jewish, Ms. Payne
refused either to apologize for, or deny, the veracity of her
comments.
[12] Her refusal to apologize to her YCS colleagues created
palpable and polarizing tensions at YCS.  The situation was
sufficiently serious that the Executive Director sought the
assistance of the YCS Board of Directors.  In a May 4, 1993
report to the Board, he made the following plea:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>There have been rather serious problems in the clinic 
around racism and I would like the Board to discuss 
this issue.  I would also like the Board to consider 
a policy for the clinic which clearly states that 
there is Zero Tolerance to racism and that racism 
will be dealt with by immediate dismissal.  Since the
statement around &#145;Show Boat&#146; there has been a 
polarization among staff that is uncharacteristic of 
The Clinic.  Prior to this statement the clinic seemed 
to function rather well in terms of racial harmony.  
Now it is tense and the voices of reason and moderation 
seem afraid to speak out.  We cannot let this continue.  
We cannot allow racism and/or intolerance in any form
to rear its ugly head in this clinic.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[13] The Board responded by forming a sub-committee to look into
the problem.  It also asked the Executive Director to inform the
employees of its concern.  As a result, in a memorandum dated May
11, 1993, the Executive Director told the staff:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The Board wishes me to convey to all of you that they
understand that morale is low and that your jobs are 
made more difficult by this.  They would also like you 
to understand that your contribution to the clinic is 
valued and that they will do everything possible to deal 
with the situation.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[14] As part of the ongoing effort to deal with the tension
generated by Ms. Payne&#146;s remarks, YCS held a day long anti-racism
workshop at the beginning of June 1993.  The effectiveness of
this session was, according to the Executive Director in a letter
he sent to the Board the next day, inconclusive.
[15] Sometime after this workshop took place, YCS established a
policy to deal with racism, diversity, and discrimination.
[16] In November 1993, a Toronto magazine published an article
about the Show Boat controversy.  While the article noted that
Ms. Payne had support from some members of the Black community,
it also mentioned Ms. Payne&#146;s anti-Semitic comments.  She was
referred to as being employed by YCS as a counsellor.
[17] As a result of this article, six YCS employees, including a
Black employee, wrote to the Executive Director with the
following concerns:
          </pre>
    <pre>          We are concerned that Ms. Payne&#146;s identification 
	  as a counsellor and the continuing close 
	  identification of Ms. Payne with the Clinic, 
	  including making her controversial remarks to
          reporters at the Clinic, undermines Youth 
	  Clinical Services&#146; credibility as a counselling 
	  service provider in the community.  It is crucial 
	  that our counselling staff be seen to be unbiased,
          unprejudiced and open to serving clients of all 
	  ethnic and religious backgrounds.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Given that her controversial views were
          shown as being connected (to) her work at the
          Clinic, and that the community is now being
          led to believe that someone with these views
          occupies a position as a counsellor, it is
          reasonable to assume that members of the
          community who are deeply offended by those
          views will not feel comfortable using our
          counselling services.</pre>
    <pre>They sent a copy of their letter to Ms. Payne.</pre>
    <pre>[18] After receiving this letter, the Executive Director wrote to
the magazine, explaining that Ms. Payne was a Community Outreach
Worker, not a counsellor.  He added:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>I wish to make it clear that counsellors at Youth Clinical
Services have no biases or prejudices that would interfere 
with the provision of services.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] Ms. Payne did not receive a copy of the Executive Director&#146;s
letter to the magazine for about three weeks.  The day after she
received it, however, she requested &#150; and obtained &#150; a meeting
with the Executive Director to complain about not immediately
having received a copy of his letter.
[20] A second meeting took place with the Executive Director on
December 22, 1993.  This time, a Board member was also present.
Ms. Payne complained about what she called the systemic racism
and the poisoned environment she was experiencing at YCS.
[21] Shortly after this second meeting, Ms. Payne filed an
internal complaint of discrimination under the new YCS policy.  A
committee was set up to deal with her complaint, consisting of
both YCS staff and Board members.  The committee met with Ms.
Payne and her representative on January 18, 1994.  At this
meeting, Ms. Payne outlined her concerns, including her feeling
that she was excluded and harassed by the staff.  This was her
only meeting with this committee.
[22] On February 2, 1994, the Executive Director sent a letter to
Ms. Payne telling her that her employment with YCS was
terminated.  She received seven months&#146; severance pay.  At the
time of her dismissal, Ms. Payne had been an employee of YCS for
just under 6 ½ years.
[23] On August 2, 1994, Ms. Payne filed a complaint with the
Ontario Human Rights Commission.  Her complaint was against YCS
and three directors of the YCS Board, including the then Chair
and Vice-chair.  She alleged that systemic discrimination and a
poisoned, racially-charged atmosphere had existed at YCS
throughout the years of her employment.  She also alleged that
she was either subjected to unequal treatment or was terminated
because of race, colour, place of origin, ethnic origin, and/or
sex in violation of the Ontario Human Rights Code, R.S.O. 1990,
c. H19.  Finally, she asserted that she was fired as a reprisal
for filing an internal complaint of discrimination at YCS.
[24] In her complaint, Ms. Payne stated that her anti-Semitic
comments, which she did not deny making, were taken out of
context.  She defined that context in her complaint to the
Commission as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The context of this comment is as follows:  I discussed 
with [the interviewer] the relationship between African 
and Jewish people and the commonality of oppression 
experienced by these groups historically.  I conveyed to 
the interviewer my dismay at the fact that Drabinsky, a 
Jewish White Male, was insistent on the production of 
Show Boat despite the fact that many members of the 
African Canadian community believed Show Boat to 
promulgate racist stereotypes about African people and 
to grossly misrepresent a period of genocide and racist 
oppression of African Americans.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[25] She explained that the &#147;cold shoulder&#148; she received from YCS
staff after her comments caused her &#147;a great deal of stress,
anxiety, loss of sleep, stomach upset and emotional turmoil.&#148;
She attributed this treatment by her co-workers to
discrimination:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; because of my race, colour and ethnic origin 
	  and a specific negative aspect of stereotyping 
	  based on the fact that I am also a Woman.  I 
	  believe that this treatment of me was triggered 
	  as a backlash against me because I attempted to 
	  enforce my human rights as a Black African 
	  Canadian Woman in speaking out publicly against 
	  the anti African racism I believe is inherent in
          the production of Show Boat.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          I further believe that the underlying
          basis of the staff&#146;s continued treatment to
          me, which was actively supported by
          management and at least some members of the
          Board of Directors of Youth Clinical
          Services, Inc., was because of a work
          environment that was poisoned by
          discrimination against Black African Canadian
          employees.</pre>
    <pre>[26] The essence of Ms. Payne&#146;s complaints were summarized by her
as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I believe that my employment was terminated at 
	  Youth Clinical Services, Inc., because I filed 
	  a complaint of discrimination.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I also believe that the termination of
          my employment resulted because of a work
          environment poisoned by anti African Canadian
          systemic racism;  and my involvement in the
          protest to stop anti African racism inherent
          in the production of Show Boat.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I further believe that I was demoted
          because of discriminatory treatment by Youth
          Clinical Services, Inc. because I am a Black
          African Canadian Woman who was seeking to
          enforce her human rights.</pre>
    <pre>[27] As is customary, an officer of the Ontario Human Rights
Commission investigated the complaint and prepared a Case
Analysis Report for use by the Commissioners in deciding whether
to refer the complaint to a Board of Inquiry under s. 36 of the
Ontario Human Rights Code.  In the Report, dated April 4, 1996,
the officer extensively reviewed Ms. Payne&#146;s employment history
with YCS.
[28] Although the April 4, 1996 Case Analysis Report is not
itself the subject of judicial review, its contents are germane
because the Report was reviewed by the Commissioners at a meeting
in September 1996 when the Payne complaint was first discussed.
[29] The officer set out the following three issues as forming
the basis of the Report:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   Does the evidence indicate the existence of
	  systemic racism or a poisoned environment in the
	  workplace?
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   Does the evidence indicate that the
          complainant was subjected to unequal
          treatment or that her employment was
          terminated because of race, colour, place of
          origin, ethnic origin, and/or sex?
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   Does the evidence indicate that the
          complainant was subjected to reprisal?</pre>
    <pre>[30] The Report concluded that the complaint should not be
referred to a Board of Inquiry on Issue 1, but that a referral
was appropriate under Issues 2 and 3.
[31] On the first issue, the Report concluded that &#147;the evidence
does not indicate the existence of systemic racism or a poisoned
environment based on race.&#148;  While the hiring practices of YCS
were found to be &#147;problematic&#148;, the evidence did not indicate the
existence of systemic racism related to staff recruitment.
[32] The Report also found that there was no merit to Ms. Payne&#146;s
allegation of a poisoned environment.  The conclusion on this
issue was that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133;the evidence does not support the existence of a 
poisoned environment for Ms. Payne because of her 
race based on the specific allegations she raised. 
However, it appears that the situation at the 
Clinic was not always healthy for either her or
other staff and conflicts did arise.  There is an 
acknowledgement by staff members of the existence 
of a strained relationship between Ms. Payne and 
many other staff.  However, this was after she 
publicly made a statement which some staff found
discriminatory and other staff found inappropriate.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[33] The officer was, however, far more sympathetic to Ms.
Payne&#146;s grievances about the reaction at YCS to her Show Boat
comments.  He describes her views as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It appears that Ms. Payne&#146;s comment was reflective 
of her belief that African Americans/Canadians have 
been historically disadvantaged and exploited by the 
White male population for economic gains, and she 
wished to bring what she saw as an ongoing 
historical fact to the public&#146;s attention.  The 
comment was made in the context of her role as an 
(unofficial) spokesperson for members of the Black 
community who opposed the production of Show Boat.  
Ms. Payne states that it was never her intention to 
discriminate against the Jewish race or any other
race, but to state a historical fact, which was 
subsequently taken out of context.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[34] After noting the furor caused by her comments, the officer
describes the public reaction as a divided one:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Those reportedly in favour of Ms. Payne&#146;s 
	  statement praised her courage for speaking out 
	  on behalf of the Black community.  Those 
	  opposed to the statement accused her of making 
	  a racist comment against one race under the
	  disguise of defending her own race.  Several
	  articles and opinions about the statement and
	  its impact were published in the printed media
	  over a period of several months.
          </pre>
    <pre>          While there appears to have been support
          for the position that African
          Americans/Canadians, have historically been
          disadvantaged and exploited at the hands of
          the White (European) race; and while there
          appeared to have been support for Ms. Payne&#146;s
          opposition to the production of Show Boat, it
          is not clear if this included support for the
          specific comment she made about white Jewish
          males, although this could be implied.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The Report noted that the remarks caused particular strain
at YCS:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Given the nature of the statement made by Ms.
	  Payne, the nature of the services provided by
	  the Clinic and the Jewish representation on
	  staff, it can be seen how a fallout could
          occur.  Although Ms. Payne made a public apology
	  for the statement, it appears the relationship
	  between her and some staff members did not
 	  improve because she refused to personally
          apologise to them.  In particular, she was asked
	  to apologise to her Jewish colleagues who were
	  particularly offended by the statement, but she
	  allegedly refused to do so.  It appears that
          other staff members isolated Ms. Payne for the
	  sake of their Jewish colleagues and/or because
	  they were concerned about the impact the
	  statement could have on the Clinic&#146;s credibility
	  in the community because of Ms. Payne&#146;s
	  continued association therewith.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Ms. Payne alleges that her race, colour,
          sex, ancestry, place of origin and ethnic
          origin were factors in the treatment she
          experienced at YCS and the subsequent
          decision to dismiss her from employment.  It
          is true that the statement was reflective of
          how she felt her race had been treated
          historically by white men for economic gain.
          Subsequent to the statement, Ms. Payne was
          somewhat isolated by some of her colleagues
          because they perceived her statement as
          racist and anti-semitic.  It is apparent that
          members of the Jewish community, including
          staff at YCS were offended by the statement.</pre>
    <pre>[36] The decision of the Board of Directors to approve Ms.
Payne&#146;s dismissal was, according to the Report, based on the
tension evident at the January 18, 1994 meeting, as well as on
the fact that ongoing efforts at YCS to &#147;redress the problems
occurring since the &#133; remarks&#148;, had been unsuccessful.  Two of
the Board members explained their decision in the Report
separately as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It came down to either having an uprising of
	  staff who were disgruntled that she was there
	  &#133;It showed a lack of sensitivity and staff was
	  saying either she goes or we go.  I think this
	  was particularly highlighted with staff because
 	  she would not back down from her position that
	  white Jewish males consistently put down black
	  people.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Stephnie had not made an active role in
          trying to remedy her relationship with staff
          or apologizing about her comment that she had
          made about Show Boat.  In light of that, we
          knew that the schools would not change their
          thoughts about having her work with them.</pre>
    <pre>[37] The Report recommended, however, that the complaint be
referred to a Board of Inquiry with respect to Issues 2 and 3 &#150;
the termination and the reprisal issues &#150; for the following
reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In order to establish whether the decision to
	  terminate Ms. Payne&#146;s employment amounts to
	  discrimination under the Code, it is important
 	  to consider whether her comment was reflective
	  of the Black Community, which she represented,
	  and if so, whether the respondents appropriately
	  addressed the workplace environment that
	  resulted from the public statement.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In examining whether the statement is
          reflective of the Black Community and whether
          it is based on historical fact, members of
          the Black Community have expressed the view
          that Black people have experienced oppression
          at the hands of the Jewish Community, and
          that the Show Boat is an example of that
          oppression.  For example, one prominent
          member of the Black Community noted that the
          Show Boat book was written by a Jewish person
          (Edner Faber), the musical was written,
          scored and produced by Jewish people (Jerome
          Kern and Oscar Hammerstein), the Toronto
          production was being produced by a Jewish
          person (Garth Drabinsky) and a Jewish
          politician (Mel Lastman) was opening the
          doors of the theatre to the production.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          There has continued to be conflict,
          opposing views, and differing opinions on the
          relationships between the Black Community and
          the White Jewish Community.  Ms. Payne&#146;s
          statement amounts to a serious allegation
          against the White Jewish male and whether
          this allegation is representative of the
          Black Community&#146;s perspective becomes
          important in analyzing whether her statement
          was inappropriate or whether the respondent&#146;s
          response to the issue was inappropriate.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The analysis has already addressed the
          support Ms. Payne received from the Black
          Community, especially from prominent leaders
          in the Community, although some felt that she
          had &#147;inadvertently shifted the spotlight from
          Show Boat to herself and the relations
          between blacks and Jews&#148;.  In this respect,
          it does not appear that her statement was
          seen as inappropriate from the Black
          Community&#146;s perspective;  it was seen as
          historically factual.  The evidence also
          indicates that the statement was offensive to
          the Jewish Community, including some members
          of YCS staff, which resulted in poor
          relations between Ms. Payne and those staff.
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; Ms. Payne&#146;s statement was reflective
          of her belief that members of her own race
          were historically exploited by the white
          male, and that Jewish white males usually
          portrayed her race in a disparaging way as a
          form of entertainment.  In this respect, it
          appears that her race, colour, and ancestry,
          and ethnic origin were the context of her
          statement and thus, factors in the ultimate
          decision to terminate her employment.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In light of the above, while the
          evidence does not indicate that Ms. Payne&#146;s
          sex or place of origin were factors in the
          decision to terminate her, it appears that
          she was subjected to unequal treatment in
          employment and was subsequently terminated
          from employment because of her race, colour,
          ancestry, and ethnic origin. [Emphasis
          added.]</pre>
    <pre>[38] This April 1996 Report was forwarded to both Ms. Payne and
to YCS for their written replies.  These replies, along with the
Report, were given to the Commissioners before the September 10-
11, 1996 meeting, when Ms. Payne&#146;s complaint was first discussed.
[39] According to the minutes of this meeting, the Payne
complaint was &#147;pulled&#148; and no decision about Ms. Payne&#146;s case was
made.  Ms. Payne was informed by letter dated October 2, 1996
that further investigation and analysis were required before a
decision could be made by the Commissioners.
[40] A second Case Analysis Report, dated January 29, 1997, was
prepared and circulated to the parties for reply before the March
1997 Commission meeting.
[41] This second Report agreed with the first that there was no
evidence of systemic discrimination or of a poisoned work
environment.  Unlike the April 1996 Report, however, it found
that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Ms. Payne&#146;s
termination was based on race.  It did recommend that the
complaint be referred to a Board of Inquiry, but only on the
issue of whether Ms. Payne&#146;s dismissal was an act of reprisal for
the complaint of discrimination she initiated internally at YCS.
[42] At its March 18-19, 1997 meeting, pursuant to s. 36 of the
Code, a majority of the Commissioners decided not to refer Ms.
Payne&#146;s complaint to a Board of Inquiry.  The following were the
recorded reasons for the decision of four of the seven
Commissioners present at the meeting (three Commissioners
dissented):
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;[M]oved and seconded that pursuant to
	  Section 36(2) of the Human Rights Code, the
	  Commission decide not to refer the subject
          matter of this complaint to the Board of
	  Inquiry for the following reasons:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   The evidence does not indicate that
          the complainant, when demoted from her
          position as Group Co-ordinator to that of
          Community Worker, was discriminated against
          because of her sex, race, color, ancestry,
          place of origin or ethnic origin.  Rather,
          the evidence indicates that the complainant
          was demoted due to a comment she made, which
          was interpreted as being anti-Semitic.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   The evidence does not indicate that
          systemic racism was present at Youth Clinical
          Services Inc. (hereinafter &#147;YCS&#148;).  Further,
          the evidence indicates that the recruitment
          and promotion practices of YCS did not result
          in an adverse impact or effect upon
          individuals at YCS,  including the
          complainant.
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   There is insufficient evidence to
          indicate that the termination of the
          complainant&#146;s employment was a reprisal for
          having claimed and enforced her rights under
          the Code, as set out in Section 8 thereof.
          </pre>
    <pre>          For the above reasons, the Commission is
          of the view that the evidence in this matter
          does not warrant the referral of the subject
          matter of the complaint to the board of
          inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>[43] In a letter dated March 26, 1997, Ms. Payne was advised of
the Commission&#146;s decision and reasons, and of her right to
request a reconsideration of this decision.
[44] Ms. Payne sought such a reconsideration under s. 37 of the
Code.  As a result of her request, a reconsideration report was
prepared by the Commission.  This report was given to the parties
for their reply in July 1997.
[45] The reconsideration report, the replies from Ms. Payne and
YCS, along with 200 pages of documents, were before the
Commissioners when they decided the reconsideration request on
March 30, 1998.  At this meeting, a majority of the Commissioners
present decided to uphold the original decision not to refer the
complaint to a Board of Inquiry. The reasons recorded in the
minutes of that meeting were:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   The application for reconsideration does
	  not set forth material facts that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  were previously unavailable, and
          are pertinent to the original decision made
          in this matter; or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  indicate that circumstances have
          changed since the Commission&#146;s original
          decision;  or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  raise issues as to the integrity of
          the Commission&#146;s procedures in this matter.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   The Commission remains of the view
          that the complainant was demoted as a result
          of a comment she made, which was interpreted
          as being anti-Semitic;  that the evidence
          does not support the existence of systemic
          racism at YCS;  and that there is
          insufficient evidence to indicate that the
          termination of her employment was a reprisal
          for having claimed and enforced her rights
          under the Code.
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   Accordingly, the application for
          reconsideration fails to raise sufficient
          material facts to permit a reversal of the
          Commission&#146;s original decision.</pre>
    <pre><u><strong>Prior Proceedings</strong></u></pre>
    <pre>[46] On July 9, 1998, Ms. Payne brought an application for
Judicial Review, seeking to quash both the Commission&#146;s original
decision made in March 1997 not to refer her complaint to a Board
of Inquiry, and its subsequent reconsideration decision a year
later.  She also sought an order referring her complaint directly
to a Board of Inquiry or, in the alternative, an order remitting
her complaint back to the Commission for &#147;proper consideration.&#148;
[47] The challenge to the Commission&#146;s original decision was
based on numerous grounds, including the following:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by usurping the
  Board of Inquiry&#146;s function when it determined the issues arising
  from the complaint;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by failing to ask
  itself the proper question, namely, whether there was a
  reasonable evidentiary basis to justify sending Ms. Payne&#146;s
  complaint to a full hearing before a Board of Inquiry;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by weighing the
  evidence;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission failed to provide sufficient reasons for
  its decision;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission denied Ms. Payne fairness by refusing to
  disclose relevant information to her relied on by the
  Commission, by assessing her credibility unfavourably
  without an oral hearing, by interfering in the
  investigation of her complaint, and by its delay in
  dealing with the complaint;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission exceeded its jurisdiction by basing its
  decision on irrelevant or improper considerations, such as
  inadequate resources, the possibility of being accused of
  anti-Semitism, and the loss of its investigative file; and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission erred in failing to find that Ms. Payne&#146;s
  complaint warranted a referral to a Board of Inquiry.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[48] The Commission&#146;s reconsideration decision was challenged for
the same reasons, but with the additional criticisms that:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the Commission improperly exercised its statutory
  reconsideration obligations by applying the wrong legal test, by
  unduly restricting its reconsideration powers, by failing to
  review the full investigative file when it reconsidered its
  original decision by losing its investigative file;  by not
  conducting a sufficient reconsideration investigation;  and by
  considering YCS&#146; judicial review application as part of its
  reconsideration process;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission denied Ms. Payne fairness by failing to give
  Ms. Payne sufficient reasons for the reconsideration decision;
  by refusing to disclose investigation material to Ms. Payne,
  including YCS&#146; response to Ms. Payne&#146;s request for
  reconsideration;  and by its delay.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[49] In support of the application for judicial review, two
affidavits were filed, one from Ms. Payne and one from Professor
Frances Henry.  Neither affidavit had been before the Commission
when it made its two decisions.  Ms. Payne&#146;s 45-page affidavit
outlines her version both of the circumstances underlying her
complaint with YCS and her problematic dealings with the Ontario
Human Rights Commission.  Professor Henry&#146;s affidavit sets out
the indicia for determining whether racism exists in a workplace,
then outlines the arguments in favour of concluding that the
Commission should have referred Ms. Payne&#146;s complaint to a Board
of Inquiry.
[50] On July 10, 1998, a Notice of Examination under Rule 39.03
of the Rules of Civil Procedure was sent by Ms. Payne to the
Registrar of the Ontario Human Rights Commission.  The Registrar
was directed to bring the following material with her to the
examination:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   the Commission&#146;s complete investigation

	  said file(s) or any separate file(s) or records
	  (including draft documents) maintained by the

          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   the Commission&#146;s complete Legal

          Mitchell, Naomi Campbell, Jan Steele, Clinton
          Campbell, Jungle Ling, Soula Dimitrey and
          Youth Clinical Services, Inc., against the
          Ontario Human Rights Commission, being

    <pre>          7.   any and all letters, memos, notes,
          telephone records, documents, draft documents
          or material of any nature whatsoever
          pertaining to the loss of the Commission&#146;s
          investigation file in the matter of the
          Complaint, including any and all documents or
          material pertaining to the ongoing Ombudsman

          Review or any other matter in issue in this
          proceeding maintained by any Commissioner,
          employee or agent of the Commission.</pre>
    <pre>[51] Ms. Payne had already been given the entire record that had
been before the Commissioners when they made the decisions being
judicially reviewed, consisting of the 69 pages from the March
1997 meeting and the 339 pages from the March 30, 1998 meeting.
It was the Commission&#146;s position that Ms. Payne was entitled only
to these materials, as well as relevant portions of the agendas
and minutes of those meetings.
[52] On August 4, 1998, the Commission sent a letter to Ms.
Payne&#146;s counsel, advising that portions of the two affidavits
filed in support of the judicial review application would be
challenged, as would the Registrar&#146;s examination, except for
questions about a temporary loss of the Payne file at the
Commission.
[53] The Commission then brought a motion on August 25, 1998,
seeking to strike portions of Ms. Payne&#146;s affidavit, to have Dr.
Henry&#146;s affidavit removed entirely from the record, and to set
aside the Notice of Examination of its Registrar.
[54] Ms. Payne brought a cross-motion for the production of
documents and for an order directing that the examination of the
Registrar take place.  In support of her cross-motion, Ms. Payne
filed an affidavit sworn on September 22, 1998 by St. Clair
Wharton, a former Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights
Commission, whose term ended in February 1997.
[55] Mr. Wharton was not a Commissioner when either of the
decisions being judicially reviewed were made.  Although he was
not present at either the March, 1997 meeting when the Commission
decided not to refer Ms. Payne&#146;s case to a Board of Inquiry, or
the April, 1998 meeting when it decided not to reverse its
original decision, he was still a Commissioner when Ms. Payne&#146;s
complaint was first discussed at the Commission&#146;s September 1996
meeting.
[56] In his affidavit, he said he had expressed the view at that
September meeting, based on his expertise and on the April 6,
1996 Case Analysis Report, that the complaint should be referred
to a Board of Inquiry.  His recollection of that meeting includes
a discussion he claims was generated by a staff member, about the
potential public reaction to a referral of the complaint to a
Board of Inquiry, given Ms. Payne&#146;s comments.  Mr. Wharton
characterized these comments as ones &#147;alleged to have been anti-
Semitic.&#148;
[57] The result of the discussion in September, as he remembered
it, was that a consensus was reached that the Payne complaint be
referred to a Board of Inquiry, but that the staff be directed to
clarify in writing that the Commission did not condone or support
Ms. Payne&#146;s comments.
[58] The affidavit generally challenges the legitimacy of the
deliberative process of the Commissioners.  Mr. Wharton alleges
that he, and therefore by implication other Commissioners, had no
knowledge or understanding of the test for making their decisions
and could not make up their own minds or reach their own
decisions because of a sense of pressure to defer to the opinions
of the Commission&#146;s legal or investigative staff.
[59] He states that as a result of shrinking resources, fewer
cases were being referred to Boards of Inquiry than earlier in
his tenure, and that sometimes the Commissioners have discussed
whether a particular complaint raises matters of sufficient
public importance to warrant the public expense of a Board of
Inquiry.
[60] Mr. Wharton also attacks the validity of the Commission&#146;s
reasons for deciding not to refer a case to a Board of Inquiry,
saying that the reasons are not drafted by the Commissioners
themselves and do not reflect the entirety of the discussion.
[61] Near the end of his affidavit, Mr. Wharton offers his
opinion about what disclosure should be made to Ms. Payne and
suggests that there must have been collusion between Commission
staff and YCS.
[62] Finally, even though he was not present at either meeting,
and even though earlier in his affidavit he decried the apparent
tendency of Commissioners to follow unquestioningly any staff
recommendations, he is persuaded that this time, the
Commissioners must have considered inappropriate information
since they did not follow the staff&#146;s recommendation.
[63] The motion was heard by Bell J.  Those portions of Ms.
Payne&#146;s affidavit in which she set out her circumstances at YCS
and her problems with the Commission, including the effect on her
of the Commission&#146;s handling of her complaint, were struck.  The
Commission&#146;s motion requesting an order striking Professor
Henry&#146;s affidavit was adjourned, to be heard by the Divisional
Court panel hearing the actual judicial review.
[64] In addition, she granted an order amending the Notice of
Application for Judicial Review to include the following
allegations:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the Commission had previously decided at a meeting held on
  September 10 and 11, 1996 to refer Ms. Payne&#146;s complaint 
  to a Board of Inquiry;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission exhibited bias; and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the Commission&#146;s decisions were not made in accordance
  with s. 15 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>The Commission did not object to these amendments.
</pre>
    <pre>[65] Bell J. noted in her reasons that Ms. Payne was seeking
documentary production of everything related to her case under
Rule 39.03(1).  She disagreed with Ms. Payne&#146;s submission that
the only test under this rule is relevance.  She relied instead
on the test set out in Bettes v. Boeing Canada/de Havilland
Division et al. (1992), 8 Admin. L.R. (2d) 232 (Ont. Div. Ct.),
holding that the right to examine witnesses under Rule 39.03 must
be based not only on relevance, but additionally on a reasonable
evidentiary foundation.
[66] She therefore, with the Commission&#146;s agreement, limited the
scope of the Registrar&#146;s examination to an examination of
documents and answers related to the Commission&#146;s temporary loss
of Ms. Payne&#146;s file, and to documents and answers about the
Commission meeting on September 10 and 11, 1996.
[67] The order permitting an examination in connection with the
September 1996 Commission meeting was based on the allegations
raised in the affidavit of Mr. Wharton.
[68] The Divisional Court dismissed Ms. Payne&#146;s application to
vary or set aside the order of Bell J. restricting the scope of
the Registrar&#146;s examination and striking portions of Ms. Payne&#146;s
affidavit.  Its reasons were:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>We are not persuaded that the order under appeal 
should be interfered with.  Appeal dismissed.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[69] This is an appeal by Ms. Payne from that dismissal.</pre>

    <pre>[70] The issue in this appeal is the scope of Rule 39.03 on an
application for judicial review of a decision of the Ontario
Human Rights Commission not to refer a complaint to a Board of
Inquiry under ss. 36 and 37 of the Ontario Human Rights Code.
Rule 39.03(1) states:          </pre>
    <pre>          39.03(1)  Subject to subrule 39.02(2), a person 
	  may be examined as a witness before the hearing
	  of a pending motion or application for the
	  purpose of having a transcript of his or her
          evidence available for use at the hearing.</pre>
    <pre>[71] At the outset, the importance of the right to pursue a human
rights complaint must be stressed.  But it is worth noting that
the process under the Code does not grant the right to have a
complaint heard by a Board of Inquiry.  Instead, the scheme of
the Code gives a complainant, in most circumstances, the right to
have a complaint investigated.  When the investigation has been
completed, a decision is then made about whether to refer the
complaint to a Board of Inquiry.  Under the Code, this
gatekeeping function is assigned to the Commission.
[72] The section of the Code which articulates the right to have
a complaint investigated is s. 33(1).  Section 34(1) sets out
which complaints need not be investigated:
          </pre>
    <pre>          33.(1)    Subject to section 34, the Commission
	  shall investigate a complaint and endeavour to
	  effect a settlement. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          34.(1)    Where it appears to the Commission that,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  the complaint is one that could or
          should be more appropriately dealt with under
          an Act other than this Act;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  the subject-matter of the complaint
          is trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made in
          bad faith;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (c)  the complaint is not within the
          jurisdiction of the Commission; or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (d)  the facts upon which the complaint
          is based occurred more than six months before
          the complaint was filed, unless the
          Commission is satisfied that the delay was
          incurred in good faith and no substantial
          prejudice will result to any person affected
          by the delay,
          </pre>
    <pre>          the Commission may, in its discretion,
          decide to not deal with the complaint.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  Where the Commission decides to not
          deal with a complaint, it shall advise the
          complainant in writing of the decision and
          the reasons therefor and of the procedure
          under section 37 for having the decision
          reconsidered.</pre>
    <pre>[73] The continuation of a complaint to a Board of Inquiry is
subject to the screening process found in ss. 36 and 37 of the
Code.  These sections state:
          </pre>
    <pre>          36.(1)    Where the Commission does not effect 
	  a settlement of the complaint and it appears
	  to the Commission that the procedure is
	  appropriate and the evidence warrants an inquiry,
          the Commission may refer the subject-matter of
	  the complaint to the board of inquiry. [Emphasis
	  added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  Where the Commission decides not to
          refer the subject-matter of the complaint to
          the board of inquiry, it shall advise the
          complainant and the person complained against
          in writing of the decision and the reasons
          therefor and inform the complainant of the
          procedure under section 37 for having the
          decision reconsidered.
          </pre>
    <pre>          37.(1)    Within a period of fifteen
          days of the date of mailing the decision and
          reasons therefor mentioned in subsection
          34(2) or subsection 36(2), or such longer
          period as the Commission may for special
          reasons allow, a complainant may request the
          Commission to reconsider its decision by
          filing an application for reconsideration
          containing a concise statement of the
          material facts upon which the application is
          based.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  Upon receipt of an application for
          reconsideration the Commission shall as soon
          as is practicable notify the person
          complained against of the application and
          afford the person an opportunity to make
          written submissions with respect thereto
          within such time as the Commission specifies.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (3)  Every decision of the Commission on
          reconsideration together with the reasons
          therefor shall be recorded in writing and
          promptly communicated to the complainant and
          the person complained against and the
          decision shall be final.</pre>
    <pre>[74] It is up to the Commission to determine whether to refer an
investigated complaint to an oral hearing by the Board of
Inquiry.  It is not an automatic right.  It is an exercise of
discretion based on the Commission&#146;s determination that &#147;the
procedure is appropriate and the evidence warrants an inquiry.&#148;
The Commission, in other words, may refer a complaint if it
considers it appropriate to do so and the evidence supports such
a decision, but it is not obliged to do so.
[75] It was the view of counsel for Ms. Payne that although the
Registrar was the focus of the Notice of Examination considered
by Bell J., Rule 39.03 also permits the examination of any
members of the Commission staff who were involved in the
investigation of the Payne complaint or present at the relevant
Commission meetings.
[76] The main jurisprudential foundation upon which the appellant
bases her argument is Canada Metal Co. v. Heap (1975), 7 O.R.
(2d) 185 (Ont. C.A.), which held that if the evidence sought to
be elicited is relevant to the issue on the motion, there is a
prima facie right to resort to Rule 39.03.  The only limit on the
right, aside from the relevance of the evidence sought, is that
it not be an abuse of the process of the court.
[77] The onus, according to the appellant, is on the party
challenging the examination to establish either an absence of
relevance or an abuse of process (see Fort Norman Explorations
Inc. v. McLaughlin (1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 787 (H.C.J.)).  The party
seeking to conduct the examination, therefore, is required to
show only that the proposed examination deals with a relevant
issue and that the person to be examined can offer relevant, as
opposed to helpful, evidence (Transamerica Life insurance Co. of
Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co. (1995), 46 C.P.C. (3d) 110
(Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.)).
[78] Moreover, because the Registrar and other members of the
Commission staff do not have statutory decision-making authority
(unlike the Commissioners), the appellant argues that she has a
prima facie right, based on the foregoing authorities, to examine
Commission staff about issues surrounding the investigation of
the complaint which do not involve the deliberations of the
Commissioners.
[79] The Commission, in response, argues that on judicial review
of a Commission decision, what comes under primary scrutiny is
the record that was before the Commissioners when they made their
decision.  The Judicial Review Procedure Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.
J.1, itself requires that only the &#147;record of the proceedings in
which the decision was made&#148; be filed.  Section 10 of that Act
sets out this obligation:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>10.  When notice of an application for judicial review 
of a decision made in the exercise or purported exercise 
of a statutory power of decision has been served on the 
person making the decision, such person shall forthwith 
file in the court for use on the application, the record 
of the proceedings in which the decision was made.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[80] The test under Rule 39.03 in cases of judicial review, the
Commission therefore argues, is not mere relevance, but requires
as well a reasonable evidentiary foundation.  Moreover, when what
is being sought is information normally protected by the
requirement for deliberative confidentiality, the threshold is
even higher.
[81] In addition, the Commission staff is protected from
discovery by s. 30 of the Ontario Human Rights Code, which
states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          30(1)     No person who is a member of the
	  Commission shall be required to give testimony
	  in a civil suit or any proceeding as to
	  information obtained in the course of an
	  investigation under this Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)  No person who is employed in the
          administration of this Act shall be required
          to give testimony in a civil suit or any
          proceeding other than a proceeding under this
          Act as to information obtained in the course
          of an investigation under this Act.</pre>
    <pre>[82] For the reasons which follow, I agree with the Commission&#146;s
submissions.
[83] Dealing finally with the portions of  Ms. Payne&#146;s affidavit
struck originally by Bell J., it is my view that since the
information in the struck paragraphs was not before the
Commission when it made its decision, the paragraphs were
properly struck.
[84] The Commission relies on the decision of the Divisional
Court in Re Ellis-Don Ltd. v. Ontario Labour Relations Board et
al. (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 56, for the proposition that s. 30 of
the Code immunizes its personnel from an examination under Rule
39.03.  In Ellis-Don, a Rule 39.03 motion was brought for
production of Ontario Labour Relations Board files.  On the
original motion, Steele J., at p. 59, had held that &#147;There is no
independent right of production on judicial review.&#148;
[85] This part of Steele J.&#146;s judgment was not appealed and his
conclusion on the issue of documentary production is, in my view,
conceptually unassailable.  This does not mean that there is no
right to production in cases of judicial review.  It means that,
contrary to the position advanced by the appellant, there is a
heavy onus on the party seeking it to justify production beyond
the usual judicial review record, namely, beyond the material
before the administrative agent or agency when the decision was
made.
[86] Steele J. nonetheless directed that the Labour Board&#146;s
Registrar and other Board members be examined pursuant to Rule
39.03.  This order, which was challenged before the Divisional
Court, was made notwithstanding that s. 111 of the Ontario Labour
Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2, protects all Labour Board
personnel from having to give testimony about work-related
information.  Section 111 states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          111. Except with the consent of the Board, no
	  member of the Board, nor its registrar, nor any
	  of its other officers, nor any of its clerks or
	  servants shall be required to give testimony in
          any civil suit or in any proceeding before the
	  Board or in any proceeding before any other
	  tribunal respecting information obtained in the
	  discharge of their duties or while acting within
          the scope of their employment under this Act.</pre>
    <pre>[87] Steele J. held that this provision could not be used to deny
information going to the issue of natural justice.  In his words,
at p. 62:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Where the denial of natural justice is alleged,
	  the purported violator cannot hide behind procedural
	  legislation to deny the claimant the right to
	  investigate whether or not he has been wronged.</pre>
    <pre>[88] The order directing the examination of the Board personnel
was set aside by the Divisional Court (1994), 110 D.L.R. (4th)
731 (leave to appeal to the Ontario Court of Appeal and leave to
appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada refused (1994), 118 D.L.R.
(4th) vi).
[89] The Divisional Court explicitly rejected Steele J.&#146;s
conclusion that the protection from discovery in s. 111 of the
Labour Relations Act must yield to the requirements of natural
justice.   The Divisional Court defined the purpose of the
immunization in the following way, at p. 741:
          </pre>
    <pre>         &#133; to insulate board officials from the distraction,
	 the expenditure of time, and the potential
	 intimidation associated with testifying about their
	 board-related activities in other legal proceedings. 
	 From this perspective and from the point of view of
	 how the term &#147;testimony&#148; is used in the rules of court,
         s. 111 ought to be given a broad and purposive
	 construction.</pre>
    <pre>[90] In the course of its reasons, the Divisional Court reviewed
cases in which similar provisions were judicially considered.  It
was clear from this review that such statutory shields had the
effect of insulating employees from documentary or viva voce
discovery.  In Cook v. Ip (1985), 22 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (C.A.), aff&#146;d
(1986), 55 O.R. (2d) 288n (S.C.C.), the court held that the
Legislature was entitled to enact provisions prohibiting
employees from being required to give information related to
their work.  Similarly, in Glover v. Minister of National Revenue
(1980), 113 D.L.R. (3d) 161 (Ont. C.A.) at 165, (confirmed on
appeal, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 561) it was held that notwithstanding the
compelling nature of the circumstances, legislatures can enact a
&#147;comprehensive code designed to protect the confidentiality of
all information&#148; obtained by a public or civil servant in the
course of employment.
[91] In Agnew v. Ontario Association of Architects (1987), 64
O.R. (2d) 8 (Div. Ct.), the focus was on a provision of the
Architects Act, 1984, S.O. 1984, c. 12 guaranteeing workplace
confidentiality.  Campbell J. found that the provision protected
members of a Committee under the Act from being examined in
connection with their decision to deny an architect&#146;s licence.
[92] Campbell J. was of the view, as I am, that even without such
explicit insulating provisions, the right of administrative
decision-makers to be presumptively free from discovery should be
similar to that given to judicial decision-makers.  Neither
should be examined unless the party seeking discovery has
satisfied the required onus to &#147;demonstrate that the evidence
sought does not seek to penetrate the mental process&#148; by which
the decision was made (at pp. 13-14).</pre>
    <pre>[93] His subsequent comments at pp. 14, 16 and 17 are
particularly apt in the case before us:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Apart from the practical consideration that
	  tribunal members and judges would spend more
 	  time testifying about their decisions than
 	  making them, their compellability would be
	  inconsistent with any system of finality of
	  decisions.  No decision and a fortiori no
	  record, would be really final until the judge
	  or tribunal member had been cross-examined
	  about his decision.  Instead of review by
	  appeal or extraordinary remedy, a system would
  	  grow up of review by cross-examination. In the
	  case of a specialized tribunal representing
 	  different interests the mischief would be
          even greater because of the process of
	  discussion and compromise among different
 	  points of view would not work if stripped of
	  its confidentiality. [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          The applicant&#146;s counsel says he does not
          propose to delve into the mental processes of
          the members or their decision-making process
          but seeks rather to explore a distinct and
          different area;  whether they considered the
          material that was put before them, whether
          they made their decision on the basis of the
          material before them, whether they each made
          their decision as individuals or deferred to
          the views of someone else, whether they
          prejudged the matter.
          </pre>
    <pre>          I see no distinction or difference
          between questions directed to those matters
          and questions directed to the decision
          process.  The matters sought to be asked are
          at the heart of the decision-making process
          and are directly within the mischief sought
          to be prevented by the rule against
          penetrating the mind of the decision-maker.</pre>
    <pre>[94] Based on the foregoing jurisprudential review, the
Divisional Court in Ellis-Don concluded, at p. 747, that
allegations of breaches of natural justice cannot justify
piercing the statutory protection from discovery found in
provisions like s. 111 of the Ontario Labour Relations Act:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In our opinion, the facts of this case are
	  precisely governed by s. 111.  This provision,
	  which was not present in Tremblay, supra, is
 	  designed to protect deliberative secrecy and
          guard against the chilling effect on the
  	  decision-making process which the potential
	  of compellability to testify would engender.
          A legislature clearly has the jurisdiction to
	  modify the common law requirements of natural
	  justice.  Here, it has specifically and clearly
	  prohibited one way in which a party might seek
	  to establish a breach of natural justice.  An
 	  exception for natural justice cannot reasonably
	  be read into the section without undermining to
	  a substantial degree its central purpose.</pre>
    <pre>[95] The court observed, however, that if it was in error in
concluding that breaches of natural justice create no exception
to such insulating provisions, then the threshold should in any
event be sufficiently high to reflect the public policy
importance of protecting deliberative secrecy.
[96] I agree with the Divisional Court in Ellis-Don that, based
both on the legislative protection from discovery and the need to
protect deliberative confidentiality, allegations of breaches of
natural justice do not automatically open the door to
examinations under Rule 39.03.  There is a high threshold in
cases of judicial review generally, and an even higher one when
there is, in addition, either legislated protection from
discovery or the need to protect deliberative confidentiality.
[97] In my view, the application of these principles to the
circumstances of this case leads to a dismissal of Ms. Payne&#146;s
appeal.  Section 30 of the Ontario Human Rights Code is almost
identical to s. 111 of the Labour Relations Act.  Although the
wording is not identical, in my view the result should be the
same.
[98] Section 30 protects information obtained in the course of an
investigation.  Part IV of the Code deals with the enforcement of
rights.  The first part of Part IV, ss. 32-37, deals exclusively
with the initiation and investigation of a complaint.  The latter
part, ss. 39-45, deals with the hearing before a Board of
Inquiry.  The complaint process in Part IV leads to ss. 36 and
37, where the fruits of any investigation are evaluated by the
Commission to determine whether there should be a Board of
Inquiry.  Since the entire process up to and including that
determination relates to the investigation of a complaint, it
follows that s. 30 protects from discovery of anything or anyone
connected to that investigation or its evaluation, including any
decisions based on such investigations.
[99] Based on the conclusions in Ellis-Don, therefore, s. 30 acts
as a statutory shield and neither the Registrar nor any other
Commission personnel can be compelled to provide further
information under Rule 39.03.
[100]     If I am wrong about s. 30 of the Code acting as a
complete bar to further documentary or testamentary disclosure by
Commission staff, I am nonetheless of the view that there is no
reasonable, reliable, relevant evidence to meet the high
threshold for judicial review proceedings, let alone the higher
one required to violate the confidentiality of the deliberative
process in ordering a Rule 39.03 examination.  In fact, in my
opinion, even if the threshold is simple relevance, there is
virtually no evidence, let alone any relevant evidence, available
to justify a Rule 39.03 examination.
[101]     The foundation for the assertion by Ms. Payne that the
evidence sought through the Rule 39.03 examination is relevant,
is the September 22, 1998 affidavit of former Commissioner St.
Clair Wharton.
[102]     It is, with respect, difficult to understand why or how
Mr. Wharton felt entitled to engage in such an astonishing breach
of his duty to protect the confidentiality of the Commission&#146;s
deliberations, and to so sweepingly assault the Commissioners&#146;
integrity and their capacity for independent decision-making.  He
smears by innuendo the bona fides of the Commission&#146;s staff and
process and, inferentially, the legitimacy of every Commission
decision made during his six year tenure.  It is not at all
surprising that the Commission refused to exacerbate or appear to
condone the impropriety by cross-examining Mr. Wharton.
[103]     There is nothing in the record to indicate whether at
any time in his six years as a Commissioner Mr. Wharton ever
raised these concerns either with fellow Commissioners, the Chief
Commissioners, or Commission staff, or, if he did not, why he
chose to raise them so publicly when he did.
[104]     There is no doubt that Mr. Wharton disagrees with and
is upset by the Commissioners&#146; decision not to refer Ms. Payne&#146;s
complaint to a Board of Inquiry.  This may explain his swearing
the affidavit, but it in no way justifies this extraordinary,
selective breach of his duty to protect the confidentiality of
the Commission&#146;s deliberative process. The Commission, by its
nature, is frequently called upon to deal with highly sensitive
matters of intense public interest.  Not unlike judicial
deliberations, it would totally undermine the required frank
exchange of competing views to render the deliberations routinely
subject to public disclosure by disaffected Commission members or
staff or, for that matter, through Rule 39.03 examinations.
[105]     More importantly, however, the affidavit says nothing
about what happened at the meetings at which the decisions being
judicially reviewed took place.  At its highest, Mr. Wharton&#146;s
affidavit offers conjecture and speculation rather than fact or
evidence.
[106]     First, he suggests that at the September 1996 meeting,
Ms. Payne&#146;s complaint was referred to a Board of Inquiry.  The
minutes of that meeting, however, say that the Payne complaint
was &#147;pulled.&#148;  These minutes were approved by Mr. Wharton.  On
October 2, 1996, a letter was sent to Ms. Payne stating:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Please be advised that after reviewing the
	  investigation report and the submissions made
	  on that report, the Commission is of the view
	  that this matter requires further investigation
	  and analysis, as well as further opportunity
	  for conciliation, before a decision is made
 	  whether to refer the matter of the complaint
          to the Board of Inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>[107]     It is clear that at the time, no one, including Mr.
Wharton, thought the Payne complaint had been referred to a Board
of Inquiry.  Mr. Wharton&#146;s affidavit does no more than give his
&#147;recollection&#148; that a consensus was reached to refer the
complaint to a Board.  This may in fact have been his
recollection, but that does not change the reality of the minutes
he approved, the letter Ms. Payne received, or the fact that
everyone &#150; the parties and the Commission &#150; proceeded in
accordance with the decision reflected in the minutes, namely,
that no final decision had been taken at the September meeting.
[108]     Mr. Wharton also states in his affidavit that at the
September meeting he thinks a staff member mentioned the
potential public reaction to a Board of Inquiry, given Ms.
Payne&#146;s anti-Semitic remark.  The heated public reaction to Ms.
Payne&#146;s comments was referred to in the April 1996 Case Analysis
Report.  Far from being an extraneous consideration, the fact
that the comments generated controversy, both at YCS and in the
public domain, was a central feature of the circumstances
surrounding the complaint and the contents of the April Report.
[109]     As for his observations that the Commission sometimes
discussed cost and strategic decision-making in connection with
Board of Inquiry referrals, three responses come to mind.
Firstly, there is no evidence that these considerations were part
of the decision-making at the March 1997 or April 1998 meeting.
Secondly, there is no evidence that these considerations were
even part of the discussions at the September 1996 meeting.  And
thirdly, there is no evidence that any discussions about cost or
public interest strategies ever led to a Commission decision not
to refer a meritorious complaint to a Board.
[110]     What we are left with in Mr. Wharton&#146;s affidavit,
therefore, is a repetition of conjecture and argument, but no
facts relevant to the arguments advanced in the judicial review
proceeding.  Conjecture does not, by virtue of its repetition,
thereby transform itself from theory into evidence.
[111]     There is, moreover, a more plausible explanation
evident from the record itself for the Commission&#146;s decision in
September 1996 not to proceed with the Payne complaint.  The
Commission&#146;s discussions under s. 36 and s. 37 are based largely
on the Case Analysis Reports reflecting the results of the
staff&#146;s investigation of a complaint.  The April 4, 1996 Report
reviewed by the Commissioners at the September meeting is so
analytically aberrant in parts, that the Commission&#146;s inability
to make a decision is transparently explicable.
[112]     The Report concluded that since Ms. Payne&#146;s comments
were &#147;reflective of the Black community&#146;s views about white
Jewish males&#148;, her race, colour and ethnic origins were factors
in the poor relationship she had with her Jewish co-workers at
YCS.  This conclusion appears to flow from the application of
what is, with respect, a completely novel test for determining
discrimination under the Code.
[113]     The proposition that behaviour or language by a member
of a minority, however offensive, attracts the protection of the
Ontario Human Rights Code if it is supported by other members of
the same minority, is, to say the least, bizarre.  Not
surprisingly, I have been unable to find support for this
proposition in any reported Canadian case.
[114]     The Report&#146;s conclusion about whether Ms. Payne&#146;s
dismissal represented an act of reprisal is also difficult to
follow.  In concluding that Ms. Payne&#146;s dismissal was based on
her race, colour and ethnic origins, the Report observed that
&#147;the evidence does not indicate that YCS made sufficient attempts
to resolve the resulting conflicts at the workplace before
deciding to dismiss Ms. Payne from employment.&#148;  Yet in dealing
with Ms. Payne&#146;s allegations of reprisal, the officer observes:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; Her dismissal came about after it appeared
	  to the Executive Director that her complaint
	  could not be adequately addressed, and that
	  her relationship with staff would not improve
          as long as the issue of her public statement
	  and its impact on staff was not resolved.  It
  	  appears that YCS took appropriate steps to
	  attempt to address the strained staff
	  relationship, to the point of developing and
	  implementing a Discrimination Policy. However,
	  this alone did not resolve the issue and YCS
	  avoided addressing the issue further by
	  dismissing Ms. Payne from employment.  This
 	  action appears to be contrary to the spirit of
          the Code which guarantees the rights of
	  individuals to address concerns of
	  discrimination without fear of reprisal.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In summary, the evidence indicates that
          Ms. Payne filed an internal complaint of
          harassment in accordance with YCS&#146; policy,
          and met with a committee to discuss how her
          complaint could be resolved.  Two weeks
          later, she was terminated from her employment
          on the basis that she was not willing to
          resolve the conflict between her and staff
          members, so it was best to let her go.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[115]     These observations represent inconsistent findings.  It
cannot reasonably be the case that on the one hand YCS took
&#147;appropriate steps&#148; to address the problem created by Ms. Payne&#146;s
remarks and refusal to apologize, but on the other hand was
liable for not continuing to take these steps indefinitely until
the issue was fully resolved.  It is difficult to understand why
Ms. Payne&#146;s dismissal two weeks after an unsuccessful attempt to
resolve her internal complaint was found to be the determinative
timeframe for concluding that insufficient efforts had been made
by YCS, rather than the eleven previous months of ongoing
attempts to resolve the situation.
[116]     Accordingly, there was, in my view, ample justification
on the record for the Commission to defer its decision in
September until it had the benefit of a more rigorous Report.
There is no basis for attributing anything sinister to this
obvious, and obviously responsible, request by the Commission for
a new Case Analysis Report and further investigation.
[117]     There is, in short, no evidence to suggest any
impropriety in the deliberations that led the Commission to
conclude, as its reasons stated, that it was not Ms. Payne&#146;s
race, but her anti-Semitic comments which led to her demotion,
that there was no systemic discrimination at YCS, that her
termination was not an act of reprisal, and that, therefore, the
evidence did not warrant a referral to a Board of Inquiry.
Accordingly, there is no foundation for a Rule 39.03 examination.
[118]     Ms. Payne seems to suggest that there is something
suspicious in the refusal of a majority of the Commissioners to
follow the recommendation in the two Case Analysis Reports that
her complaint be referred to a Board of Inquiry.  At the same
time, she speculates that the Commissioners&#146; negative decision
may have been the result of the presence at the two meetings of
Commission staff whose comments might have tainted the
Commissioners&#146; judgment.  These are, at heart, inconsistent
conclusions.  On the one hand, Ms. Payne criticizes the
Commission&#146;s independence in not following the staff&#146;s
recommendation;  on the other hand, she asserts that the
Commission was overly influenced by comments from staff.
[119]     The statutory duty to decide whether to refer a
complaint to a Board of Inquiry is assigned by s. 36 of the Code
to the Commission.  The fact that a staff member &#150; either in
person or through a report &#150; recommends one course of action and
the Commissioners decide on another, is, by itself, arguably more
reflective of the proper interplay between discrete and
independent institutional functions within the Commission than of
a tainted decision-making process.
[120]     The staff, who are responsible for investigating
complaints, are not discouraged from offering their opinions at
Commission meetings.  This, it seems to me, is a salutary part of
informed decision-making.  So is the Commission&#146;s ultimate duty
to make a decision regardless of these opinions.  It may be that
a consensus regularly emerges between staff opinions and the
Commissioners&#146; decisions, but this should be no more surprising
among people who share the same statutory and policy expertise
than is the occasional difference of opinion.
[121]     Nor can it be said that there is anything inappropriate
in having the staff participate in discussions about cases.  In
Consolidated-Bathurst Packaging Ltd. v. International Woodworkers
of America, Local 2-69 (1990), 68 D.L.R. (4th) 524, the Supreme
Court of Canada held that discussions with persons who do not
have decision-making responsibility in a particular case, do not
automatically pollute the final decision.  As Gonthier J. stated,
at p. 561:
          </pre>
    <pre>         &#133; discussions with colleagues do not constitute,
	 in and of themselves, infringements on the panel
	 members&#146; capacity to decide the issues at stake
	 independently.  A discussion does not prevent a
	 decision-maker from adjudicating in accordance
	 with his own conscience and opinions nor does it
	 constitute an obstacle to this freedom.  Whatever
	 discussion may take place, the ultimate decision
	 will be that of the decision-maker for which he
	 assumes full responsibility.</pre>
    <pre>[122]     The spectre of impropriety is not raised by the
presence and participation of staff members.  There is no
evidence that any member of the staff made inappropriate comments
at the relevant meetings, made comments that were not based on
information contained in the Reports, or made any comments that
unduly influenced or interfered with the Commission&#146;s ability to
make up its own mind based on relevant and appropriate factors.
[123]     I cannot accept the submission that the Commissioners
should be presumed collectively to be so completely weak and
vulnerable to the importunings of staff that the presence of
staff impairs their capacity for independent decision-making, or
that any decision diverging from a staff recommendation reflects
the application of inappropriate considerations.  Yet this is in
essence what the appellant is arguing:  by looking at the result
in this case, we are invited, in the absence of evidence, to
conclude that something sufficiently improper has taken place to
invoke the otherwise uninvocable Rule 39.03.
[124]     In my view, the appellant&#146;s proposed Rule 39.03
examination is essentially, like the circumstances in Agnew,
supra, an attempt through examinations of the Commission
Registrar and staff to ascertain how the deliberative process
worked in this case.  It is, with respect, difficult to see this
as anything other than a fishing expedition (Canada Metal, supra;
Bettes, supra).
[125]     A Rule 39.03 examination is not justified in the
circumstances of this case.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal
from the Divisional Court without costs.


<strong>Released:  &#147;RSA&#148; &#147;May 09 2000&#148;</strong></pre>
    <pre>                                               &#147;R.S. Abella J.A.&#148;</pre>
    <pre><strong>SHARPE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[126]      I  have  had the advantage of reading the  reasons  of
Abella  J.A.  I agree with my learned colleague that  the  appeal
from  the  decision  of  the Divisional  Court  striking  certain
portions  of  the  appellant&#146;s  affidavit  should  be  dismissed.
However,  I  respectfully disagree with the  conclusion  she  has
reached  as  to  the  main  issue in  this  appeal,  namely,  the
propriety  of the appellant&#146;s proposed examination of  a  witness
pursuant  to Rule 39.03.  As I take a different view as  to  what
facts are pertinent to this appeal and as I differ to some extent
as well with respect to the characterization of the issue raised,
I  find  it  necessary  to provide my own brief  account  of  the
background.</pre>
    <pre><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></pre>
    <pre>[127]      The  appellant  made  a complaint  to  the  respondent
Ontario Human Rights Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) alleging  that
she  had  been the victim of discrimination at the hands  of  her
employer.   The Commission staff investigated her  complaint.   A
report of the investigation recommended that the Commission refer
the  appellant&#146;s complaint to a board of inquiry.  The matter was
considered at three meetings of the Commission.  In the end,  the
Commission decided not to request the minister to appoint a board
of inquiry and, in effect, dismissed the appellant&#146;s complaint.
[128]     The appellant brought an application for judicial
review, challenging the decision dismissing her complaint on the
grounds, inter alia, that it was made on inappropriate grounds
and that she had been denied procedural fairness.  The appellant
filed the affidavit of a former member of the Commission who had
been present at the first of the three meetings at which the
appellant&#146;s complaint had been considered.  The former member
swore that when the complaint was considered, Commission staff
members made recommendations to the Commissioners that the
complaint not be referred to a board of inquiry based on facts or
considerations that ought not to have been taken into account by
the Commission.  The statements or recommendations of the
Commission staff were not revealed in the record filed by the
Commission for the judicial review application.
[129]     The principal issue on this appeal is whether the
appellant is entitled to full disclosure and production of all
facts, arguments and considerations that were presented to the
Commission when it considered her complaints.</pre>
    <pre><strong>FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[130]      The appellant is a black, African-Canadian woman  born
in   Barbados.   She  complains  that  she  is  the   victim   of
discrimination on grounds of both race and gender at the hands of
her  former employer, Youth Clinical Services Inc., a government-
funded  organization, the mission of which is &#147;to provide  mental
and  medical  heath care to adolescents, young adults  and  their
families;  specifically in the areas of psychosocial counselling,
family  planning  and  prevention.&#148;  The appellant  also  alleged
reprisal in connection with the termination of her employment  as
well  as  systemic discrimination and a poisoned work environment
in relation to a prior demotion.
[131]     In her professional life, the appellant has devoted
herself to community work.  She was actively involved in
organizing opposition to the theatrical production of the musical
Show Boat in Toronto in 1993.  At that time, she was a member of
the North York Board of Education.  She believed that Show Boat
portrayed Blacks in a negative way.  In connection with her
activities opposing Show Boat, the appellant made the following
statement during an interview with a journalist:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Most of the plays that portray Blacks or any other 
ethnic groups in a negative way is [sic] always 
done by a White man, and always usually a Jewish 
person, is doing plays to denigrate us.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[132]       Within  a  few  days,  the  appellant  held  a  press
conference  and apologized for the anti-Semitic remarks  she  had
made.   The  appellant was demoted and eleven months  later,  her
employment  was terminated, and her complaints to the  Commission
followed.
[133]     I pause here to make the following observation.  The
application for judicial review has yet to be heard by the
Divisional Court.  As this matter arises by way of judicial
review, and in light of the specific procedural issue that is
raised on this appeal, neither party made submissions before this
court as to the merits of the appellant&#146;s complaints that she has
been the victim of discrimination.  In these circumstances, I
find it neither necessary nor appropriate to consider the merits
of the appellant&#146;s complaint of discrimination.  The issue of
whether there are grounds for judicial review of the decision of
the Commissioners not to refer the complaint to a board of
inquiry should be conducted in the usual course by the Divisional
Court after appropriate submissions have been made. It is
particularly important to postpone judgment as the very matter
that brings the parties before this court is whether a proper
record disclosing all relevant factors has been presented.  The
question on this appeal is whether the appellant is entitled to
have production of a fuller record of what transpired before the
Commission.  Until that issue has been resolved, it would be
premature to express any view as to the merits of her application
for judicial review.
[134]     The appellant filed a complaint with the Commission
dated August 2, 1994.  The appellant&#146;s complaints were
investigated by the Commission staff and a Case Analysis Report
was prepared.  The Case Analysis Report, dated April 4, 1996,
recommended that her complaints of racial discrimination and
reprisal in relation to her termination be referred a board of
inquiry for a hearing.  The appellant was advised of that
recommendation.  The appellant and her former employer were
provided with a copy of the Case Analysis Report and each made
submissions to the Commission.  The case was considered at a
meeting of the Commission held on September 10 and 11, 1996.
There is some dispute as to precisely what transpired at that
meeting. According to the formal minutes prepared by the
Commission, the complaint was &#147;pulled&#148;.  According to the
affidavit of St. Clair Wharton, who was present at the meeting as
a member of the Commission, there was a consensus that the
appellant&#146;s complaint should be sent to a board of inquiry, but
that certain matters had to be clarified.
[135]     On October 2, 1996, the appellant was advised by the
Commission staff that further investigation and analysis were
required as well as further opportunity for possible
reconciliation before a decision was made whether to refer the
matter to a board of inquiry. A second Case Analysis Report,
dated January 29, 1997, was prepared. It recommended referral to
a board of inquiry for a hearing of the appellant&#146;s complaint of
reprisal.  The appellant&#146;s complaint was considered by the
Commission at its meeting of March 18 and 19, 1997. The
Commission decided, by a majority of four to three, to reject the
recommendations of the Case Analysis Reports and not to refer the
complaint to a board of inquiry.  In its reasons, the Commission
stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   The evidence does not indicate that the
	  complainant, when demoted from her position as
	  Group Co-ordinator to that of Community Worker,
	  was discriminated against because of her sex,
          race, color, ancestry, place of origin or ethnic
	  origin.  Rather, the evidence indicates that the
 	  complainant was demoted due to a comment she made,
 	  which was interpreted as being anti-Semitic.</pre>
    <pre>          2.   The evidence does not indicate that systemic
	  racism was present at Youth Clinical Services Inc.
	  (hereinafter &#147;YCS&#148;).  Further, the evidence
	  indicates that the recruitment and promotion
	  practices of YCS did not result in an adverse
	  impact or effect upon individuals at YCS, including
	  the complainant.          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   There is insufficient evidence to indicate
	  that the termination of the complainant&#146;s employment
	  was a reprisal for having claimed and enforced her
 	  rights under the Code, as set out in section 8 thereof.</pre>
    <pre>[136]      The  appellant was advised of that  decision  and,  on
April  9,  1997, she requested reconsideration of that  decision.
Just  over  one year later, on April 16, 1998, the appellant  was
informed that the Commission had upheld its earlier decision  not
to  refer  the  complaint  to a board of  inquiry.  It  gave  the
following reasons:</pre>
    <pre>            1.  The application for reconsideration does
	        not set forth material facts that:          </pre>
    <pre>               (a) were previously unavailable, and are
                   pertinent to the original decision
		   made in this matter; or

               (b) indicate that circumstances have
                   changed since the Commission&#146;s
                   original decision; or

               (c) raise issues as to the integrity of
                   the Commission&#146;s  procedures in this
                   matter.</pre>
    <pre>[137]     On July 9, 1998, the appellant commenced an application
for  judicial review of the decision of March 24, 1997,  refusing
to refer the complaints to a board of inquiry and of the decision
of  April 15, 1998, declining the request for reconsideration  of
the earlier decision. The application for judicial review alleges
a wide variety of grounds, including the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>         1. That the Commission exceeded its
	    jurisdiction and usurped the role of the
	    board of inquiry by asking itself the
	    wrong question, by weighing the evidence,
	    and by basing its decision upon
	    irrelevant considerations including lack
	    of adequate funding, an unfounded concern
	    about being accused of anti-Semitism, and
	    the loss of its own investigative file;          </pre>
    <pre>         2. That the Commission failed to provide
            sufficient reasons;          </pre>
    <pre>         3. That the Commission denied the appellant
            fairness by failing to disclose relevant
            evidence and material or information
            relied upon or considered by the
            Commission.</pre>
    <pre>[138]      On  July  10, 1998, the appellant&#146;s counsel  served  a
Notice of Examination on the Commission&#146;s registrar, pursuant  to
Rule  39.03, requiring the registrar to attend an examination  to
answer  questions  and, in effect, make full  production  of  all
documents  in  the possession of the Commission  related  to  the
appellant&#146;s  complaints.  The scope of the  proposed  examination
and  documentary  production was broad. The appellant  asked  for
production  of  the  entirety  of  the  Commission&#146;s  files   and
disclosure of all communications between Commission staff and the
members   of   the  Commission  who  considered  the  appellant&#146;s
complaint.
[139]     It would appear that no immediate steps were taken to
enforce the Notice of Examination.  However, after the
Commission&#146;s record was filed, the Commission moved to set aside
the Notice of Examination and to strike from the record affidavit
material advanced by the appellant that was not before the
Commission when it considered the complaint. The appellant
brought a cross-motion to enforce the Notice of Examination.
[140]     In support of her cross-motion, the appellant filed the
affidavit of St. Clair Wharton.  Mr. Wharton served as a
Commissioner of the Commission for six years from February 1991
to February 1997. Based on this experience, Wharton provided a
detailed account of the Commission&#146;s practices and procedures.
He explained that when a complaint is made, the Commission opens
an investigation file.  Commission staff collect and record
information relating to the complaint.  After the complaint has
been investigated, the staff prepare a Case Analysis Report,
which summarizes the evidence that has been gathered, comments on
the sufficiency of the evidence, and recommends whether or not
the Commission should request that the matter be referred to a
board of inquiry.  The Case Analysis Report is disclosed to the
parties who are entitled to make submissions in writing to the
Commission before it decides how to dispose of the complaint.
[141]     Before the matter is presented to the Commission
members, a senior management meeting is held to review the file.
Recommendations made by the staff in the Case Analysis Report may
be over-ridden by senior management, in which case the Commission
would be presented with a different recommendation.  The
conclusions reached at this senior management meeting are then
shared with the Chief Commissioner at what is called a &#147;brief the
chief&#148; meeting.
[142]     Members of senior management and other Commission staff
attend the Commission meeting where decisions are made.  Wharton
deposes that senior managers and other staff members freely offer
their views and opinions at Commission meetings.  These views and
comments, which are expressed orally to the Commissioners, are
not disclosed to the parties.  Wharton deposes that the comments
and views expressed by members of the Legal Services Branch
during Commission meetings are particularly persuasive even on
non-legal points.  He states as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I believe that the extent of involvement of Commission 
staff in the decision-making process of the 
Commissioners, in the context of the institutional 
practices and systemic pressures described in this 
affidavit, impeded my ability and the ability of other
Commissioners to make up our own minds and reach our 
own decisions.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[143]      Wharton deposes that factors other than the merits  of
the  particular complaint of discrimination were often taken into
account in determining whether or not to refer a complaint  to  a
board of inquiry:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I understood that even though the evidence in the case 
might show a violation of the Code and even if the 
Commissioners were of the view that the case was 
&#147;winnable&#148; at a board of inquiry hearing, the 
Commissioners nonetheless should not refer the case to
a board of inquiry hearing unless the case was 
&#147;strategic&#148;. In considering whether a case was 
&#147;strategic&#148;, the Commissioners would consider whether 
the case would have a big impact or raise systemic 
issues, while considering the Commission&#146;s limited
financial resources.  It is my view that introducing
consideration of whether a case was both &#147;strategic&#148; 
is a factor in the Commissioners&#146; decision-making was 
used by the Commission as a means of referring less 
cases to the board of inquiry for hearings.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[144]      Wharton  states that the Commissioners did  not  draft
reasons  for  decisions  but rather that the  reasons  were  pre-
drafted  by  the legal staff and that standard forms  were  used.
He  identifies certain standard phrases in the reasons  given  to
the  appellant  for refusing to reconsider the original  decision
not  to  refer  her complaint to a board of inquiry  specifically
deposes as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In my experience as a Commissioner, the reasons created 
by Commission staff which we were asked to endorse 
rarely reflected the actual discussion that took place 
during the Commission meetings or the true substance of 
the Commissioners&#146; reasons for their decision.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[145]      Mr. Wharton was present when the appellant&#146;s complaint
was  first considered by the Commission on September 10  and  11,
1996.   He  states  that  he specifically recalls  the  complaint
because  of  his  experience in race cases  and  because  of  the
recommendation in the Case Analysis Report that the complaint  be
referred  to  a  board  of  inquiry.  He provides  the  following
account of the discussion at the meeting:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>At the meeting I recall that some Commission staff 
voiced the concern that if the Commission sent the 
complaint to a board of inquiry the Commission might 
be viewed as supporting an alleged anti-Semitic 
comment.  The source of the staff concern was a
comment made by Stephnie Payne which was alleged to 
have been anti-Semitic and the discussion surrounding 
that comment which was contained in a written report 
disclosed to the parties.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[146]      It  is  his recollection that: &#147;[a]s a result  of  the
concern expressed by staff, the Commissioners directed the  staff
to  clarify,  by  way  of writing, that the  Commission  did  not
condone  or  support the anti-Semitic comment that  was  made  by
Stephnie Payne.&#148;  Wharton states that the letter addressed to the
appellant  dated October 2, 1996 indicating that  the  Commission
was  of the view that the matter required: &#147;further investigation
and  analysis&#148;  does  not  reflect the  direction  given  by  the
Commissioners to the Commission staff at the September 10 and  11
meeting.  It is his recollection that there was a consensus  that
the matter should go to a board of inquiry but that the staff was
directed to clarify that this did not indicate the Commissioners&#146;
support for the comments the appellant had made.
[147]     Although he was not at the subsequent meetings of the
Commission, he has examined the record prepared by the Commission
and deposes that it does not include all of the material
contained in the Commission files nor does it record any of the
comments that would typically be made at the meetings.  Based
upon his recollection, a decision taken by the Commissioners on
September 10 and 11, 1996 and based upon his experience of six
years as a Commissioner, Wharton deposes that as the Commission
dismissed the appellant&#146;s complaint despite the recommendations
in the Case Analysis Report that a board of inquiry be appointed:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>[I]t is my view that there is a legitimate basis for 
concern that at least some of the Commissioners 
involved in making the negative decisions could have 
relied on information not contained in the Commission 
package.  Only complete disclosure of the Commission&#146;s 
files and of information as to what was said by staff 
during the various meetings of the Commission&#146;s 
proceedings would shed light on whether or not this 
occurred and if occurred, what was the nature of the 
information that was relied on.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>He further states:
          </pre>
    <pre>        [T]he reasons offered by the Commission do not
        shed any light or any meaningful light as to why the
        Commissioners arrived at a negative decision.  Complete
        disclosure of the file and what was said by staff at
        the Commission meetings would shed light on why the
        complaint&#146;s rights were brought to an end.</pre>
    <pre>[148]      The Commission did not object to the admissibility  or
use  of  Mr.  Wharton&#146;s  affidavit  in  these  proceedings.   The
Commission  chose  not  to  cross-examine  Mr.  Wharton  on   his
affidavit.  Nor  did  the Commission introduce  any  evidence  to
contradict the facts deposed to by Mr. Wharton.  As Mr. Wharton&#146;s
evidence   has   been  admitted  and  stands   unchallenged   and
uncontradicted, I can see no basis in law to refuse to accept  at
face  value  his  account of the Commission&#146;s  practices  or  his
account of the treatment accorded the appellant&#146;s complaint.  Nor
do  I  see any reason to doubt the reason he offers for affirming
an  affidavit  in  these  proceedings:  &#147;&#133;as  a  Commissioner,  I
understood that I had a public duty to ensure that all complaints
that  come before me during my tenure as Commissioner were  dealt
with fairly.&#148;
[149]     The Commission&#146;s motion was allowed in part.  The
motions judge, Bell J., struck out extensive portions of the
appellant&#146;s affidavit filed in support of her application for
judicial review in which she set out at some length her own
version of the facts giving rise to her complaints. The motions
judge adjourned for determination by the panel hearing the
application for judicial review the motion to strike out the
affidavit of an anthropologist and expert in race relations,
alleged by the appellant to relate to the jurisdiction of the
Commission.  The appellant&#146;s cross-motion was allowed in part
only.  The Commission did not resist the appellant&#146;s right to
examine the Registrar with respect to the loss of the appellant&#146;s
file.  The motions judge ruled that the Wharton affidavit
provided an adequate basis to allow the appellant to examine the
Registrar regarding the meeting of September 10 and 11, 1996 and
to production of the documents provided to the Commissioners for
that meeting.  The motions judge ruled, however, that there was
not a sufficient evidential basis to warrant any order with
respect to the other meetings. The appellant&#146;s motion to have the
matter reconsidered by a full panel of the Divisional Court was
dismissed.</pre>
    <pre><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>(a)  Statutory Framework</strong></pre>
    <pre>[150]      To  assess  whether the appellant is entitled  to  the
production of further information relating to the manner in which
her  complaint was dealt with by the Commission, it is  necessary
to  review,  at the outset, the statutory framework within  which
the  Commission  carries out its important  mandate.   The  Human
Rights  Code, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19, s. 33 requires the Commission
to   &#147;investigate  a  complaint  and  endeavour   to   effect   a
settlement.&#148;  Investigations are to be conducted by a  member  or
employee  of the Commission.  The Code provides for  a  board  of
inquiry  to hear and determine complaints that cannot be resolved
by  way  of settlement and that are referred to the board by  the
Commission.
[151]     The decision-making powers of the Commission in
relation to complaints are defined in ss. 34 and 36. Section 34
sets out the circumstances in which the Commission may decide not
to deal with a complaint:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(1)  Where it appears to the Commission that,</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a) the complaint is one that could or
    should be more appropriately dealt
    with under an Act other than this Act;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(b) the subject-matter of the complaint is
    trivial, frivolous, vexatious or made
    in bad faith;</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(c) the complaint is not within the
    jurisdiction of the Commission; or</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(d) the facts upon which the complaint is
    based occurred more than six months
    before the complaint was filed, unless
    the Commission is satisfied that the
    delay was incurred in good faith and no
    substantial prejudice will result to
    any person affected by the delay,</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>the Commission may, in its discretion, decide to not
deal with the complaint.</pre>
      <pre>(2) Where the Commission decides to not deal with a
complaint, it shall advise the complainant in writing
of the decision and the reasons therefor and of the 
procedure under section 37 for having the decision 
reconsidered. 1981, c. 53, s. 33.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[152]      Section  36 deals with the power of the Commission  to
refer or not refer a complaint to a board of inquiry:</pre>
    <pre>          (1)     Where the Commission fails to effect 
	  a settlement of the complaint and it appears
	  to the Commission that the procedure is
          appropriate and the evidence warrants an
	  inquiry, the Commission may request the
	  Minister to appoint a board of inquiry
          and refer the subject-matter of the complaint
	  to the board.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)    Where  the   Commission decides to not
          request  the Minister to appoint a  board  of
          inquiry, it shall advise the complainant  and
          the  person complained against in writing  of
          the  decision  and the reasons  therefor  and
          inform the complainant of the procedure under
          section    37   for   having   the   decision
          reconsidered. 1981, c. 53, s.35.</pre>
    <pre>[153]      Where  the  Commission  decides  not  to  request  the
appointment  of  a board of inquiry, s. 37 gives the  complainant
the right to apply for reconsideration:
          </pre>
    <pre>          (1)    Within a period of fifteen days of the
	  date of mailing the decision and reasons
 	  therefor mentioned in subsection 34 (2) or
	  subsection 36 (2), or such longer period as the
  	  Commission may for special reasons allow, a
	  complainant may request the Commission to
 	  reconsider its decision by filing an application
          for reconsideration containing a concise statement
	  of the material facts upon which the application
 	  is based.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)    Upon  receipt of  an  application  for
          reconsideration the Commission shall as  soon
          as   is   practicable   notify   the   person
          complained  against  of the  application  and
          afford  the  person  an opportunity  to  make
          written   submissions  with  respect  thereto
          within such time as the Commission specifies.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (3)  Every decision of the Commission on
          reconsideration  together  with  the  reasons
          therefor  shall  be recorded in  writing  and
          promptly communicated to the complainant  and
          the   person  complained  against   and   the
          decision shall be final.  1981, c. 53, s. 36.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(b)  Role of the Human Rights Commission</strong></pre>
    <pre>[154]      When considering the Code, the powers it confers,  and
the  practices  and  procedures  that  are  appropriate,  it   is
important  to  bear  in mind the nature and significance  of  the
Commission&#146;s responsibilities.  The rights conferred by the  Code
&#147;are   fundamental,  quasi-constitutional  rights  which   embody
fundamental  values of public policy&#148; (Saskatchewan Human  Rights
Commission v. Cadillac Fairview Corporation Ltd., [1999] S.J. No.
217  at  para.  14  (Sask C.A.); see also Ontario  (Human  Rights
Commission)  v. Etobicoke (Borough), [1982] 1 S.C.R.  202).   The
Code lies at the very heart of the legal arrangements designed to
ensure that all members of our society enjoy the essential  right
to  be free from discrimination on racial and other grounds.  The
Commission  has  been  entrusted with exclusive  jurisdiction  to
determine  that  fundamental  human  right:   Seneca  College  of
Applied  Arts and Technology v. Bhadauria, [1981] 2  S.C.R.  181.
If  the  Commission  refuses to proceed  with  a  complaint,  the
individual  who claims that his or her fundamental  human  rights
have been infringed has no recourse other than judicial review to
challenge the Commission&#146;s decision.
[155]     The decision-making powers of the Commission in
relation to complaints are cast in ss. 34, 36 and 37 in terms of
a discretion.  The Divisional Court has held that the exercise of
the Commission&#146;s discretion necessarily involves consideration of
the evidence: Jazairi v. Ontario Human Rights Commission (1997),
146 D.L.R.(4th) 297 (Div. Ct.) (aff&#146;d. on other grounds [1999]
O.J. No. 3896, (C.A.) leave to appeal dismissed May 3, 2000
(S.C.C.)).  As I see it, the only legitimate factor to be
considered by the Commission in the exercise of its discretion is
whether there is any merit in the complaint.  If the Commission
were to base its decision on some extraneous factor, the court
would intervene on judicial review.  I did not understand counsel
appearing on behalf of the Commission to dispute this basic point
which flows from the nature of the Commission&#146;s statutory
mandate.  The decision not to refer a complaint puts an end to an
allegation that a fundamental human right has been violated.  In
my opinion, it would be entirely inconsistent with the nature of
a fundamental human right if the Commission were, as is alleged
in the Wharton affidavit, to dismiss a complaint for reasons of
cost or because of &#147;strategic concerns&#148;: see, for example,  Singh
v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1985), 17
D.L.R. (4th) 422, (S.C.C.) at 469 per Wilson J.;  Dworkin, Taking
Rights Seriously (1977), at pp. 90-100.
[156]     In any event, procedural fairness dictates that the
complainant and other parties who may be affected by a decision
of the Commission be given notice of the facts, arguments and
considerations upon which the decision is to be based and an
opportunity to make submissions.  Under the procedures adopted by
the Commission, the complainant and others who may be affected by
the decision are not entitled to attend the meeting at which the
complaint is considered by the Commissioners.  In advance of that
meeting, they are provided with a copy of the Case Analysis
Report that will be put before the Commissioners and are given an
opportunity to make written submissions.  If the Commission were
to proceed on a different recommendation or to base its decision
on factors or considerations undisclosed to the complainant and
the others there would be no opportunity to respond and the right
to fairness would be infringed.
[157]     Finally, the complainant has a statutory right to be
given the Commission&#146;s reasons for refusing to proceed with the
complaint or for refusing to refer it to a board of inquiry.  It
would make a mockery of that statutory right if the complainant
were told that the complaint was dismissed for want of merit
while the Commissioners&#146; real reason was want of resources or
some other unexplained strategic concern.
[158]     The procedures of the Commission must be designed, and
its practices conducted, in a manner commensurate with the nature
and importance of the rights placed in its hands.  With this
background in mind, I proceed to consider the precise issues
presented on this appeal.          </pre>
    <pre><strong>(c)  Position of the Parties</strong></pre>
    <pre>[159]      The appellant&#146;s position is that she has a prima facie
right  to  conduct  an  examination of the Registrar  under  Rule
39.03.   The  appellant  also  submits  that  even  if,  as   the
Commission  submits, it is necessary to establish  &#147;a  reasonable
evidentiary   foundation&#148;  for  the  examination,  the   evidence
adduced,  in  particular,  the Wharton affidavit  satisfies  that
test.   The  Commission submits that it is necessary to establish
an  evidentiary foundation to justify an examination  under  Rule
39.03  in  an  application  for judicial  review,  and  that  the
appellant has failed to do so in this case.  The Commission  does
not,  however, dispute before this court the correctness  of  the
motions  judge&#146;s  order  permitting the appellant  to  have  full
disclosure  of  what was said or put before the Commissioners  by
Commission staff in relation to the appellant&#146;s complaint at  the
September 10 and 11, 1996 meeting.         </pre>
    <pre><strong>(d)     The &#147;Record&#148; on Judicial Review</strong></pre>
    <pre>[160]     The content of the court record for an application  for
judicial review is defined by the Judicial Review Procedure  Act,
R.S.O.  1990,  c. J-1 and by the Rules of Civil  Procedure.   The
process  begins  with the notice of application:  Rule  68.01(1).
Upon  being  served with the notice of application  for  judicial
review,  the decision-maker is required by s. 10 of the  Judicial
Review  Procedure  Act,  to file with the Divisional  Court  &#147;the
record  of  the proceedings in which the decision was made.&#148;  The
&#147;record&#148; is not defined by the Act.
[161]     An applicant for judicial review has the right to have
a full and accurate record of what went on before the tribunal
put before the court.  This is an aspect of the superior court&#146;s
inherent powers of judicial review.  A superior court may insist
upon the production of an adequate record of the proceedings
before the tribunal being reviewed. As stated by Denning L.J. in
R. v. Medical Appeal Tribunal ex p. Gilmore, [1957] 1 Q.B. 574
(Eng. C.A.) at 583: &#147;The court has always had power to order an
inferior tribunal to complete the record&#133;.  [A] tribunal could
defeat a writ of certiorari unless the courts could order them to
complete or correct an imperfect record.  So the courts have the
power to give such an order.&#148; See also R .v Northumberland
Compensation  Appeal Tribunal, ex p. Shaw, [1952] K.B. 338 (Eng.
C.A.) at 352-4; Canadian Workers Union v. Frankel Structural
Steel Ltd. (1976), 12 O.R. (2d) 560 (Div. Ct.) at 577 per Reid
J.; F.G. Spencer Ltd. v. Prince Edward Island (Labour Relations
Board), (1970), 16 D.L.R. (3d) 670 (P.E.I.S.C.);  Battaglia v.
British Columbia (Workmen&#146;s Compensation Board) (1960), 22 D.L.R.
(2d) 446 (B.C.S.C.).  A statutory body subject to judicial review
cannot immunize itself or its process by arriving at decisions on
considerations that are not revealed by the record it files with
the court.          </pre>
    <pre><strong>(e)  Examination of Witnesses</strong></pre>
    <pre>[162]     Rule 39.03 provides that a person may be examined as  a
witness  before  the hearing of a pending motion or  application.
Rule  39.03  applies  to applications for judicial  review.   The
leading  Canadian  text on administrative law, Brown  and  Evans,
Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada (updated  June
30, 1999) at § 6:5530, states: &#147;A witness may be summoned to give
evidence  under  oath in support of an application  for  judicial
review  and any transcript of that evidence is to be included  in
the  Application Record.&#148;  This proposition is borne out  by  the
authorities  that  have  considered  the  Rule  in  relation   to
applications  for  judicial review.  As I  explain  below,  these
authorities  hold  that  a party to an application  for  judicial
review  is  entitled  to adduce evidence by way  of  examination,
provided  the  evidence sought to be adduced is  relevant  to  an
issue  properly raised on the judicial review application and  is
not  specifically excluded by statute or by some applicable legal
principle,  and provided that the examination is not  being  used
for  an  ulterior or improper purpose and does not constitute  an
abuse of process of the court.
[163]     The leading case is the decision of this court in
Canada Metal Co. Ltd v. Heap (1975), 7 O.R. (2d) 185. That case
dealt with former rule 230, the predecessor to Rule 39.03 in
relation to an application for prohibition, one of the common law
remedies that preceded the Judicial Review Procedure Act.  An
applicant for the writ of prohibition alleged that the members of
a tribunal had made statements indicating disqualifying bias. The
applicant issued subpoenas to the members of the tribunal and to
certain journalists who had heard the statements relied upon as
exhibiting bias. The Divisional Court struck out the subpoenas
directed to the journalists on the ground that they were
premature and that the applicant had first to examine the Board
members. The Divisional Court held that there was an onus on the
party issuing the subpoena to justify it. Writing for this court,
Arnup J.A. rejected that proposition and held that the applicants
were entitled to maintain the subpoenas and examine to the
journalists.  In a passage that is frequently quoted as correctly
stating the law, Arnup J.A. wrote as follows at pp. 191-2:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Rule  230  [now  Rule  39.03]    requires  no
          prior  leave  or order of the Court.  It  has
          been  suggested in some decisions that it  is
          for  the  person  issuing the subpoena  under
          that  Rule  to  satisfy the  Court  that  his
          resort   to   it  is  reasonable   [citations
          omitted] We do not think it is appropriate or
          helpful  to declare that when such a subpoena
          is attacked, an onus of proving justification
          arises against the party issuing it.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The evidence sought to be elicited must be
          relevant to the issue on the motion. If it is,
	  there is a prima facie right to resort to Rule
	  230. That right must not be so exercised as to
	  be an abuse of the process of the Court. There
	  will be such an abuse if the main motion is
          itself an abuse, as by being frivolous and
	  vexatious, or if the process under rule 230,
	  while ostensibly for the purpose of eliciting
	  relevant evidence, is in fact being used for an
          ulterior or improper purpose, or if the process
	  is being used in such a way as to be in itself
	  an abuse (as for example, by issuing subpoenas
	  to every member of the House of Commons to prove
	  a defamatory statement shouted out by a spectator
	  in the gallery). The list is not exhaustive.</pre>
    <pre>[164]     Accordingly, Canada Metal establishes that there  is  a
prima facie right to conduct a Rule 39.03 examination in relation
to  an issue relevant to the application for judicial review, but
that the right is subject to certain limits, to which I now turn.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(f)  Limits on the Right to Examine Witnesses in an Application
     for Judicial Review</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong><em>(i)  No right of discovery</em></strong></pre>
    <pre>[165]     The first limit applicable to the circumstances of  the
present  case is implicit in the fact that neither the  Rules  of
Civil Procedure nor the Judicial Review Procedure Act provide for
examination for discovery on an application for judicial  review:
Ellis-Don  Ltd.  v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board)  (1992),  95
D.L.R.  (4th)  56  (Gen.  Div.) at 59, varied  on  another  point
(1994), 110 D.L.R. (4th) 731 (Div. Ct.).  It follows, in my view,
that  a  Rule 39.03 examination may not be used where the purpose
is simply to conduct a general discovery. That would amount to an
&#147;ulterior  or improper purpose&#148; contemplated by Canada Metal  and
should not be allowed.
[166]     I agree with the submission of the Commission that the
proposed scope of the examination in the present case runs afoul
of this principle. The list of documents to be produced appended
to the notice of examination is set out in full in the reasons of
Abella J.A. and I will not repeat it here.  It is so sweeping and
unfocused that it is apparent that the appellant is, in effect,
insisting upon a general discovery of the Commission through its
registrar, hoping to uncover something that will help her case.
The proposed scope of the examination is simply too broad.
Subject to what follows with respect to documents or facts that
were actually put before the Commissioners when they decided the
fate of her compliant, the appellant has no general right to
rummage through the Commission&#146;s files in the hope of uncovering
something helpful to her case.  For reasons I will explain,
however, this is not fatal to the appeal as it seems to me that a
more focussed examination should be permitted.</pre>
    <pre><strong><em>(ii)  Deliberative secrecy</em></strong></pre>
    <pre>[167]      A second limit on the right to resort to a Rule  39.03
examination  arises  from the doctrine of  deliberative  secrecy.
Several cases subsequent to Canada Metal, supra, have dealt  with
the  problem posed by examination of tribunal members  or  senior
officials  such  as  registrars who are privy to  the  tribunal&#146;s
decision-making   process.   These  authorities   indicate   that
additional considerations must be taken into account with respect
to  Rule 39.03 examinations in the administrative law context  in
view  of  the  doctrine of deliberative secrecy.  The  point  was
dealt  with in Agnew v. Ontario Association of Architects (1987),
64  O.R. (2d) 8 at 14 (Div. Ct.) and in Ellis-Don, supra, holding
that  the prima facie right identified in Canada Metal is subject
to  the  qualification that an examination not be used  to  delve
into  the  actual  decision-making process of the  tribunal.   In
Agnew,  supra,  Campbell  J. identified  a  variety  of  purposes
underlying  the doctrine of deliberative secrecy.  First  is  the
practical  concern  that  if  no limits  were  imposed,  tribunal
members  would  be exposed to unduly burdensome examinations  and
&#147;would  spend  more  time testifying about their  decisions  than
making  them.&#148;   A  second reason is the need for  finality.  The
decision should rest on the reasons given and not on the  success
or failure of a cross-examination. Third is the need for a shield
to  protect  the  process  of debate, discussion  and  compromise
inherent in collegial decision-making.
[168]     However, it has also been held on the highest authority
that limitations on the right to conduct examinations designed to
protect the interests of tribunal members must be balanced with
the right of the citizen who has been affected by the tribunal&#146;s
decision to effective judicial review.  When applying the
principle of deliberative secrecy to protect the integrity of the
decision-making process, the courts must take into account the
fact that administrative decisions are subject to the inherent
power of judicial review. In this regard, a distinction has been
drawn between the deliberations of administrative and judicial
officers. The deliberative secrecy of administrative decision-
makers is not absolute and must yield, where necessary, to the
certain overarching principles.  As was pointed out by Gonthier
J. in Tremblay v. Quebec (Commission des Affaires Sociales),
[1992] 1 S.C.R. 952 at 965-6, an allegation that the right to
natural justice has been infringed may require scrutiny of the
decision-making process.  Tribunal members do not have an
unqualified right to shelter their decision-making process from
scrutiny:</pre>
    <pre>          Additionally, when there is no appeal from the
	  decision of an administrative tribunal, as is the
	  case with the Commission, that decision can only
	  be reviewed in one way:  as to legality by judicial
	  review.  It is of the very nature of judicial review
	  to examine inter alia the decision maker&#146;s decision-
	  making process.  Some of the grounds on which a
	  decision may be challenged even concern the internal
 	  aspect of that process:  for example, was the
          decision made at the dictate of a third party?  Is 
	  it the result of the blind application of a
 	  previously established directive or policy?  All
	  these events accompany the deliberations or are
	  part of them.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Accordingly, it  seems  to  me  that  by  the
          very  nature  of  the control exercised  over
          their   decisions  administrative   tribunals
          cannot  rely on deliberative secrecy  to  the
          same   extent  as  judicial  tribunals.    Of
          course, secrecy remains the rule, but it  may
          nonetheless  be lifted when the litigant  can
          present valid reasons for believing that  the
          process  followed  did not  comply  with  the
          rules of natural justice.          </pre>
    <pre>[169]      In  the  present  case, the doctrine  of  deliberative
secrecy must be taken into account.  The appellant does not  seek
to  examine  a  member  of  the  commission  as  to  confidential
discussions with other Commissioners.  She does, however, seek to
examine  a  senior  official, privy to the deliberations  of  the
Commission, and to obtain disclosure of facts and arguments  that
were  put  before the Commissioners by senior staff  members  and
considered  by the Commissioners in determining the fate  of  her
complaint.  I note, however, that the application of deliberative
secrecy  to  these  proceedings is not without  difficulty.   The
Commissioners apparently conduct their discussions  at  the  same
time they entertain submissions and input from staff members  and
it  would  seem  difficult to identify a  discrete,  deliberative
phase  of the process.  In view of that practice, it seems to  me
that  the  claim  of  protection  for  deliberative  secrecy  has
considerable  less  force than in cases  where  tribunal  members
actually  retire  to consider the case in private.   This  factor
must  be  added  to  what  was  said in  Tremblay  regarding  the
qualified  protection  accorded  deliberative  secrecy   in   the
administrative law setting in determining the extent to which the
Commission can shelter its process from disclosure.</pre>
    <pre><strong><em>(iii) Factual foundation</em></strong></pre>
    <pre>[170]      A  difficult and delicate issue is the nature  of  the
factual  threshold a party must satisfy to conduct a  Rule  39.03
examination in support of an application for judicial review.   I
do  not accept the argument advanced by the Commission that it is
necessary  in  all  cases  to establish a &#147;reasonable  evidential
foundation&#148;.   Nor  do  I agree with my colleague  Abella  J.A.&#146;s
conclusion that there is a &#147;heavy onus&#148; or that the party seeking
an  examination  must  provide  &#147;reasonable,  reliable,  relevant
evidence&#148;  to meet the &#147;high threshold&#148;. In my view, language  of
this  kind  is  not apt for a variety of reasons.  First,  it  is
inconsistent  with Canada Metal, supra and a long line  of  cases
that  have  followed:  see for example, Fort Norman  Explorations
Inc.  v. McLaughlin (1982), 36 O.R. (2d) 787 (H.C.J.); Iona Corp.
v Aurora (Town) (1991), 3 O.R. (3d) 579 (Gen. Div.); Transamerica
Life Insurance Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co. (1995),
27  O.R. (3d) 291 (Gen. Div.).  Second, there is a distinct  risk
that  if the standard is expressed in these terms, resort to Rule
39.03  would become virtually redundant. Simply put, an applicant
for  judicial  review should not have to prove his  or  her  case
before securing access to the very process designed by the  Rules
of  Civil Procedure to adduce evidence.  It is also my view  that
to pitch the test so high in a case such as the present one would
be  inimical  to  the inherent power of judicial review  and  the
importance  of  having  a  full  and  accurate  record  of   what
transpired   before   the  decision-maker.   To   fulfill   their
constitutionally  protected mandate of  ensuring  that  statutory
procedures  are  followed  in  a manner  that  accords  with  the
principles  of natural justice, the superior courts  must  afford
litigants  adequate procedures to ensure that all relevant  facts
are  presented.   Accordingly, it is sufficient if  the  proposed
examination  is  focussed on facts relevant to an issue  properly
raised  by  way of judicial review.  I hardly need  to  add  that
facts  relevant  to an issue properly raised by way  of  judicial
review   is   a   very   specific  and   narrowly   circumscribed
classification.
[171]     There are, no doubt, additional factors that come  into
play   where  the  examination  will  impinge  upon  deliberative
secrecy.  I  do  not  doubt the importance  of  the  doctrine  of
deliberative secrecy nor do I question the utility of  protecting
statutory  decision-makers from unduly  burdensome  examinations.
However,  as  stated in Tremblay, supra, against those  interests
must  be  balanced the right of the individual  to  fairness  and
natural justice. In my view, requiring the applicant for judicial
review  to  satisfy  a  &#147;heavy onus&#148;  by  providing  &#147;reasonable,
reliable,  relevant evidence&#148; would effectively  deny  access  to
Rule  39.03 to anyone who was not already in a position to  prove
his  or  her  case.  I do not agree that such  a  standard  would
achieve  an appropriate balance.  In the case at bar, the motions
judge referred to the need to establish a &#147;reasonable evidentiary
foundation&#148;:  see  Bettes  v. Boeing Canada/Dehavilland  Division
(1992), 10 O.R. (3d) 768 (Gen. Div.)  Brown and Evans, supra at §
6:5620 say perhaps ambiguously that the examination of a decision-
maker  will  be  allowed if &#147;a certain threshold of  evidence  is
met.&#148; In Waverley (Village) v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Municipal
Affairs) (1994), 129 N.S.R. (2d) 298 at 303, (C.A.) Freeman  J.A.
suggested the following standard:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133;a proper evidentiary foundation must be created, 
generally by affidavit evidence, to establish that 
valid reasons exist for concern that there has been 
a want of natural justice or procedural fairness, 
or that the discretionary authority has been
otherwise exceeded.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[172]      In view of these authorities and in keeping with  what
was  said  in Canada Metal and Tremblay, it seems to me  that  an
applicant for judicial review who seeks to conduct an examination
that  will  touch upon the deliberative secrecy of the  decision-
maker  must  present  some  basis for a clearly  articulated  and
objectively  reasonable concern that a relevant legal  right  may
have  been  infringed.  I would emphasize that  in  view  of  the
importance  of  the  principle  of deliberative  secrecy  in  the
administrative  decision-making process,  examinations  based  on
conjecture or mere speculation will not be allowed.</pre>
    <pre><em><strong>(iv)  Statutory exclusions</strong></em></pre>
    <pre>[173]      I note finally that the right to conduct a Rule  39.03
examination may also be limited by statute. In the present  case,
the Commission submits that s. 30 of the Code has this effect:</pre>
    <pre>
          (1)   No  person  who  is  a  member  of  the 
	  Commission shall be required to give testimony 
	  in a  civil  suit  or  any  proceeding  as  to
	  information  obtained  in  the  course  of  an
	  investigation under this Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>          (2)   No  person  who  is  employed  in   the
          administration of this Act shall be  required
          to  give  testimony in a civil  suit  or  any
          proceeding other than a proceeding under this
          Act  as to information obtained in the course
          of  an investigation under this Act. 1981, c.
          53, s. 29.</pre>
    <pre>[174]      In  my  view, s. 30 does not preclude  an  examination
along  the  lines  I  outline below. By its  terms,  s.  30  only
protects  from disclosure &#147;information obtained in the course  of
an  investigation  under  this Act.&#148;  I read  that  provision  as
protecting  from  disclosure  the product  of  the  investigative
efforts of the Commission and its staff.  It does not amount to a
general  prohibition  against  examinations  of  members  of  the
Commission or Commission staff, but rather represents a  specific
and  limited  curtailment of the rights of  litigants  to  obtain
evidence  relevant  to their cause.  While  I  accept  that  this
provision  provides  an additional reason to deny  the  appellant
claim  to  general  production of everything in the  Commission&#146;s
file,  I  fail  to see how that language has any bearing  in  the
right  of  the  appellant to have produced before the  Divisional
Court for the purposes of the judicial review application a  full
account of all material presented to the Commissioners when  they
disposed  of  her  case.  If the statute  had  that  effect,  the
appellant&#146;s right to fairness would be circumscribed.  I  do  not
accept that s.30 should be so interpreted.
[175]     The circumstances in the present case may be contrasted
with those presented in Ellis Don, supra, involving a very
different statutory provision. At issue there was the Ontario
Labour Relations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.2, s. 111. That section
explicitly provides that no member of the Board or Board official</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>
&#133;shall be required to give testimony in any civil 
suit or in any proceeding before the Board or in 
any proceeding before any other tribunal respecting 
information obtained in the discharge of their 
duties or while acting within the scope of their
employment under this Act.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[176]     In view of that very different statutory language,  the
decision  of the Divisional Court to preclude the examination  of
the chair, vice-chair and registrar of the board on the basis  of
a very different statute is readily distinguishable.</pre>
    <pre><em><strong>(v)  Summary</strong></em></pre>
    <pre>[177]      I would summarize the effect of these authorities  and
considerations in the following manner. There is  a  prima  facie
right  to  resort to a Rule 39.03 examination in relation  to  an
application for judicial review and there is no onus on the party
seeking  the  examination to prove any facts as  a  precondition.
However,  as there is no general right to discovery on a judicial
review application, the party serving a notice of examination may
be  required  to  specify the scope of the proposed  examination.
The  matters  intended to be covered in the examination  must  be
relevant  to  a ground that would justify judicial  review.   The
evidence   must  not  be  excluded  by  statute.   The   proposed
examination will not be allowed where it is being used  for  some
improper purpose or where the examination or the application  for
judicial review would constitute an abuse of the process  of  the
court.  Where  it  is  proposed to examine a tribunal  member  or
senior  tribunal  official privy to the decision-making  process,
the  right to conduct the examination must be balanced  with  the
principle  of deliberative secrecy. The examination will  not  be
permitted  unless the party proposing it can present  some  basis
for a clearly articulated and objectively reasonable concern that
a  relevant  legal  right  may have been infringed.  Examinations
based on conjecture or mere speculation will not be allowed.</pre>
    <pre><strong>(g)  Application</strong></pre>
    <pre>[178]      In  my  view, the motions judge and the panel  of  the
Divisional Court affirming her decision erred by imposing on  the
appellant  an  unduly  burdensome onus of justification  for  the
proposed   examination.   In  particular,  I  would  reject   the
submission  that  it  was necessary for the appellant  to  adduce
evidence  from  someone  actually present  at  the  two  meetings
subsequent   to  September  11  and  12,  1996  to  justify   the
examination.  However, the appellant is not entitled  to  a  full
discovery  of  the  Commission, through its  registrar,  and  the
examination must be limited to facts relevant to the grounds  for
judicial review.
[179]      The  appellant  seeks to examine a  senior  Commission
official who is privy to the decision-making process and  aspects
of  the proposed examination could well touch on the Commission&#146;s
decision-making  process.   In my view,  as  the  Commission  has
chosen to conduct it deliberations with the assistance and in the
presence   of  non-Commission  members,  its  deliberations   are
necessarily  more exposed to review than if they  were  conducted
privately.   Specifically, it is my view that  the  appellant  is
entitled  to  know  the  recommendations  and  any  other   facts
presented to the Commissioners by the Commission staff.   It  is,
in  any  event, my view that the appellant has presented a  basis
for a clearly articulated and objectively reasonable concern that
the process followed may not have complied with the principles of
fairness and that the Commission has failed to provide the  court
with  a  record that completely reveals all the facts,  arguments
and  considerations that were presented to the Commissioners when
they  decided  not  to request a board of inquiry.   The  Wharton
affidavit  gives  rise to a number of related concerns  regarding
the practices of the Commission, namely:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.    Excessive control by the staff over the decision
                making process of the Commission in general, and
                in particular, senior staff overriding the Case
                Analysis Report and putting a different
                recommendation to the Commission from that
                reflected by the Case Analysis Report;     </pre>
    <pre>          2.    Staff members urging the Commission to base
		decisions on legally irrelevant factors, 
		especially strategic concerns;          </pre>
    <pre>          3.    Failure of the Commission to convey to parties 
		affected the actual reasons for decision;</pre>
    <pre>          4.    Failure of the Commission to provide a full
                and complete record for the purposes of judicial
	        review of what facts and considerations were
	        taken into account by the Commission.</pre>
    <pre>[180]      While  I  express no view as to whether the  appellant
will, in the end, succeed on any of these points, there is, in my
view, a sufficient nexus between these concerns and the treatment
accorded  the  appellant&#146;s complaint to warrant further  inquiry.
Mr.  Wharton was, after all, a stranger neither to the  practices
of  the  Commission nor to the treatment accorded the appellant&#146;s
complaint.   In  light  of his immediate familiarity  with  these
matters, his views as to what may have transpired at the impugned
meetings  of  the  Commission  rises  well  above  the  level  of
speculation or mere conjecture.  The case is similar to Glengarry
Memorial  Hospital  v.  Ontario (Pay  Equity  Hearings  Tribunal)
(1993), 99 D.L.R. (4th) 682, varied 99 D.L.R. (4th) 706 where the
Divisional Court allowed an examination to proceed in response to
a &#147;cry for help&#148; from a concerned tribunal member.
[181]     Accordingly, it is my view that the appellant is
entitled to examine the registrar as to what documents, facts,
considerations or recommendations not already revealed by the
record filed on judicial review were before the Commissioners, to
inquire as to whether &#147;strategic factors&#148; formed a basis for the
Commissioners&#146; decision, and to inquire whether there were any
reasons for the determination not revealed in the reasons given
the appellant.</pre>
    <pre><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[182]     For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal from  the
order  striking  out portions of the appellant&#146;s  affidavit,  but
would allow the appeal to enable the appellant to conduct a  Rule
39.03  examination  to  the  extent indicated  in  the  preceding
paragraph.  I  would also award the appellant her costs  of  this
appeal as well as her costs of the proceedings before the motions
judge and the full panel of the Divisional Court.
