    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction by Mr. Justice T. O'Hara on
November 15, 1996 and from the sentence imposed on February 17,
1997
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T</strong>

    <pre>[1]    The  appellant  was  convicted  of  four  sexual  offences
committed on his step-daughter Jennifer when she was between  the
ages  of  thirteen and fifteen.  He was sentenced to five  years&#146;
imprisonment.  He appeals his conviction and sentence.
[2]  There are two issues raised on this appeal, namely, that the
trial judge erred in assessing the complainant&#146;s credibility and
reliability on the basis of demeanour alone and that the verdict
is unreasonable.
[3]  With respect to the complainant&#146;s credibility, the trial
judge viewed her evidence as being inconsistent and he recognized
that he should consider her evidence with great caution.  He then
described her demeanour and concluded that she had been an
excellent witness.
[4]  In dealing with the evidence of other witnesses, the trial
judge properly considered the reliability of the evidence. He
referred to the lack of memory and lameness of explanation, to
evidence that was coherent, cogent and believable and to evidence
that was rife with contradictions and inconsistencies.
[5]  When considering the reasons of the trial judge in their
entirety, it is apparent that he was alive to the reliability of
the evidence and we see no reason to conclude that the trial
judge would not have assessed the complainant&#146;s evidence in the
same manner as the evidence of other witnesses.
[6]  As to the reasonableness of the verdict, the trial judge
recognized that the complainant was a reluctant witness. The
trial judge was also alive to the inconsistencies in her evidence
and her delayed disclosure.  In the end, he chose to accept her
evidence.
[7]  The verdict is not unreasonable.
[8]  The appeal as to conviction is dismissed.
[9]  Finally, with respect to sentence, in light of the
seriousness of the offences and the criminal record of the
appellant, it is our view that the sentence was fit.  Leave to
appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is also dismissed.
