</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant  appeals from his  conviction  for  indecent
assault  on a female and from the sentence of two years less  one
day imprisonment.  At trial, the appellant sought production from
third   parties  of  certain  personal  records  concerning   the
complainant.  In particular, the appellant applied for production
of  notes  taken  by  a  psychotherapist  who  had  provided  the
complainant with counselling over a period of almost  two  years.
The  trial judge applied the provisions of Bill C-46 and  refused
to  order  production  of the records.  The principal  ground  of
appeal raised by the appellant concerned the constitutionality of
Bill C-46.
[2]  On March 31, 1999, this court heard the appeal from
conviction and sentence with respect to all of the grounds of
appeal except the constitutional challenge.  We reserved our
decision to await the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
R. v. Mills.  That decision was released on November 25, 1999 and
is now reported at 139 C.C.C. (3d) 321.  The Supreme Court upheld
the legislation.  The parties have filed written submissions to
deal with the effect of the decision in R. v. Mills.
[3]  For the reasons that follow we would dismiss the appeal from
conviction and sentence.</pre>
    <pre>     THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The complainant is the appellant&#146;s stepdaughter.  She lived
with  the appellant and her mother when she was between the  ages
of  five and eighteen years.  The complainant testified that  the
appellant began to sexually abuse her when she was ten  years  of
age and stopped the abuse when she was sixteen years of age.  The
complainant was thirty-seven years of age when she complained  to
the police.
[5]  The complainant testified that the sexual abuse occurred
frequently, virtually whenever the appellant had the opportunity.
The abuse included acts of fellatio, cunnilingus, and
masturbation.  There were no acts of sexual intercourse.  The
complainant described three incidents in particular detail.  She
described the other incidents only in broad terms by the type of
act and the location.
[6]  The abuse ceased when the complainant turned sixteen.  The
appellant came into her room at that time and told her that he
would leave her alone but that he wanted her to promise that she
would never tell anybody.
[7]  The only defence witness was the complainant&#146;s twin brother.
He testified to two conversations with the complainant.  In the
first conversation, around the time of the wedding of their
sister in August 1995, the brother testified that the complainant
told him that the appellant had &#147;fooled around with her&#148;.  The
brother testified that he asked the complainant if anything
sexual occurred and she said, &#147;no&#148;.  The second conversation
occurred about a year later.  The complainant told him that the
appellant had sexually assaulted her and she was taking him to
court.  She was hysterical at the time and was concerned that she
would not get any money from the appellant in his will.  The
complainant testified that her brother&#146;s recollection of these
conversations was not accurate.  She testified that she did tell
him in the first conversation that the appellant sexually abused
her, but she did not provide any details.  In the second
conversation, she gave him certain details of the abuse.
[8]  The appellant did not testify.  The theory of the defence
appears to have been that the complainant laid the charges to get
money from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, or out of
revenge because the appellant was not giving her any money.</pre>
    <pre>     THE APPEAL FROM CONVICTION

               The Mills issue</pre>
    <pre>[9]   At  trial, the appellant sought notes taken by  an  unknown
physician  in  Sharbot  Lake who referred the  complainant  to  a
therapist at the Kingston Sexual Assault Crisis Centre, the notes
of   the   therapist  at  the  Centre,  and  the   notes   of   a
psychotherapist  at  the  Kin Family  Centre.   The  trial  judge
refused  to order production of any of the notes.  On the appeal,
the  appellant  only  pursued the ruling as  it  applied  to  the
therapist  at  the Kin Family Centre.  The complainant  saw  this
therapist  on  a weekly basis for about a year from August  1995.
After  the  first  year, she began to see  the  therapist  either
biweekly  or monthly until eventually contact was infrequent  and
often only on the telephone.  The last contact with the therapist
was  on June 4, 1997.  The complainant went to the police in June
of 1996, that is, while she was seeing the therapist.  There were
about  thirty hourly counselling sessions between June  1996  and
June 1997.</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant filed his application for access to the third-
party  records  on May 2, 1997.  At that time, the governing  law
was  as  set  out  in R. v. O&#146;Connor (1995), 103  C.C.C.  (3d)  1
(S.C.C.).  On May 12, 1997, Bill C-46 was proclaimed in force and
amended the Criminal Code to include ss. 278.1 to 278.91.   These
sections,  rather  than O&#146;Connor, now govern  the  production  of
records  containing personal information as defined in s.  278.1,
in  proceedings  for  certain  offences  set  out  in  s.  278.2.
Indecent assault under former s. 149 of the Criminal Code, R.S.C.
1970,  c. C-34 is one of those offences.  The trial judge applied
those  provisions.  He held that the appellant had  not  met  the
threshold  test  of likely relevance as set out in  s.  278.5  to
warrant production to the judge.
[11] The hearing to determine production of the records was based
entirely on submissions.  Neither party called any evidence.  The
therapist from the Kin Family Centre made brief submissions to
the trial judge.  In the course of those submissions, she
disclosed that she and the complainant &#147;dealt with a number of
issues&#148;.  She agreed with the trial judge&#146;s suggestion that &#147;some
of them touched upon the issues in this case&#148;.  She stated that
in her opinion disclosure would be detrimental to the complainant
and the complainant&#146;s relationship with other family members.
[12] In the course of his submissions, counsel for the appellant
indicated that he was aware that the complainant had disclosed
the abuse to her husband and had discussed it with other persons
before she sought counselling.  At trial, there was no suggestion
that the complainant had recovered the memories of the abuse
through therapy or that the counselling had influenced her
recollection of the events.
[13] The trial judge gave the following reasons for refusing to
order that the records be disclosed to him for review:

          There is a possibility that if we knew all
	  about everything this woman said to her
	  psychologists, her counsellors, that we might
	  discover something relevant but it never rises
	  above the level of possibility in my view.
	  The information given by this woman to her
	  psychotherapist is likely to have had to do
  	  with healing her real or her perceived injuries.
	  Any revelations to her psychotherapist cannot
	  be said to be likely relevant to whether the
	  original incident complained of happened.  There
	  is, in my view, no reasonable possibility that
          the information would be logically probative of
	  the truth or falsity of the original allegation.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Now,    I    am    compelled to consider  the
          Criminal   Code  and  whether   or   not   it
          constitutes  a complete codification  of  the
          procedure  to  be used by a judge  in  making
          these  determinations.  I refer to  s.  278.1
          and   following   of   the   Criminal   Code,
          relatively    new    provisions.      Section
          278.3(3)(b) reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &quot;An application must be made in writing
               and set out,
               </pre>
    <pre>               (b)    the  grounds  on  which  the
               accused relies to establish that the
               record is likely relevant to an issue at
               trial  or to the competence of  the
               witness to testify.&quot;
                    </pre>
    <pre>          Competence    to    give    evidence  is  not
          an    issue   that   is   claimed   by    the
          defence    in    this   case    so    I    am
          limited      therefore     to     considering
          whether    the   grounds   on    which    the
          accused    relies    to    establish     that
          the   record   is  likely  relevant   to   an
          issue at trial.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Frankly,   I  do  not  think that  has  been
          made out but I have gone on and read further,
          and s. 278.3(4) reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               &quot;Any    one   or   more  of  the   following
               assertions by the accused are not sufficient
               on their own to establish that the record is
               likely relevant to an issue at trial or to
               the competence of a witness to testify.&quot;
               </pre>
    <pre>               And I refer to paragraph &quot;B&quot;,
          </pre>
    <pre>               &quot;That the record relates to medical or
               psychiatric treatment, therapy or counselling
               that the complainant or witness has received
               or is receiving.&quot;
               </pre>
    <pre>          I   can     see    nothing     more  in   the
          assertions  of  defence  counsel  on   behalf
          of   the  accused  than  a  claim  that   the
          records   of  [the  psychotherapist]   relate
          to    anything   more   than    medical    or
          psychiatric     treatment,     therapy     or
          counselling    that   the   complainant    or
          witness   has   received  or  is   receiving.
          There  is  not  anything else but  that,  and
          I  am  commanded  that any  one  or  more  of
          the   following  assertions  by  the  accused
          are not sufficient.
          
[14] In his written submissions, counsel for the appellant argues
that the trial judge erred in holding that the documents were not
likely relevant within the meaning of s. 278.5. He relies on  the
close temporal connection between the creation of the records and
the  decision to bring the charges.  He argues that  the  records
may have contained information concerning the unfolding of events
underlying the complaints, may have revealed the use of  therapy,
which  influenced the complainant&#146;s memory and may have contained
information bearing on the complainant&#146;s credibility.
[15] Section 278.3(4) lists a series of &#147;assertions&#148; that cannot
on their own establish that a record is likely relevant.
Included in that list are the following:

                (b) that the record relates to medical
	  or psychiatric treatment, therapy or counselling
          that the complainant or witness has received or
	  is receiving;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (c)  that  the  record relates  to  the
          incident  that is the subject-matter  of  the
          proceedings;
          </pre>
    <pre>               (d) that the record may disclose a prior
          inconsistent statement of the complainant  or
          witness;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (e)  that the record may relate to  the
          credibility of the complainant or witness;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (f)  that the record may relate to  the
          reliability   of   the   testimony   of   the
          complainant  or  witness merely  because  the
          complainant  or  witness has received  or  is
          receiving  psychiatric treatment, therapy  or
          counselling;
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                (k)  that the record was made close  in
          time  to a complaint or to the activity  that
          forms   the  subject-matter  of  the   charge
          against the accused.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[16] All of the submissions made by the appellant fall within one
or  the other of these categories.  In Mills at p. 380, the court
held  that  an  accused is not prevented from  relying  on  these
assertions  &#147;where  there  is  an  evidentiary  or  informational
foundation  to  suggest  that  they  may  be  related  to  likely
relevance&#148;.   There is no such foundation.  As  we  have  pointed
out,  there  was  nothing  to suggest that  the  complainant  had
recovered  these  memories of abuse or that the  counselling  had
influenced  her memory.  The submissions made on the  application
at  trial  and  on this appeal amount to nothing more  than  bare
assertions.  There is, in the words of the court in Mills  at  p.
380,  &#147;no case-specific evidence or information to show that  the
record in issue is likely relevant to an issue at trial&#148;.
[17] The appellant also submits that the trial judge took too
narrow a view of likely relevance as he failed to consider the
possibility that the information contained in the records may
have also led the appellant to other witnesses or shed light on
the unfolding of events.  There is no merit to this submission.
There is nothing to suggest that anything in these records could
have led to other witnesses or information or shed light on the
narrative.  The complainant and the appellant were not strangers.
The complainant was the appellant&#146;s stepdaughter.  The Crown had
made full disclosure to the appellant, and his counsel made
reference to that disclosure in his submissions to the trial
judge.  The suggestion that the therapist&#146;s notes might have
revealed the existence of witnesses, about whom the appellant had
no information, is pure speculation.
[18] In our view, the trial judge did not err in refusing to
order production of the therapist&#146;s notes.

               The Reasons for Judgment
</pre>
    <pre>[19]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding
that  the  complainant&#146;s ability to recall only certain incidents
was  &#147;telling&#148; and supportive of her credibility.  He argues that
&#147;absent expert evidence to establish that a selective ability  to
recall  was consistent with the pattern of assaults alleged&#148;  the
complainant&#146;s  limited recall weighed against the reliability  of
her evidence.
[20] In our view, the trial judge&#146;s reasons are not fairly open
to this criticism.  The portion of the reasons complained of is
as follows:

          The fact that there is repetition alleged about
      	  some sorts of incidents and one particular incident
	  which sticks in her mind which she says was not
          repeated I find telling.
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  In  this  passage, the trial judge  was  referring  to  the
complainant&#146;s description of a particular incident when  she  was
twelve years of age.  The complainant&#146;s mother sent her home from
a  neighbour&#146;s house to get something.  When she arrived home the
appellant was there.  He took the complainant to her bedroom, had
her  take down her pants and he pulled down his.  He then put his
penis  between her legs and started to rub very fast against  her
genitals.   This  hurt her and she jumped away.   A  few  seconds
later  the  appellant told her to get dressed because her  mother
was  coming.  She ran to the bathroom and urinated.  She  noticed
blood in the urine.  Later she told the appellant about this  and
he &#147;looked surprised&#148;, said he was &#147;sorry, he didn&#146;t mean it&#148; and
not  to  tell her mother.  That was the only occasion  when  this
kind   of   conduct  occurred.   Later,  in  her  testimony   the
complainant  testified  that while  all  of  the  incidents  were
painful  to  recall,  &#147;certain ones&#133;really  stick  in  your  mind
because they&#146;re the most&#133;painful&#148;.
[22] In our view, it is not accurate to say that the complainant
had a limited recall.  What she said was that certain events,
like the one just described, were different and she could recall
them in detail.  The other abuse, such as the repeated acts of
fellatio and masturbation were similar and she could not recall
anything that distinguished any of those acts from others.
[23] Further, contrary to the appellant&#146;s submission, the trial
judge did not use the complainant&#146;s alleged selective recall as
positive evidence consistent with abuse.  In the impugned
passage, he was dealing solely with the attack on the
complainant&#146;s credibility. The trial judge took a common sense
approach to the complainant&#146;s evidence.  He did not require
expert evidence to accept the complainant&#146;s explanation that
certain events stood out from the others.
[24] We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     THE SENTENCE APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The  appellant  is 61 years of age.   He  has  no  previous
criminal record.  He was a good provider for his family.  In  his
submissions, counsel for the appellant pointed out  a  number  of
factors that he considered to be mitigating.  There were no  acts
of  intercourse,  although the act in the  complainant&#146;s  bedroom
might  well have been an attempt, the appellant ceased the  abuse
voluntarily,  and the abuse stopped about twenty  years  earlier.
On the other hand, the abuse was serious and prolonged.  It had a
serious  impact on the complainant as disclosed in her  testimony
and her victim impact statement.
[26] At trial, the only contest between defence counsel [not Mr.
Napier] and Crown counsel was whether the trial judge should
impose a high reformatory or low penitentiary sentence.  The
trial judge accepted the defence submissions and imposed the
former.  On appeal, the appellant nevertheless argues that the
sentence was manifestly excessive and that the appropriate range
was twelve to eighteen months' imprisonment.  We do not agree.
The offences were of considerable gravity and involved a high
degree of moral blameworthiness.  The appellant was in a position
of trust.  He abused that trust repeatedly over many years.</pre>
    <pre>     DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[27]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed, leave
to appeal sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.
