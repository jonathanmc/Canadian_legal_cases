    <pre>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Cullity dated
September 24, 1999
</pre>
    <pre>CHARRON J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>1.   Overview
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Board of Directors of the appellant, the Greater Toronto
Airports  Authority (the &#147;GTAA&#148;), decided that Louis  Parsons,  a
nominee of the respondent Regional Municipality of Peel (&#147;Peel&#148;),
was  not qualified to be a member and director of the GTAA.  Peel
brought  an application  pursuant to Rule 14.05(3)(d), seeking  a
declaration that the Board&#146;s decision contravened the GTAA&#146;s  by-
laws.   Mr.  Parsons  was  granted  leave  to  intervene  on  the
application.
[2]  Cullity J. allowed the application. In a judgment, dated
September 24, 1999 and reported at (1999), 5 M.P.L.R. (3d) 101
(Ont. S.C.J.), the court declared that the Board&#146;s decision
contravened the GTAA&#146;s General Operating By-law (&#147;the By-law&#148;)
and that the Board was obligated to appoint Mr. Parsons as a
member and director of the GTAA. The GTAA appeals from this
judgment.
[3]  Cullity J. made a thorough review of the facts in his
judgment. None of those facts are in issue on this appeal. The
parties are divided, rather, on what inferences those facts were
capable of supporting. Cullity J. held that the facts could not
reasonably support the Board&#146;s decision. I agree with that
conclusion.</pre>
    <pre>2.   The Facts
</pre>
    <pre>[4]   I  will  only  review those facts  that  are  necessary  to
understand  this  appeal. Reference can be made to  Cullity  J.&#146;s
reported judgment for a more complete review.
[5]  The GTAA is a non-profit corporation that operates Pearson
Airport. The persons who serve as its members and directors are
nominated by various outside bodies, including the regional
municipalities of the Greater Toronto Area and the federal and
provincial governments. The nominees are then appointed by the
Board of Directors if the Board determines that they meet the
qualifications in the By-law.
[6]  Mr. Parsons was nominated by Peel. At its meeting on May 12,
1998, the Board decided that Mr. Parsons did not meet the
conflict of interest requirements of the By-law for appointment
as a member and director. This decision was based on the
conclusion reached by a majority of the members of the Board that
Mr. Parsons, if appointed, would not at all times act in the best
interests of the GTAA. The Board therefore did not appoint Mr.
Parsons and Peel&#146;s prior nominee, Anne Edgar, remained on the
Board pursuant to the By-law.
[7]  In arriving at the conclusion that Mr. Parsons would not at
all times act in the best interests of the GTAA, the Board relied
firstly, on reports of what transpired during the course of an
interview with Mr. Parsons held on May 4, 1998 before two members
of the Board, and, secondly, on the contents of a letter dated
May 11, 1998 written by Mr. Parsons and sent to the Chairman of
the Board.
[8]  The two Board members who conducted the interview, Mr. Dimma
and Mr. Butt, concluded that Mr. Parsons would not at all times
act in the best interests of the GTAA based on the fact that Mr.
Parsons, several times during the course of the interview,
refused to state unequivocally that he would do so. Rather, in
answer to several specific questions, he responded that he would
want to know all the facts before stating his position on any
issue.
[9]  Following the interview, Mr. Parsons was informed that a
recommendation was being made to the Board that his nomination be
rejected on the basis that he would not always act in the best
interests of the GTAA and was therefore in a conflict of
interest. He was asked to state unequivocally that he intended to
exercise his powers and duties as a director with a view to the
best interests of the GTAA.  Mr. Parsons did so by letter dated
May 11, 1998.
[10] In his May 11 letter, Mr. Parsons also commented that in his
interview &#147;there had been no suggestions of a conflict of
interest or any questions raised that would indicate that I would
not be in a position to act in the best interests of the GTAA in
all matters.&#148; The Board was advised by Mr. Dimma that this latter
statement was untrue. The Board therefore reached the conclusion
that Mr. Parsons was lying in his letter and that, consequently,
his statement that he would always act in the best interests of
the GTAA was not credible.</pre>
    <pre>3.   The Issues
</pre>
    <pre>[11]  A  number of matters are no longer in issue on this appeal.
For  the purposes of this appeal, the parties do not dispute  the
following  conclusions of fact and law made by  the  applications
judge:</pre>
    <pre>     1.   the  application can be determined on the basis of  the
          material before the court without a trial;
     </pre>
    <pre>     2.   under the provisions of the By-law, it was open to  the
	  Board  to inquire into whether a nominee, if appointed,
	  would act solely in the best interests of the GTAA, and
	  to disqualify a nominee on the basis that he would not;
     </pre>
    <pre>     3.   in order to succeed, it was incumbent upon the applicant,
          Peel, to demonstrate that no Board of Directors, acting
          reasonably in the exercise of its business judgment, could
	  have made the decision on the basis of the evidence before
	  it; and</pre>
    <pre>     4.   given the anticipatory nature of the decision to reject a
          nominee on the basis that he would not act in the best 
	  interests of the GTAA, the Board&#146;s decision could only
	  be said to fall within the range of reasonableness if it
	  was based on &#147;clear and not ambiguous evidence.&#148;
     
[12] The evidence demonstrates that the Board purported to act in
accordance  with  this latter stringent test  when  it  made  the
decision to reject Mr. Parsons&#146; nomination and that it did so  on
the advice of its legal counsel. All counsel on the appeal are in
agreement  that, given the scope of the Board&#146;s limited authority
to  screen nominees under the By-law and the anticipatory  nature
of  the  decision,  this  test  is the  appropriate  one  in  the
particular  circumstances  of  this  case.  Given  the   parties&#146;
agreement  as  to  the narrow scope of the Board&#146;s  authority  to
reject  Mr.  Parsons&#146;  nomination under the  By-law,  it  is  not
necessary for this court to decide whether the applications judge
was correct in finding that the Board&#146;s decision was entitled  to
the  same degree of deference as it generally would with  respect
to decisions made in the management of the company&#146;s affairs. See
Maple Leaf Foods Inc. v. Schneider Corp. (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 177
(C.A.)  for an application of what has been referred  to  by  the
parties  as  the &#147;business judgment rule&#148;. In this  case,  it  is
agreed  that  any rejection of Mr. Parsons&#146; nomination  that  was
based  on evidence falling short of the &#147;clear and not ambiguous&#148;
test  would fall beyond the scope of the Board&#146;s authority  under
the By-law.
[13] The applications judge held that the evidentiary basis
before the Board could not reasonably support its decision. More
specifically, he held that no board of directors acting
reasonably in the exercise of its business judgment could have
decided that the evidence satisfied the stringent test propounded
by counsel.
[14] In light of his decision on this issue, the applications
judge held that it was not necessary to decide whether the Board
breached a duty to observe the requisite standards of procedural
fairness in reaching its decision. Nonetheless, he held that, if
it were necessary to decide this issue, he would conclude that
procedural fairness required that Mr. Parsons be given a
reasonable opportunity to be heard and that Mr. Parsons was not
given this opportunity.
[15] The GTAA contends that the applications judge erred in
finding, firstly, that the Board&#146;s decision could not be
supported on the evidence and, secondly, that the decision
breached the rules of procedural fairness.
[16] The first issue to be decided on this appeal is whether the
Board could reasonably conclude that it had clear and unambiguous
evidence that Mr. Parsons would not act at all times in the best
interests of the GTAA. In my view, it could not and the
applications judge was correct in so concluding.
[17] In light of my decision on this issue, I do not find it
necessary to deal with the  question of procedural fairness and,
consequently, I will make no comment on this second issue.</pre>
    <pre>4.   The Evidentiary Basis in Support of the Board&#146;s Decision
     
[18]  The applications judge extensively reviewed the evidentiary
basis  for the Board&#146;s decision at pp.127-32 of his judgment.  In
dealing firstly with the interview, the applications judge stated
that &#147;the thrust of &#133; [the] criticism on the conflict of interest
issue was that Mr. Parsons refused to give a direct answer to the
question  where  his loyalties would lie, that he  said  that  it
would   depend   on  the  circumstances  and  that   he   saw   a
responsibility both to the [GTAA] and to the body that  nominated
him.&#148; Cullity J.  then concluded as follows:

                    Ignoring the references to extraneous
	 matters and, for the moment, the attack that was
	 subsequently made on Mr. Parsons&#146; credibility, I
	 cannot  accept  that  the criticisms made of his
         cautious responses to the questions relating  to
	 directors&#146;  accountability,  responsibility   or
	 loyalty could reasonably support a decision that
	 there   was  a   sufficiently   high   degree of
         probability that he would not always act  in the
	 best   interests  of  the  respondent  [GTAA] to
	 justify       anticipatory     revocation     or 
	 disqualification.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  In  dealing  next  with  the Board&#146;s  conclusion  that  Mr.
Parsons&#146; account in his May 11 letter of what took place  at  the
interview  was untruthful, the applications judge held that  this
conclusion could not &#147;possibly be justified on the basis  of  the
evidence.&#148;  The applications judge found &#147;it quite extraordinary,
as  well  as  very  regrettable&#148; that the Board was  prepared  to
impugn Mr. Parsons&#146; credibility solely on the basis of the May 11
letter  without seeking further clarification. In his  view,  the
Board&#146;s conclusion with respect to Mr. Parsons&#146; credibility  &#147;was
unwarranted and unreasonable.&#148;
[20] Finally, the applications judge concluded as follows:

               A decision to set aside the decision of the
	 board does, of course, require more than the Court&#146;s
	 disagreement with it. The applicant must demonstrate
	 that it was not open to the board, acting reasonably,
	 to reach such a decision. The evidence on which the
	 board acted must be so deficient and inadequate as to
         justify a conclusion that no board of directors acting
	 reasonably in the exercise of its business judgment,
	 could have decided that it satisfied the stringent
	 test propounded by the respondent&#146;s corporate counsel.
	 On the facts of this case, I believe that a conclusion
	 that the decision of the board was not valid is required.
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  The  appellant  takes the position  that  the  Board  could
reasonably  conclude, based on the interview,  that  Mr.  Parsons
would  not  at all times act in the best interests of  the  GTAA.
Counsel  for  the appellant conceded, however, that any  concerns
the Board may have had arising from the interview would have been
adequately  answered by the May 11 letter, had this  letter  been
accepted  by the Board as truthful. Hence, the reasonableness  of
the  Board&#146;s conclusion that the letter was not credible  becomes
pivotal in the determination of this appeal.
[22] The GTAA submits that the applications judge, although
correct in his statement of the test, did not in substance apply
the test he articulated. The GTAA submits that the applications
judge effectively applied a different test, &#147;namely whether the
Board&#146;s assessment of the evidence before it was less reasonable
than the Court&#146;s alternative assessment of the evidence.&#148; In
support of this submission, the appellant relies mainly on the
applications judge&#146;s treatment of the May 11 letter.
[23] The appellant notes firstly that, at one point in his
judgment, Cullity J. stated as follows:

                    An inference that, in his letter to
	 Mr. Butt of May 11, Mr. Parsons intended to deny
	 that the question of his future motivation as a
	 director had been discussed is, in my judgment,
         far less reasonable than a conclusion that he
	 simply did not relate the allegation of a conflict
	 of interest to that question.
</pre>
    <pre>The appellant submits that this statement  demonstrates that  the
applications judge  was in effect  substituting his  own view for
that of the Board.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Secondly, the appellant argues that the applications judge&#146;s
conclusion  on  the meaning of the May 11 letter is  inconsistent
with   Mr.  Parsons&#146;  own  interpretation  of  the  letter   and,
consequently, demonstrates that he misapprehended the evidence on
this  crucial  point. The appellant submits that the applications
judge  focussed on the word &#147;position&#148; in the May 11  letter  and
concluded  that Mr. Parsons was in effect stating in  the  letter
that there was no question at the interview that he would not  be
in  a  &#147;position&#148; to act in the best interests of the GTAA.  This
latter  statement  would  be truthful  given  the  fact  that  no
questions were raised about Mr. Parsons holding any position with
Peel that would give rise to a duty that would conflict with  his
position  on  the  Board,  if appointed. However,  the  appellant
states that Mr. Parsons&#146; explanation of the letter was different.
The   appellant  notes  that,  in  his  affidavits   and   cross-
examination,  Mr.  Parsons stated that there were  no  &#147;questions
raised&#148; that he would not be in a position to act always  in  the
best  interest  of the GTAA and submits that he thereby  inferred
that  no discussion had taken place about his duty to act in  the
best interest of the GTAA, a proposition that was incorrect.
[25] I see no merit to this argument. It is based on an improper
dissecting of the applications judge&#146;s reasons. It is clear from
the reasons as a whole that the applications judge applied the
test that he articulated. Further, the applications judge&#146;s
conclusions on the May 11 letter are not inconsistent with Mr.
Parsons&#146; own evidence as contended. In my view, the appellant&#146;s
argument on this point amounts to a distinction without a
difference.
[26] In my view, the applications judge was correct in finding
that the Board&#146;s decision could not be supported by the evidence.
Since it is conceded that, absent the finding on the conflict of
interest question, there was no basis for rejecting Mr. Parsons&#146;
nomination, the applications judge was also correct in allowing
Peel&#146;s application and declaring that the Board&#146;s decision
contravened the GTAA By-law. The formal judgment also includes an
order that the Board was obliged to appoint Mr. Parsons as a
member and director of the GTAA. It would appear from the
judgment (at p.134) and from the materials filed by Mr. Parsons
that this order was made pursuant to Mr. Parsons&#146; request. No
issue was raised on appeal with respect to Mr. Parsons&#146;
entitlement to seek this relief on his own application. I
therefore see no basis to interfere with that part of the order.
[27] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre>
