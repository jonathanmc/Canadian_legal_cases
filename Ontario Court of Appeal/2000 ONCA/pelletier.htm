    <pre><strong>HEARD:         February 18, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from conviction by R. Riopelle J. dated April 30, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T

    <pre>[1]  After a trial the appellant was acquitted of charges of
having care and control of a motor vehicle while his ability to
drive was impaired by alcohol and while his blood alcohol level
exceeded 80 mg. of alcohol in 100 ml. of blood.  Upon appeal by
the Crown the summary conviction appeal judge entered a
conviction on the first charge and stayed the second.
[2]  The facts are not in dispute.  Around midnight on September
10, 1998, the appellant drove his car to the Mattagami Hotel in
Timmins and parked in the hotel parking lot.  Approximately two
hours later he left the bar of the hotel with a friend.  His
ability to drive was impaired by alcohol.  While walking to the
car the appellant saw an OPP cruiser parked about 200 feet away.
The appellant and his friend got into the car, the appellant in
the drivers seat.  They sat there without starting the car.
After about ten minutes the police approached and found the
appellant still sitting in the driver&#146;s seat, his seat belt
fastened and the keys to the car on the floor in front of the
driver&#146;s seat.
[3]  The trial judge found that the appellant had left the keys
in the car when he went into the hotel and that he had not picked
them up when he returned to the car.  He also found that the
appellant did not intend to drive the car when he got into the
driver&#146;s seat after returning from the hotel.  The appellant told
the officer that he and his friend intended to sleep for a while.
[4]  In acquitting, the trial judge found that the appellant had
rebutted the presumption under s. 258(1)(a) of the Criminal Code.
He also found that there was no evidence that the appellant took
control of the keys when he returned to the car.  The trial judge
concluded that because the vehicle could not be moved unless the
appellant took deliberate action to put the key in the ignition
there was no risk of the car becoming a danger to users of the
highway.  He therefore found that the appellant did not have care
and control of the car and acquitted on both charges.
[5]  The summary conviction appeal judge accepted the trial
judge&#146;s conclusion that the appellant had rebutted the
presumption under s. 258(1)(a).  He then considered whether,
absent the assistance of the presumption, the Crown had
established care and control.  He accepted that the appellant had
no immediate intention to drive the car, however, he went on to
say:
          </pre>
    <pre>	The point is, that in his intoxicated condition, 
	he [the appellant] had, at that moment, the 
	immediate capacity and the immediate means to 
	operate the vehicle if he chose to do so.  He
        could have changed his mind at any time.  He had 
	care and control.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  In our view, there was ample evidence to support a finding
that the appellant was in care and control of the vehicle.  The
undisputed evidence established that the appellant had the means
readily available to drive the car.  He was sitting in the
driver&#146;s seat.  Although the keys were not in the ignition they
were immediately accessible to him.  The appellant had driven the
car to the hotel.  When he left he was impaired and did not take
advantage of the hotel&#146;s shuttle bus service.  He told the police
that he intended to sleep for a while.  As the summary conviction
appeal court judge pointed out there was a risk that the
appellant would change his mind and drive the car.  There was
also the risk that, in his impaired condition, the appellant
would misjudge his level of impairment and drive the car while
his condition continued to pose a risk.
[7]  The appellant&#146;s conduct created a risk of danger.  We see no
basis to interfere with the conclusion of the summary conviction
appeal judge.  We would therefore dismiss the appeal.</pre></td>
