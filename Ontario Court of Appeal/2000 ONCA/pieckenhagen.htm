</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The issue on this appeal is whether a

exercising a power of sale is bound by the terms of existing tenancies.</span></p>

<h2 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-GB>FACTS</span></h2>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant is a tenant in an
apartment building pursuant to a written lease for the period from October 1,
1991 to September 30, 1992.  The
appellant entered this lease, with the previous corporate owner of the
building, an entity controlled by the appellant’s family.  The lease specifies a monthly rent of $212
with an additional $2 charge for parking privileges.  The lease contains the following renewal provision:</span></p>

<p class=MsoBlockText style='margin-bottom:18.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB>This tenancy agreement will renew itself on every suite anniversary
date for a 12 (twelve) month period on a yearly basis subject to the statutory
guideline increase as set by the Ministry of Housing annually.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The rental amount specified in the
lease was the legal maximum rent allowed by the <i>Residential Rent Regulation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R. 29.  The legal maximum rent was increased by
subsequent orders of the Rent Review Hearings Board, but the appellant
continued to pay the rent specified by his lease. </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On June 1, 1993, the first mortgagee
of the building took possession pursuant to its mortgage.  O'Shanter Development Company Ltd.
(“O'Shanter”) managed the building on behalf of the mortgagee in
possession.  In early 1994, O'Shanter
commenced proceedings for arrears of rent. 
When the appellant produced a copy of his lease to O'Shanter, the
proceedings were withdrawn.  On May 15,
1994, O'Shanter gave the appellant a notice of rent increase in accordance with
the lease advising of a monthly rent of $244.58 (including parking) for the
period September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995.

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>On June 6, 1994, the respondent,
1030553 Ontario Limited, purchased the building on a “no vendor
representations” basis pursuant to the exercise of a power of sale initiated by
the second mortgagee.  The respondent
did not see or obtain a copy of the appellant's lease prior to closing, nor was
the lease registered on title.  An agent
of the respondent had inspected O'Shanter's records prior to purchasing the
property that showed the amount of rent the appellant was paying.  The respondent did not ask for a copy of the
appellant’s lease.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>After the closing, the respondent
discovered that the appellant was occupying his apartment at a monthly rent
substantially below the market rate. 
The respondent served notices of rent increase in May of 1995, 1996 and
1997, based on the rent review orders. 
Despite these notices, the appellant continued to pay rent in the amount
of $250.  </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The respondent brought an application
pursuant to the <i>Landlord and Tenant Act</i>,
R.S.O. 1990, c. L 7, Part IV for arrears of rent of $17,007.66, for an order
terminating the tenancy, and for a writ of possession.  </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Application judge concluded that
the written lease was valid and binding on the applicant respondent and
dismissed the respondent’s application:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE>…I find that the written lease was a valid lease … The
tenancy agreement created by the written lease was, in my view, a year to year
tenancy at a monthly rental of $214 per month for the period October 1, 1991 to
September 30, 1992, and with statutory guideline increases annually
thereafter.  The rent payable for the
period commencing September 1, 1995 and thereafter should be based upon the
rent of $244.58 for the year September 1, 1994 to August 31, 1995, as set out
in the rental increase notice from O'Shanter to the respondent dated May 15,
1994. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt;'><span
lang=EN-GB>He further concluded that this holding
was not unfair to the respondent:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE>[T]he applicant purchased the building from a mortgagee
in possession on the basis of “no vendor representations”.  This did not prevent the applicant from
undertaking adequate due diligence and determining the status of the various
apartment leases and apartment rents.  …
It seems to me that, in all the circumstances, more adequate due diligence by
the applicant… would have resulted in the applicant becoming aware of the situation
with respect to the disputes as to the rent for Apartment 109, and ultimately
becoming aware of the written lease, and taking that into account in
negotiating the purchase price for the building.  The applicant cannot now come to court and ask the court to
remedy the results of its failure to adequately investigate the situation with
respect to the lease of Apartment 109 prior to closing its purchase of the
building.</p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The respondent appealed the dismissal
of the application to the Divisional Court. 
The Divisional Court raised, on its own motion, an argument not advanced

the lands in question are subject to the <i>Land

<p class=headingQUOTE>44.--(1) All registered land, unless the contrary is

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Writing for a unanimous court, O’Leary
J. found that the renewal provision rendered the term of the lease to be “for a
period yet to run” of more than three years. 
He held that it followed that as the lease was not registered, and as
the respondent had no knowledge of it terms, the respondent was not bound by
the lease by virtue of the <i>Land Titles
Act</i>, s. 44.  The Court concluded,
accordingly, that the respondent was entitled to deal with the appellant as if
the appellant did not have the benefit of the lease in question.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Following the release of the
Divisional Court’s reasons for judgment, counsel for the appellant drew to the
Court’s attention ss. 44 and 45 of the <i>Mortgages
Amendment Act</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 6 [now <i>Mortgages
Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 40, ss. 46, 47 as amended by 1991, c. 6, s. 2, as

<p class=headingQUOTE>46.(1) In the event of a conflict between this Part and
any other provision of this Act or any other Act, this Part prevails unless the
provision or the Act states that it is to prevail over this Part.</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE>47. (1) A person who becomes the mortgagee in possession
of a mortgaged residential complex which is the subject of a tenancy agreement
between the mortgagor and a tenant or who obtains title to the residential
complex by foreclosure or power of sale shall be deemed to be the landlord
under the tenancy agreement.</p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The Divisional Court rejected the
appellant's argument that these provisions gave the appellant security of
tenure against the respondent and overcame the effect of the <i>Land Titles Act</i>. In an addendum to his
earlier reasons, O’Leary J. held that the <i>Mortgages
Amendment Act</i> had no application where the landlord had acquired title by
purchasing the lands pursuant to the exercise of a power of sale: </span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE>A purchaser who buys property from a mortgagee does not
obtain title by power of sale.  The
mortgagee may have sold the property by exercising his power of sale rights,
but in neither legal nor colloquial language is it said nor can it be said that
the purchaser obtained title or acquired the property by power of sale.  The purchaser has nothing to do with nor is
he granted any rights by the power of sale provisions in the mortgage. … A
person who buys from a mortgagee selling under power of sale, never becomes a
mortgagee in possession. … Section 45(1) [now s. 47(1)] then does not apply to
a person that buys property from a mortgagee who sold under power of sale. </p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In my view, it is apparent that the
“mischief” addressed by the <i>Mortgages
Amendment Act</i> was the vulnerability of tenants in residential complexes to
being disrupted in their tenancy by changes in possession and title resulting
from mortgage default by the landlord or owner of the property.  Before the <i>Mortgages Amendment Act, </i>tenants lacked security of tenure as
against mortgagees in possession, those who obtained title by foreclosure, and
subsequent purchasers who acquired title in power of sale proceedings.  It was held in <i>Canada Trust Co. Mortgage Company v. Hurst</i> (1989), 71 O.R. (2d) 294
(L.J.S.C.) that a mortgagee in possession was not a party to and was not bound
by the terms of a tenancy agreement between the mortgagor and the tenant.  It followed that a mortgagee in possession
was not a “landlord” and according, was not caught by the terms of the <i>Landlord and Tenant Act</i> (see now the <i>Tenant Protection Act</i>, 1997) protecting
tenants by restricting the right of the “landlord” to terminate a residential
tenancy.  Accordingly a party who
obtained possession or title by virtue of mortgage default could obtain vacant
possession despite the existence of a landlord and tenant relationship between
the mortgagor and its tenants.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The purpose and intent of the <i>Mortgages Amendment Act </i>was to overcome
this state of affairs and to provide tenants with security of tenure in the
event of mortgage default by the landlord. 
The <i>Mortgages Act,</i> s.47
specifically puts those persons described in the position of the landlord under
the tenancy agreement.  </span></p>

namely: (1) a “mortgagee in possession”, (2) a person “who obtains title …by

the meaning to be given the words “a person…who obtains title by power of

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>It is my respectful view that in light
of the language and purpose of this legislation, the Divisional Court erred in
its interpretation of the words “a person…who obtains title by power of
sale”.  While I agree that it would have
been possible for the legislature to use more precise language, as I read the
words of the section, the language is adequate to embrace a party who acquires
title by purchasing lands from a mortgagee exercising a power of sale.  If the words of the legislation do not
convey that meaning, it is difficult to see what they do mean.  A mortgagee who exercises a power of sale
does not “obtain title by power of sale”. If these words include anyone, the
only candidate seems to be a person who purchases the property through the
exercise of the power of sale.  A court
should strive to give some meaning to the words of a statute rather than
interpret in a way that render it meaningless: <i>Grand Trunk Pacific Railway Co. v. Dearborn </i>(1919), 58 S.C.R. 315
at 320-321; <i>Williams v. Box </i>(1910),
44 S.C.R. 1 at 24. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I accept the contention that a
purchaser under of power of sale is in a different, perhaps more vulnerable,
position than a mortgagee.  However, as
noted by the appellant, such purchasers are not bereft of protection.  The mortgagee exercising power of sale has
the right to obtain a copy of the lease (s. 50(2)) or to set aside tenancy
agreements entered into after default with the object interfering with the
mortgagee’s rights (s. 52(1)).  It would
be open to the purchaser under power of sale to insist that these rights be
exercised as a condition of the agreement to purchase the property.  As noted, the respondent chose to purchase
the property on a “no vendor representations” basis.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The respondent relies on the statutory
heading “Mortgagees in Possession of Residential Premises” to Part V of the <i>Mortgages Act</i>, the part of the Act
containing ss. 46 and 47. I do not accept the respondent’s submission that this
heading restricts the reach of the section. 
Headings may be resorted to as an interpretive aid, but they do not trump
the actual language of the section, nor should they frustrate its purpose. In
my view, the language of the section indicates a legislative attempt to deal
comprehensively with the security of tenure of tenants in the event of mortgage
default and consequent change in possession or title.  The section should be given “such fair, large and liberal
construction and interpretation as will best ensure the attainment of the
object of the Act according to its true intent, meaning and spirit”: <i>Interpretation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
I.11, s. 10.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>I conclude, therefore, that the
Divisional Court erred in finding that the respondent was not bound by the
terms of the appellant’s lease.  The <i>Mortgages Act</i>, s. 47 applies and, in
accordance with s. 46, prevails to the extent there is any conflict with the <i>Land Titles Act</i> in the absence of any
explicit provision to the contrary.  It
follows that it is not necessary to consider the alternative submission
advanced by the appellant that the Divisional Court erred in finding that the
renewal clause rendered this lease subject to the <i>Land Titles Act.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-GB>Issue 2 
<u>Did the Divisional Court exceed its appellate function by determining
that the <i>Land Titles Act</i> was
dispositive of this matter, given that it had not been raised in the pleadings,
nor before the trial judge, and was not raised in the notice of appeal to the
Divisional Court?</u></span></b></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In view of my disposition of the first
issue, it is not necessary to consider the second.  However, an issue does arise under this heading.  By raising the <i>Land Titles Act</i> issue on its own motion, the Divisional Court
avoided addressing the issues that the respondent did raise in its appeal.  In its factum, the respondent submits that
if the appeal is allowed, the matter should be sent back to the Divisional
Court for a determination of the grounds of appeal the respondent did
raise.  In my view, in the unusual
circumstances of this case, the respondent is entitled to this relief.  The respondent had an appeal as of right to
the Divisional Court from the dismissal of its application and if the matter
were not remitted to the Divisional Court, the respondent would, through no
fault of its own, effectively be denied its right of appeal.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal,
set aside the order of the Divisional Court, and direct that the matter be sent
back to the Divisional Court for consideration of the grounds of appeal raised
by the respondent in its notice of appeal from the judgment of the applications
judge. The appellant is entitled to his costs of this appeal and of the appeal
to the Divisional Court.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The appellant also seeks an order for
the return of the additional rental monies paid in accordance with the decision
of the Divisional Court.  As I would
allow the appeal and restore the judgment of the applications judge, it follows
that the appellant is entitled to the return of rental payments in excess of
the amount he was required to make by virtue of the judgment restored. </span></p>
