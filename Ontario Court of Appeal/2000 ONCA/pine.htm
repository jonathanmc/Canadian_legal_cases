    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]   The  trial  judge  gave detailed and  careful  reasons  for
finding  that self-defence was not available to what he found  to
be a separate act of throwing the rock.  It was open to the trial
judge  to  make  that finding of fact.  The trial judge  properly
applied  the law in light of that finding.  We do not agree  that
he  failed to consider the subjective elements of self-defence or
that  he  in  any other way misdirected himself with  respect  to
s.34(2) of the Criminal Code.
[2]  In view of the finding that the throwing of the rock was an
act of punishment not based on the necessity of self-defence, on
that ground alone s.34(1) of the Criminal Code was not available.
Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.
[3]  As to sentence, we agree with the trial judge&#146;s reasons for
sentence and, in particular, agree with him that this was not a
proper case for a conditional sentence.  Accordingly, the appeal
from sentence is also dismissed.
