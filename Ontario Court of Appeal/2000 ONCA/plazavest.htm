    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Madam Justice Sanderson dated
September 10, 1998.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>DOHERTY J.A.:
                                
</strong>				I
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant (&#147;Plazavest&#148;) borrowed money from the
respondent, the National Bank of Canada (&#147;National&#148;).  As a term
of that loan agreement, Plazavest agreed to pay National&#146;s legal
fees relating to the loan transaction.  National retained the
respondent, Kelly Affleck Greene (&#147;Kelly Affleck&#148;) who provided
legal services and eventually submitted their bill to National.
National requested that Plazavest pay the bill, and when
Plazavest declined, National, pursuant to a term of the loan
agreement with Plazavest, paid the bill from funds held in
Plazavest&#146;s account.  Plazavest then brought an application
seeking an order directing that National deliver copies of Kelly
Affleck&#146;s legal bills to Plazavest and an order directing that
the bills be referred for assessment pursuant to the Solicitors
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15 (the &#147;Act&#148;).
[2]  Sanderson J. held that Plazavest had paid the bills prior to
seeking an assessment and was required under s. 11 of the Act to
demonstrate that &#147;the special circumstances of the case &#133; appear
to require the assessment.&#148;  She examined the language of the
agreement between Plazavest and National and concluded that as
Plazavest was required to pay &#147;all legal expenses actually
charged&#148; to National, it could not demonstrate &#147;special
circumstances&#148; justifying an order directing an assessment.
Having reached this conclusion, it was unnecessary for her to
decide whether National should be required to give copies of the
legal bills to Plazavest.
[3]  Plazavest appeals.
[4]  I agree with Sanderson J. that s. 11 of the Act applies and
that Plazavest was required to show &#147;special circumstances.&#148;
With respect, however, I do not agree that the language of the
agreement between Plazavest and National was determinative of
whether &#147;special circumstances&#148; existed.  I think that the
entirety of the circumstances, including but not limited to the
terms of the agreement, should have been considered in deciding
whether Plazavest had established &#147;special circumstances.&#148;  On
the view I take of the entirety of the circumstances, Plazavest
demonstrated &#147;special circumstances&#148; and was entitled to an order
directing an assessment.</pre>
    <pre>				II</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Plazavest and National initially entered into a loan
agreement in 1990.  Under the terms of that agreement, Plazavest
was required to pay National&#146;s &#147;reasonable&#148; legal fees and
expenses incurred in relation to the transactions described in
the agreement.  In April and May of 1997, Plazavest and National
entered into a new agreement restructuring Plazavest&#146;s loan
arrangements with National (the &#147;1997 agreement&#148;).  The 1997
agreement called for a loan in the amount of $2,235,000.  Under
the terms of the 1997 agreement, Plazavest was obligated to pay
&#147;the actual fees and expenses&#148; of National&#146;s solicitors incurred
in relation to the transactions described in the agreement.
Under the terms of the 1997 agreement, not only was Plazavest
liable to pay the actual legal fees and expenses incurred by
National, but National could pay those fees and expenses from
funds held in Plazavest&#146;s account with National.
[6]  Kelly Affleck performed legal services in connection with
the transactions described in the 1997 agreement between December
1996 and July 1997.  It submitted five bills to National
totalling $32,564.24.  The fifth bill was sent to National in
July 1997.
[7]  On October 21, 1997, National wrote to Plazavest requesting
that Plazavest pay the amount owing ($32,564.24) directly to
Kelly Affleck at Plazavest&#146;s &#147;earliest convenience.&#148;  A copy of
the fifth account (July 15, 1997) in the amount of $1,499.61 was
enclosed in the October 21st letter.  That account provided some
details of the work done by Kelly Affleck between June 1, 1997
and June 30, 1997.  That account also referred to the amounts
owing on the four previous accounts that had been submitted to
National.  The material sent to Plazavest did not, however,
provide any details with respect to the four previous accounts
other than the amount owing on each account.
[8]  At some unspecified date after Plazavest received the letter
of October 21, 1997, Mr. Phillip Meretsky, the solicitor for
Plazavest, asked National for copies of the first four accounts.
National refused to provide the copies.  Mr. Meretsky advised
National that Plazavest could not agree with the quantum of the
bills and would assess the accounts if no agreement could be
reached.
[9]  On December 19, 1997, National wrote to Plazavest stating:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; Please be advised that we have incurred legal fees in
the total amount of $34,000 for the Borrowers&#146; account 
in respect of this matter.  Payment of this amount is 
requested prior to December 31, 1997, failing which we 
shall deduct same from the $154,616.10 payment made by 
the Borrowers in accordance with Article 7.4 of the Loan 
Agreement.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10] The affidavit of Mr. Kennedy filed by National on the
application contains the following assertion:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The Moving Parties [Plazavest] did not pay the outstanding
Kelly Affleck Greene accounts.  Accordingly, on December 
18, 1998,1 the Bank applied a portion of monies received 
by it on account of the Moving Parties&#146; indebtedness, 
pursuant to the terms of the Loan Agreement, on account of 
the outstanding Kelly Affleck Greene accounts.  The Bank 
remitted these monies to Kelly Affleck Greene in 
satisfaction of its accounts.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[11] In oral argument, counsel for National indicated that in
fact the funds owed to Kelly Affleck had been segregated from the
other funds held on behalf of Plazavest as of December 18, 1997,
but were not paid to Kelly Affleck until some subsequent
unspecified date.  I do not read Mr. Kennedy&#146;s affidavit as
drawing the distinction made by counsel.  In my view, the
affidavit must be read as indicating that National exercised its
rights under the 1997 agreement to pay the amounts owed to Kelly
Affleck on December 18, 1997, while at the same time indicating
that payment would not be made until December 31st. It does not
appear, however, that National&#146;s precipitous action prejudiced
Plazavest.  There is no suggestion that Plazavest would have
moved to assess the bill between December 19th and December 31st.
This application was not commenced until July 1998.
[12] Prior to the return of the application, National did deliver
copies of the first four accounts to Plazavest.  These accounts
provide details of the work done by Kelly Affleck.  Several
entries in each of the accounts were, however, &#147;blacked-out&#148; in
the copies provided to Plazavest.  National claimed client-
solicitor privilege with respect to the edited entries.</pre>
    <pre>				III</pre>
    <pre>[13] Counsel for National submitted that the 1997 agreement
constituted a waiver by Plazavest of any right it may have had to
an assessment of the legal accounts.  In advancing this position,
she placed considerable reliance on Plazavest&#146;s agreement to pay
all &#147;actual&#148; legal fees and expenses relating to the transaction.
She contrasted this commitment with Plazavest&#146;s agreement in 1990
to pay &#147;reasonable&#148; legal fees and expenses.  She argued that
while a commitment to pay &#147;reasonable&#148; legal fees contemplated a
review by a neutral arbiter of the fees claimed, a promise to pay
&#147;actual&#148; legal fees did not envision any such review.  It does
not appear that this argument was made before Sanderson J.
[14] The rendering of legal services and the determination of
appropriate compensation for those services is not solely a
private matter to be left entirely to the parties.  There is a
public interest component relating to the performance of legal
services and the compensation paid for them.  That public
interest component requires that the court maintain a supervisory
role over disputes relating to the payment of lawyers&#146; fees.  I
adopt the comments of Adams J. in Borden &amp; Elliott v. Barclays
Bank of Canada (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 352 at 357-58 (Gen. Div.),
where he said:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; The Solicitors Act begins with s. 1 reflecting the legal
profession&#146;s monopoly status.  This beneficial status or
privilege of the profession is coupled with corresponding
obligations set out in the Act and which make clear that 
the rendering of legal services is not simply a matter of 
contract.  This is not to say a contract to pay a specific 
amount for legal fees cannot prevail.  It may.  But even 
that kind of agreement can be the subject of review for 
fairness:  see s. 18 of the Solicitors Act.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[15] The observation of Adams J. that the rendering and payment
of legal accounts is not &#147;simply a matter of contract&#148; finds
support in a long established line of authority which recognizes,
apart entirely from the Act, that a superior court has an
inherent jurisdiction, as part of its disciplinary authority over
lawyers, to direct the assessment of lawyers&#146; fees:  Re Peel
Terminal Warehouses Ltd. and Wootten, Rinaldo &amp; Rosenfeld (1978),
21 O.R. (2d) 857 at 861 (C.A.);  Minkarious v. Abraham, Duggan
(1995), 44 C.P.C. (3d) 210 at 242 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).
[16] The provisions of the Solicitors Act also offer full support
for the conclusion reached by Adams J.  Sections 16 to 36 of the
Act recognize that clients and solicitors may enter into written
agreements concerning payments for legal services.  These
sections do not, however, suggest that those agreements oust the
assessment process.  To the contrary, they provide detailed
provisions for the assessment of legal fees rendered pursuant to
written agreements between lawyers and their clients.
[17] Although I would reject the contention that an agreement
between a client and a lawyer may preclude the client from
resorting to the Act or the inherent power of the court to seek
an assessment of the lawyer&#146;s fees, I do not mean to suggest that
the existence of such a contract and the terms of that contract
are of no significance.  As Adams J. said, the terms of the
agreement may in the end prevail and dictate the fees to be paid.
Furthermore, where the party seeking an assessment must show
special circumstances, the terms of the agreement may figure
prominently in the determination of whether those special
circumstances exist:  Borden &amp; Elliott v. Barclays Bank of
Canada, supra, at 358-59.
[18] The agreement relied on in this case is not between the
client (National) and the solicitor (Kelly Affleck), but rather,
is between the client (National) and the borrower (Plazavest).
Under the terms of that agreement, Plazavest is liable to pay
National&#146;s actual legal fees and expenses.  Section 9(1) of the
Act is directly applicable to Plazavest.  The relevant words
provide:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Where a person, not being chargeable as the principal 
party, is liable to pay or has paid a bill &#133; to the 
solicitor, &#133; the person so liable to pay or paying, 
&#133; may apply to the court for an order referring to 
assessment as the party chargeable therewith might 
have done, and the same proceedings shall be had
thereupon as if the application had been made by the 
party so chargeable.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] Section 9(1) of the Act puts Plazavest in the same position
as National in so far as the assessment of Kelly Affleck&#146;s bill
is concerned.  If an agreement between National and Kelly Affleck
to pay the firm&#146;s actual fees could not pre-empt an application
by National to assess those fees, it must follow that the same
agreement between the client and a third party to pay actual
legal fees does not place those fees beyond the pale of the
assessment process should the third party seek to resort to that
process.
[20] Apart entirely from the general question of whether those
liable to pay legal fees can waive a right to assess a lawyer&#146;s
bill, the actual terms of the agreement between Plazavest and
National do not provide any evidence of a waiver.  Plazavest
agreed to pay National&#146;s actual fees and legal expenses relating
to the transactions encompassed in the loan agreement.
Certainly, there is no express agreement to waive any right to
assess those costs.  Nor can I accept that it was implicit in
Plazavest&#146;s agreement to pay actual legal fees relating to the
transactions that it would not challenge whether the fees were
&#147;actual&#148; or whether the fees related to transactions encompassed
by the loan agreement.  An agreement to pay &#147;actual&#148; legal fees
cannot be read as an agreement to pay all fees &#147;actually
charged.&#148;  Actual fees refer to fees for work done within the
scope of the retainer.  For example, if Kelly Affleck&#146;s bill
inadvertently included charges for work done on a file unrelated
to the 1997 loan agreement, those charges would not be part of
the &#147;actual&#148; legal fees referred to in the 1997 agreement even
though they would be part of the fees &#147;actually charged&#148; by Kelly
Affleck.
[21] In my view, the 1997 agreement between Plazavest and
National described the scope of Plazavest&#146;s obligation to pay
National&#146;s legal bills, but said nothing about Plazavest&#146;s
entitlement to challenge the propriety of those bills.  Even if
Plazavest could waive its right to seek an assessment under the
Act, it did not do so in the 1997 agreement.
[22] In an alternative but related submission, the respondent
argued that Plazavest could not seek an assessment under the
general provisions of the Act (ss. 1-14) as it did, but could
only rely on the provisions governing assessment where there is
an agreement as to the fee to be paid (ss. 15-33).  The
respondent contends that the 1997 agreement constitutes an
agreement for the purposes of ss. 15-33 of the Act.  This
argument was also not advanced before Sanderson J.
[23] Sections 15 to 33 of the Act speak to situations in which
there is a written agreement between the lawyer and a &#147;client&#148;
respecting the manner and amount of payment of the lawyer&#146;s fees.
While Plazavest is a &#147;client&#148; under the expanded definition of
that word in s.15 of the Act, there was no written agreement
between Kelly Affleck and Plazavest.  Nor, for that matter, was
there any evidence of a written agreement between Kelly Affleck
and National concerning Kelly Affleck&#146;s fees.  I do not think
that ss. 15 to 33 have any application, direct or by analogy, to
written agreements to pay legal fees to which the lawyer claiming
the fees is not a party.  The sections are intended to reflect
and manifest the court&#146;s supervisory power over agreements
involving lawyers for the payments of lawyers&#146; fees.  The
sections do not reach arrangements between clients and third
parties referable to the payment of the client&#146;s legal fees.2</pre>
    <pre>				IV</pre>
    <pre>[24] Having concluded that the 1997 agreement did not preclude
Plazavest&#146;s resort to the  Act, I must now determine which
section of the Act applies.  By operation of s. 9(1) of the Act,
Plazavest&#146;s entitlement to an assessment is the same as that
which would be available to the actual client (National) in the
same circumstances.
[25] Counsel for Plazavest submitted that s. 3(a) or s. 3(b) of
the Act applies and that since the application was brought within
12 months of the delivery of the bills, Plazavest is entitled to
an assessment and need not demonstrate special circumstances.3
[26] National and Kelly Affleck submit that the bill was paid
prior to, but within 12 months of the application for an
assessment, and that s. 11 of the Act applies.  It provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The payment of a bill does not preclude the court from
referring it for assessment, if the application is made 
within twelve months after payment, and if the special 
circumstances of the case, in the opinion of the court, 
appear to require the assessment.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27] It is Plazavest&#146;s position that the phrase &#147;the payment of a
bill&#148; in s. 11 refers to payments made voluntarily by the party
responsible for the payment.  It contends that the payment made
from Plazavest&#146;s account to Kelly Affleck by National was not a
voluntary payment, but was in fact made in the face of
Plazavest&#146;s objection to payment of the bill.
[28] Plazavest relies on Re Randell and Robins &amp; Robins (1979),
22 O.R. (2d) 642 (H.C.J.).  In Re Randell, the solicitors
obtained a judgment for their client.  They deducted the amount
owing on their fees and remitted the balance of the judgment to
the client.  After receipt of those funds, the client moved for
an assessment of the bill.  The law firm argued that the bill had
been paid and, therefore, under s. 10 (now s. 11) of the Act, the
client was required to show &#147;special circumstances&#148; justifying an
assessment.  While it would appear there was no specific
agreement between the client and the firm permitting the firm to
deduct its fees from the judgment, Eberle J. made it clear that
it was not suggested that the solicitors acted improperly in
doing so.
[29] Eberle J. acknowledged that for many purposes, payment of
the account had been made.  He then said, at p. 643:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; However, when I consider the intention of s. 10 [now s.
11], it seems clear to me that the reason why a client who 
has paid an account is required to show special circumstances 
in order to have the account taxed, is because the payment of 
the account indicates that the client accepts the amount of 
the account as being proper.  That is, that payment is an 
implied acceptance of the reasonableness of the account.  Can 
one make that implication in the circumstances of this case &#150;
circumstances of payment which are not uncommon?  In my view
&#145;no&#146;;  one cannot make that implication, and I am, therefore,
driven to the conclusion that although, for many purposes, the
solicitors&#146; account has been paid, for purposes of s. 10 a
voluntary action on the part of the client on making the payment
is required before one can infer an acceptance by the client of
the propriety of the bill.  Therefore, in my view, the special
circumstances required by s. 10 of the Solicitors Act where 
there has been payment of a bill need not here be shown.  
[Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[30] I agree with Eberle J.&#146;s description of the purpose
underlying s. 11 of the Act.  Payment of the bill is generally
seen as an implied acceptance by the payor of the propriety of
the bill.  Absent special circumstances, the payor should not be
allowed to resile from its implied acceptance of the propriety of
the bill.  I think, however, that the purpose underlying s. 11 is
not served by attempting to distinguish between voluntary and
involuntary payments.  The distinction is not an easy one to
make.  Plazavest argues that the payment of the bill was not
voluntary because National made the payment from Plazavest&#146;s
account over Plazavest&#146;s objection.  National argues that
Plazavest agreed, as part of the 1997 agreement, that National
could unilaterally make the payment.  National contends that a
payment made pursuant to an agreement, the validity of which is
not challenged, is a voluntary payment.
[31] I would avoid any attempt to characterize a payment as
voluntary and involuntary, but instead distinguish between
payments that are authorized by the payor and those that are not
authorized.  Where the payment is authorized by the payor, I
would hold that it is a payment for the purposes of s. 11 of the
Act.  Plazavest agreed that it would pay National&#146;s actual legal
fees and expenses.  It also agreed that National could
unilaterally pay those fees and expenses from Plazavest&#146;s account
if Plazavest did not pay them.  These were two terms of a complex
bargain struck between National and Plazavest by which Plazavest
gained access to financing in excess of $2 million.  There is no
suggestion that the agreement does not reflect the bargain made
between National and Plazavest or that there is any reason why
the court should not enforce that bargain.  Indeed, I do not
understand Plazavest to contend that National was not entitled to
pay the bill.
[32] In my opinion, the payment was authorized by Plazavest under
the terms of the 1997 agreement and is a payment of the bill for
the purposes of s. 11 of the Act.  Plazavest&#146;s objection to
paying the bill could not make the payment unauthorized since
Plazavest had agreed in advance that National could unilaterally
make the payment.  Plazavest was, therefore, entitled to an
assessment only if it could show that the special circumstances
of the case appeared to require an assessment.</pre>
    <pre>				V</pre>
    <pre>[33] Section 11 refers to &#147;special circumstances&#148;, which &#147;in the
opinion of the court appear to require the assessment.&#148;  This
language clearly implies that assessment after payment will be
the exception rather than the rule.  It further contemplates that
in determining whether to order an assessment, the court has a
broad discretion to be exercised on a case-by-case basis and with
an eye to all of the relevant circumstances.  As was said in
Minkarious v. Abraham, Duggan, supra, at 236:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; exceptional circumstances of either a contractual or an
equitable nature could lead a court to find that an 
assessment is necessary or essential on general principles 
or is called for as being appropriate or suitable in the 
particular case.  &#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[34] In deciding whether special circumstances exist, the court
may take into consideration the fact that payment was made by a
third party and not by the client.  Section 9(2) of the Act
provides in part:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; the court may take into consideration any additional
special circumstances applicable to the person making 
it [the payment], although such circumstances might not 
be applicable to the party chargeable with the bill [the 
client] if he, she or it was the party making the 
application.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[35] Section 9(2) of the Act reflects the reality that a third
party required to pay a legal bill will often not be in as good a
position as the client to determine the propriety of that bill.
In Tory, Tory, DesLauriers and Binnington v. Concert Productions
International Inc. (1985), 7 C.P.C. (2d) 54 (Ont. H.C.J.), Steele
J. considered a case in which a borrower committed to pay the
lender&#146;s legal fees as part of the financing arrangements.  The
borrower subsequently sought to assess those fees.  Steele J.
said, at p. 57:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; A third party under s. 8 [now s. 9] can be in no higher
status than the party itself, and therefore, in my opinion,
special circumstances are required to be shown by the 
applicant herein.  However, s. 8(2) [s. 9(2)] allows the 
court to consider any extra circumstances.  A third party 
is not per se automatically entitled to be said to have 
special circumstances, although it should be given more 
favourable consideration than the party who paid the 
account.  The facts in each case must be considered on 
their merits.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[36] Bearing in mind the comments of Steele J. and the need to
consider all of the circumstances of the case, three factors are
particularly significant in determining whether special
circumstances exist here.  First, the payment to Kelly Affleck
was made on Plazavest&#146;s behalf by National over the express
objection of Plazavest.  Plazavest had made it clear that it did
not agree with the amounts claimed in the bills provided to
National by Kelly Affleck.  In this circumstance, the normal
inference concerning the propriety of the bills flowing from the
payment of the bills cannot be made.  It cannot be said that
Plazavest is seeking to challenge legal bills which, by its
earlier conduct, it had accepted as appropriate.  To the
contrary, in bringing this application, Plazavest was maintaining
the same position it had taken from the time it was first advised
of the amount of the bill.  Denying an assessment in these
circumstances does not further the purpose underlying s. 11 of
the Act:  see Enterprise Rent-a-Car v. Shapiro, Cohen, Andrews,
Finlayson, supra, at 265.
[37] Second, when Plazavest initiated this application, it had
virtually no information concerning the work done by Kelly
Affleck for which the law firm was claiming fees in excess of
$32,000.00.  Plazavest was not the client and could not have
first hand knowledge of what work Kelly Affleck had done on the
relevant transactions.  Plazavest requested the bills when
National demanded payment.  National provided one bill referable
to a very small part of the overall amount claimed by Kelly
Affleck but refused to provide the remaining bills.  In effect,
National took the position that Plazavest was obligated to pay
the legal fees but was not entitled to any information concerning
the work done to earn those fees.  National eventually modified
its position somewhat and did provide Plazavest with the bills
given to it by Kelly Affleck.  The bills given to Plazavest were,
however, edited on the basis of solicitor-client privilege and
gave Plazavest only partial information as to the work done by
Kelly Affleck.  The edited bills were provided long after
National had paid the bill from Plazavest&#146;s account.
[38] National&#146;s refusal to give the bills to Plazavest before
paying the legal fees from Plazavest&#146;s account, and its
subsequent providing of only edited bills to Plazavest are
important factors which tells in favour of directing an
assessment.  A third party who has agreed to pay a client&#146;s legal
bills is entitled, subject to any sustainable solicitor-client
privilege claim, to information in the client&#146;s possession which
is relevant to the determination of whether the legal bills are
properly payable by the third party.
[39] I would think that in the normal course, a client in the
position of National should provide copies of the legal bills to
the third party who was responsible for paying those bills.  If
the client has legitimate concerns that the bills will reveal
information protected by the solicitor-client privilege, the
client should provide the third party with a description of the
legal work done and the fees charged for that work which will
protect the privilege but still allow the third party to make an
informed decision as to its obligation to pay that bill.
[40] Had National been more forthcoming in providing details as
to the services rendered by Kelly Affleck, it may well have
avoided this application altogether.  At a minimum, it would have
been in a much better position to argue that Plazavest could not
demonstrate &#147;special circumstances.&#148;
[41] The third factor to be considered is the wording of the
terms of the agreement between Plazavest and National.  This was
the factor which Sanderson J. regarded as determinative against
Plazavest on the special circumstances inquiry.
[42] Plazavest argued that a term requiring that the legal fees
be reasonable should be implied into the 1997 agreement.  I
cannot accept that submission.  The 1990 agreement referred to
&#147;reasonable&#148; legal fees and expenses.  The parties chose to
change that term in the 1997 agreement and Plazavest agreed to
pay &#147;actual&#148; legal fees and expenses.  I see no reason why the
court should ignore the change in the language made by the
parties.
[43] I do not, however, accept National&#146;s submission that the
language of the agreement tells against an assessment.  Plazavest
agreed to pay actual legal fees and expenses incurred in relation
to the transactions arising out of the loan agreement.  Given
National&#146;s position, Plazavest had no way, other than through the
assessment process, of determining whether the amounts claimed in
the bills met these two criteria.  I see nothing in the language
of the 1997 agreement which should foreclose Plazavest&#146;s resort
to an independent arbiter to determine whether the fees claimed
in fact came within the description of the fees which Plazavest
had agreed to pay.  The analysis of Adams J. in Re Borden &amp;
Elliot v. Barclays Bank of Canada, supra, at 358-59, although
directed to an agreement requiring that the third party pay
&#147;reasonable&#148; fees, seems to me to have equal application to the
1997 agreement.  Plazavest agreed to pay actual legal fees and
expenses incurred in relation to the loan transaction.  It did
not agree to pay any and all fees claimed by Kelly Affleck.  The
terms of the 1997 loan agreement may well limit the arguments
available to Plazavest on an assessment, but in my view they
should not preclude that assessment.
[44] Plazavest was entitled to satisfy itself that the legal fees
and expenses which were claimed met the criteria set out in the
1997 agreement.  National chose to deny Plazavest the relevant
information and to pay Kelly Affleck&#146;s fees from Plazavest&#146;s
account over Plazavest&#146;s express objection.  Absent an assessment
by Plazavest, there will be no independent review of the fees and
no way of knowing whether they are truly covered by the 1997
agreement.  In my view, these factors combine to constitute
special circumstances within the meaning of s. 11 of the Act.
This is a case where an assessment should be ordered.</pre>
    <pre>				VI</pre>
    <pre>[45] As I would order an assessment, I must address the solicitor-
client privilege claim made by National.  National contends that
many of the entries in the bills provided by Kelly Affleck are
protected by solicitor-client privilege.  National cannot, of
course, have the final say on this issue.  The unedited accounts
should be produced to the assessment officer who may examine them
and determine what part, if any, should be protected by the
solicitor-client privilege.  The assessment officer may also have
to consider whether the terms of the 1997 agreement constitute a
waiver of any solicitor-client privilege claim in so far as it
relates to Plazavest&#146;s obligation to pay National&#146;s legal bills.
Any bill or part of a bill which is not protected by the
privilege should be turned over to Plazavest.  The assessment
officer may, if he or she can do so without compromising the
privilege, also provide Plazavest with a summary of any of the
information which has been determined to be protected by the
solicitor-client privilege.</pre>
    <pre>				VII</pre>
    <pre>[46] I would allow the appeal, set aside the order below, and
direct an assessment subject to the conditions set out above.
Plazavest is entitled to its costs here and below.

1 The parties agree that this a typographical error and should be
December 18, 1997.
2 Even if ss. 15 to 33 applied, s. 25 would appear to put
Plazavest in virtually the same position it would be in if s. 11
applied.  Section 25 would allow Plazavest to apply to &#147;re-open&#148;
the agreement under which the legal fees were paid.  If Plazavest
could demonstrate &#147;special circumstances&#148; the court could order
the agreement re-opened and the fees assessed.
3 Given the conclusion I have reached, I need not decide whether
Plazavest&#146;s application does fall within s. 3(a) or s.3(b) of the
Act.  Arguably, it is an application brought more than one month
after delivery of the bill and less than 12 months after delivery
of the bill and therefore falls into the &#147;gap&#148; in the Act
recognized by this court in Re Peel Terminal Warehouses Ltd. v.
Wootten, Rinaldo and Rosenfeld, supra:  see also Krigstin v.
Samuel (1982), 31 C.P.C. 41 (Ont. H.C.J.);  Enterprise Rent-a-Car
Company v. Shapiro, Cohen, Andrews, Finlayson (1998), 38 O.R.
