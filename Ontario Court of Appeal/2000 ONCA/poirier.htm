</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction by Keenan J. with a jury dated
January 27, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BORINS J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The principal issue raised on this appeal is whether the
trial judge erred, in answering a question from the jury, by
telling them only that there was no evidence in respect to the
point raised by the question.   It is the position of the
appellant that in the circumstances of this appeal a more
comprehensive answer was required, as well as a limiting
instruction.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Factual background</strong></pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant was jointly charged with Seth Martin and Ryan
O&#146;Reilly with the commission of an aggravated assault on Lawrence
Bent by wounding him.  Each of the accused was convicted.</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The assault took place at about 11:00 p.m. in downtown
Toronto.  Bent testified that as he walked along a laneway he was
chased and surrounded by the three accused men and a fourth man,
who was a young offender. He stated that Martin asked him if he
had asked them whether they were smoking crack, to which he
replied that he had not done so.  This was followed by Martin,
without any warning, punching Bent in the mouth, causing him to
fall backwards to the pavement.  Bent said he was then kicked
several times by Martin and, to a lesser extent, by O&#146;Reilly.
The incident ended when the four men ran northbound through the
laneway.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  As for the appellant&#146;s role in the assault, Bent testified
that he stood two or three feet away and did not take part in the
assault.  However, Bent testified that the appellant was one of
the group that chased him down the laneway and surrounded him so
that he had &#147;no option but to stay there&#148;.  As well, Bent did not
hear the appellant say anything to the men who assaulted him.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Martin and O&#146;Reilly testified and gave a different account
of what occurred.  They described Bent approaching them with an
offer of drugs in return for sex.  As Martin turned toward Bent
and said &#147;What?&#148;, Bent reached out and grabbed Martin&#146;s
testicles.  As a result, Martin punched Bent in the mouth.  It
was a rather hard blow and it caused him to fall backwards.
Martin and O&#146;Reilly denied kicking Bent while he was on the
ground.  After Bent stood up, the four men ran way and were
apprehended by police officers who were in the area.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Proceedings at trial</strong></pre>
    <pre>[6]  Although Martin and O&#146;Reilly testified, the appellant did
not.  It was the Crown&#146;s position, relying on s. 21(1)(b) of the
Criminal Code that the appellant was a party to the offence
because he was a member of the group that chased, and surrounded,
Bent.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  About three hours after the jury had retired to consider its
verdict it returned with a written question.  Although the
written question did not become part of the record, it is
apparent from what the trial judge said to counsel that this was
the question:</pre>
    <pre>                We  request clarification regarding the
          first  time  any of the accused informed  the
          police  that Mr. Bent grabbed Mr.  Martin  by
          the testicles.  By first time, we mean at the
          time  of  arrest or preliminary hearing.   Is
          there  any  answer  other than  there  is  no
          evidence at all?</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Counsel agreed that the appropriate answer to the question
was that there was no evidence, and the trial judge answered the
question as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                THE  COURT:  Thank you, members of  the
          jury.   I  have your question, which  I  have
          read   and  discussed  with  counsel.    Your
          question  is  the jury requests clarification
          regarding  the first time any of the  accused
          informed the police that Mr. Bent grabbed Mr.
          Martin  by  the testicles, and  your  subnote
          says,  by first time we mean at the  time  of
          the  arrest or preliminary hearing.   Members
          of  the jury, I can answer your question only
          by saying there is no evidence on that point.
          All right, you may retire.
          </pre>
    <pre>About one hour later the jury returned with its verdict by which
it found each of the three accused guilty.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Subsequently, in the course of his reasons for sentence, the
trial judge placed his own interpretation on the jury&#146;s question.
He stated:</pre>
    <pre>                In imposing a sentence in this case,  I
          have  to consider what was the nature of  the
          offence and how was it committed.  Mr.  Laan,
          in  the  course of his submissions,  said  we
          don&#146;t   know   what  the  jury  decided.    I
          disagree.   I  have not the  slightest  doubt
          that  the jury decided that this was a  swarm
          by four youths with the intention of  beating
          up   a   passing  pedestrian.   For  whatever
          reason,  we can never be sure.  We  do  know,
          however, that is what happened.  We do  know,
          as  well, that the jury rejected the  defence
          that  was  advanced  by two  of  the  accused
          [Martin and O&#146;Reilly]
          It  is my view that the question posed by the
          jury    during    the   course    of    their
          deliberations, for which I was  not  able  to
          give  an  answer, was very instructive.   The
          jury concluded that the defence presented was
          a  carefully, crafted defence that opened the
          only    possible   defence   where   identity
          essentially could not be otherwise  deflected
          or reflected.  It was a recent fabrication in
          order   to  avoid  responsibility.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[10] With respect to the trial judge&#146;s observation that the
defence raised was a &#147;recent fabrication&#148; he no doubt had in mind
Martin&#146;s evidence that Bent had grabbed him by the testicles.  I
would observe, however, that the trial judge had not instructed
the jury concerning the probative value of a recently concocted
explanation.  See, e.g., R. v. Coutts (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545
(Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal refused [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 450.
However, as I explain subsequently, it was not open to the Crown
to invite the jury, in assessing Martin&#146;s credibility, to rely on
the argument that Martin had recently fabricated, or concocted,
his account of how the incident occurred.</pre>
    <pre>[11] It would appear that there was some evidence to which the
trial judge could have referred, assuming that there was any
relevance to the question from the jury.  When Martin was cross-
examined by the Crown, the following exchange took place after he
explained what had occurred:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.    Well,  you  knew  from   your,  one  of
          your  close friends, sir, what he was talking
          to him about.  Why did you stick around close
          enough to let Mr. Bent touch you in this way?
          
          A.    I,  I  can&#146;t  really    answer    that.
          I  think I&#146;ve answered it to the best  of  my
          ability.   It  happened fast.  I  asked  him,
          &#147;What?&#148;  and he, he proceeded to do  what  he
          did.

          Q.    I&#146;m   going   to   suggest to you, sir,
          the  reason you can&#146;t answer that is  because
          it  didn&#146;t happen that way; isn&#146;t that right,
          sir?

          A.    No; you&#146;re wrong.
          
          Q.    I&#146;m   going   to   suggest to you, sir,
          that   you   invented  this   grab   by   the
          complainant to justify punching  him  in  the
          face, isn&#146;t that right?

          A.    That&#146;s not right.
          </pre>
    <pre>[12] Martin was then cross-examined about his arrest close to the
scene of the incident while he was hiding in a bush and about the
cause of a wound to his right hand.  The cross-examination
continued:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Q.    And   I&#146;m  going  to  suggest  to  you,
          sir,  that you knew that things did not  look
          good for you in that position?

          A.    Um &#150;

          Q.    And  so  you  decided  to  concoct  the
          story  about the complainant grabbing you  in
          the  way  that he does &#150; in the way that  you
          say that he did?

          A.    No.   See,  I   don&#146;t   trust   police.
          Police  never been very nice to me.   I  have
          done  some  wrong things but police  are  not
          nice  to me.  I&#146;ve been beaten up and  stuff.
          You  know, everybody thinks police  are  good
          people  but there&#146;s a lot of bad police  that
          beat  you  up  and  do  things,  so  I  don&#146;t
          consider them there to serve and protect  me.
          So  I don&#146;t talk to them or trust them and  I
          run from them.</pre>
    <pre><strong>Analysis</strong></pre>
    <pre>[13] In R. v. S. (W.D.) (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) Cory J.
considered the significance and importance of questions from the
jury. He stated at pp. 6-7:
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  importance of giving  a  full  and
          proper  response to questions from  the  jury
          has been recognized by this court on a number
          of  occasions.  In R. v. W. (D.)  (1991),  63
          C.C.C. (3d) 397 at pp. 410-1, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
          742,  3  C.R.  (4th) 302, the  following  was
          stated on behalf of the majority:
           When a jury submits a question, it gives  a
           clear indication of the problem the jury is
           having with a case.  Those questions  merit
           a  full, careful and correct response.   As
           well, the answer should remind the jury  of
           its instructions given in the course of the
           main charge: see R. v. Desveaux (1986),  26
           C.C.C. (3d) 88 at p. 93, 51 C.R. (3d)  173,
           13 O.A.C. 1 (Ont. C.A.), where it was said:

                &#147;Questions from a jury manifest their
             concern  and indicate their  desire  for
             direction on a particular issue.  The trial
             judge should read the question to counsel
             and  obtain their submissions as to  the
             response that should be made.  It is then
             incumbent on the trial judge to answer the
             question  in  a complete and  reasonably
             detailed  manner.  It is unfair  to  the
             parties and the jury to attempt a  short
             form answer to a problem that is obviously
             presenting difficulties.  The definitions
             requested had been adequately set out early
             in the charge.  However, memories are short
             and  much had intervened in the  way  of
             directions  and  recharges  before   the
             question  was  submitted.  The  original
             instructions should have been repeated in
             the response.&#148;
             </pre>
    <pre>[14] At p. 7, Cory J. referred to the following observation of
Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. Naglik (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 526 at 536
(S.C.C.): &#147;Answers to questions from the jury are extremely
important, and carry influence far exceeding instructions given
in the main charge.&#148; As well, at p. 7 Cory J. referred to a
similar observation of Lamer C.J.C. in R. v. Pétel (1994), 87
C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 105 (S.C.C.): &#147;The question will generally
relate to an important point in the jury&#146;s reasoning, so that any
error the judge may make in answering it becomes all the more
damaging.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[15] It is clear from the jury&#146;s question in this appeal that the
jurors placed particular significance on the first time any of
the accused informed the police that Bent grabbed  Martin by the
testicles.  Moreover, it appears that the jury were of the view
that there might have been an obligation resting on the accused
to inform the police of this fact either at the time of arrest,
or at the preliminary hearing.  In my view, it is reasonable to
infer from the question that the jury had reached a point in its
deliberations where it was considering the truth of Martin&#146;s
testimony that Bent had grabbed him and had reasoned that if his
explanation was true he would have told the police on his arrest,
or would have said so at the preliminary hearing.  If this
analysis is correct, the jury may have been influenced by the
portion of Martin&#146;s cross-examination that I have reproduced.</pre>
    <pre>[16] From the trial judge&#146;s reasons for sentence, it is also
clear that he regarded the jury&#146;s question as playing a
significant role in its rejection of the defence raised by Martin
and O&#146;Reilly.  The trial judge considered their defence, based on
their evidence that Bent was the assailant, as &#147;a recent
fabrication in order to avoid responsibility&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[17] It is well accepted that the probative value of an
allegation that a witness has recently fabricated his or her
testimony is that a witness who is truthful would have raised the
issue at an early opportunity &#150; at a time when, as in the
circumstances of this appeal, it would have been natural to
provide an explanation.  The allegation that the witness has
recently fabricated his or her testimony can be refuted by the
admission of a consistent statement made by the witness at the
relevant time to demonstrate that he or she did speak out on an
earlier occasion.  See, e.g., R. v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C.
(2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[18] However, when it is the accused whose testimony is being
impeached, an allegation that he or she did not speak out, or
give an explanation of his or her conduct, at an early
opportunity, conflicts with his or her right to remain silent.
As the authorities have decided, the Crown is precluded from
making the allegation, and no inference can be drawn that if the
accused was innocent he or she would have asserted his or her
innocence upon arrest</pre>
    <pre>[19] The principle underlying this preclusion was stated by Cory
J. in R. v. Chambers (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 341 (S.C.C.):
          </pre>
    <pre>                It  has  &#133;  been recognized that  since
          there  is a right to silence, it would  be  a
          snare  and a delusion to caution the  accused
          that he need not say anything in response  to
          a police officer&#146;s question but none the less
          put  in  evidence  that the  accused  clearly
          exercised  his right and remained  silent  in
          the  face  of a question which suggested  his
          guilt.
          </pre>
    <pre>[20] Although the Crown&#146;s cross-examination of Martin was not as
blatant as that of the accused in R. v. Lalande (1999), 138
C.C.C. 441 (Ont. C.A.), what this court said in that case
illustrates what was required in this case by way of a more
comprehensive answer and a limiting instruction when the trial
judge answered the jury&#146;s question.  At pp. 447-448 the court
stated:
          </pre>
    <pre>                When  the Crown Attorney cross-examined
          the appellant, he questioned him with respect
          to  his  failure  to previously  explain  his
          conduct.  Although defence  counsel  did  not
          object  to  this question, she  attempted  to
          mitigate  its  effect  in  re-examination  by
          eliciting  from the appellant  that,  on  his
          arrest, his lawyer instructed him not to  say
          anything  to  the  police.   In  his  closing
          argument,  the Crown Attorney revisited  this
          issue  and attempted to justify the  question
          on  the ground that the appellant had said he
          had  been  cooperative with the  police.   He
          then told the jury: &#147;You have to keep in mind
          that  an  accused  person does  not  have  to
          explain   &#150;  does  not  have  to  provide   a
          statement to the police.&#148;  However, the Crown
          Attorney  did not tell the jury that  it  was
          not  to  draw an adverse inference  from  the
          appellant&#146;s exercise of his right to silence.
          The  trial judge did not deal with this issue
          in his instructions to the jury.

                Counsel for the respondent, in my view,
          has quite properly conceded that the question
          should not have been asked, and, having  been
          asked,  required the trial judge to  admonish
          the  jury  in the clearest of terms that  the
          fact that the accused had remained silent did
          not  lend itself to any adverse inference and
          could not be used as an inference against him
          as  a  step  on the way to the proof  of  his
          guilt: R. v. Robertson (1975), 21 C.C.C. (2d)
          385 (Ont. C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>See, also,  R. v. Cones (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 630  (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[21] In my view, most juries would assume that an innocent person
would be prompted to deny any false accusations against him or
her, or, at the very least, to give an explanation consistent
with his or her innocence and that the failure to do so when
arrested would tend to prove the truth of the accusations.  As I
have indicated, of significance to the jury was whether Martin
had given the same explanation that he had given in his testimony
to either the police at the time of his arrest, or at the
preliminary hearing.  In his reasons for sentence, the trial
judge recognized the significance which the jury likely gave to
these factors.  However, Martin&#146;s silence at the time of his
arrest, or at the preliminary hearing where he was under no
obligation to testify, cannot be said to advance the case for the
Crown.  Martin&#146;s silence cannot be a step on the way to the proof
of his guilt and, indeed, was irrelevant to any issue at trial.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Generally speaking, when a jury inquires about a point on
which there is no evidence, it is proper for the trial judge to
indicate that there is no evidence before them to consider on
that point.  However, there will be cases, such as this case,
where care must be taken by the trial judge to provide a more
comprehensive answer including, when necessary, a limiting
instruction.</pre>
    <pre>[23] Likely as a result of the Crown&#146;s cross-examination of
Martin, the jury was probably left with the erroneous impression
that he was under some obligation to disclose to the police when
arrested, or at the preliminary hearing, that Bent had grabbed
him by the testicles.  As Cory J. put it in Chambers at p. 343,
&#147;[t]he failure to correct such an impression by direction from
the trial judge rendered the right to silence a snare of silence
for the appellant.&#148;  The trial judge was required to make it
clear to the jury that Martin had no obligation to give an
account of how the incident occurred either to the police on his
arrest, or at his preliminary hearing, and that the jury was not
entitled to draw any inference about the truthfulness of his
testimony, or that of Bent, or about Martin&#146;s guilt as a result
of the absence of any evidence in respect to the jury&#146;s question.
Indeed, because the jury&#146;s question was directed to the first
time any of the accused informed the police that Bent had grabbed
Martin by the testicles, it was incumbent on the trial judge to
explain to the jury that the right to silence applied to each
accused.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Although the jury&#146;s question appeared to have a greater
application to Martin than to the other accused, it had a direct
bearing on the appellant&#146;s conviction.  Without a finding that
Martin was guilty of the assault, the foundation for the
appellant&#146;s conviction under s. 21(1) of the Criminal Code as a
party to the assault was absent.  I would, therefore, give effect
to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[25] The appellant raised three additional grounds of appeal.  As
I have found that the failure of the trial judge to give a
comprehensive answer and a limiting instruction in answer to the
jury&#146;s question was a reversible error, there is no need to
consider the additional grounds.  As well, there is no need to
consider the sentence appeal.</pre>
    <pre>[26] For the above reasons, the appeal is allowed, the conviction
is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</pre>
