<h2>ENDORSEMENT</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center'><b><u><span style='font-size:15.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></u></b></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant, Continent-Wide Enterprises Limited (“CW”)
appeals the judgment of Spence J. (the “trial judge”) which awarded to the
respondent Polaroid Canada Inc. (“Polaroid”) damages for breach of contract
plus interest and costs.  A counterclaim
by CW was dismissed.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Polaroid is in the business of distributing photographic
products.  CW carries on  the business of dealing in a wide range of
consumer and industrial goods.  The
claim and counterclaim resulted from the dealings between the parties with
respect to the sale and distribution of Polaroid photographic products.  The dispute centered on the practice of
“transhipping” whereby CW acquired goods from Polaroid in Canada and allegedly
exported these goods for resale in another jurisdiction.  In general terms, as a result of
transhipping, CW could take advantage of resale price benefits, such as
favourable currency exchange rates. However, transhipping also adversely
affected Polaroid’s global export systems and led to price and supply problems
in Canada.  In an attempt to curtail the
practice of transhipping on the part of CW, Polaroid introduced an “export
price policy” charging its Canadian dealers who sold its products outside
Canada a higher price than the domestic price for goods sold in Canada.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, Polaroid demanded payment of the export price
for certain goods sold to CW, which Polaroid alleged had been sold outside
Canada.  CW refused to pay.  Furthermore, in order to monitor the CW
purchases, Polaroid would only sell to CW at export prices.  Upon receiving satisfactory assurance as to
the extent to which the goods had been re-sold and distributed for sale in
Canada, Polaroid would remit the amount of any excess payment to CW.  In the end, Polaroid terminated its
relationship with CW and commenced this action.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence of the entire
relationship between the parties.  He
concluded that CW was an “authorized dealer for the purposes of Polaroid’s
pricing policies”.  He also concluded
that Polaroid was at liberty to change its terms of business with CW, that it
was not precluded from imposing the export price policy and that CW became
contractually bound by the export policy when it received proper notice of the
policy.  The trial judge determined the
date of effective notice to be October 10, 1986.  Finally, he also concluded that there had been no waiver of the
export price policy by Polaroid.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In our view, these findings of the trial judge are all
reasonable and supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the purpose of this appeal, CW restricted its attack to
the issues of restraint of trade and penalty, which were determined in favour
of Polaroid, and the calculation of damages.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was submitted that the export price policy constituted an
illegal contract in restraint of trade and, accordingly, was
unenforceable.  As part of this
submission, it was also argued that the policy was contrary to the <i>Competition Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The trial judge correctly considered this issue in light of
the decision of this court in <i>Tank Lining
Corp. v. Dunlop Industrial Ltd.</i> (1982), 40 O.R. (2d) 219.  He stated that he had no doubt that, on its
specific wording, the export price policy was a restraint of trade.  The respondent has submitted that the trial
judge was in error in concluding that the export price policy was a restraint
of trade, arguing that the policy falls outside the scope of the common-law
doctrine of restraint of trade.  It is
not necessary to decide this issue because, in any event, the trial judge
concluded that the policy satisfied the test of being “reasonable in the
interests of the parties” and not contrary to the public interest (including
the <i>Competition Act</i>).  We agree with the trial judge’s conclusion
on this issue.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It was also submitted that the export price policy was a
penalty clause. The trial judge considered that a penalty clause is an obligation
to pay damages by reason of a breach of the agreement.  This was not the present case as it applied
in the absence of any breach.  He also
considered the provision in the policy that the surcharge was in addition to
any other right that Polaroid may have had. 
He remarked that this was not the language of a penalty clause.  He concluded that the export price policy
was not a penalty.  We agree with this
conclusion.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With respect to damages, the trial judge concluded that as of
October 10, 1986, CW was on notice of the export price policy and that all
purchases completed after that date were subject to the policy.  It was open to the trial judge to find that
orders made prior to October&nbsp;10th were subject to the policy, having
regard to the circumstances under which those orders were placed by CW.  The trial judge did not distinguish between
industrial and consumer goods and, as the appellant points out, CW did not have
the industrial export price list until sometime in 1987.  However, it is apparent that the critical
factor for finding that CW was bound by the two-price policy was its receipt of
the October&nbsp;7th letter.  At this
point, CW knew that Polaroid intended the relationship to be governed by the
policy.  This was essentially a finding
of fact and we have not been persuaded that it is inconsistent with the trial
judge's earlier comments concerning the lack of a price list.  Accordingly, we are not persuaded that there
was any error on these issues.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, the trial judge's decision not to include all
orders after March 1986 was based on his assessment of the evidence of the
witnesses and especially the equivocal conduct of Polaroid's sales staff prior
to October&nbsp;10th.  This finding of
fact should not be disturbed and therefore the cross-appeal must also be
dismissed.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appeal and the cross-appeal are therefore dismissed with
costs.</p>
