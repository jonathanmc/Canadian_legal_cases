[1]  This is an application for special leave to appeal under  s.
131 of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 from the
judgment  of  O&#146;Neill  J.  dismissing a  Crown  appeal  from  the
judgment  of  Vaillancourt Prov. Ct.  J.   The  respondents  were
charged  with offences under ss. 46 and 47 of the Game  and  Fish
Act,  R.S.O.  1990,  c.  G.1.  The offences  relate  to  unlawful
hunting  of  moose and unlawful possession of moose  parts.   The
respondents  relied upon an aboriginal right  to  hunt  as  Métis
protected  by s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982.  The  trial
judge  and the provincial offences appeal court judge gave effect
to this submission and dismissed the charges.
[2]  At the opening of the appeal, counsel for the respondents
took a preliminary objection to some of the material filed by the
applicant.  She argued that the material was filed late, that it
was an attempt to contradict evidence adduced at the trial and
was, in any event, irrelevant.  I indicated that I would permit
the applicant to rely upon the material, but if counsel for the
respondent required an adjournment, I would grant one.  Counsel
indicated that she was prepared to proceed.  In my view, the
material was properly before the court on an application for
special leave.  This was not an attempt to adduce fresh evidence
or to contradict the trial evidence.  The material was directed
to the issue of whether it was essential in the public interest
that leave be granted.
[3]  In my view, this is a proper case to grant leave to appeal.
The applicant has raised a number of important questions of law
concerning the interpretation of s. 35(1) of the Constitution Act
as it applies to the Métis people.  These are matters of first
impression in this court and, apparently, in any appellate
court1.  In R. v. Van der Peet, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 507 at 558, Lamer
C.J.C. wrote as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Although s. 35 includes the Métis within its definition
of &quot;aboriginal peoples of Canada&quot;, and thus seems to link 
their claims to those of other aboriginal peoples under 
the general heading of &quot;aboriginal rights&quot;, the history 
of the Métis, and the reasons underlying their inclusion 
in the protection given by s. 35, are quite distinct from 
those of other aboriginal peoples in Canada. As such, the 
manner in which the aboriginal rights of other aboriginal 
peoples are defined is not necessarily determinative of 
the manner in which the aboriginal rights of the Métis 
are defined. At the time when this Court is presented with
a Métis claim under s. 35 it will then, with the benefit 
of the arguments of counsel, a factual context and a 
specific Métis claim, be able to explore the question of 
the purposes underlying s. 35's protection of the aboriginal 
rights of Métis people, and answer the question of the kinds 
of claims which fall within s. 35(1)'s scope when the 
claimants are Métis. The fact that, for other aboriginal 
peoples, the protection granted by s. 35 goes to the 
practices, customs and traditions of aboriginal peoples 
prior to contact, is not necessarily relevant to the answer 
which will be given to that question. It may, or it may not, 
be the case that the claims of the Métis are determined on 
the basis of the pre-contact practices, customs and 
traditions of their aboriginal ancestors; whether that is 
so must await determination in a case in which the issue 
arises.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[4]  The respondents have now raised the question of how s. 35(1)
applies  to the Métis and in my view it is appropriate  for  this
court  to  deal  with the issue.  There is a full record  in  the
courts  below and both the trial judge and the appeal judge  have
written  careful  and  extensive  reasons  for  judgment.   These
reasons  include  a number of issues of great importance  to  the
public and to the Métis people.
[5]  In her submissions, Ms. Teillet made a powerful argument
against granting leave.  She noted that the courts have
repeatedly urged the parties to resolve aboriginal rights issues
through negotiation without resort to the courts.  She urges me
to put an end to the court process in this case to compel the
Government of Ontario to resolve these difficult issues through
negotiation rather than prosecution.  She submits that the trial
judge and the appeal judge came to the correct conclusion and
there is no need for any further appeals.  She also points out
that there has been a lengthy delay in dealing with these
charges, which date back to 1993.
[6]  I do not doubt the sincerity of these submissions, nor the
frustration that the respondents and Métis people may feel
because of their perception of the Government's position in this
and other cases.  I also appreciate their concerns about further
delay in view of the clear and emphatic terms in which both
courts recognized and dealt with their rights under s. 35(1).  I
am also conscious of the trial judge's comment that any single
prosecution cannot resolve all of these complex matters and that
the broad issues of the entitlement of the Métis people under
s. 35(1) can only be fully dealt with in the political arena.
[7]  While I am sympathetic to the concerns raised by Ms.
Teillet, it is my view that they do not outweigh the public
interest in granting leave to appeal.
[8]  I am also satisfied that the grounds of appeal sought to be
argued raise questions of law alone and are therefore matters
upon which special leave to appeal may be granted.
[9]  Accordingly, leave to appeal is granted.</pre>

1    Section 35 was raised in Ardoch Algonquin First Nation v.
Ontario (1997), 148 D.L.R. (4th) 96 (Ont. C.A.) but in the result
the Court did not need to deal with the interpretation of the
section.</pre></td>
