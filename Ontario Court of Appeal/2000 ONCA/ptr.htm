<p class=MsoBodyText>On appeal from the conviction by Justice R.A. Blair dated 
  February 28, 1997, and on appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice R.A. Blair 
  on June 2, 1997.</p>
<h2 align="center"><span style='font-size:16.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In this appeal the appellant argues first that 
  the trial judge erred in admitting the <i>Penthouse</i> letter and then erred 
  in his use of it. We agree that there was no basis upon which the Crown could 
  have sought the admission of this letter when it did, as part of its case in 
  chief. However, in our view, no prejudice to the appellant resulted from this. 
  The case against him, based primarily on the evidence of the complainant and 
  of the appellant’s gay partner, Mr. I., was a strong one. It was inevitable 
  that the appellant would have to testify on his own behalf to answer it. At 
  that point the letter could have been put to him in cross-examination. The absence 
  of a clear objection by defence counsel to the tendering of the letter was probably 
  a recognition of this inevitability. Once admitted, the letter was used by the 
  trial judge not as the basis for propensity reasoning, but as part of a careful 
  evaluation of the credibility of the appellant. In our view, the first ground 
  of appeal fails.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Secondly, the appellant argues that the trial 
  judge erred in treating evidence of the appellant’s sexual activities as bad 
  character evidence relevant to guilt. We disagree. The trial judge was expressly 
  alive to the need to insure that the appellant not be tried or convicted on 
  the basis of his sexual proclivities. While he did make reference to the appellant’s 
  sexual activities it was in the context of his assessment of the appellant’s 
  credibility and his conclusion that when it comes to matters in that realm the 
  appellant might well not be able to distinguish between reality and fantasy. 
  We see no sign that the trial judge used this evidence to engage in propensity 
  based reasoning.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Finally, the appellant argues that the trial 
  judge permitted cross-examination of the appellant which was improper and unfair. 
  We are not prepared to give effect to this ground of appeal. While the Crown 
  ought not to have asked the appellant why Mr. I. went to the CAS and the police, 
  this questioning followed an assertion by the appellant that Mr. I. must have 
  known that the appellant’s story about the complainant was a fantasy. Moreover, 
  the questioning was very limited and elicited no answers that were damaging 
  to the appellant. This ground of appeal fails. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed.</span></p>
