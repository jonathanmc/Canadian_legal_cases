    <pre><strong>On appeal against his conviction by Mr. Justice R. N. Weekes,
sitting with a jury, on March 18, 1996 and from the sentence
imposed on July 10, 1996
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A.:</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  On November 25, 1994, the appellant, a man of previous good
character, went to the house where his estranged wife and her
boyfriend were living.  He was armed with four containers of
gasoline.  He began to splash gasoline around the house and in
the course of an altercation with his wife and her boyfriend
gasoline was either spilt or poured on them.  The gasoline
ignited and the two victims were horribly burned.  The appellant
was charged with attempted murder and other offences arising out
of this act.  At a trial before Weekes J. and a jury, the
appellant was convicted of two counts of attempted murder.
Charges of arson endangering life and break and enter and
committing attempted murder arising out of the incident were
conditionally stayed.  Following a lengthy sentence hearing,
Weekes J. sentenced the appellant to fourteen years' imprisonment
in addition to eighteen months' pre-trial custody.  The appellant
appeals against his conviction and sentence.
[2]  The appellant raises two grounds of appeal from conviction.
First, he argues that the trial judge erred in admitting the
expert evidence of Armen Kassabian, an engineer at the Fire
Marshall&#146;s office, as to the source of ignition of the fire.
Second, he argues that the charge to the jury on attempted murder
was needlessly complex and confusing and may have diverted the
jury from the necessity of finding an intention to kill. As to
sentence, the appellant argues that the sentence was manifestly
excessive given the circumstances of the offence and the
appellant&#146;s prior good character. For the reasons that follow, I
would dismiss the appeal from conviction and sentence.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[3]  The appellant was 55 years of age at the time of the trial.
He married his wife Catherine in 1971.  The couple had three
adult children.  The eldest daughter Jennifer was an important
witness for the Crown.  The appellant had always been fully
employed as a plumber until the recession in the construction
industry in 1992 and 1993.  In January 1994, the appellant moved
to Vancouver where he quickly found work.  He lived with his
daughter.  Catherine visited the appellant in Vancouver in
February and April.  At the April visit, the couple decided to
separate.  Catherine had begun a relationship with Garry
Henderson.  During the next few months the couple reconciled and
then separated again.  In September 1994, Catherine moved in with
Mr. Henderson.
[4]  Initially, the separation was amicable.  However, the
appellant began to feel aggrieved over the way that Catherine was
dealing with their property after an incident on October 12,
1994.  He began to make threats against her life.  From
October 12th to the date of the fire, the appellant said the
following to various witnesses:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>He wanted to blow his wife&#146;s head off;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>He wanted to &#147;get rid of her&#148;;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>He wanted back all of the things she had taken so he could
burn them so nobody else could have them;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>Killing his wife was on his mind and he could not get rid
of that thought;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>He told Jennifer that he would burn the house down with
&#147;them&#148; in it;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>He told Jennifer that there was no death penalty anymore
and he was ready to go to Kingston;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>He told Jennifer that he had been driving around the
Henderson home and if his wife had been there that night, 
she would have been dead;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>He told his mother-in-law that his wife better talk to him
and &#147;I&#146;ll burn the place down with them in it&#148;; he told a
friend virtually the same thing;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>He told his son that if he had a gun, he would &#147;blow her
head off&#148;.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[5]  On November 2, 1994, Catherine telephoned the appellant.
She tape-recorded the call.  He made threats to her which were
similar to those that he had told to other people, including the
threat about being willing to go to Kingston since they do not
hang people anymore.  He also told her that if she were to get a
lawyer involved, she would be signing her own &#147;death warrant&#148;.
[6]  In addition to the threats, the appellant began stalking the
Henderson home.  On November 10th, the appellant broke into the
home and stole two dolls that belonged to Catherine.  When
Jennifer learned of the break-in and confronted the appellant, he
told her that Catherine would have been dead had she been there.
[7]  At about 3:15 p.m. on November 25th, the appellant met with
a friend who worked at a law office and had been helping him try
to settle the property issues with his wife.  He complained that
Catherine was stealing things from the matrimonial home and he
said &#147;there is only one thing left for me to do&#148;.  He then left
and went home.  The friend then called Catherine but Catherine
was not home.  Catherine called the friend back at about 3:30
p.m. and then called the appellant.  During the call, the
appellant threatened to kill her.
[8]  After the telephone call with his wife, the appellant
obtained four gasoline containers.  He put the containers in his
van and drove to a service station where he filled them.  The
station attendant, who helped the appellant fill the cans,
testified that the appellant said he wanted to &#147;make sure that I
have enough to do what I&#146;m doing&#148;.  He then drove to the
Henderson home.  It was about 4:00 p.m.
[9]  The appellant parked in the driveway and approached the
house carrying two gas cans and a sledgehammer.  Catherine and
Mr. Henderson were both in the house at the time.  Catherine
called the police while Mr. Henderson picked up a crowbar. The
testimony of Catherine and Mr. Henderson is not consistent in all
respects as to what next occurred.  This is not surprising, given
the severity of their injuries.  However, in effect, they
testified that there was the sound of breaking glass and the
appellant began spreading gasoline on the deck of the house or
inside the front door.  Mr. Henderson confronted him and they
began to fight.  The appellant began to throw gasoline on
Mr. Henderson.  Catherine came out of the house and the appellant
poured gasoline on her head.  Mr. Henderson testified that he
heard a &#147;click&#148; and he was instantly engulfed in flames.
Catherine testified that she heard a &#147;whoosh&#148; and then she was on
fire.
[10] The appellant returned to his van and drove away, apparently
towards the hospital since he too had been burned in the fire.
The police arrested him on the way to the hospital.  The police
found a functioning lighter in the van.  The lighter was covered
with a black film or gummy residue, which could have been from
being in the vicinity of a fire.
[11] The Crown called a number of firefighters and neighbours who
described the aftermath of the fire and the state of the two
victims.  Catherine was in a coma for seven weeks and had burns
to 40% of her body, including third degree burns to her back,
hands, upper chest and neck.  Mr. Henderson was in a coma for two
months and remained in hospital for another six months.  He
received burns to 60% of his body.  Both victims had to endure
long and painful treatment.  Both are now significantly disabled.
In particular, Mr. Henderson has only 50% of his former hand
movement.
[12] During its case in chief, the Crown called Robert Schnurr,
an investigator with the Fire Marshall&#146;s office.  During
examination in chief, he testified that the fire was deliberately
set.  In cross-examination he resiled from that position and
stated that, more accurately, the fire should be classified as
undetermined, but suspicious, because he could not specifically
determine the ignition source.  He stated that with the evidence
of gasoline poured into the dwelling and with people being in the
dwelling, he did not think the ignition source was all that
important.
[13] In cross-examination, Mr. Schnurr was asked to consider
accidental sources of ignition such as &#147;arcing&#148; (sparks) from
appliances.  He considered this unlikely.  Counsel also suggested
to him that the heating element from baseboard heaters was a
possible source of ignition.  He originally testified that it was
unlikely because the ignition temperature of gasoline is much
higher than the maximum temperature of baseboard heaters.  He was
then shown a study that had been prepared by Armen Kassabian, an
engineer in the Fire Marshall&#146;s office, concerning baseboard
heaters.  That study suggested that baseboard heaters can get to
over 300 Celsius.
[14] Mr. Schnurr also acknowledged in cross-examination that
prior to the trial he had been contacted by his former boss,
Dennis Merkley, who had been retained by the defence.  As a
result of that call, he had done some further investigation about
accidental sources of ignition and, in particular, he spoke to
Mr. Henderson and a neighbour about the location of the baseboard
heaters in the Henderson home.
[15] The appellant testified on his own behalf.  He denied making
some of the threats. He claimed that the others were all &#147;empty
threats&#148;.  He testified that he did not intend to hurt anyone,
but only to burn the property that his wife had removed from the
matrimonial home.  He admitted that he intended to break into the
house and to pour gasoline in the house, even if the victims were
inside.
[16] His version of the fire was completely different from that
of the two victims.  He testified that as he approached the house
he saw that the door was open so he dropped the sledgehammer.  He
proceeded up the stairs and put the two gasoline cans down on the
porch.  Mr. Henderson then came out of the house and hit him
several times with the crowbar.  They struggled and the appellant
freed himself.  He grabbed one of the gas cans and started
pouring gas through the open door.  The gas seemed to flow
quickly towards the centre of the house.  He did not believe
Catherine was in the house since he could not see her.  However,
about five seconds after he began pouring gas, Catherine came up
behind him and grabbed him by his hair.  He dropped the empty can
and started to turn back.  As he turned, he heard a &#147;poosh&#148;
sound, then a &#147;whoosh&#148; and a blue flame shot out of the doorway.
There was then an explosion as the second gas can, which was near
Mr. Henderson, exploded.  He and Catherine were showered with
gasoline and were on fire.  He denied pouring gasoline on the
victims or igniting the gasoline.  He claimed that he had no
source of ignition with him.
[17] The defence called Mr. Merkley.  He had been with the Fire
Marshall&#146;s officer for 23 years and had impressive credentials.
He provided several theories for the &#147;accidental&#148; ignition.  He
testified that &#147;arcing&#148; occurs when an appliance or thermostat
with a poor or worn wiring switches off.  The resulting spark can
be 2000 to 5000 Fahrenheit.  This would be enough to ignite
gasoline vapours as their ignition temperature is approximately
280 Celsius, depending on the octane level of the gasoline.  He
also suggested that the fire could have ignited as a result of
the gasoline vapours coming in contact with heat from the
baseboard heaters.  Mr. Merkely testified that Catherine&#146;s
injuries were consistent with the appellant&#146;s explanation of the
fire.
[18] The Crown called three witnesses in reply.  The Crown did
not seek leave to call these witnesses and the defence did not
object to their testifying.  Accordingly, the trial judge made no
ruling as to the admissibility of this evidence.  The only real
issue on appeal is the admissibility of the expert evidence.
[19] Mr. Henderson was recalled to testify about the location of
the baseboard heaters and the thermostat.  Mr. Kassabian was then
called by the Crown.  He testified that Mr. Schnurr had contacted
him after he had finished testifying to ask him about his report
on baseboard heaters.  Mr. Kassabian then attended the trial and
sat through part of the appellant&#146;s evidence and all of Mr.
Merkley&#146;s evidence.  On the morning he was to testify, Mr.
Kassabian conducted several tests involving heating elements to
very high temperatures in the presence of gasoline.  The gasoline
did not ignite.  A videotape of the experiments was played for
the jury.  He disagreed with Mr. Merkley&#146;s opinion that the
baseboard heaters could have been the source of ignition.  He
testified that these heaters must meet CSA standards and the
temperature of the heating element cannot exceed 294C.  The
minimum ignition temperature of gasoline is 400C and more likely
closer to 456C.  He also explained why he thought arcing was
&#147;practically impossible&#148; as a source of ignition.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>The Reply Evidence</strong></pre>
    <pre>[20] The appellant argues that Mr. Kassabian&#146;s evidence was not
admissible as reply evidence and that the Crown infringed the
rule against splitting its case.  That rule was summarized by
McIntyre J. in R. v. Krause (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.)
in the following terms at pages 390-91:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The general rule is that the Crown, or in civil 
matters the plaintiff, will not be allowed to split 
its case. The Crown or the plaintiff must produce 
and enter in its own case all the clearly relevant 
evidence it has, or that it intends to rely upon, 
to establish its case with respect to all the issues 
raised in the pleadings, in a criminal case, the 
indictment and any particulars ... The underlying 
reason for this rule is that the defendant or the 
accused is entitled at the close of the Crown's case 
to have before it the full case for the Crown so that 
it is known from the outset what must be met in response.</pre>
      <pre>The plaintiff or the Crown may be allowed to call 
evidence in rebuttal after completion of the defence 
case, where the defence has raised some new matter 
or defence which the Crown has had no opportunity to
deal with and which the Crown or the plaintiff could 
not reasonably have anticipated. But rebuttal will 
not be permitted regarding matters which merely
confirm or reinforce earlier evidence adduced in the 
Crown's case which could have been brought before 
the defence was made.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21] Despite this broad language it has always been understood
that the trial judge has a discretion to admit evidence in reply
concerning an issue that was of only marginal importance during
the prosecution's case in chief, but that took on added
significance as a result of the defence evidence.  This Court has
held as an aspect of this &#147;marginally relevant&#148; exception, that
the trial judge has a discretion to admit evidence in reply to a
matter raised during the cross-examination of Crown witnesses,
providing it was not a &#147;live issue&#148; at the end of the Crown's
case and the admission of such evidence would not work an
unfairness to the accused. See R. v. Sparrow (1979), 51 C.C.C.
(2d) 443 (Ont. C.A.) at 455.
[22] A decision of particular assistance is R. v. Campbell
(1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont. C.A.), the facts of which are
somewhat similar to this case.  The accused in Campbell was
charged with the attempted murder of his wife.  The victim
testified that she and the accused went out in their automobile
for a drive.  At the accused&#146;s direction, she stopped the car in
a laneway.  They both left the car and, while her back was
turned, the accused shot her.  She dropped to the ground and he
fired at her twice more.  He then obtained a gasoline container
from the car, spread the gasoline on her and set it on fire with
a match.  The victim managed to put out the flames by rolling in
the snow.
[23] The accused&#146;s version of the events was different.  He
testified that, in fact, the victim tried to kill him.  He
testified that they stopped driving because he was having an
asthma attack.  His wife left the car while he was trying to
recover.  When he looked up, he saw his wife with a cigarette in
her mouth, a gun in one hand and a can of gasoline in the other.
He left the car and pleaded with his wife not to kill him.
However, she threw gasoline at his face.  He saw a bright flash
and then felt something fall by his feet.  He picked it up,
realized it was the gun and fired blindly.  Defence counsel had
cross-examined the victim on this version of events both at the
preliminary inquiry and the trial but she said it was false.  In
reply, the Crown called a fire research engineer employed at the
Ontario Fire College.  This witness had conducted certain tests
two months before the trial at the request of Crown counsel as a
result of the cross-examination of the victim at the preliminary
inquiry.  The expert had conducted the tests in an attempt to see
whether gasoline could be ignited if it were blown back towards a
lit cigarette.  He concluded that the possibility was remote.
[24] Speaking for the court at p. 29, Martin J.A. held that,
although the accused's version of events was &#147;foreshadowed&#148; by
the cross-examination of the complainant, &#147;the issue to which the
rebuttal evidence of the expert witness was directed did not
arise until the appellant testified&#148;.  The expert evidence was
&#147;not primarily evidence upon which the Crown relied as probative
of guilt; rather, it was adduced to refute the case advanced by
the appellant in his testimony, supported by the evidence of a
defence witness, a mechanic and service station lessee, who
testified under the prevailing weather conditions, if a person
with a glowing cigarette threw gasoline from a can to another
person, there was a &#145;good chance&#146; of the thrower igniting himself
as a result of a back-splash of gasoline.&#148;  (at p. 29)
[25] Martin J.A. went on to hold at p. 30 that, even if the
expert evidence might also have been properly admitted as part of
the Crown's case, &#147;its relevance was, at that stage, marginal
only, and it was, accordingly, within the discretion of the trial
judge to admit it in reply&#148;.
[26] In my view, much the same reasoning applies in this case.
As the case stood at the end of the Crown&#146;s case in chief, there
was direct evidence that the appellant had poured gasoline on the
two victims and, from his own statements to the various Crown
witnesses, that he intended to kill them by fire.  In those
circumstances, the manner in which the gasoline was actually
ignited was not primarily evidence upon which the Crown relied as
probative of guilt.  Admittedly, the question of alternative
means of ignition was foreshadowed in the cross-examination of
Mr. Schnurr and Mr. Merkley&#146;s pre-trial queries of Mr. Schnurr.
The manner of ignition only became a live issue when the
appellant testified that he did not throw gasoline on the
victims, did not set them on fire and did not light the gasoline
in the house.
[27] Had objection been taken at trial to the admissibility of
this evidence, it would have been open to the trial judge to
exercise his discretion in favour of admitting the evidence.  The
Crown did not violate the rule against splitting its case.  I
would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>The Charge to the Jury</strong></pre>
    <pre>[28] The trial judge left two bases for liability for attempted
murder depending upon the means the appellant used to carry out
his intention to kill.  He instructed the jury that the appellant
could be found guilty of attempted murder if he intentionally set
the victims on fire or if he intentionally set fire to the
residence and thereby set fire to the victims.  The appellant
argues, however, that the need for proof of specific intent was
not made clear.  The manner in which these two theories of
liability were presented forms the basis for this second ground
of appeal.  The impugned instructions are as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>    To prove attempted murder the Crown must prove 
either set of the following elements beyond a 
reasonable doubt. I am going to give you two 
different sets of elements.  Dealing with the first 
set the Crown must prove the following beyond a 
reasonable doubt.  First, that the accused intended 
to kill, in the case of count one, Cathy Quance, 
and in the case of count two, Garry Henderson.  That 
is that he intended to cause the death by means of 
the unlawful act of assault, which on an objective 
basis was dangerous.  Secondly, that in each case he 
set fire to such person for the purpose of carrying 
out his intention.  Thirdly, that in doing so he 
endangered such person's life.  And fourthly, that 
he did this on or about November 25, 1994 at the Town 
of Innisfil.</pre>
      <pre>    The second set of elements which, if proven beyond 
a reasonable doubt, would require you to convict on 
counts one or two if so proven are the following.  
First, that the accused intended to kill, in the case 
of count one, Cathy Quance, and in the case of count 
two, Garry Henderson.  That is that he intended to 
cause death by means of the unlawful act of 
intentionally setting fire to the residence which he 
knew to be occupied, which on an objective basis was 
dangerous.  Second, that in each case, by setting fire 
to the residence, he set fire to such person.  Thirdly, 
that in doing so he endangered the life of such person.  
And fourthly, that he did this on or about the 25th of 
November, 1994 at the Town of Innisfil.  [Emphasis 
added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[29] The trial judge repeated this instruction as part of a
response to a question from the jury seeking clarification of the
elements of the offences of attempted murder, break and enter and
committing attempted murder.
[30] On behalf of the appellant, Ms. Lavine submits that these
instructions were needlessly complex and there was a risk that
the jury may have convicted the appellant solely on the basis
that they found he committed an objectively dangerous act.  She
submits that the instructions had the effect of obscuring the
pivotal issue in the case of whether the appellant intended to
kill the victims.
[31] In my view, the trial judge could have simplified the
instructions somewhat by eliminating the phrase &#147;which on an
objective basis was dangerous&#148;.  The trial judge had used this
phrase to modify the unlawful act of assault element as part of
the first basis for liability and the unlawful act of
intentionally setting fire to the residence as part of the second
basis for liability.  In doing so, he was explaining to the jury
that unlawful act homicide requires proof of an objectively
dangerous act.  See R. v. DeSousa, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944 at 961.
[32] However, no one was contending that either setting fire to
the victims or setting fire to the residence was other than an
objectively dangerous act.  Such a position would have been
untenable on this evidence.  In the circumstances of this case,
it was unnecessary for the trial judge to have left that issue to
the jury.  Alternatively, if the trial judge wished for the sake
of completeness to have set that element out, it would have been
preferable for him to deal with it and the other non-contentious
elements separately.  In this way, he could have focused the
jury&#146;s attention on the only real issue, which was the intent to
kill.
[33] However, the fact that the trial judge left this issue to
the jury, or left it in the manner that he did, does not
constitute an error unless the charge was so unnecessarily
complex and confusing that it probably diverted the jury from
considering the real basis for liability.  See R. v. Pintar
(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.) at 417.
[34] In my view, when the charge is read as a whole, the jury
would have been in no doubt that the Crown could not succeed on
the attempted murder counts without proving that the appellant
intended to kill the victims.  In the main part of the charge,
after the portion I have set out above, the trial judge
extensively reviewed the evidence in relation to the various
elements.  In that review, he isolated the intent to kill and
discussed the evidence that the jury might consider on that
issue.  That discussion was extensive and made it clear that the
Crown had the burden of proving intent to kill and that the
position of the defence was that the accused did not intend to
cause death.
[35] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.</pre>
    <pre><strong>The Sentence Appeal</strong></pre>
    <pre>[36] The trial judge heard evidence and submissions concerning
sentence over two days.  He delivered his reasons for sentence
the following day.  He heard extensive evidence of the impact of
the offences on the victims and their families.  He was presented
with a vast amount of documentary and viva voce evidence about
the appellant.  This evidence was impressive.  It showed that
until the fall of 1994, the appellant had been a good father,
grandfather and husband.  He was hard working and respected in
the community.  He was described as generous, quiet and caring.
The defence also presented a psychiatric assessment to the effect
that at the time of the offences, the appellant was likely
suffering from an adjustment disorder and that he now presented a
low risk to re-offend.  By all accounts, these offences were an
aberration.
[37] The trial judge gave the appellant credit for three years in
view of the eighteen months of pre-trial custody.  He then
imposed a sentence of fourteen years' imprisonment.  Thus, the
trial judge imposed an effective sentence of seventeen years.
The appellant argues that this sentence is excessive.
[38] The fundamental principle of sentencing is set out in s.
718.1 of the Criminal Code: &#147;A sentence must be proportionate to
the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of
the offender&#148;.  In determining the gravity of the offence and the
degree of responsibility of the appellant, the trial judge had to
make certain findings of fact in accordance with s. 724(2) of the
Criminal Code, which provides as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(2) Where the court is composed of a judge and jury, the
    court</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(a) shall accept as proven all facts, express or 
implied, that are essential to the jury's verdict 
of guilty; and</pre>
          <pre>(b) may find any other relevant fact that was 
disclosed by evidence at the trial to be proven, 
or hear evidence presented by either party with 
respect to that fact.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[39] The trial judge reviewed the evidence of the many threats by
the appellant and the appellant&#146;s actions on the day of the
offences.  He concluded that the crimes were &#147;planned and
deliberate&#148;.  The appellant does not suggest that this finding
was not open to the trial judge and, in my view, it is virtually
the only reasonable inference from all the evidence.  For weeks,
the appellant had been threatening to kill his wife and to do so
by fire.  On the day of the offence, he purchased large
quantities of gasoline.  He knew his wife was at the Henderson
home and he knew within seconds of his arrival that Mr. Henderson
was also home.  He poured gasoline on them.  He has left his wife
and her companion with permanent disabilities and lifelong pain
and suffering.  The trial judge described the offences as
horrific.
[40] On the findings made by the trial judge, this was in effect
an attempted first degree murder.  The gravity of the crime could
only have been greater if the victims had died.  The appellant&#146;s
degree of responsibility was also very high.  The psychiatric
report, aside from indicating an &#147;adjustment disorder with mixed
disturbance of emotions and conduct&#148;, offered no psychiatric
explanation for this conduct.  The appellant&#146;s faculties were not
impaired.
[41] This is pre-eminently a case where this court should show
deference to the trial judge.  He had presided over the trial
where the victims and the appellant testified.  He then heard
extensive evidence and submissions on sentencing.  While the
sentence imposed was high and perhaps even at the upper end of
the range, given the appellant&#146;s previous good character and the
pre-trial custody, I cannot say that it is so excessive as to
justify intervention by this court:  R. v. Shropshire (1995), 102
C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.).  In that respect, I note that the
sentence of the accused in Campbell was reduced from twenty-five
years to fifteen years by this court.  That case involved only
one victim, less serious injuries and, remarkably, the accused
and the deceased appeared to have reconciled to some extent prior
to the trial.</pre>
    <pre><strong>DISPOSITION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[42] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.  I
would grant leave to appeal sentence, but dismiss the appeal from
sentence.
