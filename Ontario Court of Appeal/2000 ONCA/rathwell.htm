</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of  Manton J. dated August 24, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CARTHY J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Employment Insurance Act, S.C. 1996, c. 23, and the
regulations thereunder, S.O.R./96-332, permit an employer to seek
a reduction of premiums if it provides a wage loss plan to
employees and undertakes that the employees will benefit from the
premium reduction to the extent of at least five twelfths of the
reduction (the ratio of contribution to premiums). From 1975 to
1987, the collective agreement with Hershey provided that the
medical plan was in lieu of the five twelfths rebate. All
reference to the rebate was removed from the agreement in 1987,
but the medical plan has continued. This class action seeks to
recover five twelfths of all rebates since 1987 as an unpaid
statutory benefit. The fundamental lis between the parties is
whether the plan continued to be the replacement for the rebate
notwithstanding the deletion of any reference to the rebate in
the 1987 and subsequent agreements.
[2]  The two issues before this court are, first, whether the
above question is solely within the jurisdiction of the
Commission under the Act and, second, whether a ruling under the
regulations has created an issue estoppel.
[3]  Manton J. refused to make an order under Rule 21 dismissing
the action and the defendant appeals that order. His reasons read
in part:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I find that the statement of claim discloses a 
reasonable cause of action.</pre>
        <pre>I also find that this Court has jurisdiction to 
hear this action because the Employment Insurance 
Act requires that part of the reduction given to 
the employer (Hershey) must benefit the employee. 
The regulations under the E.I.A. require only
that the employer undertake to share the benefit 
with the employee but there is no mechanism to 
ensure that the employer is meeting his 
undertaking. The employees allege that they did 
not receive the benefits they are entitled to. 
A trial of the issues will determine this.</pre>
        <pre>I also find that the Plaintiffs are not estopped 
from going ahead with their claim and that the 
doctrine of res judicata cannot be invoked by the 
Defendant because the parties in this action are 
not the same parties who communicated with Human 
Resources Development Canada.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[4]  The Act provides that the Commission shall annually set the
premium rate (s.66) and then provides for the collection of those
premiums from the employer and employee (ss.67 and 68). There is
a further provision for a reduction of the employer&#146;s premium if,
what is called, a wage loss plan is in place and if the employees
will benefit from the premium reduction in an amount equal to
five twelfths of the reduction (s.69).
[5]  The Commission is authorized to make regulations to provide
a system for effecting premium reductions (s.69(2)), and
specifically for the making of decisions relating to premium
reductions and appeals from such decisions (s.69(3)(e)).
[6]  The regulations provide that an application for a reduction
may be made to the Commission by an employer (s.68(1)) and, inter
alia, shall be accompanied by the employer&#146;s undertaking that the
employees will benefit in the required amount (s.68(1)(c)). An
officer (not defined) of the Commission is empowered to decide
whether the requirements have been met (s.72). This provision is
at the centre of the present debate and reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>72.  Where an application for a reduction of the
employer&#146;s premium has been made by an employer, 
an officer of the Commission shall decide whether 
the employer meets the requirements for receiving 
a premium reduction under this Part and shall 
notify the applicant of the decision and of the 
rate at which premiums are to be remitted.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[7]  There is then a provision (s.75) that an employer may appeal
the officer&#146;s decision to the Commission.
[8]  It should be noted that this entire procedure concerns the
employer&#146;s premiums and there is no involvement contemplated by
employees or the union. In each year since 1987, the employer,
Hershey, made application for and was granted a rebate and on
each occasion filed the required undertaking as to the benefit to
the employees.
[9]  Prior to 1987, the collective agreement contained the
following wording:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The Medical Plan will continue as at present and 
in recognition of this, any rebates as a result 
of unemployment insurance premium reduction will 
accrue to the Company.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10] That clause disappeared in the 1987 version of the agreement
without any change in the employer&#146;s medical plan. An issue first
arose in negotiating the 1994-97 agreement when the union sought
recognition of the alleged entitlement to the employees&#146;
statutory benefit. The employer resisted the change and the union
filed a grievance. The arbitrator found that the dispute was
outside of the terms of the agreement and thus beyond his
jurisdiction.
[11] The union then wrote to the Premium Reduction Program
complaining that the employer had given false information on its
applications under s.68(1)(c) of the regulations and invoking
s.39(1) and s.136 of the Act. These latter provisions give the
Commission authority to impose a penalty for a false or
misleading statement and do not reflect what the plaintiffs
presently seek &#150; reparation &#150; nor how the complaint was dealt
with by the officer in the Premium Reduction Program. He, officer
Landry, simply ruled that so long as the medical plan remained in
place, the employer is to be regarded as complying with the
sharing requirement. That is the very issue which the plaintiff
wishes to litigate as a class action on behalf of all those since
1987 who might have been entitled to a benefit.
[12] On the above recital of facts and statutory provisions, the
analysis flows without complication to a conclusion. The only
jurisdiction of officer Landry is under s.72 of the regulations
and that is to make a decision on an application for reduction by
an employer, subject to the employer&#146;s right of appeal to the
Commission. That decision, so far as it relates to this appeal,
is as to whether the employer has given an undertaking that the
employees will benefit from the reduction. It is not a decision,
which this one purported to be, as to whether the employer has
satisfied the undertaking, or will satisfy it. Subject to s.39(1)
of the Act, giving the Commission power to impose penalties for
false statements, there is no provision in the statute or
regulations for enforcement of the regulation.
[13] Since the officer&#146;s decision under s.72, where properly
made, is appealable to the Commission, his decision in this case
cannot be read as a decision of the Commission that no false or
misleading statement was made. Nor is there a basis for applying
s. 132(1) of the Act which reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>132. (1)  If a question that could be decided by the
Commission arises in any legal proceedings, the justice, 
judge or court before whom the question arises shall 
refer the question to the Commission and defer further 
proceedings until the Commission&#146;s decision is received.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>The question that has arisen in this proceeding as to compliance
with the undertakings, or legal obligations arising therefrom, is
not a question that could be decided by the Commission.</pre>
    <pre>[14] Thus, there is no ruling or decision extant that has been
made within the jurisdiction established by the Act and its
regulations and, if there be legitimacy in the plaintiff&#146;s plea,
it would constitute a right which should not stand without a
remedy. I conclude that the motions judge was right and the
appeal should be dismissed with costs.
