    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Manton dated June 30,
1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The question in this appeal is whether the Superior Court of
Justice has jurisdiction to vary an order for spousal support
made as part of an order for divorce obtained in Ontario under
the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1970 c. D-8, where neither party is a
resident of Ontario and one of the spouses does not accept the
jurisdiction of the court.  The answer to that question depends
on whether the provisions of the former Divorce Act  or the
provisions of the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1985 2nd Supp., c. 3 apply.
In my view, the latter provisions apply and accordingly, the
Ontario court has no jurisdiction to vary the order.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant, Elizabeth Kathleen Rhys-Jones, married the
respondent, Wyn Rhys-Jones, in Ireland in 1959.  Ten years later
the couple moved to Ottawa where the respondent established his
own medical practice.  The couple had three children.  In 1973,
the parties separated and the appellant and the children moved
back to Ireland.  In 1974, the appellant and the children
returned to Ottawa.  On September 27, 1977, the parties were
divorced in the Supreme Court of Ontario.  The respondent was
awarded custody of the children and ordered to pay the appellant
$400 per month for her support and maintenance.  It is alleged
that the respondent has made no payments in accordance with this
order since 1979.
[3]  The appellant moved back to Ireland, where she continues to
reside.  The respondent moved to the United States.  He has lived
in the United States since 1977 except for a six-year period when
he was employed in Saudi Arabia.  He is now a citizen of the
United States and an employee of the United States government.
The respondent has lived in different states since leaving
Canada.
[4]  The appellant alleges that she has attempted to collect her
outstanding spousal support.  The latest attempt began in
Florida, where the respondent now resides, in November 1994.  By
that time, the outstanding arrears exceeded $100,000.  On June 9,
1999, the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit for Pasco
County, Florida, domesticated (registered) the 1977 Ontario
support order and there is now a pending action for unpaid
support in that court.  Those proceedings are governed by the
Uniform Interstate Family Support Act, c. 88, Part VI, Fla. Stat.
[5]  The parties have filed affidavits from their Florida
attorneys as to the procedure under the Florida statute.  There
is a dispute as to whether the Florida court has jurisdiction to
&#147;vacate&#148; the arrears.
[6]  On March 12, 1999, the respondent brought an application in
the Ontario Court (General Division) [now the Superior Court of
Justice] to rescind or vary &#147;retroactively and prospectively&#148; the
order for support and maintenance made by the Supreme Court of
Ontario in 1977.  Until this application, the respondent had made
no attempt to vary the order and, in particular, he had no
application pending at the time the former Divorce Act [the
Divorce Act, 1968] was repealed and replaced by the present
Divorce Act [the Divorce Act, 1985] on June 1, 1986.
[7]  On June 29, 1999, Manton J. heard a preliminary motion
concerning the court&#146;s jurisdiction and made an order that may be
summarized as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(1)  The Ontario court has jurisdiction to hear the
     respondent&#146;s application;</pre>
      <pre>(2)  The Notice of Application was properly served 
     upon the appellant in Ireland;</pre>
      <pre>(3)  The order for support and maintenance is 
     &#147;suspended&#148; pending disposition of the 
     application on its merits.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[8]  The appellant appeals from that part of the order holding
that the Ontario court has jurisdiction.  We were informed that
the Florida court has taken no further proceedings pending the
outcome of the proceedings in Ontario.  Counsel for the
respondent has also stated that it was understood by the parties
and by Manton J. that his order did not preclude the appellant
from subsequently moving under Rule 21.01(3)(c) to stay the
Ontario proceedings on the basis that Ontario is not the
convenient forum.</pre>
    <pre>REASONS OF THE MOTIONS JUDGE</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Manton J. held that the Ontario court had jurisdiction
because s. 11(2) of the Divorce Act, 1968 applied.  Section 11
provides as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>11. (1)  Upon granting a decree nisi of divorce, the
court may, if it thinks it fit and just to do so having 
regard to the conduct of the parties and the condition, 
means and other circumstances of each of them, make one 
or more of the following orders, namely:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a)  an order requiring the husband to secure or to
pay such lump sum or periodic sums as the court 
thinks reasonable for the maintenance of</pre>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(i)   the wife,
(ii)  the children of the marriage, or
(iii) the wife and the children of the marriage;</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <pre>(b)  an order requiring the wife to secure or to pay 
such lump sum or periodic sums as the court thinks
 reasonable for the maintenance of</pre>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(i)   the husband,
(ii)  the children of the marriage, or
(iii) the husband and the children of the marriage;
and</pre>
        </blockquote>
        <pre>(c)  an order providing for the custody, care and 
upbringing of the children of the marriage.</pre>
        <pre>(2)  An order made pursuant to this section may be varied 
from time to time or rescinded by the court that made the 
order if it thinks it fit and just to do so having regard 
to the conduct of the parties since the making of the 
order or any change in the condition, means or other 
circumstances of either of them.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10] Manton J. acknowledged that if the provisions of the present
Divorce Act applied, the Ontario court would have no jurisdiction
to vary the 1977 order.  Section 17 of the Divorce Act, 1985
provides that a &#147;court of competent jurisdiction&#148; may vary or
rescind prospectively or retroactively a support order on
application by either of the spouses.  Section 5(1) of the
Divorce Act, 1985 sets out the court&#146;s jurisdiction:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>5.  (1)  A court in a province has jurisdiction to hear
and determine a variation proceeding if</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a)  either former spouse is ordinarily resident in 
the province at the commencement of the proceeding; or</pre>
        <pre>(b)  both former spouses accept the jurisdiction of the 
court.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[11] Manton J. based his decision on s. 43(a), (b) and (c) of the
Interpretation Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21 which provide as
follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>43. Where an enactment is repealed in whole or in part, the
repeal does not</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a) revive any enactment or anything not in force or 
existing at the time when the repeal takes effect,</pre>
        <pre>(b) affect the previous operation of the enactment 
so repealed or anything duly done or suffered thereunder,</pre>
        <pre>(c) affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability 
acquired, accrued, accruing or incurred under the 
enactment so repealed,</pre>
        <pre>&#133;</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[12] In my view, the motions judge erred in holding that s. 11 of
the Divorce Act, 1968 applied to these proceedings.  As
indicated, he based his decision on s. 43 of the Interpretation
Act.  However, there is a preliminary issue as to whether s. 43
is applicable.  Section 3(1) of the Interpretation Act provides
that, &#147;Every provision of this Act applies, unless a contrary
intention appears, to every enactment, whether enacted before or
after the commencement of this Act.&#148; [Emphasis added.]  The
Divorce Act, 1985 contains transitional provisions, including ss.
33 and 34(1), which provide as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
               33.   Proceedings commenced under the 
	  Divorce Act, chapter D-8 of the Revised Statutes 
	  of Canada, 1970, before the day on which this Act 
	  comes into force and not finally disposed of
          before that day shall be dealt with and disposed 
	  of in accordance with that Act as it read 
	  immediately before that day, as though it had not 
	  been repealed.</pre>
    <pre>               34. (1)  Subject to subsection (1.1),
          any order made under subsection 11(1) of the
          Divorce Act, chapter D-8 of the Revised
          Statutes of Canada, 1970, including any order
          made pursuant to section 33 of this Act, and
          any order to the like effect made corollary
          to a decree of divorce granted in Canada
          before July 2, 1968 or granted on or after
          that day pursuant to subsection 22(2) of that
          Act may be varied, rescinded, suspended or
          enforced in accordance with sections 17 to
          20, other than subsection 17(10), of this Act
          as if</pre>
    <pre>            (a)  the order were a support order or
            custody order, as the case may be; and

            (b)  in subsections 17(4), (4.1) and
            (5), the words &quot;or the last order made
            under subsection 11(2) of the Divorce Act,
            chapter D-8 of the Revised Statutes of
            Canada, 1970, varying that order&quot; were
            added immediately before the words &quot;or the
            last variation order made in respect of
            that order&quot;.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[13] As the appellant had not commenced his variation proceeding
prior to the repeal of the 1968 Act, he cannot rely upon s. 33.
On the other hand, although s. 34(1) uses the term &quot;may&quot; this
nevertheless suggests an intention on the part of Parliament that
an application for variation of an order under the old Act be
dealt with in accordance with the procedure under the new Act.
It does not appear that the transitional provisions of the 1985
Act were brought to the attention of the motions judge.
[14] In any event, in my view, s. 43 of the Interpretation Act
does not give the Ontario court jurisdiction under s. 11 of the
1968 Act.  The only part of s. 43 that might apply is
paragraph (c), which provides that the repeal does not &#147;affect
any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued,
accruing or incurred under the enactment so repealed&#148;.  In my
view, the respondent did not have any acquired, accrued, or
accruing right or privilege at the time he brought his
application in the Ontario court in 1999.
[15] The respondent was somewhat unclear in identifying the right
that he claimed had acquired, accrued or was accruing.  He
appears to claim that where a court-ordered support obligation
has been imposed upon a party pursuant to a statute that gives
the party a right to vary or rescind the obligation, that right
is preserved for all time.  In other words, the right to vary
vested at the very moment the support obligation was imposed.  I
cannot accept that proposition.
[16] With respect to whether the right had &quot;accrued&quot;, as
Dickson J. said in Gustavson Drilling (1964) Ltd. v. Minister of
National Revenue (1975), 66 D.L.R. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at 463, &#147;The
mere right existing in the members of the community or any class
of them at the date of the repeal of a statute to take advantage
of the repealed statute is not a right accrued&#148;.  In reaching
that conclusion, Dickson J. referred to Abbott v. Minister of
Lands, [1895] A.C. 425 (P.C.) at 431.  In Abbott, the Lord
Chancellor said at p. 431:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It has been very common in the case of repealing statutes to
save all rights accrued. If it were held that the effect of 
this was to leave it open to any one who could have taken 
advantage of any of the repealed enactments still to take 
advantage of them, the result would be very far-reaching.</pre>
      <pre>...</pre>
      <pre>&#133; [We] think that the mere right (assuming it to be properly 
so called) existing in the members of the community or any 
class of them to take advantage of an enactment, without any 
act done by an individual towards availing himself of that 
right, cannot properly be deemed a &quot;right accrued&quot; within the 
meaning of the enactment.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[17] To a similar effect, is the decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in Quebec (A.G.) v. Expropriation Tribunal, [1986] 1
S.C.R. 732 at 742, where Chouinard J. wrote:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>A vested right is one which exists and produces effects.
That does not include a right which could have been exercised 
but was not, and which is no longer available under the law.  
The courts and scholarly commentators distinguish between a 
vested right and what they call either a possibility or an 
option.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18] The respondent therefore had no accrued right to a
variation, merely upon the making of the support order under the
former legislation.  At a minimum, he had to do something to
exercise that right before the legislation was repealed.  The
decisions of the courts considering the effect of the 1978
amendments to the gun control provisions of the Criminal Code are
of some assistance in resolving this issue.  That legislation
took certain firearms that had been in the &#147;restricted&#148; category,
which could be legally owned if the owner had a registration
certificate, and placed them in the prohibited category.  A
transitional provision provided that notwithstanding the new
classification, the firearm could still be legally owned if it
had been registered under the former legislation.  In a series of
cases,1 the courts had to consider whether an owner was entitled
to a registration certificate under the former legislation.
While those cases turned on their facts, the unifying principle
was that even a mere application for the certificate was not
sufficient.2  The process had to be almost complete before the
courts would hold that the owner had an accrued right.  The
decision in Abell v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner
(1979), 49 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (Sask. C.A.) is illustrative of the
reasoning.  Bayda J.A. held as follows at p. 203:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In the present case, the respondent, at the time of the
repeal of the former s. 98 on January 1, 1978, was not 
merely a member of a general class who could &quot;'take 
advantage&quot; of the right to obtain a registration 
certificate afforded by s. 98 of the Code but was much 
more. She was an individual who had done acts to avail 
herself of that right. In fact she had done all she   
could possibly do towards availing herself of that right. 
Thus, on the face of the matter and barring some 
statutory provision either disentitling the respondent 
to a registration certificate for her sten gun, or 
disabling her from obtaining one until something more is 
done, the right she had entitling her to such a
certificate was a &quot;right ... acquired&quot; or a &quot;right ... 
accrued&quot; and at the very least a &quot;right ... accruing&quot; 
within the meaning of s. 35 of the Interpretation Act 
[now s. 43].  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19] The respondent&#146;s position stands in stark contrast.  He had
done nothing to take advantage of the right to a variation.
[20] I have also considered whether the respondent had an accrued
right to a variation at the time when he theoretically could have
met the statutory pre-requisite for a variation, namely a
material change in circumstances.  See s. 11(2) of the Divorce
Act, 1968, s. 17(4.1) of the Divorce Act, 1985 and Moge v. Moge,
[1992] 3 S.C.R. 813.  As I understand it, at least one alleged
material change in circumstances was when he claimed to have
become &#147;financially destitute&#148; in 1977 or 1979.  However, the
reasoning in Gustavson, Abbott and Expropriation Tribunal would,
in my view, still apply.  As a result of a material change in
circumstances, the respondent might have obtained a variation.
Having taken no steps to exercise that &#147;right&#148; it was not an
accrued right within the meaning of the Interpretation Act.
[21] I also cannot find that the appellant had any accruing right
at the time of the repeal since he had taken no steps at that
time to take advantage of the repealed provisions to vary the
order.
[22] The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal dealt with s. 23(1)(c) of
the Interpretation Act, R.S.S.A 1978, c. I-11, the equivalent of
s. 43(c), in Scott v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of
Saskatchewan (1992), 95 D.L.R. (4th) 706.  In his concurring
opinion, Cameron J.A. held at p. 715 that, &#147;An abstract
entitlement to take advantage of an enactment is not to be taken
as a &#145;right&#146; within the meaning of s. 23(1)(c) and cannot
therefore be regarded as an &#145;acquired&#146; or &#145;accrued&#146; right,
unaffected by repeal or amendment&#148;.  He then went on to consider
the meaning of &#147;accruing&#148; at p. 719:</pre>
    <pre>               In the context under consideration, I 
	  cannot think the legislature intended the term
	  to mean that which may, in the sense of
	  possibility, ripen into an acquired or accrued
	  right or obligation at a future time. As will be
	  readily apparent, the implications of that in
	  relation to the effectiveness of repeal are
	  simply too wide to be acceptable.

               That, coupled with the ordinary and
          grammatical sense of the language of the
          provision, leads me to believe that by
          &quot;accruing right&quot; and &quot;accruing obligation&quot;
          the legislature meant one which will, rather
          than may, in time accrue. The word
          &quot;accruing&quot;, as it appears in the provision
          and applies to rights and obligations, is
          used in conjunction with &quot;accrued&quot;. The one
          houses the same basic idea as the other,
          separated only in time. The difference is
          merely one of tense. And so I conclude that
          &quot;accruing&quot; rights and obligations are those
          necessarily or inevitably, not possibly or
          even probably, arising in due course. In
          other words I am of the opinion that before a
          right--and its correlative duty--may be said
          to be &quot;accruing&quot;, the events giving rise to
          it or the conditions upon which it depends
          for its existence, must have been so set in
          train or engaged as inevitably to give rise
          in due course to the right and its
          corresponding duty.

               It follows, in a case such as this, that
          the mere entitlement to take advantage of a
          statute cannot be taken to constitute an
          &quot;accruing&quot; right or to give rise to an
          &quot;accruing&quot; obligation. Put another way, it
          cannot be said that, because the right is
          there to be had, it is accruing. That would
          violate the language and render repeal
          altogether ineffective. Nor can entitlement
          combined with intention to take advantage of
          an enactment suffice. That, too, would
          distort the language and cut into the
          effectiveness of repeal. Entitlement and
          intention, coupled with a positive step
          toward realizing the right, is getting closer
          to the mark. But the taking of some step or
          the doing of some act, of whatever kind and
          however far removed, toward acquiring a
          statutory right is insufficient to turn what
          would otherwise have been nothing more than a
          mere &quot;hope or expectation&quot; into an &quot;accruing
          right&quot; or &quot;accruing obligation&quot;. The required
          element of inevitability is lacking.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[23] The same may be said in this case.  The respondent took no
steps towards realizing his &#147;right&#148; until years after the repeal
of the statute.  He had at most a &quot;hope or expectation&quot; that in
the future he could apply for a variation.  He did not therefore
have an accruing right.
[24] This part of the Scott decision was referred to with
approval by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Puskas, [1998] 1
S.C.R. 1207 at 1216, a case concerning the repeal of a provision
of the Criminal Code that formerly provided an appeal as of right
to the Supreme Court of Canada.  Lamer C.J.C. adopted this
definition of the terms &#147;acquired&#148; &#147;accrued&#148; and &#147;accruing&#148;.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>A right can only be said to have been &quot;acquired&quot; when the
right-holder can actually exercise it. The term &quot;accrue&quot; is
simply a passive way of stating the same concept (a person
&quot;acquires&quot; a right; a right &quot;accrues&quot; to a person). Similarly,
something can only be said to be &quot;accruing&quot; if its eventual
accrual is certain, and not conditional on future events (Scott
v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Saskatchewan (1992), 95
D.L.R. (4th) 706 (Sask. C.A.) at p. 719). In other words, a right
cannot accrue, be acquired, or be accruing until all conditions
precedent to the exercise of the right have been fulfilled.
[Emphasis added]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[25] Returning to Scott, Vancise J.A. (Jackson J.A. concurring)
also provided a helpful definition of these terms, at p. 727:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Left with no definition, the courts have established two
criteria or factors which will help to determine whether a right
is acquired, accrued or accruing. First, one must establish a
tangible or particular legal right, the right cannot be abstract,
it must be more than a possibility, more than a mere expectation;
and, secondly, establish that the right was sufficiently
exercised or solidified before the repeal of the enactment to
justify its protection.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[26] Under this test, as well, the respondent did not have a
right within the meaning of s. 43(c).  Up to the time of the
repeal of the 1968 Act, his right was abstract.  It was a mere
expectation.  He had also taken no steps to exercise or solidify
the right before the repeal.
[27] To a similar effect, is the decision of this court in Re Rai
(1980), 27 O.R. (2d) 425 (C.A.).  In that case, Weatherson J.A.
considered the meaning of the provincial equivalent of s. 43 and
held at p. 432:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Manifestly, it cannot serve to preserve abstract rights,
such as those which all members of the community or a class of
the community enjoy. However, if procedural steps have been taken
to enforce or establish a particular right, that right must be
accruing. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[28] To conclude, in my view, Parliament has manifested an
intention that applications to vary be brought under the new
legislation.  Alternatively, the respondent did not have a right
under the old legislation that was preserved by s. 43 of the
Interpretation Act.  It follows, that the respondent cannot take
advantage of s. 11 of the former Act.
[29] It was not argued that the Ontario courts have an inherent
right to vary an order for spousal support apart from the
statute.  In any event, in Ramsay v. Ramsay (1977), 13 O.R. (2d)
85 (C.A.) this court held that there is no such inherent right.
[30] Finally, I would make this comment.  Much was said by
counsel for the respondent about the unfairness to the respondent
if he had no remedy in Ontario to deal with the arrears.  As I
have said, there was conflicting affidavit evidence as to the
effect of the Florida statute and whether the respondent could
obtain some relief under that legislation.  While my own view is
that the Florida legislation does appear to permit the court to
deal with the arrears and refuse to enforce some or all of them,
that matter was not fully argued before Manton J. or before this
court.  It does not strike me as unfair to require the respondent
to proceed in accordance with the legislation in the jurisdiction
that he has made his home.  Nor would it be unfair for courts in
this country to decline jurisdiction to deal with an order that
was made over twenty years ago and where the parties no longer
reside in this country and have not done so for many years.
However, I need not finally decide that matter in view of my
conclusion on the court&#146;s jurisdiction and bearing in mind that
the decision of Manton J. did not preclude the appellant from
subsequently pursuing her motion under rule 21.01(3)(c).</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[31] Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order
of Manton J. and dismiss the application to vary the order for
spousal support.  The appellant is entitled to her costs of the
appeal and of the proceedings before Manton J.</pre>

2    I note that under the transitional provisions in the Divorce
Act, 1985, the respondent would have had the right to continue
his application under the former legislation, if he had initiated
it prior to the repeal.  Of course, that did not occur.</pre></td>
