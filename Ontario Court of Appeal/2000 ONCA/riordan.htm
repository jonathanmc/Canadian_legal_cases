    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Roberts J. dated December 17,
  1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>LASKIN J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The general issue on this appeal is whether Roberts J. erred
in concluding that the transfer of $195,000 by Leo Burns, now
deceased, to the respondent Margaret Mellon in May 1995, two
years before his death, was a gift.  The appellant, Patricia
Riordan, one of Burns&#146; daughters and the administratrix of his
estate, challenges the trial judge&#146;s conclusion.  She contends
that Ms. Mellon holds the money on a resulting trust for Burns&#146;
estate.  She makes three submissions:
     </pre>
    <pre>     (i)  the trial judge applied the wrong standard of proof;
     </pre>
    <pre>     (ii) he erred in rejecting the evidence of Kenneth King and
          in ignoring the evidence of Burns&#146; other daughter
          Angela Wright; and
     </pre>
    <pre>    (iii) he erred in finding that Ms. Mellon&#146;s evidence had been
          corroborated, as required by s. 13 of the Ontario Evidence 
	  Act.1</pre>
    <pre><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></pre>
    <pre>[2]  Leo Burns met Margaret Mellon in May 1993.  She worked for
the Bank of Nova Scotia and tried to help him to resolve a
complaint that he had against the bank.  Both Burns and Ms.
Mellon were Irish, and in their discussions they learned that
their families came from the same county in Ireland.  They became
friends.  At the time Burns was 78 years old, had been separated
from his wife for over 20 years, and had an uneven, although
ongoing relationship with his two daughters.  Between the time
they met and May 1995, when Burns gave Ms. Mellon a bank draft
for $195,000, the contact between the two of them consisted of &#147;a
lot of phone calls and three lunches.&#148;  The appellant does not
suggest that Ms. Mellon needed the money or that she influenced
Burns to give the money to her.  Burns died in May 1997, at age
82.  His daughters acknowledge that he had always been of sound
mind.
[3]  At trial, Ms. Mellon testified that the transfer to her was
a gift.  Roberts J. accepted her evidence as being truthful and
accurate.  The appellant does not attack that finding of
credibility.  That, however, does not end the matter.
[4]  In law, the transfer raises a rebuttable presumption of
resulting trust in favour of Burns&#146; estate.  The reason for the
presumption is that &#147;Equity assumes bargains, and not gifts&#148;.2
Ms. Mellon had the onus to rebut the presumption.  Moreover,
because Burns is now deceased, s. 13 of the Evidence Act requires
that the transfer be corroborated by some other material
evidence.  Against this background I turn to the appellant&#146;s
three submissions.</pre>
    <pre><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>1.Did the trial judge apply the wrong standard of proof?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  To succeed in an action by or against a deceased&#146;s estate, a
living person&#146;s evidence must be corroborated by some other
material evidence.  This requirement for corroboration is
codified in s. 13 of the Evidence Act, which provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>13.  In an action by or against the heirs, next 
of kin, executors, administrators or assigns of 
a deceased person, an opposite or interested party 
shall not obtain a verdict, judgment or decision 
on his or her own evidence in respect of any matter
occurring before the death of the deceased person, 
unless such evidence is corroborated by some other 
material evidence.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Section 13 addresses the obvious disadvantage faced by the dead:
they cannot tell their side of the story or respond to the
living&#146;s version of events.3</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Section 13 applies in this case because Ms. Mellon claims to
have received a gift from someone who is no longer alive.  The
appellant submits that when s. 13 applies, proof is required on
the criminal standard, or at least on a standard higher than the
civil standard of the balance of probabilities.  She relies on
the following passage from the reasons of Middleton J.A. in
Bayley v. Trusts and Guarantee Co. Ltd.4:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>[T]he Court should always have present to its mind 
the danger of relying too implicitly upon the evidence 
of the living in establishing a claim against the dead.  
The proper judicial attitude in the first place towards 
the evidence of the living claimant ought to be one of 
suspicion, even when that evidence is corroborated 
within the meaning of the statute, and effect ought not 
to be given to it unless the effect of the entire 
evidence, including that which is relied upon as 
corroboration, is to remove all reasonable doubt from 
the judicial mind.
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[7]  Bayley was a case decided under s. 13.  A related line of
authorities from this court on the standard required to rebut a
presumption of resulting trust also seems to support the
appellant&#146;s submission.  In Johnstone v. Johnstone,5 both the
donor and recipient of the gift were living at the time of trial.
Nonetheless, Mulock C.J. for a five-member panel, seemed to
invoke the criminal standard of proof when he wrote:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In weighing the conflicting evidence, it is not sufficient
that the preponderance of evidence may turn the scale 
slightly in favour of a gift.  The preponderance must be 
such as to leave no reasonable room for doubt as to the 
donor&#146;s intentions.6
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[8]  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing
to apply the standard of proof reflected in Bayley and Johnstone.
Certainly, Roberts J. applied the civil, not the criminal,
standard.  Was he wrong to have done so?  In my view, he was not
wrong.
[9]  Admittedly, both Bayley and Johnstone have been followed in
subsequent cases7 and neither has been expressly overruled by
this court.  In my view, however, a gift may be established under
s. 13 and a presumption of resulting trust may be rebutted by
proof on a balance of probabilities, recognizing that proof
within the civil standard may vary depending on gravity of the
issues.  When a claim of gift is asserted against a deceased&#146;s
estate, a trial judge is justified in carefully scrutinizing the
cogency of the supporting evidence.  A &#147;healthy scepticism&#148; may
be appropriate.  But it is the civil standard not the criminal
standard that should be applied.  The passage from Bayley relied
on for applying the criminal standard has been taken out of
context.  Moreover, both principle and recent case law support
the application of the civil standard.
[10] I begin with Bayley. That case focussed on whether s. 13
required corroboration of the &#147;vital&#148; facts in issue or whether
corroboration of any of the &#147;material&#148; facts would suffice.
Middleton J.A. concluded that corroboration of any of the
material facts met the requirements of the section:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133;It must be corroboration of the party&#146;s evidence in
essential matters.  On the other hand, I do not think 
that it is required that there should be corroboration 
of the evidence of the party with respect to that 
perhaps which is the vital and essential portion of 
his evidence in which he is in conflict with that 
which the executors are ready to admit.  So to hold 
would be to impose an obligation upon the claimant 
far in excess of that which the statute requires.8
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[11] His observations about &#147;the proper judicial attitude of
suspicion&#148; and needing evidence &#147;to remove all reasonable doubt
from the judicial mind&#148; were not the focus of his decision, and
are extracted from a long paragraph in which he rejects extending
the requirements of s. 13 beyond those established by the
Legislature.  The entire paragraph reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I have quoted the opinions of the English Courts 
for the purpose of indicating that there is no 
principle that requires or justifies the carrying 
of our statutory provisions beyond that which is 
actually provided, and also for the purpose of
indicating that the Court should always have present 
to its mind the danger of relying too implicitly 
upon the evidence of the living in establishing a 
claim against the dead.  The proper judicial 
attitude in the first place towards the evidence 
of the living claimant ought to be one of suspicion, 
even when that evidence is corroborated within the 
meaning of the statute, and effect ought not to be 
given to it unless the effect of the entire evidence,
including that which is relied upon as corroboration, 
is to remove all reasonable doubt from the judicial 
mind.  It is not required by the statute that the
plaintiff's claim must be established by the evidence 
of two witnesses, or by evidence apart from that of 
the claimant if there is apart from his evidence that 
which the statute regards as corroboration.  The 
Courts have more or less studiously refrained, and 
wisely so, from any attempt to define in exhaustive 
terms precisely what constitutes corroboration within
the statute.  In an appeal from New Zealand, Minister 
of Stamps v. Townend, [1909] A.C. 633, at p.638, 
Lord Loreburn, L.C., delivering the judgment of the 
Judicial Committee with reference to a similar statute 
of New Zealand, said the statute was satisfied when, 
upon the evidence taken as a whole, &quot;there is a 
substantial corroboration of the testimony given by the
interested party.&quot;  This &quot;confirms the credit not only 
of the statements which are expressly supported, but of
all statements made by the interested party.&quot;9</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12] I cannot accept that Middleton J.A. could have intended to
impose the criminal standard of proof while at the same time
rejecting the need for stricter corroboration.  The criminal
standard too would &#147;impose an obligation upon the claimant far in
excess of what the statute requires.&#148;
[13] Three other points tell against interpreting Bayley to have
imposed the criminal standard.  First, the English decisions
relied on by Middleton J.A. did not require proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Second, later in his reasons, Middleton J.A.
referred only to a &#147;suspicious mind&#148; and to &#147;viewing the evidence
with all possible caution.&#148;10  Third, the plaintiff in Bayley
succeeded though his case was far from overwhelming.  He claimed
that the deceased had failed to pay a commission on a real estate
deal.  The case turned on whether he had told the deceased, the
vendor, that he was acting for the purchaser as well and was also
receiving a commission from the purchaser.  The plaintiff
testified that he had so informed the deceased and, because he
was receiving a commission from both sides, he agreed to charge
the deceased a lower rate.  The plaintiff produced a contract
showing that the deceased had agreed to pay him a  2 percent
commission, instead of the going rate of 3 percent.  The court
held that the contract alone provided sufficient corroboration.
For these reasons, I do not think that Bayley imposed the
criminal standard for cases under s. 13 of the Evidence Act.
[14] I next turn to more recent authority.  In Moran v. Richards11
, Lerner J. reviewed Bayley in detail &#147;to dispel the suggestion&#148;
it required &#147;that the corroboration must be such as to satisfy
the judge beyond a reasonable doubt&#148;.  His decision has been
followed by several Ontario trial judges.12  More recently still,
the Alberta Court of Appeal explicitly rejected the notion that
Bayley required proof to the criminal standard:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>We do not take this to import a criminal standard of 
proof for the presence of corroborating evidence in 
these cases.  Rather, this excerpt serves as a 
reminder of the unique evidentiary problem that is 
encountered in them, and that a healthy scepticism 
may not be wholly inappropriate.13
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[15] The related line of authorities stemming from Johnstone has
also been questioned.  This court, in a short endorsement
allowing an appeal and ordering a new trial, expressed doubt
about the continuing validity of the criminal standard of proof
set out in Johnstone for cases where a party seeks to rebut a
presumption of resulting trust:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It will be for the new trial judge to decide whether 
the onus laid down in Johnstone v. Johnstone applies 
or whether that judgment has not survived more recent 
judgments of this court.14
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[16] In Dagle v. Dagle Estate15, MacDonald C.J.T.D. sitting ad hoc
in the Prince Edward Island Court of Appeal reviewed the
authorities and concluded that a presumption of resulting trust
could be rebutted by proof on a balance of probabilities.  His
decision was recently followed in Ontario16 and has been approved
by the authors of the Law of Evidence in Canada.17  Thus I
conclude that recent case law supports the application of the
civil standard where a party must meet the s. 13 corroboration
requirement or seeks to rebut a presumption of resulting trust.
[17] In principle, I see no justification for applying the
criminal standard in a civil action.  A criminal prosecution
differs fundamentally from a civil action, and the criminal
standard serves different ends and operates on different
assumptions from the civil standard.18  Moreover, nothing in s. 13
itself suggests that the Legislature intended to displace proof
on a balance of probabilities with proof beyond a reasonable
doubt.
[18] Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence has repeatedly
emphasized that in civil cases &#150; even in civil cases where the
alleged conduct is morally blameworthy or might attract penal
sanctions &#150; the standard of proof is on a balance of
probabilities.  Within that standard, the degree of proof may
vary depending on what is at stake.
[19] The Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the application of the
civil standard in Continental Insurance Co. v. Dalton Cartage Co.
Ltd.19, where an insured successfully recovered on an insurance
policy that excluded &#147;loss by infidelity&#148;:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Where there is an allegation of conduct that
	  is morally blameworthy or that could have a
	  criminal or penal aspect and the allegation is
	  made in civil litigation, the relevant burden of
          proof remains proof on a balance of probabilities.
	  So this Court decided in Hanes v. Wawanesa Mutual
	  Insurance Co., [1963] S.C.R. 154 .
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my opinion, Keith J. in dealing with
          the burden of proof could properly consider
          the cogency of the evidence offered to
          support proof on a balance of probabilities
          and this is what he did when he referred to
          proof commensurate with the gravity of the
          allegations or of the accusation of theft by
          the temporary driver.  There is necessarily a
          matter of judgment involved in weighing
          evidence that goes to the burden of proof,
          and a trial judge is justified in
          scrutinizing evidence with greater care if
          there are serious allegations to be
          established by the proof that is offered.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               I do not regard such an approach as a
          departure from a standard of proof based on a
          balance of probabilities nor as supporting a
          shifting standard.  The question in all civil
          cases is what evidence with what weight that
          is accorded to it will move the court to
          conclude that proof on a balance of
          probabilities has been established.20
</pre>
    <pre>[20] Similarly in Vout v. Hay21, where a will was alleged to be
invalid because of suspicious circumstances and undue influence,
McLachlin J. held that the civil standard of proof on a balance
of probabilities, not a higher standard, applied, though &#147;the
evidence must, however, be scrutinized in accordance with the
gravity of the suspicion.&#148;
[21] I therefore conclude that both principle and recent case law
support the application of the civil standard in this case, and
neither Bayley nor Johnstone justify departing from that
standard.  As Roberts J. properly applied the civil standard, I
would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>2.  Did the trial judge err by rejecting Kenneth King&#146;s evidence
    and ignoring Angela Wright&#146;s evidence?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[22] King, an accountant, who helped Burns with his tax returns,
gave evidence under Rule 36 of the Ontario Rules of Civil
Procedure.22  He testified about his conversations with Burns
concerning the transfer to Ms. Mellon.  According to King, Burns
regarded the money he gave to Ms. Mellon as his.  He thought by
transferring it to Ms. Mellon he would save taxes.  King said
that Burns told him he had demanded the money back.
[23] The trial judge ruled King&#146;s evidence inadmissible for four
reasons:  under the classic definition of hearsay, it was
inadmissible for the truth of its contents;  under the modern
approach to hearsay, it was unreliable;  King&#146;s discussions with
Burns were not contemporaneous with the transfer but took place
20 months later;  and evidence of an illegal scheme will not be
received to support a resulting trust.
[24] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
excluding King&#146;s evidence from consideration.  She submits that
his evidence was admissible to show Burns&#146; state of mind, that he
regarded the money as his and that he did not intend to make a
gift.
[25] Even if King&#146;s evidence should have been admitted to show
the deceased&#146;s state of mind, the trial judge was quite correct
not to give any effect to it because of its obvious
unreliability.  Two considerations undermine the reliability of
King&#146;s evidence.  First, his conversation with Burns was not
contemporaneous with the transfer, but took place months
afterwards.  Thus the conversation is of little help in
determining Burns&#146; intention at the time of the transfer.  A
party cannot ordinarily rely on a declaration subsequent to a
transfer to support his or her position.  A subsequent
declaration is only admissible as evidence against the party who
made it.  Therefore because Burns&#146; statements to King were not
contemporaneous with the transfer the appellant cannot rely on
them to support her position that the transfer was not a gift.23
[26] Second, King acknowledged that he had no confidence Burns
would tell him the truth about the transfer.  King testified:
          </pre>
    <pre>               Question:  Did you feel it&#146;s possible that 
	  Mr. Burns told Ms. Mellon that he was giving the
	  money to her as a gift and later lied to you
	  about having given it to her for tax purposes?
          Is that possible?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Answer:  Well, anything is possible, but
          how could I get inside his head?  I have no
          idea.  It&#146;s possible, but how would I know?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Question:   Do you feel you had the type
          of relationship with Mr. Burns, bearing Mr.
          Burns would never lie to you?
          </pre>
    <pre>               Answer:  The up and down relationship I
          had with Mr. Burns, I wouldn&#146;t feel one way
          or the other about it.  You&#146;ve got to
          remember Leo was there, Leo could be very
          helpful.  He was a neighbour.  I didn&#146;t get
          into &#150; there were no &#150; I didn&#146;t labour my
          mind on how is Leo feeling today.  Is he
          going to lie to me.  Just another person in
          an apartment.  It&#146;s the first time I&#146;d lived
          in an apartment, by the way.</pre>
    <pre>I therefore agree with the trial judge that King&#146;s evidence was
unreliable.
</pre>
    <pre>[27] The appellant also contends that the trial judge ignored the
evidence of Angela Wright, Burns&#146; other daughter.  Ms. Wright
testified that on one occasion when she visited her father in the
hospital, he became agitated that Ms. Mellon had not returned the
money.  The trial judge did not refer to this evidence in his
reasons.  I think it is reasonable to conclude, however, that he
did not refer to Ms. Wright&#146;s evidence because he did not accept
it.  I think it significant that on a later visit to the
hospital, her father refused to discuss the transfer with her.
[28] I therefore would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>3.  Did the trial judge err in finding that Ms. Mellon&#146;s evidence
    had been corroborated as required by s. 13 of the Evidence
    Act?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[29] The main issue on this appeal is whether Ms. Mellon&#146;s
evidence had been corroborated &#147;by some other material evidence.&#148;
The corroboration required by s. 13 must be evidence independent
of the evidence of Ms. Mellon, which shows that her evidence on a
material issue is true.  The corroborating evidence can be either
direct or circumstantial.  It can consist of a single piece of
evidence or several pieces considered cumulatively.24  Roberts J.
found that there was independent evidence corroborative of a
gift.  He relied on three pieces of evidence, which he
&#147;considered cumulatively.&#148;     </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a)       Burns made a holograph will in March 1996, about 10
months after the transfer.  In his will he made detailed
reference to all his assets, even an asset of only $2,500.  He
referred to the $100,000 loans he had made to each of his
daughters, which loans he forgave.  But he did not refer to 
the transfer to Ms. Mellon.

(b)       Burns kept no written record of the transfer.

(c)       Burns lived for two years after he transferred the
money to Ms. Mellon.  Yet there was no reliable evidence from
any source that he asked for the money back or for an accounting 
of it at any time before he died.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[30] The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in relying
on the absence of a written record and the absence of a demand
for repayment of the money, because neither piece of evidence was
independent of Ms. Mellon&#146;s testimony and neither was of much
probative value.  I accept that both pieces of evidence carry
little weight.  However, the will alone reasonably supports the
trial judge&#146;s finding of corroboration.  The will is an
especially strong piece of circumstantial evidence because it
addresses the vital issue in the case, whether Burns intended the
transfer to be a gift or whether he intended the money to be
repaid.  The will, though short, is quite detailed, and no
evidence was led to suggest that Burns&#146; omitted any of his
assets.  The will provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               I want out of my financial account Two
	  Thousand Dollars given to the Redemptorist
	  Fathers Roman Catholic Order, 426 St. Germain

	  this money I want Thirty-eight Thousand Dollars
	  given also to the Redemptorist Fathers to assist

          recently been informed by my previous
          employer namely Gulf Oil Co. that I hold a
          &#147;Group Life Insurance Plan&#148; to the value of
          $2,500.00 payable to whoever my Beneficiary
          may be.
          </pre>
    <pre>               My apartment furniture will be left at
          the disposal of my two daughters namely
          Patricia Riordan 759 Balmoral Drive,
          bramalea, Ont. And Angela Wright 2660 Brock
          Rd. North, Pickering Ont.  Patricia&#146;s tel no.
          792-0151. Angela&#146;s tel. No. 428-6459.  The
          apt has to be cleared out to the bare walls
          to comply with Building Owner&#146;s request.  My
          financial accounts are held by the Toronto
          Dominion Bank, Yonge St. &amp; Bedford Park Ave.
          My previous employer Gulf Oil Co. now in
          Calgary, Phone 1-800-661-3376.  When all
          expenses are paid, a large surplus of money
          should remain.  This is to be divided equally
          between my two daughters names previously
          stated.  They are also allowed to keep the
          $100,000.00 given each of them in previous
          years.
</pre>
    <pre>[31] The absence of any reference in the will to the $195,000
transfer and the explicit reference to the loans to Burns&#146;
daughters, taken together, corroborate Ms. Mellon&#146;s evidence that
the transfer was a gift.  The trial judge could reasonably infer
that if Burns had treated the $195,000 as a loan, he would have
listed it in his will along with his other assets.  Even in
Bayley, this court found that a single document, the agreement of
purchase and sale, amounted to sufficient corroboration.  So too
in this case does the will.
[32] Another piece of evidence, not referred to by the trial
judge, further corroborates Ms. Mellon&#146;s evidence.  When Burns&#146;
daughters visited their father shortly before his death, they
asked him for an explanation about the transfer.  He refused to
give them an explanation, from which a court could infer that he
did not want to tell his daughters about the money because it was
a gift to another woman.
[33] In my view the trial judge&#146;s finding that Ms. Mellon&#146;s
evidence had been corroborated as required by s. 13 of the
Evidence Act is reasonably supported by evidence.  That finding
is therefore entitled to deference from this court.  I would not
interfere with it.
[34] I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre>
