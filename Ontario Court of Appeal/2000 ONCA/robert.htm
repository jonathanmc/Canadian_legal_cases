    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction of Cusson J., sitting without a
jury, dated November 12, 1997.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>SHARPE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of intentionally causing fire to
a dwelling knowing the property was inhabited and of
intentionally causing damage by fire to a dwelling he did not
fully own.  He was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment on each
count, to be served concurrently.  The Crown&#146;s case was entirely
circumstantial.  The appellant was present when the fire started,
but he claimed the fire was accidental.  The trial judge, sitting
without a jury, held that in order to convict, he had to be
satisfied &#147;that the proven facts [lead] the court to no other
reasonable conclusion than the guilt of the accused&#148;.  The
appellant submits that rather than apply this principle to test
the case for the Crown, the trial judge used it to test the
appellant&#146;s explanation for the cause of the fire.  The appellant
argues that this required him to provide a reasonable explanation
for the fire on proven facts and, effectively, reversed the
burden of proof.
[2]  The appellant resided with his wife in a two-storey home
with an attached garage.  On the morning of July 3, 1994, he
mowed his lawn with a Sears lawn tractor.  That evening, he drove
the tractor into the garage.  Moments later, a fire started in
the garage. The fire spread quickly and destroyed the house.
[3]  The Crown&#146;s theory was that the appellant dismounted the
tractor, doused a pile of newspapers with gasoline and
deliberately ignited the fire.  The case was entirely
circumstantial and the Crown conceded that there was no proof of
motive.
[4]  The theory of the defence was that the fire was an accident.
The appellant testified that after he got off the tractor, and as
he left the garage he heard an explosion that knocked him to the
ground.  He got up and immediately warned the occupants of the
house that it was on fire.  The defence called expert evidence to
show that a possible cause of the fire was a backfire from the
tractor which could ignite a small quantity of spilled gasoline.
[5]  The appellant testified that on the morning of July 3, 1994
he filled his riding mower with gasoline from a red plastic two-
gallon jerry can.  He testified that while it was his usual
practice to put the cap and the vent cap tightener back on the
container, he had no specific recollection of having done so on
this occasion.  The appellant mowed his lawn and left the lawn
mover outside the garage.  The garage doors were left open all
day.  In the early afternoon, his in-laws arrived.  They brought
with them a stack of newspapers that the appellant required to
train his new dog.  The appellant moved the newspapers next to
the jerry can.
[6]  After dinner, the appellant drove his tractor around the
property and then into the garage.  It is his evidence that he
stepped off the tractor, removed the key and that, as he was
walking away from the tractor, he heard a noise.  He then found
himself laying face down on the ground with a fire burning.  The
appellant immediately ran to the house and yelled for everyone to
get out.  The fire destroyed the house.
[7]  The appellant&#146;s wife testified that she heard the appellant
drive the tractor into the garage and then she heard a bang.  She
thought that he drove into the garage wall.  Next she heard the
appellant yelling that the house was on fire.  She also testified
that, earlier on the day of the fire, she noticed that the jerry
can was in the garage and that its top was missing.  She was
concerned that her daughter&#146;s friend, who had been in the garage
and had stumbled, might have knocked over the jerry can.  She
went to investigate but could not see any gasoline spilled out of
the jerry can.  The appellant did not smell gasoline as he drove
into the garage, but he testified that he had a deficient sense
of smell.  He did not recall knocking over the jerry can.
[8]  The jerry can itself was destroyed by the fire.  It was not
possible to determine from the remaining melted plastic whether
it had been standing on its bottom or on its side as it burned.
However, another witness, Antony Weir, a neighbour of the
appellant, came by as the fire was burning.  It was his evidence
that the jerry can appeared as a silhouette and that it was
standing upright as the fire burned around it.
[9]  The 13-day trial proceeded intermittently over the course of
15 months between November 12, 1996 and May 22, 1997.  On
November 12, 1997, the trial judge gave reasons for judgment
convicting the appellant.  The trial judge did not explicitly
reject the evidence of the appellant nor did he express any clear
view as to the appellant&#146;s credibility.  The trial judge accepted
as a possible scenario that a backfire had occurred.  However,
the trial judge found that if the fire had been caused
accidentally by backfire, there had to have been a significant
gas spill on the garage floor.  The trial judge found that a
spill was not established.  The trial judge attached particular
significance to the evidence of a neighbour that, as the fire was
burning, he could see the jerry can standing upright.
[10] The appellant seeks leave to introduce fresh evidence
relating the trial judge&#146;s prior involvement in family law
proceedings involving the appellant, that allegedly gives rise to
a reasonable apprehension of bias.</pre>
    <pre>Issues</pre>
    <pre>[11] The appellant raises the following issues:
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   Was the verdict unreasonable and unsupported by the
evidence?

2.   Did the trial judge misapprehend or fail to consider
relevant evidence?

3.   Did the trial judge effectively reverse the burden of proof?

4.   Was there a reasonable apprehension of bias arising from the
trial judge&#146;s prior involvement in a family law proceeding
involving the appellant?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1:  Was the verdict unreasonable and unsupported by the
evidence?
Issue 2:  Did the trial judge misapprehend or fail to consider
relevant evidence?</pre>
    <pre>[12] As these two grounds of appeal are related and as we did not
find either to have sufficient merit to warrant calling upon Mr.
Rupic for a response, they can conveniently be dealt with
together.
[13] Mr. Code took us through a detailed review of the evidence
and made forceful submissions that the conviction should be set
aside and an acquittal entered.  In view of the conclusion I have
reached on the third ground of appeal, which leads me to conclude
that the convictions must be set aside and a new trial ordered, I
consider it neither necessary nor appropriate to review the
evidence in detail.  It suffices to say that, at the conclusion
of Mr. Code&#146;s submissions, we indicated that, subject to the
third ground of appeal, we were not persuaded that he was able to
demonstrate reversible error.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 3:  Did the trial judge effectively reverse the burden of
proof?</pre>
    <pre>[14] In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge noted that the
Crown&#146;s case was entirely circumstantial.  He described the
standard of proof he intended to apply to the Crown&#146;s case in the
following terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>    [T]his court cannot convict the accused unless it is
    convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the proven 
    facts leads the court to no other reasonable conclusion
    than the guilt of the accused.
     
[15] This test, often referred to as the rule in Hodge&#146;s case,
has often been used to described how the trier of fact is to
assess the case for the Crown when it is based on circumstantial
evidence.  However, since the decision of the Supreme Court of
Canada in R. v. Cooper (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 18 (S.C.C.), it is
clear that the rule in Hodge&#146;s case is not &#147;an inexorable rule of
law in Canada&#148;.  As was pointed out by this court in R. v. Fleet
(1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 at 464-465, the formula referred to
by the trial judge is but one of the ways of describing the
essential test, which remains, has the Crown proved the guilt of
the accused beyond a reasonable doubt:
          </pre>
    <pre>     We read the object of both judgments in Cooper to be the
     eradication of any formulaic approach to such cases so 
     long as the jury is clearly made aware of the necessity
     to find the guilt of the accused to be established beyond
     a reasonable doubt.  This object may be achieved in more
     ways than one.  Thus, the trial judge, reviewing the
     evidence and setting out the position of the defence and
     relating the substantial parts of the evidence to that
     position, may frame the requisite instruction in the manner
     he or she considers most appropriate in the circumstances, 
     for example, by:
          </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  charging the jury in accordance with the traditional
	  language of proof beyond a reasonable doubt (per Laskin
          C.J.C. in Cooper);
          </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  charging the jury in accordance with that language
          and pointing out to the jury the other inferences
          that the defence says should be drawn from the
          evidence and the necessity to acquit the accused if
          any of those inferences raises a reasonable doubt
          (as the trial judge did in Cooper in the final
          portion of his recharge); or
          </pre>
    <pre>     (c)  charging the jury that it must be satisfied
          beyond a reasonable doubt that the guilt of
	  the accused is the only reasonable inference
	  to be drawn from the proven facts (per Ritchie
	  J. in Cooper and Dubin J.A. in Elmosri).
          </pre>
    <pre>     The essential requirement is to impress upon the jury the
     need to find guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt and to
     make plain to them the manner in which such a doubt can
     arise in the context of a case of proof of identity by
     circumstantial evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[16] It is clear from Cooper, supra and Fleet, supra that
whatever formula is used, it must not divert attention from the
essential issue, namely, has the Crown proved the guilt of the
accused beyond a reasonable doubt?
[17] In my view, the trial judge&#146;s use of the Hodge&#146;s case
formula had that unfortunate result in the present case.  Rather
than ask whether the Crown had proved the guilt of the accused
beyond a reasonable doubt, the trial judge made his finding of
guilt by using the formula to test the explanation for the
possible cause of the fire offered by the accused.  The trial
judge required that the appellant offer an explanation based on
the &#147;proven facts&#148;, a standard that is never applicable to an
accused and, for reasons I will explain, a standard that may no
longer even be applicable to the Crown.
[18] Early in his reasons, the trial judge set out his basic
approach:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In this case, as is usually the case when only
	  one person is at the scene when a fire starts,
	  the question of that person&#146;s explanation of
	  how the fire started is very crucial.  Is that
          explanation credible, taking the known
	  circumstances into account? Are there any other
	  reasonable explanations for the fire ignition,
	  if that of the accused is not acceptable.  Is
	  the only reasonable conclusion the one that a
	  deliberate fire was set?  In the instant case,
	  we know only the accused was present when the
          fire ignited.  Was it an accident or was it
	  deliberate?
</pre>
    <pre>[19] After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge examined each
of the possible causes of the fire offered by the defence.  The
possible combination of aluminum nitrate with some organic
material was rejected as &#147;&#133;this could not be considered as a
reasonable conclusion from the proven facts&#148;.  The presence of a
damaged electrical cord was also dismissed: &#147;&#133;this scenario does
not lead one to conclude it is a reasonable probability on the
factual evidence at hand&#148;.
[20] This left the third and most plausible explanation for the
cause of the fire offered by the appellant, namely, the
possibility of a backfire igniting gas accidentally spilled in
the garage.  The trial judge found that he had &#147;no difficulty
accepting that Mr. Robert&#146;s tractor could have backfired&#148; as
described by the defence expert.  However, the trial judge found
that the other essential element of that explanation, namely, a
gas spill, had not been made out:
          </pre>
    <pre>                 That is too far fetched to be considered
 	  a reasonable conclusion as to how the gas spill
	  on the floor came about in the face of Mr.
	  Weir&#146;s evidence which I accept.
          </pre>
    <pre>                 While   theoretically,  the   backfire
          scenario  is  a  feasible  one,  it   becomes
          unacceptable  as a reasonable inference  from
          the   proven   circumstantial   facts.    The
          evidence  with  respect to the  feasible  gas
          spill  is not present.  Accordingly,  I  must
          reject  that  theory for the reasons  I  have
          stated.
          </pre>
    <pre>                The  court is then left with  only  one
          reasonable  inference to be  drawn  from  the
          proven  facts.   That is that this  fire  was
          deliberately set.
</pre>
    <pre>[21] The trial judge took as the starting point the presence of
the appellant at the scene of the fire and then scrutinized the
case for the defence by asking whether it established innocent
cause for the fire.  The appellant was, in effect, required to
satisfy the trial judge that an accidental cause was made out as
a &#147;reasonable inference&#148; or as a &#147;reasonable conclusion&#148; from the
&#147;proven facts&#148;.   With respect, that was not the issue from the
perspective of the appellant.  It was for the Crown to show
beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no other reasonable
inference than the guilt of the accused.  The appellant was
entitled to an acquittal if there was a reasonable doubt on all
of the evidence, a conclusion sustainable at a threshold
significantly lower than a &#147;reasonable inference&#148; from &#147;proven
facts&#148;.
[22] In my view, the trial judge took a formula, designed to test
the case for the Crown, and applied it to the accused.  This set
the standard too high.  It is trite law that an accused need only
raise a reasonable doubt as to guilt to gain an acquittal.  There
is no affirmative obligation on an accused to prove anything by
way of reasonable conclusion or reasonable inference.  As Martin
J.A. stated in R. v. Campbell (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 6 (Ont.
C.A.) at 22, &#147;&#133;reasonable possibilities in the accused&#146;s favour
may give rise to a reasonable doubt&#148;.
[23] The use of the phrase &#147;proven facts&#148; is problematic,
particularly from the perspective of the accused.  There is no
obligation on an accused to prove any facts.  As was stated in
Ungaro v. The King (1950), 96 C.C.C. 245 (S.C.C.) at 251 &#147;&#133;if the
judge or jury conclude the explanation &#145;might reasonably be
true&#146;, which is quite different from whether it is true,
reasonable or probable, then a reasonable doubt exists to which
the accused is entitled to the benefit&#148;.  See also Latour v. The
King (1950), 98 S.C.C. 258 (S.C.C.)  at 262, 264 and Linney v.
The Queen (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 294 at 298.
[24]  Indeed, as Mr. Code submitted, following R. v. Morin
(1988), 44 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Miller (1991), 68
C.C.C. (3d) 517 (C.A.) even the Crown is not required to prove
specific facts, but rather is required to prove the overall
verdict.  In R. v. Charemski (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 225
(S.C.C.), a recent decision dealing with motions for non-suit in
cases based on circumstantial evidence, the test to be applied by
the trier of fact is described in the following terms: &#147;&#133;a
finding of guilt could only be made where there was no other
rational explanation for the circumstantial evidence but that the
defendant committed the crime&#133;&#148;.  This formulation avoids the
phrase &#147;proven facts&#148; and is in keeping with the principles
stated in Morin, supra and Miller, supra.
[25] The trial judge required the appellant to provide a
reasonable explanation for the fire based upon proven facts, a
standard that is not justifiable in law.  It follows that the
convictions cannot stand.
</pre>
    <pre>Issue 4:  Was there a reasonable apprehension of bias arising
from the trial judge&#146;s prior involvement in a family law
proceeding involving the appellant?</pre>
    <pre>[26] The appellant sought to introduce fresh evidence on appeal
in support of the allegation that there was a reasonable
apprehension of bias on account of the trial judge&#146;s prior
involvement in a family law proceeding involving the appellant.
The respondent did not resist admission of the evidence on the
basis that where fresh evidence is adduced in support of an
allegation that there was unfairness in the trial process and the
issue is raised for the first time on appeal, an appellate court
may receive the evidence to see if the allegation is made out: R.
v. Joanisse (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont. C.A.).
[27] While the conclusion I have reached on the third ground of
appeal makes consideration of this ground redundant, I think it
appropriate to indicate my view that fresh evidence was entirely
unpersuasive in demonstrating a reasonable apprehension of bias.
[28] The facts are briefly as follows.  Following the fire that
destroyed their home, the appellant and his wife become involved
in bitterly fought matrimonial litigation.  In September 1994,
the wife obtained an interim custody order with unsupervised
access to the appellant.  The appellant was arrested on September
15, 1994 for the offences at issue here.  He was released on
bail.  The wife then applied for an order restricting the
appellant&#146;s access and the judge hearing the application
indicated that she was not prepared to vary the earlier order but
that, as there were possible inconsistencies between the custody
order and the terms of the appellant&#146;s bail, both matters should
be brought back before the court together.  The joint application
of the wife to vary the terms of access and of the appellant to
vary the terms of his bail came before Cusson J. on November 4,
1994.  The affidavits filed by the wife contained serious
allegations of wrongdoing against the appellant.  However, there
was no cross-examination on the affidavits and no oral evidence
presented.  Cusson J. adjourned the applications on the following
terms:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This Court orders that an assessment shall
	  be completed by a competent person as agreed
	  between the parties or as ordered by this court,
	  the costs to be shared equally between the parties.
          </pre>
    <pre>                This Court orders that the question  of
          access is modified to supervised access,  the
          supervisor to be approved by the CAS, once  a
          week  on Saturday between 10:00 a.m. and 6:00
          p.m.
          </pre>
    <pre>                This  Court orders that the  matter  is
          adjourned    further    until    after    the
          Respondent&#146;s bail review proceedings&#133;
</pre>
    <pre>[29] The matter came back before another judge on March 10, 1995.
The wife was awarded interim custody and the appellant was
granted unsupervised access.
[30] The fresh evidence indicates that during the trial, both the
appellant and his trial counsel became aware that the trial judge
had made the order adjourning the matrimonial proceedings.  They
did not object to the trial judge continuing with the case.
[31] In my view, these facts fall well short of establishing a
case for reasonable apprehension of bias.  The involvement of the
trial judge in the matrimonial proceedings almost a year before
the commencement of the trial was minimal.  He heard no evidence
and he made no findings.  While he did make an interim order
limiting the terms of the appellant&#146;s access, that was plainly on
an &#147;interim-interim&#148; basis and, by ordering an assessment, it
reveals that the trial judge did not expressly decide anything.
Trial judges routinely deal with many such motions in the course
of a single day.  The reasonable observer would conclude that it
would be highly unlikely that a judge would even recall, a year
later, factual allegations made in affidavits filed in support of
a motion that was adjourned. The involvement of the trial judge
in the matrimonial proceedings was hardly memorable to the
appellant.  On his own evidence, he did not recall the fact until
reference was made to the order the trial judge had made by one
of the witnesses.  The failure of the appellant and his counsel
to object when they became aware of the facts is telling.
[32] Taking all these facts into account, it is my view that the
fresh evidence falls well short of demonstrating that a
reasonable person, informed of all the circumstances, would have
a reasonable apprehension of bias.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[33] As I have concluded that the trial judge erred with respect
to the burden of proof, I would set aside the conviction and
order a new trial.</pre>
