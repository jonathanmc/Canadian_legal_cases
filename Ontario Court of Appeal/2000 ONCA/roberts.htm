</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice J. W. O&#146;Brien dated
July 24, 1997 and the supplementary reasons dated October 28,
1997, December 12, 1997 and February 12, 1998</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Following a forty-four day trial plus additional days of
evidence and argument, O&#146;Brien J. awarded Penny Roberts (&#147;the
plaintiff&#148;) approximately $4.5 million, including $3.83 million
for future care.  This appeal raises issues of liability, damages
and costs of the proceedings.
[2]  With the exception of the issues raised with respect to
section 116 of the Courts of Justice Act R.S.O.1990, c. C.43 and
the costs, the issues raised in this appeal are fact-driven and
the appellants essentially sought to re-try the case by
challenging the weight given to the evidence by the trial judge.
This aspect of the appeal must be dismissed.  We adopt the trial
judge&#146;s comprehensive and carefully considered reasons.  More
specifically, the findings of fact and the inferences drawn by
the trial judge in relation to liability, community support
services and accommodation and moving costs are all reasonable
and amply supported by the evidence and based on sound and
accepted legal principles.
[3]  With respect to the section 116 issue, the appellants assert
that, the trial judge erred in requiring them to purchase a
structured annuity in the amount of the present value of the
award for future care costs. The appellants submit that the trial
judge ought to have accepted their proposal of a structured
annuity that would provide periodic payments, indexed to the
Consumer Price Index, corresponding to the various specific items
of future care needs identified by the trial judge. The cost of
the structured annuity proposed by the appellants was
approximately $800,000 less than the present value of the future
care award.
[4]  Section 116 provides, in part, as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>116(1)  Periodic payment and review of damages &#150; In a
proceeding where damages are claimed for personal injuries 
or under Part V of the Family Law Act for loss resulting 
from the injury to or death of a person, the court,</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a)  if all affected parties consent,
may order the defendant to pay all or part 
of the award for damages periodically on 
such terms as the court considers just; and</pre>
        <pre>(b)  if the plaintiff requests that
an amount be included in the award to
offset any liability for income tax
payable on income from the investment
of the award, shall order the
defendant to pay all or part of the
award periodically on such terms as
the court considers just.</pre>
        <pre>. . .</pre>
        <pre>(5)  Amount to offset liability for
income tax &#150; If the court does not make an
order for periodic payment under subsection
(1), it shall make an award for damages that
shall include an amount to offset liability
for income tax on income from investment of
the award.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[5]  The starting point for the interpretation of s. 116 (read in
conjunction with rule 53.09 (1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure
(the discount rate)) is the determination of the present value of
the future care award.  Consideration of a periodic award was
triggered, pursuant to s. 116(1)(b), by the respondent&#146;s request
that an amount be included in the award to offset any liability
of income tax.  It is only after the calculation of the award is
made that consideration is given to a periodic payment of the
award or gross-up: Wilson v. Martinello (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 417
at 427-8 (C.A.).
[6]  The wording of s. 116 does not permit the court to order
periodic payments in the manner suggested by the appellants.  In
our view, &#147;the award&#148; that is to be paid periodically can only be
&#147;the award&#148; that triggers consideration of periodic payments.
The wording of s. 116 may be contrasted with the Manitoba
legislation, considered in Lusignan (Litigation Guardian of) v.
Concordia Hospital (1998), 44 C.C.L.T. (2d) 90 (Man Q.B.) which
specifically requires the court to order structured payments on
an item by item basis.  But for s. 116, the respondent would have
been entitled to a lump sum award including the amount necessary
to offset liability for tax on income derived from the award.  We
accept the respondent&#146;s submission that specific legislation,
along the lines of the Manitoba scheme, would be required to take
away her right to receive the full benefit of the present value
of the award in her favour.  We do not accept the submission of
the appellants that it would be appropriate for this court to
&#147;read in&#148; the words that would be needed to alter the effect of
s. 116 to avoid what they perceive to be over-compensation to the
respondent.  The appellants have been relieved of the obligation
to pay approximately $4 million by way of gross-up for income
tax. That is the benefit intended by s. 116.  Any further
reduction in their liability would require legislative change.
[7]  The trial judge heard a substantial amount of evidence and
argument on the issue of the appropriate order pursuant to s.
116.  The Litigation Guardian for the plaintiff, an experienced
personal injury litigation lawyer, recommended that the major
part of the future-care award be structured and that the balance,
for which no gross-up was requested, be conservatively invested
for her protection in the event of unanticipated development
amongst the items covered by the award.
[8]  The trial judge determined the present value of the future-
care award.  He then considered the benefits and disadvantages of
a structured settlement and approved a periodic-payment schedule
for a structured part of the award.  He required a lump-sum
payment of the balance of the award and approved a management
plan for the amount paid to the credit of the plaintiff in order
to provide for her financial flexibility.
[9]  It is clear that the trial judge concluded that the plan
proposed by the Litigation Guardian was in the plaintiff&#146;s best
interests.  The trial judge applied appropriate legal principles
and we see no basis to interfere.
[10] Finally, with respect to costs, the trial judge fixed the
costs of the action following a two-day hearing during which he
examined extensive documentary evidence and heard submissions.
Under the authority of rule 49.10, he awarded part of the costs
on a solicitor-and-client basis.  The appellants challenge three
aspects of the cost award: first, two disbursements allowed as
part of the costs; second, the premium awarded against them over
the docketed time expended: and third, the allocation of the
costs among the appellants.  We see no merit in the attack on the
disbursements.  On the second ground, the trial judge concluded
that the &#147;meticulous, ingenious preparation and presentation of
the case&#148;, &#147;the financial risk incurred by the plaintiff&#146;s
counsel and the extraordinary result&#148; achieved, justified the
premium awarded. In our view, the trial judge properly exercised
his discretion when awarding the premium over the time docketed.
We would not interfere with his disposition of the costs.  As to
the third ground, the trial judge considered all the relevant
factors relative to the apportionment of the costs and we see no
basis to interfere.
[11] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
