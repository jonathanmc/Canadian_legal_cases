	       THOMAS ROBERTSON (Appellant)</strong></pre>

    <pre><strong>COUNSEL:       Irwin Koziebrocki, for the appellant</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>               Grace Choi, for the respondent</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>HEARD:         May 9, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the conviction imposed by J.R. Morgan J. dated
March 10, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The Crown does not dispute that it was open to the trial
judge to permit the defence to question the complainant on what
she told the police about whether the act with the appellant was
her first act of sexual intercourse.  The Crown also does not
dispute that it was open to the trial judge to permit the defence
to call Ms. Gushue to contradict the complainant's denial that
she told her she had intercourse with her boyfriend.
[2]  Accordingly, we are not called upon to consider the
correctness of allowing that extent of questioning on prior
sexual conduct.  We do agree that contradicting the complainant
on whether in fact she had intercourse with her boyfriend or was
abused by her father was irrelevant to any of the issues of the
case except credibility and, therefore, the defence was not
entitled to contradict the complainant by extrinsic evidence.
Admission of this evidence would offend the collateral fact rule
quite apart from the provisions of s.276 of the Criminal Code.
[3]  As to the other grounds of appeal, we did not find it
necessary to call upon Crown counsel.  We do not agree that the
trial judge improperly compartmentalized the defence evidence or
erred in taking into account the appellant&#146;s flight as conscience
of guilt.  We see no error in the manner in which the trial judge
dealt with the complainant&#146;s credibility.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  The
sentence of four years&#146; imprisonment was well within the
appropriate range and, accordingly, while leave to appeal
sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</pre>
