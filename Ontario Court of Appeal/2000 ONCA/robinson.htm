    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Cusinato dated
September 21, 1998
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CHARRON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   Dr.  Halpenny  is an orthopaedic surgeon who  treated  Kirk
Robinson  for  a  hand fracture. Following a trial,  Cusinato  J.
found  that  Dr.  Halpenny&#146;s treatment fell below  the  requisite
standard  of  care  and  that  this breach  of  duty  caused  the
permanent injury to Mr. Robinson&#146;s hand. The trial judge  awarded
Mr.  Robinson  total  damages  of  $208,867.90  plus  prejudgment
interest and costs. Dr. Halpenny appeals from both the finding of
liability and the quantum of damages.</pre>
    <pre>     The Facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]   On  June 12, 1993, Mr. Robinson, while carrying a box  down
his  basement stairs, accidentally tripped over his dog.  In  his
attempt to stop his fall, he extended his left arm and, in  doing
so, his left hand struck against the concrete basement wall. When
his  hand  began to swell and throb, he went to the  hospital  to
have it examined. He was referred to  the orthopaedic surgeon  on
duty at the time, Dr. Halpenny.
[3]  Dr. Halpenny directed that x-rays be taken. The x-rays
revealed that Mr. Robinson had a slight fracture of the
metacarpal of the third finger of his left hand.  Dr. Halpenny
first realigned the fracture and no issue arises with respect to
that part of the treatment. Then, Dr. Halpenny immobilized the
four fingers of Mr. Robinson&#146;s left hand in a plaster cast in a
position &#147;very much like a closed boxing glove&#148;. The manner in
which Dr. Halpenny immobilized the fracture was the main
complaint at trial. A secondary complaint related to Dr.
Halpenny&#146;s follow-up care of Mr. Robinson.
[4]  When Mr. Robinson had the cast removed on July 9, 1993, all
four of the fingers on his left hand were stiffened in the
position in which they had been immobilized in the cast. He could
only move his fingers about an inch up or down. This condition
was described as &#147;contractures&#148;. Dr. Halpenny told Mr. Robinson
that this stiffness had resulted from the cast and that his hand
should return to normal in a few weeks. Dr. Halpenny told
Mr. Robinson to squeeze a ball with his hand and told him to see
his family doctor if he had any further problems.
[5]  Mr. Robinson&#146;s fingers stiffened further and, about a week
later, they started to close up completely into a fist. Mr.
Robinson saw his family doctor who arranged an appointment with
Dr. Halpenny. By the time Mr. Robinson saw Dr. Halpenny on
August 19, 1993, the tips of his fingers were in a frozen
position about one half inch from his palm. He was also
experiencing a burning sensation and a clammy feeling in that
hand. These symptoms were described at trial as being probably
due to a condition known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy or RSD.
Upon seeing Mr. Robinson, Dr. Halpenny immediately sent him for
physiotherapy. After several painful and unsuccessful therapy
sessions involving the use of hot wax and the use of force to pry
the fingers open, Mr. Robinson returned to his family doctor to
request another type of treatment. In May 1994, the family
physician referred him to Dr. Richards, a plastic surgeon with a
sub-specialty in hand surgery.
[6]  After two surgeries in 1994 and 1996, Mr. Robinson&#146;s hand
was opened but remained without function.  His overall level of
disability was described by Dr. Richards as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>	With respect to the left hand he basically has a 
	total disability with respect to that hand for any 
	job or occupation.  He can&#146;t carry with it, he 
	can&#146;t functionally use a keyboard. He has problems 
	with cold sensitivity. He will never be allowed to
        work in an outdoor occupation because the hand, as 
	a result of all the injuries, doesn&#146;t have normal 
	blood supply. It is exquisitely sensitive to the 
	cold. So functionally for his age and education 
	level there is no job that I can conceive of him
        being able to do. He would need an indoor right 
	hand only job.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  At the time of the injury, Mr. Robinson was 38 years old. He
had a grade 10 education, was unemployed at the time and had been
unemployed for some time before that.
[8]  The trial judge concluded that Dr. Halpenny fell below the
standard of care required of him in the immobilization of Mr.
Robinson&#146;s injured hand and that this breach was causally
connected to the resulting permanent disability. In light of this
conclusion, the trial judge found it unnecessary to determine
whether there was any breach of the standard of care with respect
to the follow-up treatment. The trial judge then assessed total
damages in the amount of $208,867.90 as follows:
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a) general damages  _____       $70,000.00

(b) past wage loss   _____        25,000.00

(c) future wage loss _____       100,000.00

(d) special damages  _____        13,867.90</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[9]   Dr. Halpenny submits that the trial judge erred in law with
respect to both the applicable standard of care and the test  for
causation. He also submits that the trial judge erred in  failing
to consider the issue of contributory negligence arising from the
fact   that  Mr.  Robinson  did  not  pursue  his  treatment   in
physiotherapy. Finally, Dr. Halpenny submits that the  amount  of
general  damages is excessive and that the award of  damages  for
wage  loss,  both  past  and future,  is  not  supported  by  the
evidence.
Standard of Care
</pre>
    <pre>[10]  Dr.  Halpenny&#146;s main argument on the issue of  standard  of
care  is that the trial judge erred in holding him to an unfairly
rigorous  standard by disregarding his lack of  sub-specialty  in
hand  surgery.  In  support  of this argument,  counsel  for  the
appellant  relies  on an excerpt from the trial  judge&#146;s  reasons
where  he  purports  to answer a question posed  by  one  of  the
medical  experts  during the course of his testimony.  The  trial
judge first quoted the question from Dr. Wright&#146;s testimony:
          </pre>
    <pre>	One final question that I have for the legal profession 
	is whether the same community standard can be applied 
	to all types of physicians that treat hand fractures. 
	Is this the same for an emergency medicine physician, 
	a general practitioner, an  orthopaedic surgeon in 
	general practice and a hand surgeon with sub-specialty 
	training?  In my own circumstances I did not receive 
	very much in terms of hand surgery training as a
        resident.  It was only when I went away to do my hand 
	surgery sub-specialty training that I became aware and 
	educated in these different positions of hand 
	immobilization that are thought to be most beneficial 
	to patients such as Mr. Robinson.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The trial judge then commented on this testimony as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>        What I extract from Dr. Wright's evidence is that he 
	was not completely aware of the concerns identified 
	by the medical literature concerning the positioning 
	or casting of a metacarpal fracture as a medical 
	resident.  This he submits was achieved only when he 
	received more extensive training.       </pre>
    <pre>        To directly address  Dr. Wright&#146;s question as it 
	relates to this defendant upon whether he should be 
	judged by a more  modest standard  in his treatment 
	of the  plaintiff, this should be answered with a 
	resounding no. [Emphasis added.]
     
[12]  If  the  trial judge&#146;s &#147;resounding no&#148;  in  answer  to  Dr.
Wright&#146;s question is to be taken as a general proposition of  law
that  all  physicians  are  to  be held  to  the  same  standard,
regardless   of   their   particular  training,   experience   or
circumstances, I would agree with counsel for the appellant  that
it is incorrect. However, I do not read the trial judge&#146;s reasons
as  adopting such a proposition. The above-noted excerpt must  be
read  in the context of the entire reasons. It is clear from this
context that the trial judge applied the proper standard.
[13] First, I note that, earlier in his reasons, the trial judge
cited the following excerpt from Sylvester v. Crits (1956), 1
D.L.R. (2d) 502 at 508, aff&#146;d [1956] S.C.R. 991 as setting out
the standard of care adopted by our courts:
          </pre>
    <pre>	Every medical practitioner must bring to his task 
	a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must 
	exercise a reasonable degree of care. He is bound 
	to exercise that degree of care and skill which could 
	reasonably be expected of a normal, prudent 
	practitioner of the same experience and standing, and 
	if he holds himself out as a specialist, a higher 
	degree of skill is required of him than of one who 
	does not profess to be so qualified by special 
	training and ability.</pre>
    <pre>[14] No issue is taken with this statement of the law.
[15] Second, it is important to note that the trial judge gave
this impugned answer, not as a general proposition of law but
rather, &#147;as it relates to this defendant &#133; in his treatment of
the plaintiff&#148;. Hence, he was referring to the standard of care
to be expected of Dr. Halpenny as it related to the particular
treatment in question, the casting of a hand fracture. In other
words, the trial judge simply found that this particular doctor
performing this particular treatment should not be assessed
against a lower standard of care.  With respect to the
performance of this task, the trial judge&#146;s view that no lesser
standard should be expected of the orthopaedic resident was well
supported by the evidence. In support of his finding, the trial
judge referred to the expert testimony of Dr. Richards on the
education received by an orthopaedic resident. It is clear from
this evidence that a physician in Dr. Halpenny&#146;s position would
be aware of the appropriate positioning of a fractured hand for
the purpose of immobilization. The trial judge also referred to
Dr. Halpenny&#146;s own testimony where he conceded that he would have
received this training. On the basis of this evidence, the trial
judge concluded as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>	From my analysis of the expert testimony of Dr. 
	Richards, I have formed the following conclusion 
	as to the orthopaedic surgeon who practices in a 
	smaller community hospital. Although he may not 
	be aware of all the sophisticated intricacies of 
	hand surgery, if he undertakes a procedure to set 
	a fractured metacarpal, he must at minimum be aware 
	of the dangers of immobilizing a joint in a position 
	which does not accord with the standard literature.
          </pre>
    <pre>        The defendant as a physician who specializes in 
	orthopaedics, should and  must be aware of the  
	danger of secondary contractures which may result 
	from inappropriate immobilization.
     
[16]  Given  this  context, I see no error in the  trial  judge&#146;s
reasons on the applicable standard of care. It is clear from  his
reasons  as a whole that he applied a standard of care which  was
appropriate  to  Dr. Halpenny&#146;s circumstances and  his  level  of
expertise. Applying this standard, the trial judge found that the
manner in which Dr. Halpenny immobilized Mr. Robinson&#146;s hand &#147;met
neither  of the criteria adopted by Dr. Wright or by Dr.  Richard
[the two medical experts called at trial] nor does it accord with
the  recommended  literature.&#148; The trial judge  also  noted  that
&#147;[o]n  Dr.  Halpenny&#146;s own admissions he has failed to  meet  the
recommended  criteria for immobilization of the hand as  reported
by Dr. Richards, and for which the defence expert does not differ
greatly.&#148;
[17] Hence, the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that Dr. Halpenny had
breached the standard of care in his treatment of Mr. Robinson&#146;s
fracture was based on correct principles of law and was amply
supported by the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>Causation
</pre>
    <pre>[18]  On the issue of causation, counsel for the appellant  takes
particular  issue  with the trial judge&#146;s interpretation  of  the
Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s decision in Snell v. Farrell, [1990]  2
S.C.R.  311. Counsel submits that the trial judge erred  when  he
stated  &#147;I  accept  the language of Snell v.  Farrell,  that  the
plaintiff  need only prove that the defendant created a  risk  of
harm,  and that the injury occurred within the area of the risk.&#148;
It  is  argued  that  the Supreme Court expressly  rejected  this
proposition  as  evidenced  by the  following  excerpt  from  the
unanimous  judgment  of  the Court authored  by  Sopinka  J.  (at
pp. 326-27):
          </pre>
    <pre>	Causation is an expression of the relationship that
        must be found to exist between the tortious act of 
	the wrongdoer and the injury to the victim in order 
	to justify compensation of the latter out of the 
	pocket of the former.  Is the requirement that the 
	plaintiff prove that the defendant's tortious conduct
        caused or contributed to the plaintiff's injury too 
	onerous?  Is some lesser relationship sufficient to 
	justify compensation?  I have examined the alternatives 
	arising out of the McGhee case.  They were that the 
	plaintiff simply prove that the defendant created a 
	risk that the injury which occurred would occur.  Or,
        what amounts to the same thing, that the defendant 
	has the burden of disproving causation.  If I were 
	convinced that defendants who have a substantial 
	connection to the injury were escaping liability 
	because plaintiffs cannot prove causation under
        currently applied principles, I would not hesitate 
	to adopt one of these alternatives.  In my opinion, 
	however, properly applied, the principles relating 
	to causation are adequate to the task.   Adoption 
	of either of the proposed alternatives would have the
        effect of compensating plaintiffs where a substantial 
	connection between the injury and the defendant's 
	conduct is absent.  Reversing the burden of proof 
	may be justified where two defendants negligently 
	fire in the direction of the plaintiff and then by 
	their tortious conduct destroy the means of proof at 
	his disposal.  In such a case it is clear that the 
	injury was not caused by neutral conduct.  It is 
	quite a different matter to compensate a plaintiff 
	by reversing the burden of proof for an injury that 
	may very well be due to factors unconnected to the
        defendant and not the fault of anyone. [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[19]  I  agree  with  counsel for the appellant  that  the  trial
judge&#146;s  statement, when considered on its own,  contradicts  the
above-noted excerpt from Snell v. Farrell where the Court clearly
rejects the proposition in the decision of the House of Lords  in
McGhee,  that  the plaintiff need only prove that  the  defendant
created  a  risk  that  the injury which  occurred  would  occur.
However,  both the excerpt from the judgment in Snell  v.  Farell
and the trial judge&#146;s reasons must be considered in context.
[20] While the Supreme Court rejected the proposition arising
from the decision in McGhee, it is clear from the above-noted
excerpt that this proposition was rejected because its
application would in effect serve to reverse the ultimate burden
of proof on the issue of causation. This does not mean, however,
that the fact that a &#147;plaintiff created a risk that the injury
which occurred would occur&#148; is irrelevant to the issue of
causation. While proof of this fact by a plaintiff will not
effect a reversal of the burden of proof, it may well result in
an inference of causation being drawn adverse to the defendant.
The following further excerpt from Snell v. Farrell (at pp. 328-
29) may be useful to consider:
          </pre>
    <pre>        In many malpractice cases, the facts lie particularly
        within the knowledge of the defendant.  In these 
	circumstances, very little affirmative evidence on 
	the part of the plaintiff will justify the drawing of 
	an inference of causation in the absence of evidence 
	to the contrary. This has been expressed in terms of 
	shifting the burden of proof.</pre>
    <pre>[21] After referring to several cases that spoke of a reversal or
shifting  of  onus, Sopinka J. commented on these authorities  as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>        These references speak of the shifting of the secondary
        or evidential burden of proof or the burden of adducing 
	evidence.  I find it preferable to explain the process 
	without using the term secondary or evidential burden.  
	It is not strictly accurate to speak of the burden 
	shifting to the defendant when what is meant is that 
	evidence adduced by the plaintiff may result in an
        inference being drawn adverse to the defendant. Whether 
	an inference is or is not drawn is a matter of weighing 
	evidence.   The defendant runs the risk of an adverse 
	inference in the absence of evidence to the contrary.  
	This is sometimes referred to as imposing on the 
	defendant a provisional or tactical burden.  See Cross, 
	op. cit., at p. 129.  In my opinion, this is not a
        true burden of proof, and use of an additional label to 
	describe what is an ordinary step in the fact-finding 
	process is  unwarranted.
          </pre>
    <pre>        The   legal  or  ultimate  burden
          remains  with  the  plaintiff,  but  in   the
          absence  of evidence to the contrary  adduced
          by  the  defendant, an inference of causation
          may  be drawn although positive or scientific
          proof of causation has not been adduced.   If
          some  evidence to the contrary is adduced  by
          the defendant, the trial judge is entitled to
          take   account  of  Lord  Mansfield's  famous
          precept.   This  is,  I  believe,  what  Lord
          Bridge  had  in  mind  in  Wilsher  when   he
          referred  to a &quot;robust and pragmatic approach
          to the ... facts&quot; (p. 569).
</pre>
    <pre>[22]  It  is clear from the totality of the trial judge&#146;s reasons
that  he  clearly understood that the Supreme Court of Canada  in
Snell  v.  Farrell  had rejected the proposition  that  the  onus
should  be  reversed in medical malpractice cases  and,  instead,
adopted  the flexible approach to the proof of causation set  out
above.  Before considering the evidence, the trial judge reviewed
the  relevant  law  on standard of care. His analysis,  in  part,
reads as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>	Where an allegation of breach of a medical standard
	of care is raised, the initial question that arises 
	is upon whom is the burden of proof placed. Ordinarily 
	the onus is upon those who make the claim. There was 
	however a period where the legal maximum [sic] of res 
	ipsa locquitor [sic] flourished.</pre>
    <pre>[23]   The  trial  judge  then  reviewed  some  of  the  relevant
jurisprudence and concluded as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               This legal principal [sic] which it is
	  said, shifted the onus of proof upon the
	  defendant to explain at the outset, no longer
	  holds favour in our jurisprudence. It is
	  considered an unnecessary legal maxim. It is
	  replaced by the common law rule that has
	  always existed, that the plaintiff establish
	  a prima facie breach of the standard of care
	  required which may be satisfied by circumstantial
	  evidence. Where the circumstantial evidence
	  presented, establishes a reasonable inference of
          negligence against the physician, such inference
	  requires an explanation to show there was no
	  negligence. Where this inference is not removed
	  by evidence from the defendant, then in this
          instance as confirmed by our courts, it should
	  be enough to satisfy the onus of proof.
          </pre>
    <pre>                This  is  particularly true  where  the
          facts  are  not  equally consistent  with  no
          negligence as with negligence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                As  commented  by  Justice  Sopinka  in
          Fontaine  v.  British Columbia,  1997  S.C.J.
          100,  Paragraph 17, in doing  away  with  the
          principle of res ipsa loquitor [sic], he puts
          his thoughts in these terms;
          </pre>
    <pre>                           &#147;&#133;correctly understood, [it]
               means   that   circumstantial   evidence
               constitutes   reasonable   evidence   of
               negligence&#133; [and] if at the conclusion of the
               case, it would be equally reasonable to infer
               negligence or no negligence, the plaintiff
               will lose since he/she bears the legal burden
               on this issue. Under this construction, the
               maxim  is superfluous, it can be treated
               simply as a case of circumstantial evidence.
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . .
          </pre>
    <pre>                As  shown in Snell v. Farell, 72 D.L.R.
          (4th)  289, negligence can be found based  on
          reasonable inferences. The defendant&#146;s  being
          unable  to  provide  sufficient  evidence  to
          rebut the reasonable inference of negligence,
          the  Supreme  Court  of Canada  was  able  to
          satisfy  itself  that on the  fact  situation
          before  them,  on a balance of probabilities,
          the  case  of  negligence was  made  out.  In
          coming to this determination, the court found
          that  the  evidence adduced by the  plaintiff
          was  sufficient  to support an  inference  of
          causation based on common sense, despite  the
          absence of positive medical opinions.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Significant  to  the Supreme  Court  of
          Canada&#146;s determination as it relates  to  the
          plaintiff&#146;s obligation to establish a  breach
          of   the   standard  of  care  in  a  medical
          malpractice    suit   is    the    additional
          requirement of causation as it relates to the
          complained  of injury. It is here  where  the
          court speaks of its acceptance, that where on
          the  totality of the evidence, the  inference
          is raised as to negligence, which is directly
          related to the cause of harm, then it is  not
          strictly  accurate  to speak  of  the  burden
          shifting to the defendant. It is rather  that
          the  evidence  adduced by the  plaintiff  may
          result in an inference being drawn adverse to
          the  defendant where there is an  absence  of
          evidence to the contrary.</pre>
    <pre>[24]  After  referring  to  the recent Supreme  Court  of  Canada
decision in Athey v. Leonati, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458 where the court
reiterated  that the onus is on the plaintiff to prove  causation
and  that causation may be inferred from the evidence, the  trial
judge concluded as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It is with these principles that the evidence
	  before me is to be applied to determine if the
	  plaintiff has satisfied both a breach of the
	  standard of care and a causal relationship to
	  the injury complained of.</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Despite the trial judge&#146;s apparent misunderstanding of  one
aspect  of  Sopinka  J.&#146;s  analysis in Snell  v.  Farrell,  I  am
satisfied,  given the entirety of his reasons, that he  correctly
instructed  himself  on  the  law  of  causation.  He   correctly
understood that an inference of causation may be drawn  from  the
evidence  even in the absence of scientific or medical  certainty
and,  although  the burden of proof remains on the plaintiff,  an
absence of evidence to the contrary adduced by the defendant will
be  weighed in the balance in determining what inferences  should
properly be drawn from the evidence. The question remains whether
he correctly applied these principles to the evidence.
[26] Most of the trial judge&#146;s reasons relate to the standard of
care issue and his conclusions on causation are also intertwined
with the question of standard of care. The two issues appeared to
have been meshed together as a result of the approach taken by
the medical experts who testified at trial. In particular, Dr.
Wright, who testified on behalf of the defence, linked the issue
of causation to the question of standard of care. In his view, it
could not be said that Dr. Halpenny fell below the standard of
care by failing to follow the recommended procedure in
immobilizing Mr. Robinson&#146;s hand because there was no established
scientific certainty as to the cause of contractures based on a
position of immobilization. On the other hand, Dr. Richards, who
testified on behalf of Mr. Robinson, stated that the purpose of
following the recommended procedure in immobilizing the hand was
to avoid contractures. He testified that the most probable result
of the failure to immobilize the hand properly was a much higher
risk of joint contractures.  Dr. Richards also testified that any
subsequent problems that may occur such as RSD, a condition that
may result from the injury itself, would become more difficult to
treat because the subsequent problem would start when the hand is
already in a poor position. Hence, on Dr. Richards&#146; evidence, Dr.
Halpenny&#146;s failure to properly immobilize the hand also
contributed to the subsequent development of RSD. The trial judge
accepted the evidence of Dr. Richards on this issue and concluded
on the totality of the evidence that there was a causal link
between the improper immobilization, the contractures and the
ultimate condition suffered by Mr. Robinson. His reasons, in
part, read as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               . . . Dr. Halpenny failed to minimize the
	  risks in his treatment of the plaintiff.  In so
	  doing he failed to meet the required standard 
	  of care in the immobilization and treatment of
          the metacarpal fracture. It is from this failure,
	  that I find there is a clear inference of a
	  breach of the standard of care in the treatment
	  of the plaintiff and a direct causal connection
	  to the problems suffered by the plaintiff.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    I do not accept, or do I find, that
          Dr. Wright's evidence overcomes the inference
          of  negligence.  In this regard, I accept  in
          totality   the  evidence  of  Dr.   Richards.
          Wherever Dr. Wright's evidence may differ  as
          to  the  proper and reasonable  standards  of
          treatment to be followed by the defendant,  I
          prefer the evidence of the plaintiff expert.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In my analysis of the evidence, and
          in  arriving at my conclusions, I have  noted
          from a review of the evidence of the experts,
          that   when   we  analyze  their   testimony,
          Dr.    Wright's   evidence   of   recommended
          treatment  does not differ greatly from  that
          of  Dr.  Richards.  This is true even  though
          each  medical expert may prefer  a  different
          position   for   the  immobilization   of   a
          metacarpal fracture.  What is significant is,
          that Dr. Halpenny's procedures do not conform
          to    either   experts   testimony.     Where
          Dr.  Wright differs from Dr. Richards  is  in
          his ultimate conclusion.  Dr. Wright does not
          conclude  that  Dr. Halpenny fell  below  the
          required standard of care because there is no
          available  scientific  certainty  as  to  the
          cause  of  contractures based upon a position
          of   immobilization.   There  is  nonetheless
          evidence which I accept minimizes the risk of
          contractures   based  on  the   position   of
          immobilization.  Dr. Halpenny in  failing  to
          minimize   those   risks,  fell   below   the
          reasonable  standard of  care  required.   He
          failed  to  provide the degree of  skill  and
          care  necessary which is well  documented  by
          the  medical literature which I  find  to  be
          directly related to the injuries sustained by
          the plaintiff.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    In arriving at these conclusions, I
          accept the language of Snell v. Farrell, that
          the   plaintiff  need  only  prove  that  the
          defendant  created a risk of harm,  and  that
          the  injury occurred within the area  of  the
          risk.   On  the  question of  causation,  the
          inference  is  clear from the evidence.   The
          cause  of  the plaintiff's existing complaint
          results  from the breach of the  standard  of
          care   required  in  the  treatment  of   the
          plaintiff's metacarpal fracture.  With  these
          conclusions, I find that the complications to
          the  plaintiff's injuries that  followed  are
          also   interconnected  with  the  defendant's
          failure,  in  his original treatment  to  the
          plaintiff.
          </pre>
    <pre>          </pre>
    <pre>[27]  In my view, it was entirely open to the trial judge on  the
evidence  to find that the contractures suffered by Mr.  Robinson
upon  removal of the cast and his resulting permanent  disability
following  the onset of RSD were causally linked to the  improper
immobilization  of the hand by Dr. Halpenny. This conclusion  was
not  only supported by the medical evidence accepted by the trial
judge  but was also a reasonable common sense inference from  the
totality of the evidence.  I see no reason to interfere.
[28] In view of his conclusion on causality, the trial judge did
not find it necessary to make any definitive findings on Mr.
Robinson&#146;s secondary complaint, the follow-up treatment by Dr.
Halpenny. Mr. Robinson&#146;s secondary complaint was that Dr.
Halpenny had failed to recognize the symptoms of RSD and to take
appropriate action. The trial judge stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In the situation before me, I have concluded,
	  that Dr. Halpenny fell below the standard of care
	  required of him in his casting and positioning of
	  the plaintiff's injured hand. For this reason I
	  need not determine whether RSD within the
          circumstances presented should have been diagnosed
	  and or treated by Dr. Halpenny on the 19th of
	  August 1993.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                Although  there is uncertainty  in  the
          evidence  of  whether  the  symptoms  of  RSD
          presented themselves to Dr. Halpenny,  in  my
          consideration   of  the   totality   of   the
          plaintiff&#146;s  problem, I find  that  they  all
          relate   back  to  the  defendant&#146;s   initial
          failures.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[29]  Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge  did
not  seem  to appreciate the fact that RSD, as explained  by  the
medical  experts, is a condition that probably resulted from  the
fracture  itself and not from Dr. Halpenny&#146;s fault. He  therefore
submits  that the trial judge erred in failing to deal with  this
secondary  issue and to determine the extent to which the  injury
was  caused  by  RSD  as opposed to being  caused  by  any  fault
attributed to Dr. Halpenny.
[30] I do not agree. The Supreme Court of Canada makes it clear
in Athey v. Leonati, supra, that any apportionment between
tortious and non-tortious causes is contrary to principles of
tort law because the defendant would escape full liability even
though he or she caused or contributed to the plaintiff&#146;s entire
injuries. Once the trial judge found, as he was entitled to do on
the evidence, that Dr. Halpenny&#146;s initial treatment of the
fracture was causally connected not only to the contractures
suffered upon removal of the cast but also to the aggravated
subsequent condition, it was unnecessary for him to proceed any
further. As a result of his finding on causality, Dr. Halpenny
was liable with respect to Mr. Robinson&#146;s entire injury.  Any
finding that Dr. Halpenny was, or was not, further negligent in
his treatment of Mr. Robinson&#146;s subsequent RSD and if so, to what
extent, would not have added anything to the analysis.  However,
the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that it was not necessary to deal
with the secondary complaint may have led him to mistakenly
believe that it was not necessary for him to deal with any of the
issues arising from the follow-up treatment, including the
question of contributory negligence. The question of contributory
negligence raises a different issue which brings me to the next
ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>     Contributory Negligence</pre>
    <pre>[31]  It  was Dr. Halpenny&#146;s position at trial that Mr.  Robinson
had  contributed to his injury by stopping physiotherapy  on  his
own initiative before the course of treatment had been completed.
The  trial  judge  did  not deal with the issue  of  contributory
negligence in his reasons. Counsel for the appellant submits that
this  court  ought  to find on the evidence that  Mr.  Robinson&#146;s
negligence  materially contributed to the severity of his  injury
and,  consequently,  submits that this court  should  reduce  the
overall award of damages by 50%.
[32] Counsel for Mr. Robinson takes the position that the trial
judge did not err in failing to deal with the allegation of
contributory negligence because it was never proven at trial.
Counsel submits that there was no evidence to support the
allegation.
[33] Given that the issue of contributory negligence was raised
at trial, the trial judge should have dealt with it in his
reasons. Although it was not necessary for the trial judge to
make any apportionment between the two alleged tortious acts of
Dr. Halpenny, or between this tortious cause and any non-tortious
cause such as RSD, the question of contributory fault is a
different matter.  If Mr. Robinson&#146;s own fault materially
contributed to his injury, Dr. Halpenny is entitled to an
apportionment. In light of the trial judge&#146;s failure to deal with
this issue, it is necessary for this court to consider the record
on this issue.
[34] Having considered the record, it is my view that the
evidence does not reasonably support a finding of contributory
negligence. Although some support for the appellant&#146;s contention
that Mr. Robinson stopped the physiotherapy too early can be
found in Dr. Wright&#146;s testimony, the evidence of Dr. Richards
deals more specifically with the appropriateness of the
prescribed physiotherapy and hence is more helpful in assessing
the effect, if any, of Mr. Robinson&#146;s actions. I find it
noteworthy in considering this issue that the trial judge
preferred the evidence of Dr. Richards to that of Dr. Wright
throughout. Dr. Richards&#146; evidence was that the physiotherapy
prescribed by Dr. Halpenny was inappropriate and making the
situation worse, and that any reasonable person would stop
treatment that was making the situation worse rather than better.
Mr. Robinson also testified that the physiotherapy was &#147;torture&#148;
and was not helping him. It is for that reason that he went to
see his family doctor and asked for another kind of treatment.
This is important to note because, as pointed out by the
appellant, Dr. Richards stated on cross-examination that he
thought it was inappropriate for a patient to stop physiotherapy
on his own &#147;[w]ithout providing some feedback to a health care
professional to see if there is another alternative&#148;.  Although
Mr. Robinson stopped his physiotherapy, he also provided feedback
to his family doctor and sought an alternative treatment.  In all
the circumstances, I find that the trial judge made no reversible
error in failing to deal with the issue of contributory
negligence as the claim was simply not made out.</pre>
    <pre>     Damages</pre>
    <pre>[35]  I  see  no  reason  to interfere  with  the  trial  judge&#146;s
assessment of general damages. In my view, the award  is  not  so
out  of  line  with  other  authorities  as  to  merit  appellate
intervention  as contended by counsel for the appellant.  I  also
see  no  reason to interfere with the award of damages for future
loss  of income. The award was based on the trial judge&#146;s finding
that  Mr. Robinson &#147;will sustain a permanent and continuous  loss
of some future income&#148;. In my view, this finding was supported by
the  evidence  of Mr. Robinson&#146;s permanent loss  of  capacity  to
work,  particularly  in his preferred field  of  repairing  small
engines.   There was also evidence that Mr. Robinson  would  have
had  a  reasonable prospect of taking over his father&#146;s part-time
business in that field upon his father&#146;s retirement.
[36] However, I am of the view that there was no basis for
awarding damages for past loss of income. After reviewing the
relevant evidence, the trial judge himself stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>	For these reasons, I do not conclude or am I 
	impressed that there was any appreciable loss 
	of past earnings.</pre>
    <pre>[37]  Nonetheless, he &#147;assume[d]&#148; a past loss of income of $5,000
per  year  from  August 1993, the time from  which  Mr.  Robinson
&#147;possibly  would have been in a position to begin re-employment&#148;.
There was no proper basis for making this award. Mr. Robinson was
not  working at the time of the accident and had not  worked  for
some  time.  This  was  largely due to  the  prevailing  economic
conditions  in  the  area in which he lived,  a  situation  which
essentially  continued  until  shortly  before  the   trial,   as
evidenced  by  a report relied upon by the trial  judge  on  this
issue.</pre>
    <pre>     Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[38] I would therefore allow the appeal only with respect to  the
award  for  past  loss  of  income and  reduce  the  total  award
accordingly. Counsel for the appellant advised the court that the
disposition of costs in the judgment reflects an offer to  settle
and  the effect of Rule 49.10(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.
If the reduction in the quantum of damages on this appeal affects
this  disposition,  the  appellant may  serve  and  file  written
submissions within fifteen days of this judgment on the issue  of
costs  at  trial and the respondent may respond within  ten  days
thereafter.  Otherwise, the costs award at trial will stand.
[39] In view of the fact that the appellant&#146;s success on the
appeal was limited, I would award him 20% of his costs of the
appeal.
