CHARRON J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]    The   appellant  was  convicted  of  sexual   assault   on
November 26, 1996 after a trial before Poupore J. and a jury, and
he  was  subsequently sentenced to four years&#146; imprisonment.  His
appeal  against conviction is scheduled to be heard  before  this
court on May 18, 2000.
[2]  The appellant raises the ineffective assistance of his trial
counsel as one of the grounds of his appeal. In particular, he
submits that trial counsel failed to adduce credible and relevant
exculpatory evidence of another suspect, Mr. Richard Cote. In
support of this ground of appeal, the appellant intends to bring
an application for the introduction of fresh evidence at the
hearing of his appeal. In order to assist in the gathering of the
proposed fresh evidence, he brings three applications to the
court. In the first application, the appellant seeks an order
compelling Mr. Cote to attend for examination; in the second, he
seeks an order for the production of the medical records of one
Dr. Tissot-Van Patot relating to Mr. Cote; and in the third, he
seeks an order compelling one Dr. Anthony McFarthing to attend
for examination and an order for production of Dr. McFarthing&#146;s
file relating to Mr. Cote for the time period surrounding the
assault.
[3]   In  the event that the appellant&#146;s application to introduce
fresh evidence on his appeal is successful, the Crown intends  to
bring  an  application  to  introduce fresh  evidence  in  reply.
Accordingly  the  Crown  also brings an application  before  this
court to assist in the gathering of this proposed reply evidence.
The  Crown seeks the production of certain psychological  records
and  to  examine  the doctors who created them.  A  psychological
assessment of the appellant was completed by Dr. Paul Valliant on
January 31, 1994 while the appellant was under a probation  order
for  a  prior  sexual  offence. A subsequent  progress  note  was
completed  by  Dr.  Valliant  on  August  15,  1995.   Both   the
assessment  and  the progress note are referred to  in  the  Pre-
Sentence  Report in this matter.  The Crown seeks  production  of
both  the  assessment and the progress note and seeks to  examine
Dr.   Valliant.   A  further  psychological  assessment  of   the
appellant  was completed by Dr. Bruce Malcolm on July  10,  1997,
while  the  appellant  was incarcerated  for  the  offence  under
appeal.  This is known as a &#147;risk assessment&#148; because it assesses
the  needs  of  and risks posed by offenders under  the  care  of
Corrections Canada.  The Crown seeks production of the assessment
and seeks to examine Dr. Malcolm.
[4]  In order to put these various motions in context, it is
helpful to briefly outline the facts of the offence and the
background facts concerning the particular motions.
[5]  The offence for which the appellant was convicted occurred
on August 14, 1995. On that day, the 15 year old complainant was
assaulted while she walked to a variety store near her home.  She
was grabbed from behind as she walked down the road, was dragged
backwards off the road, down onto some train tracks, along the
tracks to an embankment under a train trestle, and was sexually
assaulted.  After the assault was over, she managed to make it to
the variety store, where she reported the assault.
[6]  In his factum the appellant describes the circumstances
involving Richard Cote as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
          Richard  Cote, &#133;who  lived  in  the  area,  was
	  among the other potential suspects investigated
	  by the police.  Cote  originally  came  to  the
	  police&#146;s attention through a doctor at  Sudbury
          Hospital,  Dr. Tissot.  Tissot contacted police
	  after reading a  description of  the suspect in
	  the newspaper. Dr. Tissot had recently  treated
	  an  individual who resembled the description of
          the  suspect.   The  individual   had  attended
	  Sudbury  General  Hospital  on July 12, 1995 to
	  seek  medical  treatment  to control his sexual
	  urges.  This individual  told Dr. Tissot he had
	  just attempted  to  sexually  assault a female,
  	  but the  female  got away.   He  also told  Dr.
	  Tissot  that  he liked  teenaged girls, and had
          sexually  assaulted  teenaged  girls  and   had
	  approached  a  lot  of  teenaged  girls  in the
	  Donovan area.  This individual  also  mentioned
	  something  to Dr. Tissot  about a train trestle
	  in the Donovan area.

          Dr. Tissot   again    saw  this  individual on
          August   12,   1995,   two  days  before   the
          complainant  was assaulted.    The  individual
          advised  Dr.  Tissot that he   needed  another
          shot  because  he felt like  he was  going  to
          sexually   assault    someone.    Dr.   Tissot
          described  the  patient  as a white  male,  39
          years  old, approximately  6 feet tall, medium
          build,  with dark short hair,  a beard  and  a
          moustache.   The individual  was also  wearing
          thick glasses.</pre>
    <pre>[7]   On  December 3, 1999, the appellant obtained an order  from
this   court   compelling  the  attendance  of  Dr.  Tissot   for
examination.  No  order was sought or made with  respect  to  any
records  that may be in the possession of Dr. Tissot. On December
22,  1999, Dr. Tissot was examined and, although he refreshed his
memory  using medical records, counsel for the doctor raised  the
fact  that  the  order  did  not  specifically  provide  for  the
production  of  the  medical records and Dr.  Tissot  refused  to
produce them.  It is for this reason that the appellant now seeks
production of those records in order to, as counsel put it in his
materials,   &#147;correct  an  earlier  oversight&#148;  in  not   seeking
production  of  the  records.  Mr.  Cote  was  served  with  this
application  together  with the application  to  compel  his  own
attendance.
[8]  Dr. McFarthing is a staff psychiatrist at Sudbury General
Hospital.  Mr. Cote came into his care in July 1995 and was in
his care at the time of the offence (August 1995).  Mr. Cote
apparently reported having aberrant sexual urges, and Dr.
McFarthing gave Mr. Cote injections of Androcur-Depot, a drug
designed to stop those urges.  Although Dr. McFarthing has
continued to treat Mr. Cote, the appellant only seeks production
of the doctor&#146;s file relating to Mr. Cote from July through
September, 1995.
[9]  On March 7th, this court made an order appointing counsel to
represent Mr. Cote.</pre>
    <pre>Motion to compel attendance of Mr. Cote</pre>
    <pre>[10]  In  response to the appellant&#146;s motion, Mr. Cote  filed  an
affidavit  dated March 14, 2000 wherein he asserts  that  he  was
not, and could not have been, involved in the assault.
[11] There is no question that the general rule is that Mr. Cote
would have been compellable as a witness at Mr. Rodgers&#146; trial if
he had relevant evidence and that, in exchange, he would receive
evidentiary immunity for any self-incriminating statements: R. v.
S. (R.J.) (1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.); British Columbia
Securities Commission v. Branch (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 505
(S.C.C.).  It is common ground between the parties that the
appellant has established the threshold test of relevance with
respect to this witness.
[12] Mr. Cote&#146;s counsel argued before this court, however, that
Mr. Cote came under an exception to the general rule of
compellability because the predominant purpose in compelling this
testimony was to incriminate Mr. Cote. In support of this
proposition, counsel relies on the decisions in R. v. Primeau
(1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) and R. v. Jobin (1995), 97
C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.). The exception discussed in these cases
does not apply to Mr. Cote.  In both these cases, the Crown
sought to compel the witness to testify against an accused person
and the question was whether the predominant purpose was to
incriminate the witness, in which case the witness could claim an
exception to the general rule of compellability. In this case, it
is the defence who seeks to compel Mr. Cote and the predominant
purpose in seeking his testimony is not to incriminate him but
rather to provide exculpatory evidence for Mr. Rodgers.
[13] In these circumstances, I see no reason why the general
principle of compellability should not apply and would grant the
order sought.</pre>
    <pre>Motion to produce notes of Dr. Tissot-Van Patot</pre>
    <pre>[14] While working in the emergency department of Sudbury General
Hospital  on  July  7, 1995, Dr. Tissot saw  Mr.  Cote,  who,  as
indicated  earlier,  informed Dr. Tissot  that  he  was  sexually
attracted to teenage girls and had attempted to assault  a  young
girl.   Dr. Tissot admitted Mr. Cote to the psychiatric  ward  of
the  hospital.  Mr. Cote returned to the emergency ward  and  saw
Dr.  Tissot  again  on  August 12, 1995, at  which  time  he  was
injected with a drug which had been prescribed to him in order to
reduce his sexual urges.  As stated above, Dr. Tissot has already
been  examined,  but the appellant now seeks  production  of  any
medical records he may have relating to these two visits.
[15] At the hearing of this application, this court raised with
counsel the question of the applicability of ss.278.1 to s.278.91
of the Criminal Code with respect to the production of Dr.
Tissot&#146;s records. It is clear that these provisions apply to
medical records relating to a witness in a sexual assault
proceeding, and hence to a person in Mr. Cote&#146;s position. Counsel
for the appellant and for the Crown confirmed that this issue had
not been raised at the time that the order compelling Dr. Tissot
was obtained. Given that Dr. Tissot has already been examined,
counsel for Mr. Cote indicated at the hearing that his client was
not objecting to the production of these notes.  Based on this
consent, I would grant an order compelling Dr. Tissot to produce
the records in question.</pre>
    <pre>Motion  to compel attendance of Dr. McFarthing and for production
of his records</pre>
    <pre>[16]  As stated above, Dr. McFarthing was Mr. Cote&#146;s psychiatrist
at  the  time  of  the  assault.  The appellant  seeks  an  order
requiring the attendance of Dr. McFarthing to be examined and  an
order compelling him to produce his file in relation to Mr.  Cote
for the period of July through September of 1995.
[17] Counsel for the appellant conceded that medical records
relating to Mr. Cote fall within the scope of the statutory
regime for the production of records set out in ss. 278.1 to
278.91 of the Code. He argues however that the order sought on
this application falls outside this regime because it is sought
under s.683(1) of the Code, which confers certain powers on a
court of appeal or a judge of that court.
[18] I do not agree. The order sought on this application is made
in the context of a proposed application to introduce fresh
evidence. The admissibility of the proposed fresh evidence must
always be considered on such an application. No order could be
made at trial for the production of Mr. Cote&#146;s records without
compliance with the relevant statutory provisions. The law can be
no different on an application to introduce fresh evidence.  A
proper application must be made to this court, albeit under
s.683(1), but in conformity with the requirements of ss.278.1 to
278.91. These provisions cannot be circumvented by compelling the
attendance of the holder of the records: see s.278.4(2).
[19] Since this application was not brought within the relevant
statutory framework, it is my view that it cannot be determined
on the basis of the material before this court. I would therefore
dismiss the application without prejudice to the appellant&#146;s
right to bring a fresh application if so advised.</pre>
    <pre>Motion by the Crown</pre>
    <pre>[20]  The  Crown  seeks production of a psychological  assessment
prepared  by Dr. Valliant as well as a risk assessment  that  was
conducted by Dr. Malcolm during the appellant&#146;s incarceration for
the  offence in this case.  The Crown also seeks to examine these
two  psychologists.   In  support,  the  Crown  has  offered   an
affidavit  which  includes  the  Pre-Sentence  Report   and   its
references  to  Dr.  Valliant&#146;s assessment, as  well  as  general
statements  about the existence of and purpose  behind  the  risk
assessment prepared by Dr. Malcolm.
[21]  Once the accused introduces evidence relating to the
propensity of a third party, usually to establish that third
party as an alternate suspect, the Crown may in reply offer
propensity evidence relating to the accused. Otherwise, the trier
of fact would be left with a distorted view of the facts:  R. v.
McMillan [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824; R. v. Parsons (1993), 84 C.C.C.
(3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.).
[22] In this case, it is clear that the appellant seeks to
introduce evidence about Mr. Cote&#146;s propensity in relation to his
sexual urges toward teenage girls for the purpose of presenting
him as an alternate suspect and thereby to exculpate the
appellant.  If this evidence is admitted on the appeal, it will
be open to the Crown to bring its application to introduce reply
evidence. The reply evidence must, however, be relevant.
[23] In so far as the application relates to Dr. Valliant, it is
my view that the Crown has presented a sufficient evidentiary
basis to establish relevance. I would therefore grant an order
compelling Dr. Valliant to attend for examination and for the
production of his assessment report and progress notes.  There
has, however, been no showing of threshold relevance as to the
risk assessment. The general statements about the purpose of such
an assessment without further elaboration or details do not meet
the test. I would therefore dismiss the application as it relates
to Dr. Malcolm.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[24]  In  summary, I would grant the application  to  compel  the
attendance  of  Mr. Cote; I would grant the application  for  the
production of the medical records of Dr. Tissot relating  to  Mr.
Cote; and I would order production of the assessment and progress
note  completed  by  Dr. Valliant and order  his  attendance  for
examination.  I  would dismiss the application  relating  to  Dr.
McFarthing. I would also dismiss the application by the Crown  as
it relates to Dr. Malcolm.
