    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Nordheimer J. dated July 5, 1999

BY THE COURT:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, Rogers Cablesystems Limited (&#147;Rogers&#148;),
commenced an action against the respondents Look Communications
Inc. and Look T.V. Ontario Inc. (collectively, &#147;Look&#148;) and 690981
Ontario Limited and Creccal Investments Limited (collectively,
the &#147;landlord&#148;) for a number of injunctive remedies intended to
prevent Look from delivering cable television services to the
landlord&#146;s apartment buildings and its tenants living in the
buildings.  As well, Rogers claimed damages of $1,000,000 from
Look and the landlord for the tort of intentional interference
with economic relations.
[2]  The action evolved from a dispute between Rogers and Look as
to whether one, or the other, or both have the right to supply
cable television services to the landlord&#146;s apartment buildings.
The dispute was precipitated by the landlord terminating its
contract with Rogers which permitted Rogers to supply television
services to the buildings and its tenants, and entering into an
exclusive arrangement with Look to provide such services.  As a
result, the exclusive right to supply cable television services
which Rogers and its predecessors had for about 24 years came to
an end.
[3]  In an effort to come to a speedy resolution of the action,
C. Campbell J. directed a trial of the following issue:</pre>
    <pre>          Whether  690981 Ontario Limited  by  its
          agent    Creccal   Investments   Limited
          (collectively,   the   &#147;landlord&#148;)   can
          terminate    the   right    of    Rogers
          Cablesystems   Limited   (&#147;Rogers&#148;)   to
          supply cable television services to  the
          Buildings  and the tenants therein  and,
          if   not,   whether  the  landlord   has
          wrongfully interfered with the  economic
          interests of Rogers.</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The issue was tried by Nordheimer J. who concluded the
landlord could terminate the right of Rogers to supply cable
television services to the buildings and the tenants therein,
and, as a consequence, the landlord had not wrongfully interfered
with the economic interests of Rogers in so doing.  In the course
of the trial of the issue, the trial judge found that the
landlord and Look, by entering into the exclusive arrangement to
which we have referred, had not intentionally interfered with
Rogers&#146; economic relations with those tenants who had existing
contracts with it for the supply of cable television services.
[5]  Rogers has appealed from the findings of Nordheimer J. in
respect to two of the elements of the tort of unlawful
interference with economic relations approved by this court in
Lineal Group Inc. v. Atlantis Canadian Distributing Inc. (1998),
42 O.R. (3d) 157, which he considered in reaching the conclusion
that the respondents had not intentionally interfered with
Rogers&#146; economic relations.  It is Rogers&#146; position that the
trial judge erred in his interpretation and application of the
element of the tort whereby the plaintiff must prove an intention
to injure it, and that he erred in concluding that Rogers had
failed to prove the element of the tort which requires that the
interference be by way of unlawful means.
[6]  It was Rogers&#146; position before both the trial judge and this
court that in entering into the exclusive arrangement with the
landlord, Look had breached s. 9 of the Broadcasting Distribution
Regulations which states: &#147;No licensee shall give an undue
preference to any person, including itself, or subject any person
to an undue disadvantage.&#148;  Look is a &#147;licensee&#148; within the
meaning of s. 9.  Indeed, on March 25, 1999, shortly after it
commenced its action, Rogers filed a complaint against Look with
the Canadian Radio-Television Telecommunications Commission
(&#147;CRTC&#148;) alleging that Look was in breach of s. 9.  We were
advised by counsel that the CRTC has not as yet adjudicated the
complaint.  Notwithstanding the pending complaint before the
CRTC, the trial judge felt that he could deal with this issue.
He resolved it in favour of Look, and concluded that it was not
in breach of s. 9 in entering into the exclusive arrangement with
the landlord, and, therefore, had not engaged in unlawful means.
[7]  In our view, the issue before Nordheimer J. was clear and
straightforward.  If he found that the landlord was justified in
terminating Rogers&#146; right to supply cable television services to
the apartment buildings and the tenants who lived in them, it was
unnecessary for him to determine whether the landlord had
wrongfully interfered with Rogers&#146; economic interests.  Indeed,
the operative paragraph of the formal order in respect to which
the trial of the issue was conducted reflects Nordheimer J.&#146;s
resolution of that issue. This paragraph states:</pre>
    <pre>          2.   THIS COURT FURTHER ORDERS AND ADJUDGES
	       that the defendants 690981 Ontario Limited
	       and Creccal Investments can terminate the
               right of Rogers Cablesystems Limited to
	       supply television services to the Buildings
	       and the tenants therein, and have not
               wrongfully interfered with the economic
	       interests of Rogers Cablesystems Limited.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  On the basis of this analysis, there was no need for
Nordheimer J. to embark upon the determination of the broader
issue, whether Look and the landlord had committed the tort of
intentionally interference with Rogers&#146; economic interests.
Indeed, in resolving this question the trial judge went beyond
the narrow issue he was required to try and decided the
appellant&#146;s claim against the respondents that they had
intentionally interfered with the appellant&#146;s economic interests.
It was the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that Rogers had failed to
prove that the respondents had committed this tort which gave
rise to the appeal.
[9]  However, this is not intended as a criticism of the trial
judge.  We believe that he was led into considering the tort
issue and the Broadcasting Distribution Regulations issue by the
manner in which the issue he was directed to try was presented to
him.  The issue to be tried contained a contractual component and
a tort component.  On the basis of his conclusion on the
contractual component, it was unnecessary for the trial judge to
consider the tort component.
[10] Therefore, it is our view that the only findings which this
court should review are those which arise from the issue which
Nordheimer J. was required to try.  Those findings are contained
in paragraph 2 of the formal order set out above.
[11] In our view, the trial judge was correct in his conclusion
that the landlord could terminate Rogers&#146; right to supply cable
television services to the landlord&#146;s apartment buildings and its
tenants.  We agree with the submission of Mr. Richler, on behalf
of the landlord, that because the relationship between the
landlord and Rogers was governed by a contract which permitted
the landlord to terminate Rogers&#146; right to deliver cable
television services to the landlord&#146;s buildings and its tenants,
in terminating Rogers&#146; right under the contract the landlord was
exercising a right which it enjoyed under the contract.  Indeed,
Rogers has not suggested that in terminating the contract, the
landlord was in breach of the contract.  Consequently, the
landlord&#146;s lawful exercise of its contractual right to terminate
the privileges which were given by the contract to Rogers could
not serve as a foundation for Rogers&#146; tort claim against the
landlord and Look.
[12] Having reached this conclusion in respect to the first
component of the issue to be tried, it followed that there was no
need for the trial judge to make any findings arising from the
second component of the issue, the tort claim asserted by Rogers.
It follows that it is unnecessary for this court to consider that
issue.
[13] As we are satisfied that Nordheimer J. made no error in
respect to the issue that he was directed to try, there is no
need for us to determine whether he erred in his interpretation
and application of the elements of the tort of intentional
interference with economic interests.
[14] Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
