    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Madam Justice Swinton dated</pre>
    <pre>November 10, 1998

</pre>
    <pre>LABROSSE J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  appellant Shirley Rothgiesser appeals the judgment  of
Swinton  J.  dated  November  10,  1998,  which  terminated   the
obligation of Claude Henry Rothgiesser to pay spousal support and
medical  benefits  to  the appellant.  Notwithstanding  that  the
parties are divorced, for ease of reference, I will refer to  the
appellant as &#147;the wife&#148; and to the respondent as &#147;the husband&#148;.
</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  parties were married, separated and divorced in  South
Africa.   As  part  of  the  divorce judgment,  they  executed  a
&quot;Consent  Paper&quot; which provided inter alia for custody and  child
and  spousal  support, including medical benefits.  Subsequently,
the  husband settled in Ontario.  On the consent of the  parties,
an  order  was obtained from the Ontario Court (General Division)
(&#147;the  Ontario  court&#148;) which dealt with custody  and  child  and
spousal  support.   Some  years later,  the  husband  brought  an
application for a variation of the order to provide that  he  had
no  further support obligation. The application was granted.  The
wife  appeals  on  the  grounds that the  Ontario  court  had  no
jurisdiction  to  terminate  the  spousal  support  or   in   the
alternative,   that  there  was  no  merit   to   the   husband&#146;s
application.
</pre>
    <pre>The Facts</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The parties were married in 1967 in Cape Town, South Africa.
They  had three children: Stephen, born October 10, 1968; Stuart,
born October 10, 1970; and David, born January 31, 1980.
[4]  The parties separated in 1985 and were divorced pursuant to
a Final Order of Divorce of the Supreme Court of South Africa on
August 5, 1985.  The Final Order of Divorce incorporated, as an
order of the court, a &#147;Consent Paper&#148; dated July 16, 1985 which
set out the terms of the settlement of the issues arising from
the breakdown of the marriage, including custody and access (the
wife had custody of the three children), and child and spousal
support.  The Consent Paper contained the following provisions
for spousal support:

               2.1  Subject to what is set forth hereunder,
	  Defendant shall pay maintenance for Plaintiff
	  personally at the rate of the rand equivalent of
	  $U.S. 1000 per month until her death or remarriage,
          whichever event shall first occur.  This sum shall
	  be paid by Defendant to Plaintiff simultaneously
	  with the maintenance in respect of the minor 
	  children and in the manner set out in the second 
	  paragraph of sub-clause 1.1 above.
               . . .
                2.3  In addition to his obligations  as
          set forth in sub-clause 2.1 above, but at all
          times  subject  to the contingencies  therein
          contained and to the contingency contained in
          sub-clause 2.2, Defendant undertakes to  bear
          the   medical  aid  premium  for  Plaintiff's
          membership of either the Blue Shield or  Blue
          Cross in the United States of America or  the
          National  Medical  Plan in  the  Republic  of
          South   Africa   provided  that   Defendant's
          liability in terms of this sub-clause will be
          limited  only to the normal rates  levied  by
          such  organizations from  time  to  time  (as
          opposed  to a loaded premium for some  reason
          or other).
               . . .
                3.2  The maintenance payable in respect
          of  the  Plaintiff shall be adjusted annually
          on  the  first day of July of each and  every
          year  commencing with effect  from  1st  July
          1986, by the percentage increase/decrease  in
          the   Consumer  Price  Index  for  all  urban
          consumers in the area in which Plaintiff will
          then be residing as published by the relevant
          governmental authority.
                3.3   Plaintiff hereby waives  for  all
          time  her  right, both under Common  Law  and
          Statute  and in any Court of any jurisdiction
          throughout  the  world,  to  apply   for   an
          increase  in  her  personal  maintenance,  it
          being  specifically agreed upon  between  the
          parties  that  the increases  in  Plaintiff's
          maintenance   shall  be  limited   to   those
          increases  as  set  forth in  sub-clause  3.2
          above.  Defendant hereby similarly waives for
          all time his right, both under Common Law and
          Statute  and in any Court of any jurisdiction
          throughout the world, to apply for a decrease
          in  Plaintiff's  personal  maintenance.   The
          intention  of the parties is that, except  as
          specifically   hereinabove   provided,    the
          maintenance  in respect of the  Plaintiff  is
          non-modifiable   and  Plaintiff   with   full
          knowledge  of  all the relevant circumstances
          accepts  that  her  personal  maintenance  is
          reasonable and will not be capable  of  being
          modified other than as herein provided.</pre>
    <pre>When referring to both the Final Order of divorce and the Consent
Paper, I will refer to them as the &#147;South African divorce
judgment&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Shortly after the divorce, in August 1985, both the husband
and  the wife relocated separately to San Diego, California.   In
1987, the husband moved to Toronto.
[6]  On April 11, 1988, upon the motion of the husband, the
Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego &#147;awarded
the joint legal and joint physical custody&#148; of Stuart and David,
who were residing in California with the wife, to the parties.
The order, dated May 16, 1988, provided that all other custodial
provisions of the South African divorce judgment remained in full
force and effect.  In the same proceedings, the wife brought a
motion to increase child and spousal support.  By order dated
October 21, 1988, the court found that the current level of child
support was reasonable, and held that the spousal support as
ordered by the South African divorce judgment &#147;is non modifiable
either by Petitioner or Respondent &#133; in any jurisdiction
throughout the world&#148;.  Accordingly, the wife's motion was
dismissed in its entirety.
[7]  In September 1990, the youngest child David moved to Toronto
to live with the husband.  The husband brought an application for
his custody pursuant to the Children&#146;s Law Reform Act, R.S.O.
1980, c. 68 as amended.  The application was resolved on consent
by the order of Lang J. dated September 27, 1990 which provided,
inter alia, that David shall primarily reside with the husband
with specific access provisions for the wife.  In addition to
matters relating to custody, access and child support, the order
provided in para. 4 states:

          THIS COURT ORDERS that spousal support shall be
	  paid to the respondent by the applicant in  the
	  sum  of  $1,600.00  United States  Dollars  per 
	  month, commencing  September 1, 1990,  and  due
	  and  payable  on  the  first  day of each month
	  thereafter.   Support  shall  continue  at this
	  amount  until  whichever of the following shall
          first occur:

              (a) June 30, 1995;
              (b) Respondent ceases to actively continue
	          her education leading towards obtaining
	          residency in the United States of
                  America.
              (c) Respondent becomes employed on a full-
	          time basis.

          Upon   the   occurrence   of   any   of   the
          events    described   above,    the    amount
          of   spousal   support   shall   be   reduced
          to    the    sum    of    $1,200.00    United
          States     Dollars    per     month,     said
          amount   to   be  deemed  the   base   figure
          upon     which    any    future     increase/
          decrease   in   spousal   support   are    to
          be    made   pursuant   to   paragraph    3.2
          of   the   South   African   Divorce   Decree
          on    file   and   recognized   herein,    to
          be    payable    until   death,   remarriage,
          or    cohabitation    with    an    unrelated
          male      person     as     described      in
          paragraph   2.2   of   the   South    African
          Divorce Decree.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The husband complied with the terms of the order until 1994.
[9]  In July 1994, the husband reduced the monthly spousal
support to $1,200.00 US.  In his affidavit in support of his
motion which is the subject-matter of this appeal, he alleged
that he learned that the wife had been employed full time and
that medical coverage had been available to her through her
employment.  He stated that he offset his overpayments against
his ongoing support payments and that subject to this adjustment,
he continued paying $1,200.00 per month.
[10] In 1995, David returned to live with the wife in California
and the husband reinstated his child support payments.  At the
request of the wife, the husband increased child support payments
for David by $200.00 U.S. per month.  In July 1997, the wife and
David returned to live in South Africa.  In November 1997, the
husband was informed that  David was employed and he terminated
the child support payments.
[11] By Notice of Application dated June 22, 1998, brought under
the Divorce Act, R.S.C. 1995, c. 3 (2nd Supp.), the husband
applied to the Ontario court for an order varying the &quot;Order of
Madam Justice Lang, dated September 27, 1990 &#133; and the Consent
Paper, dated July 16, 1985&quot;, by providing that he no longer had
an obligation to pay spousal support to the wife.   He was also
seeking an order that he was no longer required to pay the wife&#146;s
medical aid premiums pursuant to the Consent Paper.  The wife
filed an affidavit in response to the application.  She took the
position that no court was entitled to relieve the husband of his
obligation to pay spousal support as provided in the South
African divorce judgment.  She also deposed that she was not
possessed of the requisite funds to retain counsel to represent
her, had not yet been able to obtain Legal Aid and intended to
file a further affidavit in support of arrears of support based
on the cost of living.
[12] On November 10, 1998, Swinton J. granted the husband&#146;s
application.  In a brief endorsement, she noted that, although
duly notified, the wife had not appeared on the hearing of the
application.  She wrote:

   I have jurisdiction to deal with this variation application,
   given that the parties attorned to the jurisdiction of the court
   in 1990, section 5(1)(b) Divorce Act and it would be undue
   hardship for the applicant to deal with this matter in South
   Africa.</pre>
    <pre>[13]  As  to the merits of the application, Swinton J. held  that
although the husband in his application did not seek relief  with
respect  to  child support, there had been a material  change  of
circumstances which justified a termination of the child  support
order for David who was no longer a dependent child.
[14] Swinton J. further held that there had also been a material
change of circumstances with respect to his spousal support
obligation.  She ordered that the order of Lang J. and the order
of Tebbutt J. of the Supreme Court of South Africa, dated August
5, 1985 (the South African divorce judgment) be varied to provide
that the husband had no further obligation to pay spousal support
and medical aid premiums to the wife.
[15] It is argued on behalf of the wife that Swinton J. erred in
granting the husband&#146;s application for a variation of Lang J.&#146;s
order and the South African divorce judgment because the Ontario
court did not have jurisdiction over this matter.   It is also
argued that, in any event, on its merits the application ought to
have been dismissed.
</pre>
    <pre>The Relevant Legislation</pre>
    <pre>[16] The relevant sections of the Divorce Act for the purposes of
this appeal are as follows:

          2. (1)  In this Act,
               . . .
          &quot;corollary  relief  proceeding&quot;     means   a
          proceeding in a court in which either or both
          former  spouses  seek a support  order  or  a
          custody order or both such orders;

          &quot;support order&quot;  means  an order  made  under 
	  subsection 15(2);

          &quot;variation order&quot;   means   an    order  made
          under subsection 17(1);

          &quot;variation      proceeding&quot;      means      a
          proceeding in a court in which either or both
          former spouses seek a variation order.

          3.  (1)   A   court   in   a   province   has
          jurisdiction to hear and determine a  divorce
          proceeding   if   either  spouse   has   been
          ordinarily  resident in the province  for  at
          least  one  year  immediately  preceding  the
          commencement of the proceeding.

          4.    A  court   has  jurisdiction  to   hear
          and  determine a corollary relief  proceeding
          if  the court has granted a divorce to either
          or both former spouses.

          5.  (1)   A   court  in   a   province    has
          jurisdiction   to   hear  and   determine   a
          variation proceeding if

          (a)  either former   spouse   is   ordinarily
          resident  in the province at the commencement
          of the proceeding; or

          (b)   both  former spouses  accept  the
          jurisdiction of the court.

               . . .

          15. (1)  In this  section  and  section   16,
          &quot;spouse&quot;   has   the  meaning   assigned  by
          subsection 2(1) and includes a former spouse.

          (2)   A court   of   competent   jurisdiction
          may,   on  application  by  either  or   both
          spouses,  make an order requiring one  spouse
          to  secure or pay, or to secure and pay, such
          lump  sum or periodic sums, or such lump  sum
          and   periodic  sums,  as  the  court  thinks
          reasonable for the support of

          (a)  the other spouse;

               . . .

          17.   (1)    A      court    of     competent
          jurisdiction  may  make  an  order   varying,
          rescinding  or  suspending, prospectively  or
          retroactively,

          (a)  a support order or &#133;.
</pre>
    <pre>Jurisdiction</pre>
    <pre>[17] The issue of jurisdiction raises the following questions:

1.   Did Lang J. have jurisdiction to make a spousal support
     order  where the parties had been divorced in a foreign
     jurisdiction?
2.   Could jurisdiction to determine spousal support be
     conferred on the Ontario court by the consent of the parties?
3.   Did the Ontario court have jurisdiction to vary spousal
     support obligations pursuant to the Lang order or a foreign
     divorce judgment under s. 5 of the Divorce Act?
</pre>
    <pre>Brief Answer</pre>
    <pre>[18]  On the first question, it is my view that on September  27,
1990, Lang J. did not have jurisdiction to make a spousal support
order  (&#147;the Lang order&#148;) because the jurisdictional requirements
of  s. 4 of the Divorce Act (also referred to as &#147;the Act&#148;)  were
not  met.  Section 4 provided that only the court that granted  a
divorce  to  either  or both former spouses had  jurisdiction  to
subsequently  determine  a corollary proceeding  i.e.  a  spousal
support order.  As the Ontario court had not granted a divorce to
one  or  both of the parties, the Ontario court could  not  order
support  under the Act and, in so far as it provided for  spousal
support, the order was made without jurisdiction.
[19] This conclusion is unaltered by the husband&#146;s argument that
the parties can confer jurisdiction on a court through consent
(Question 2).  The common law unanimously supports the general
proposition that parties cannot empower a court with the
authority to make a determination where it otherwise has no
authority to do so or its authority is limited by statute.
Section 4 limited a court&#146;s jurisdiction to entertain a
proceeding relating to corollary relief to the specific court
that has granted the divorce.  This limitation cannot be altered
on consent of the parties.
[20] With regard to the third question, on November 10, 1998,
Swinton J. had no jurisdiction to vary the Lang order or the
South African divorce judgment.  As the Lang order was a nullity,
it could not be the subject of a variation proceeding.  Under the
Act, a Canadian court can only vary a spousal support order made
pursuant to a Canadian divorce: there is no jurisdiction on a
Canadian court to vary a foreign support order.  Jurisdiction to
vary a foreign spousal support order may only be derived from
provincial legislation respecting enforcement of support orders
(in Ontario this is the Reciprocal Enforcement of Support Orders
Act R.S.O. 1990, c. R-7 (&quot;the RESOA&quot;)) which does not come into
play in the present case.  Swinton J. lacked jurisdiction to deal
with the husband&#146;s application to vary the Lang order and the
South African divorce judgment.
</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[21] In light of the foreign elements and the effects thereof  on
the  issue of jurisdiction, it is convenient to review  the  bare
facts of the case.
[22] The wife and the husband were married in South Africa and
divorced pursuant to a judgment of the Supreme Court of South
Africa, on August 5, 1985, which incorporated as part of the
divorce judgment a Consent Paper which settled, inter alia,
custody and support issues.
[23] In 1990, the husband, who had moved to and established
residency in Ontario, brought an application under the Children
Law Reform Act seeking custody of the youngest child, David. His
application did not seek relief from his support obligations.  On
September 27, 1990, the Lang order granted the husband custody of
David and conditionally increased his support obligation to the
wife, who at the time was residing in California.  Both parties
consented to the increase of support, notwithstanding that the
South African divorce judgment specifically provided that the
spousal support provision was non-variable.  In 1998, the husband
applied to vary the Lang order, seeking to terminate his spousal
support obligations.  On November 10, 1998 Swinton J. made an
order (&quot;the Swinton order&quot;) varying both the Lang order and the
South Africa divorce judgment, terminating the husband&#146;s child
and spousal support obligations.
[24] Although the wife seeks to set aside the Swinton order, it
is only that part dealing with spousal support that is in issue
in this appeal.
</pre>
    <pre>     Question 1.   Did Lang J. have jurisdiction to order spousal
                   support?</pre>
    <pre>[25]  Before turning to Lang J.'s jurisdiction to make the order,
it  should be noted that as this is an appeal from the  order  of
Swinton  J.,  the attack on the order of Lang J. is a  collateral
attack.   Generally speaking, collateral attacks on court  orders
are  prohibited.   They  are,  however,  permitted  where  it  is
alleged,  as  it  is  here,  that  the  order  was  made  without
jurisdiction:  R. v. Wilson, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594 at  599;  R.  v.
Litchfield  (1993),  86  C.C.C. (3d) 97  at  109  (S.C.C.).   The
husband does not suggest that the wife cannot challenge Lang J.'s
jurisdiction on this appeal.
[26] It must be remembered that the application before Lang J.
had been brought under the Children Law Reform Act.  Lang J. had
jurisdiction thereunder to deal with custody of David.  However,
there is no jurisdiction in that statute to deal with spousal
support.  Moreover, the two provincial statutes empowered to deal
with spousal support cannot be relied on in the circumstances of
this case.  The application did not purport to be, nor could it
have been, brought pursuant to the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. F-2 as the parties were not spouses as required thereunder.
Nor could the application be said to have been brought pursuant
to the RESOA, as that procedure had not been invoked.  That
leaves only the federally-enacted Divorce Act as the potential
basis of jurisdiction for the spousal support order.  In fact,
counsel for the husband conceded on appeal that the Lang order
could only have been made as a corollary relief order under the
Act.
[27] Under the Divorce Act, there are only two ways to deal with
spousal support: a) as a corollary relief proceeding (s. 4) and
b) as a variation proceeding (s. 5).  The proceeding before
Lang J. could not be a variation proceeding of the South African
divorce judgment for reasons that will become evident later under
Question 3.
[28] On the basis of s. 4 and s. 15, the Act provides a court
with jurisdiction to order spousal support as corollary relief.
Section 15(2), which comes under the heading &#147;Corollary Relief&#148;,
provides that a court of competent jurisdiction may make an order
of spousal support. The resultant order, referred to and defined
as a &#145;support order&#146;, is identified in s. 2(1) as made pursuant
to a &#145;corollary relief proceeding&#146;.  The relevant provision
granting a court jurisdiction in corollary relief proceedings is
s. 4, which for ease of reference, is once again reproduced:

          4.  A court has jurisdiction to hear and determine a
          corollary relief proceeding if the court has granted
	  a divorce to either or both former spouses.1</pre>
    <pre>Thus,     a     court       will       have    jurisdiction    to
hear       and       determine      a      corollary       relief
proceeding,     and    can    therefore    make     a     support
order,    provided   it   is   the   court    that    has    also
granted     either    or    both    parties    their     divorce.
Clearly,     the    &#145;court&#146;    can    only    be    a    Canadian
court     and     would     include     the     Ontario     Court
where     it     was     the    court    that     granted     the
parties their divorce.</pre>
    <pre>[29]  I  could  find only three cases that have dealt  with  this
issue  and they all affirm that under s. 4 of the Act, a Canadian
court  is  without jurisdiction to order corollary  relief  (i.e.
spousal support) where the same court has not granted the parties
a  divorce.   See  Lietz  v. Lietz [1990]  111  N.B.R.  (2d)  128
(N.B.Q.B.),  Droit de la Famille &#150; 770 (1989) [1990]  R.J.Q.  581
(Que.  S.C.) and Kalsi v. Kalsi [1992] 41 R.F.L. (3d)  201  (Alb.
C.A.).
[30] In my view, the Lang order can only purport to have been
made pursuant to s. 15(2) of the Act and consequently,
jurisdiction to make that order must be derived from s. 4.  On
the facts of this case, the jurisdictional requirement mandating
that only the court that granted the divorce is empowered to
order support was not met, nor could it be met.  The Ontario
court was not the court that granted the parties their divorce.
The Lang order failed to meet the jurisdictional requirement
necessary to determine a corollary relief proceeding and the
order was made without jurisdiction.
</pre>
    <pre>     Question 2:  Can consent confer jurisdiction?</pre>
    <pre>[31]  The  husband  argues  that,  in  any  event,  Lang  J.  had
jurisdiction to make the spousal support order because  in  1990,
both parties accepted the jurisdiction of the Ontario court.   He
also  argues that by availing herself of the jurisdiction of  the
Ontario  court to increase spousal support the wife  cannot  now,
after  having collected the increased payments for the last eight
years,  challenge the jurisdiction of the Ontario court  to  make
the order.
[32] The wife challenges this position on the basis that consent
cannot confer jurisdiction.  She argues that the fact that the
order was made with the consent of both parties is irrelevant to
the determination of whether the Ontario court had jurisdiction
to make the order and whether the order is valid.
[33] No authority was cited in support of the husband&#146;s position.
In my view, the assertion that the parties cannot confer
jurisdiction on a court where it otherwise lacks subject-matter
jurisdiction is unequivocally correct.
[34] Halsbury&#146;s Law of England, 4th ed. p. 326, states the
general principle as follows:

    Where, by reason of any limitation imposed by statute,
    charter or commission,  a court is without jurisdiction to
    entertain any particular action or matter, neither acquiescence
    nor the express consent of the parties can confer jurisdiction
    upon the court&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[35]  The  author cites as authority a long line of cases  dating
back  to 1750.  The case law generally affirms, as stated in   Re
Dulles  Settlement, [1950] ALL ER 1013 (CA)  at  1015,  that  &#147;no
amount of submission on the part of an individual will operate to
extend jurisdiction which Parliament has thought fit to limit&#148;.
[36] In Township of Cornwall v. Ottawa and New York Railway
Company et al. (1916), 52 S.C.R. 466, it was argued that there
was no right of appeal from a decision of the Municipal Board.
The question was whether in taking part in an appeal to the Court
of Appeal of Ontario without objection, a party had waived the
right to object to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of
Canada to hear the appeal. Duff J. speaking for himself as a
member of the majority (no member of the court disagreed with him
on the issue of consent) said:

	First, it is said to be a case for the application 
	of the maxim consent cannot give jurisdiction.  This, 
	of course, simply begs the question.  Consent can 
	give jurisdiction when it consists only in waiver of 
	a condition which the law permits to be waived, 
	otherwise it cannot.  Where want of jurisdiction
        touches the subject matter of the controversy or where 
	the proceeding is of a kind which by law or custom has 
	been appropriated to another tribunal then mere 
	consent of the parties is inoperative.  No consent, 
	for example, could give the Supreme Court of Ontario 
	jurisdiction to hear a petition for determining the 
	right to a seat in Parliament.</pre>
    <pre>[37]  Further, in a factually similar case to the present appeal,
the English Court of Appeal in Hinde v. Hinde [1953] 1 ALL ER 171
(CA)  dealt with an appellate challenge to a court&#146;s jurisdiction
that  had  earlier made a consent order setting  out  maintenance
obligations.   The  husband had paid the  wife  support  payments
pursuant  to  the  consent order, but upon his death  his  estate
discontinued  payment.  The wife brought an  application  against
the  estate seeking payment on the basis that it was the parties&#146;
intention,  as  reflected in the order, that the  payments  would
survive  the  husband&#146;s death.  It was argued on  behalf  of  the
estate  that the jurisdiction of the court was limited by statute
to   order  payment  during  the  joint  lives  of  the  parties,
regardless of whether the parties or the court in its  order  had
so  intended.   Further, it was argued that, at the  very  least,
there  was  no  power  in the court to enforce  the  order.   The
members of the court, both explicitly and by implication, applied
the principle that parties could not by consent give the court  a
jurisdiction which it did not otherwise possess and dismissed the
wife&#146;s  appeal.  (See also Byrn v. Mackin (1983) 32  R.F.L.  (2d)
207 (Que. S.C.) for the proposition that parties are bound by the
jurisdictional requirements of s. 4(1)(b) of the Act  and  cannot
confer  jurisdiction by consent and Patterson v. Torrance (1994),
111  D.L.R.  (4th) 477 (Man. C.A.) where again in  a  family  law
context,   the  court  confirmed  that  &quot;parties  cannot   confer
jurisdiction on the court where the court does not otherwise have
jurisdiction&quot;.)
[38] In the present case, as discussed above, s. 4 of the Act
limits a court&#146;s jurisdiction to determine a corollary relief
proceeding (support order) to the court that has granted the
divorce.  This limitation cannot be altered on consent of the
parties: it is a condition that must be satisfied before a court
can avail itself of the jurisdiction provided by the statute.
[39] In summary, the fact that the parties consented to the Lang
order or abided by it for some years cannot overcome the
determinative fact that in failing to satisfy the s. 4
requirement of being the court that granted the divorce, the
Ontario court lacked jurisdiction to order spousal support.  As a
consequence, the spousal support obligations in para. 4 of the
Lang order are a nullity.
</pre>
    <pre>     Question 3:    Did Swinton J. have jurisdiction to vary
	            spousal support obligations?</pre>
    <pre>[40]  There is no dispute that the application before Swinton  J.
was  a variation proceeding.  It purported to vary both the  Lang
order  and  the South African divorce judgment.  In my  view,  it
could do neither for the following reasons.
[41] Swinton J. purported to take jurisdiction under the Act and
identified s. 5 as the statutory basis enabling her to determine
the variation proceeding before her.  Section 5 of the Act
provides:

   5. (1)  A court in a province has jurisdiction to hear and
   determine a variation proceeding if

   (a) either former spouse is ordinarily resident  in the
    province at the commencement of the proceeding; or

   (b) both former spouses accept the jurisdiction of the court.
               . . .</pre>
    <pre>[42]  In  my  view, there are three premises that  underlie  this
provision: first, the support order from which variation is being
sought  is  valid; second, the support order has been made  by  a
Canadian  court pursuant to the Divorce Act; and third, which  is
part  and  parcel  of the second requirement,  there  must  be  a
Canadian  divorce  from  which the power  to  vary  an  order  or
corollary relief can derive.
[43] The first premise is self-evident.  A support order must be
valid before a court can vary it.  A court can only vary an order
that was made with jurisdiction in the first place as the power
to vary cannot be substantively wider than the power to make the
order.  The effect of my conclusion to Question 1 that the part
of the Lang order dealing with spousal support was made without
jurisdiction and is a nullity is that the husband&#146;s application
for variation of the Lang order must be dismissed.  Swinton J.&#146;s
variation of the Lang order must be set aside.
[44] There remains to be determined whether the parts of the
Swinton order varying the South African divorce judgment dealing
with spousal and child support and the wife&#146;s medical premiums
must be similarly set aside.  As stated earlier, the husband&#146;s
application to vary did not seek relief from child support
obligations.  Swinton J., nevertheless ordered a variation and
declared that the husband had no further child support
obligations to the wife.  As also stated earlier, child support
has not been raised as an issue in this appeal.
[45] Dealing with the second and third premises underlying s. 5,
they flow from the interpretation of the wording of the statute.
Pursuant to s. 17, a court of competent jurisdiction can make an
order varying a support order.  A support order is a defined term
in the statute (s.2(1)) and means an order made under s. 15(2).
Pursuant to s. 15(2), a support order can only be made by a court
of competent jurisdiction, which in accordance with s. 4
necessarily means the court that granted the divorce.  The court
that granted the divorce must be a Canadian court because under
the Act, only a court in a province, also a defined term in the
statute (s.2(1)), can grant a divorce (3(1)).  Thus, both the
order and the divorce upon which it is premised, must have a
Canadian identity.  There is both academic commentary and caselaw
to support this conclusion.
[46] Professor Castel in Canadian Conflicts of Laws, 4th ed.
(Toronto: Butterworths, 1997) at p. 417, states that pursuant to
the Divorce Act &#147;the right to corollary relief comes into
existence at the time of the divorce&#148;.  Professor Hovius in his
text Family Law: Cases, Notes &amp; Material, 4th ed. (Toronto:
Carswell, 1996) at p. 482, states that &#147;[a]s the Parliament of
Canada&#146;s jurisdiction over support is ancillary to its
legislative jurisdiction over divorce, the power to order support
under the Divorce Act will cease if the court refuses to grant
the divorce&#148;.  The inference is that a Canadian divorce must be
granted before an Ontario court can order support under the Act.
Finally, Professor Payne in his text Payne on Divorce, 4th ed.
(Toronto: Carswell, 1996) states that &#147;Section 5 of the Divorce
Act confers no jurisdiction on any Canadian Court to vary a
foreign support order, although such jurisdiction may be
exercisable under provincial legislation respecting reciprocal
enforcement of support orders.&quot;  Thus, according to these
commentaries, s. 5 must be read as conferring jurisdiction on
Canadian courts to vary Canadian support orders made pursuant to
the Act.
[47] No Canadian cases were cited and I could find none, where a
court has varied a foreign divorce or foreign support order under
the Divorce Act.  On the contrary, on occasions where it has been
tried, the application has been rejected and the courts have
named the provincial reciprocal enforcement legislation as the
appropriate approach.  There are two cases on point.
[48] In Trotter v. Trotter (1992) 90 D.L.R. (4th) 554 (Ont.
G.D.), Greer J. dismissed the wife&#146;s application to vary a
support order of an English court on the basis that she had no
jurisdiction to do so under the Divorce Act.  The parties were
married and divorced in England.  The husband moved to the United
States with one child of the marriage and the wife moved to
Ontario with the second child.  Greer J. reasoned that under the
Act she did not have jurisdiction to vary an English divorce
judgment because the Trotter divorce was not granted under the
Act, and therefore, could not be varied by our courts unless the
Attorney-General selected this court upon application of the wife
under the RESOA.  She went on to explain that the RESOA provided
a vehicle by which support orders from reciprocating states could
be enforced. As no such application had been made, the wife&#146;s
application was dismissed.
[49] Similarily, in Smibert v. Smibert (1996) S.J. No. 496 (Sask.
Q.B.) the question arose as to whether s.5 of the Act could
provide the jurisdictional basis to vary a foreign order.  Laing
J. found that &#147;the law seemed fairly clear that s.5 applies only
to orders made under the Divorce Act &#133;&#148;  He held that he had &#147;no
jurisdiction to vary the terms of [an Alabama] order, unless it
can be done pursuant to&#148; the RESOA, which it could not as the
foreign divorce was not registered as required by the statute.
[50] Parliament has no jurisdiction to pass legislation
authorizing spousal support except when ancillary or corollary to
a divorce.  Section 5(1)(b) speaks of the ability of a former
spouse to apply for a variation in a different province from the
one which granted the divorce judgment.  It is not intended to
permit the variation of a foreign divorce judgment.  The
legislative or statutory scheme for addressing variations of
foreign support orders is the RESOA.
[51] In my opinion, Swinton J. clearly could not derive her
jurisdiction to vary the South African divorce judgment from s. 5
of the Act, as she did, and her order cannot stand.  There is no
jurisdiction to vary a foreign divorce.  This is why, as stated
earlier, the Lang order could not be a variation.
</pre>
    <pre>The merits of the application before Swinton J.</pre>
    <pre>[52] As an alternative ground of appeal, the wife argues that, on
its   merits,  the  husband&#146;s  application  ought  to  have  been
dismissed.   In  light  of  my  disposition  of  the   issue   of
jurisdiction,  it is not necessary to deal with  this  ground  of
appeal.   However,  I wish to make some brief  comments  on  this
issue.
[53] Following an eighteen year traditional marriage, the parties
entered into an agreement pursuant to which the parties waived
for all times their right to apply for a variation of spousal
support except for certain specific conditions that do not apply
in this case.
[54] The husband has sworn to changes in his income and to the
state of his health.   The wife has sworn to little change, if
any, in her income and that she could not afford to retain
counsel on the application.   The variation was essentially
granted by default, on the basis of untested affidavits and
financial information.
[55] Even disregarding the non-variable provision of their
agreement, it remains that the husband enjoys a much higher
standard of living than the wife.  He has a valuable residence
and access to a family fund.  Counsel for the wife argued that
the spousal support payments represented 86% of the wife&#146;s
income.  She swears that she has no assets.  Swinton J. noted
that it would be undue hardship for the husband to go to South
Africa to deal with this matter.  It would be no less of a
hardship for the wife to come to Ontario.
[56] In my view, on the basis of this record, there was no cogent
evidence that the parties had experienced a material change of
circumstances.  The termination of spousal support payments may
have caused her severe hardship.
</pre>
    <pre>The 1993 Amendment</pre>
    <pre>[57] The effect of this decision is that under the Divorce Act  a
Canadian  court,  which  includes the  Ontario  court,  only  has
jurisdiction to determine a corollary relief proceeding,  i.e.  a
support  order, if the court has granted a divorce to  either  or
both  former  spouses.  Furthermore, a Canadian  court  can  only
grant a variation of a support order of a Canadian divorce if (a)
either  former spouse is ordinarily resident in the  province  at
the  commencement  of the proceeding or (b) both  former  spouses
accept the jurisdiction the jurisdiction of the court.
[58] In these reasons, I referred to s. 4 of the Divorce Act as
it read in 1990 at the time of the Lang order.  I also mentioned
that s. 4 was amended as of March 25, 1993.  I repeat the section
as it read prior to and since the amendment:
</pre>
    <pre>4.   A court has jurisdiction	4.  Jurisdiction in corollary	
to   hear  and  determine   a	relief proceedings. &#150;  
corollary  relief  proceeding	(1) A court in a province has

divorce  to  either  or  both	determine a corollary  relief		
former spouses.			proceeding if
				(a) either  former spouse  is
				ordinarily  resident  in  the
				province at the  commencement 
				of the proceeding; or
				(b) both former spouses accept
				the jurisdiction of the court.

</pre>
    <pre>In   his  textbook  earlier referred  to, Professor  Payne  wrote
that  the  amendment  &#147;appears sufficiently  broad  to  enable  a
foreign divorcee to institute proceedings for support and custody
under sections 15 and 16 of the Act, if he or she has established
ordinary  residence in a Canadian province.&#148;  The implication  of
this view is great and thus merits correction.</pre>
    <pre>[59]  In  my  view,  the amendment did no  such  thing.   Whereas
Parliament had previously limited jurisdiction to the court  that
had  granted the divorce, the amendment extended the jurisdiction
by  authorizing  a  Canadian court to  hear  a  corollary  relief
proceeding  if  either  spouse were ordinarily  resident  in  the
province  or if both former spouses accepted the jurisdiction  of
the  court.  Parliament did not intend to  give  Canadian  courts
jurisdiction   over  foreign  divorces.   As   Professor   Hovius
correctly  noted,  Parliament&#146;s  jurisdiction  over  support   is
ancillary to its jurisdiction over divorce pursuant to s.  91  of
the  Constitution  Act, 1867.  Any attempt to deal  with  support
obligations  in the absence of a Canadian divorce would  encroach
on  provincial  jurisdiction (Section  92,  &quot;Property  and  Civil
Rights&quot;).   This  assertion  also supports  and  strengthens  the
conclusion  that I have reached on the issue of the  jurisdiction
of an Ontario court to make an order in the absence of a Canadian
divorce.
</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[60]  In  the  result, the appeal is allowed  and  the  order  of
Swinton  J.,  insofar as it relates to spousal  support,  is  set
aside.   Since the mutual consent to the Lang order is  in  large
part  the  cause of this dispute, there will be no  order  as  to
costs.
