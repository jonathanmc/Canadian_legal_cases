                                </pre>
    <pre>[1]   This is an appeal by the appellants from the order of
Cusinato J. declining to set aside the summary judgment of Zalev
J. on the basis that the material the respondent bank placed
before Zalev J. was fraudulent and incomplete. The appellants
also submit, as fresh evidence, after-acquired documents that
they say should have been before Zalev J.
[2]  However, on examination, it is evident that the material
that was placed before Zalev J. was neither fraudulent nor
incomplete.  The complaint essentially is that Zalev J. did not
put the construction on the material that was later urged before
Cusinato J. and this court.  In our view, Cusinato J. was correct
in his assessment that what are now being raised as allegations
of misrepresentation are really arguments arising out of the
original record that should have been submitted for the court&#146;s
consideration on the motion for summary judgment before Zalev J.
[3]  Having concluded that the submission respecting the primary
debtors must fail, there is no reason to discharge the appellant
Mifflin as guarantor.
[4]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.
