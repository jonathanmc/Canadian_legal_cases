    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Whetung J. dated October 30, 1998</pre>
    <pre>LASKIN J.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  In July 1997, in the wake of several serious incidents of
&#147;flying truck wheels&#148; the Ontario Legislature enacted s. 84.1 of
the Highway Traffic Act.1  Section 84.1 provides for an absolute
liability offence where a wheel becomes detached from a
commercial motor vehicle while the vehicle is on a highway.  A
vehicle owner or operator convicted under this section may be
fined to a maximum of $50,000.
[2]  Shortly after s. 84.1 came into force, the respondent Ryder
Truck Rental Canada Limited was charged under the section when
the dual wheels, hub and axle on one side of one of its large
moving trucks &#147;separated as a unit&#148; from the truck, while it was
being driven on a highway near Peterborough.
[3]  Ryder was acquitted at trial by Justice of the Peace
O&#146;Toole, and the Crown&#146;s appeal to the Ontario Court of Justice
was dismissed by Justice Whetung.  The Crown appeals to this
court, with leave, on a question of law, under s. 131 of the
Provincial Offences Act.2  The question of law is whether on the
agreed facts of this case a wheel became detached from Ryder&#146;s
truck under s. 84.1 of the Act.

BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[4]  The parties filed an agreed statement of facts.  Ryder was
the operator of the commercial motor vehicle in question, a 1993
international truck.  About a week before the incident Ministry
of Transportation inspectors had inspected the truck, and the
Ministry had issued an annual inspection certificate.3
[5]  On the day of the incident, July 30, 1997, the truck was
being driven eastbound on Highway 115 &#147;when the dual wheels, hub
and axle on the second axle left side separated as a unit&#148; from
the truck.  In other words, the dual wheels themselves did not
separate from their fasteners.  Instead, the entire assembly, of
which the dual wheels were a part, detached in one piece from the
truck.  The parties agreed that &#147;[t]he axle and the dual wheels
are attached to the wheel hub at the wheel end, and the axle is
not attached but interacts with a series of gears to rotate, at
the differential.  When a hub separates the two wheels and axle
attached to it will separate with the hub.&#148;  The parties also
agreed that &#147;the cause of wheel separation is not a necessary
element of proving the offence.&#148;
[6]  In acquitting Ryder the Justice of the Peace concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>  The section is very specific.  The definition, in my
  opinion, is quite specific.  There is no mention at 
  any place of the axle, and in my opinion they do not
  apply in this case.  From the Agreed Facts, the axle
  separated, and that was the cause of everything
  attaching to the axle coming off with it.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Justice Whetung decided that the Justice of the Peace&#146;s
conclusion was &#147;reasonably reached&#148; and therefore dismissed the
Crown&#146;s appeal.  Goudge J.A. granted leave to appeal to this
court on June 16, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>DISCUSSION</pre>
    <pre>[8]  Section 84.1 of the Act was part of Bill 138, &#147;An Act to
promote road safety by &#133; creating an absolute liability offence
for wheel separations&#133;&#148;  Subsection (1), which imposes liability,
provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>  84.1 (1)  Where a wheel becomes detached from a commercial
  motor vehicle, or from a vehicle being drawn by a commercial
  motor vehicle, while the commercial motor vehicle is on a
  highway, the operator of the commercial motor vehicle and the
  owner of the vehicle from which the wheel becomes detached are
  guilty of an offence.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Subsection (3) provides that on a conviction the owner or
operator is liable to a fine of not less than $2,000 and not more
than $50,000.  Subsection (5) makes the offence one of absolute
liability by providing that the exercise of due diligence to
avoid or prevent the detaching of the wheel is not a defence to a
charge under subsection (1).
[10] The dispute between Ryder and the Crown centres on whether,
under s. 84.1(1) &#147;a wheel becomes detached&#148; only when the wheel
itself separates from the vehicle, or whether a wheel also
Sbecomes detached&#148; when an assembly of which the wheel is a part
separates from the vehicle.  Ryder argues for the former meaning;
the Crown for the latter.  This is a question of statutory
interpretation.
[11] The modern approach to statutory interpretation calls on the
court to interpret a legislative provision in its total context.
The court should consider and take into account all relevant and
admissible indicators of legislative meaning.  The court&#146;s
interpretation should comply with the legislative text, promote
the legislative purpose, reflect the legislature&#146;s intent, and
produce a reasonable and just meaning.4  The Supreme Court has
repeatedly affirmed this approach to statutory interpretation,
most recently in R. v. Gladue5 where Cory and Iacobucci JJ.
wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>  As this Court has frequently stated, the proper construction
  of a statutory provision flows from reading the words of the
  provision in their grammatical and ordinary sense and in their
  entire context, harmoniously with the scheme of the statute as a
  whole, the purpose of the statute and the intention of
  Parliament.  The purpose of the statute and the intention of
  Parliament, in particular, are to be determined on the basis of
  intrinsic and admissible extrinsic sources regarding the Act&#146;s
  legislative history and the context of its enactment.
    </pre>
    <pre>[12] The relevant indicators of the legislative meaning of s.
84.1(1) all support Ryder&#146;s interpretation.  Four indicators of
the section&#146;s meaning are especially important:  the legislative
history, the text of the section, the related regulatory
provisions, and the effect of the Crown&#146;s proposed
interpretation.
[13] First, the legislative history of s. 84.1 supports Ryder&#146;s
interpretation of the section.  The legislative debates on this
issue from February 1997 until Bill 138 was passed in July 1997
focus on one concern:  the threat to public safety from &#147;flying
wheels,&#148; that is from wheels coming off trucks and other
commercial motor vehicles because, for example, the wheel was not
fastened tightly enough.
[14] Section 84.1 was enacted to address that specific concern.
Both Justice of the Peace O&#146;Toole and Justice Whetung recognized
this purpose of s. 84.1.  Justice of the Peace O&#146;Toole said:
          </pre>
    <pre>  The intention of course, given all of the publicity in the
  last couple of years, was for road safety and the protection of
  the public in my opinion.  We are all aware of the numerous
  situations, accidents, and deaths that have resulted, as a result
  of the term flying wheels.
        
Justice Whetung adopted this view:</pre>
    <pre>  I do not consider the present appeal to be trivial at all.
  It involves legislation that deals directly with the issue of
  public safety on the highway.  It involves legislation meant to
  address a situation that is clearly within the forefront of
  public concern and involves serious matters of public safety and
  involves situations on our highways that have resulted in
  fatalities.
          </pre>
    <pre>  &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>  [Justice of the Peace O&#146;Toole] directs his mind to the issue
  I alluded to earlier of road safety and refers to the issue 
  of the term &#145;flying wheels&#146;.  He acknowledges the drafting
  of the legislation as creating an absolute liability offence
  and acknowledges that was the intention of the legislature.
  Obviously, the legislature drafted it, so that must be their
  intention.</pre>
    <pre>[15] In the case before us, for whatever reason, the axle, hub,
wheel and tire assembly came off in one piece.  But the wheel
fastening mechanism &#150; which was the concern of the Legislature in
enacting s. 84.1 &#150; did not fail.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The second indicator of the meaning of s. 84.1 is the text
of the section.  The words used in s. 84.1 show that the section
means to impose liability when a wheel separates from a
commercial motor vehicle, not when another component or assembly
of the vehicle &#150; such as an axle and hub &#150; separates, even if
that other assembly or component includes a wheel.  Under s.
84.1(1) an offence occurs only &#147;where a wheel becomes detached.&#148;
Had the Legislature meant to impose absolute liability when
another component that includes a wheel detached from a vehicle,
it could have said so.
[17] The Crown submits, however, that s. 84.1(1) imposes
liability in the present case for two reasons.  The Crown draws a
distinction between the phrase used in s. 84.1(1) &#147;where a wheel
becomes detached,&#148; and the phrase &#147;where a wheel detaches.&#148;  The
Crown submits that the actual wording of s. 84.1(1) is broader
and that Ryder&#146;s interpretation would be supportable only if the
Legislature had used the words &#147;where a wheel detaches.&#148;  In my
view, the Crown has drawn a distinction without a difference.
The section focuses on the separation of a wheel from a vehicle,
not on the separation of another component of the vehicle, which
happens to include a wheel.  As the Justice of the Peace said in
acquitting Ryder &#147;the axle separated, and that was the cause of
everything attaching to the axle coming off with it.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[18] The Crown also submits that on Ryder&#146;s interpretation, an
owner or operator of a commercial motor vehicle could be
convicted only if the wheel alone separates.  That
interpretation, the Crown argues, would make the section
ineffective because a wheel is defined not to include a tire or
large piece of a tire,6 yet when a wheel becomes detached from a
vehicle, invariably it becomes detached with a tire.  I do not
agree with this submission by the Crown.  To obtain a conviction
under s. 84.1 the Crown need not prove that the wheel without the
tire separated from the vehicle.  The tire can be attached to the
wheel.  But if the tire alone separates, that is not an offence
under s. 84.1.</pre>
    <pre>[19] The third indicator of the meaning of s. 84.1 is found in
related provisions of the regulatory scheme under the Highway
Traffic Act.  Ryder&#146;s interpretation of s. 84.1 is consistent
with the duties imposed by regulation on a driver to inspect the
wheels on a commercial motor vehicle. Subsection 2(1) of the
Commercial Motor Vehicle Inspections Regulation provides that
&#147;every driver of a commercial motor vehicle shall inspect or
cause to be inspected the commercial motor vehicle before the
vehicle&#146;s first trip of the day.&#148;7  Section 3 provides that the
inspection must include the list of items in Schedule 1 (outside
inspection) and Schedule 2 (inside inspection).  Among the items
to be inspected under Schedule 1 are &#147;wheels and fasteners (for
wheel or rim cracks, defective lock rings, loose or missing
fasteners).&#148;  Requiring the wheels and fasteners to be inspected
is meant to ensure that the wheels themselves do not separate
from the vehicle.  A driver has no similar obligation under the
Regulation to inspect hubs and axles to ensure they do not become
detached from a vehicle.  Moreover, as with the inspection
requirements in Schedule 1, the maintenance standards for
&#147;wheels&#148; in Schedule 3 relate only to wheel fasteners and the
wheel surface.  Thus, both s. 84.1 of the Act and the inspection
requirements under the Regulation reflect the Legislature&#146;s
concern about &#147;flying wheels.&#148;
[20] Finally, the Crown&#146;s proposed interpretation of s. 84.1
would produce unreasonable results.  Suppose a tractor trailer
rig lost the trailer it was hauling.  Although the trailer would
have separated as a unit, because it included wheels the owner of
the rig could be convicted under s. 84.1.  Such a result seems
unreasonable and contrary to the purpose of the section.</pre>
    <pre>[21] Giving effect to Ryder&#146;s interpretation of s. 84.1 does not
mean the Crown is powerless in a case like the one under appeal.
The Crown could have resorted to the general offence provision,
s. 84, which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre> 84.  No person shall drive or operate or permit the driving
 or operation upon a highway of a vehicle, a street car or
 vehicles that in combination are in such a dangerous or unsafe
 condition as to endanger any person.</pre>
    <pre>[22] I would dismiss the Crown&#146;s appeal.

3   Because  s.  84.1  is  an  absolute  liability  offence  and,
therefore,  Ryder cannot rely on a defence of due diligence,  the
inspection has little relevance on this appeal.
