    <pre><strong>    On appeal from sentence by Beaulieu J. on March 27, 1998
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>BY THE COURT:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an inmate sentence appeal.  In the early morning
hours of August 31, 1996, the appellant David Sackanay sexually
assaulted a male prostitute.  Nineteen hours later he assaulted a
taxi driver.  At the time of both offences he was heavily under
the influence of alcohol and crack cocaine.  He pleaded guilty to
aggravated sexual assault and aggravated assault.  The trial
judge sentenced him to six years imprisonment, three and one-half
years for the aggravated assault and two and one-half years
consecutive for the aggravated sexual assault.  The appellant had
already served nineteen months in pre-trial custody, for which
the sentencing judge gave him thirty months credit.  Thus, the
appellant, effectively, was sentenced to eight and one-half
years, or if the usual two for one credit had been given, to over
nine years.
[2]  He submits that the trial judge committed two errors
entitling this court to review the sentence.  First, the
appellant is an aboriginal offender and he submits that the trial
judge did not give sufficient weight to the direction in s.
718.2(e) of the Criminal Code.  Second, he submits that the trial
judge erred by not giving any weight to the nexus between the two
offences.  The appellant submits that we should reduce his
sentence by making the two and one-half years sentence for
aggravated assault concurrent instead of consecutive.  For the
reasons that follow we agree with the appellant&#146;s submission.</pre>
    <pre>Background</pre>
    <pre>[3]  The facts surrounding these offences are horrific.  Both
victims were subjected to gratuitous and serious acts of
violence.
[4]  The appellant attacked his first victim, a male prostitute,
in a stairwell at 3:00 a.m. on August 31, 1996.  When the victim
refused sexual intercourse, the appellant assaulted him with a
broken bottle and then penetrated him anally.  When the victim
resisted, the appellant hit him in the face, forced him to
perform fellatio, took $65.00 from his jacket pocket, and then
fled.  The victim suffered a lacerated upper lip and broken jaw;
his face was badly bruised and he lost four teeth.
[5]  At 10:30 p.m. that evening the appellant attacked a second
victim, a taxi driver, with a broken bottle.  This victim
suffered four stitches to his nose, three stitches to his lip,
and minor lacerations to his forehead.
[6]  The appellant is addicted both to alcohol and crack cocaine,
and when he committed these offences he had been on a &#147;24 hours a
day drinking and drugs bender for almost nine months.&#148;  He
blacked out during the sexual assault, not remembering what he
had done, and the incident with the taxi driver &#147;was a blur&#148; in
his mind.
[7]  The appellant was 26 years old when he committed these
offences.  He has a long criminal record, which began when he was
14, and which includes several offences of violence.  His longest
previous adult sentence was one year in custody.
[8]  At trial the appellant not only pleaded guilty but sent a
letter of apology to each victim.  The sentencing judge gave
detailed and thoughtful reasons in which he considered the
principles of denunciation and specific deterrence to be
paramount.  He observed that but for an optimistic report from
METFORS, he would have sentenced the appellant to an even longer
penitentiary term.</pre>
    <pre>Discussion</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The sentence imposed by a sentencing judge is, of course,
entitled to deference from this court.  Nonetheless, we think
that the sentencing judge&#146;s failure to give sufficient weight to
the direction in s. 718.2(e) of the Code and his failure to
consider the nexus between the two offences justify our
intervention.
[10] Section 718.2(e) of the Code provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>718.2  A court that imposes a sentence shall also take 
into consideration the following principles: </pre>
      <pre>&#133;</pre>
      <pre>(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment 
that are reasonable in the circumstances should be 
considered for all offenders, with particular 
attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>The sentencing judge did refer to the appellant&#146;s aboriginal
ancestry and recognized his &#147;horrific personal and family
background.&#148;  But the sentencing judge did not have the benefit
of the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s decision in R. v. Gladue (1999),
133 C.C.C. (3d) 385.  In Gladue, the Supreme Court stated for the
first time that s. 718.2(e) was more than a reaffirmation of
existing sentencing principles, that it recognized the unique
circumstances of aboriginal offenders, and that it directed
sentencing judges to sentence aboriginal offenders differently.</pre>
    <pre>[11] Admittedly, both Gladue and the later Supreme Court of
Canada decision in R. v. Wells, [2000] S.C.J. No. 11 acknowledge
that sentences should not be automatically reduced for aboriginal
offenders, and that for more serious and violent offences
sentences are likely to be similar whether the offender is
aboriginal or not.  Still, Gladue mandates a different approach
to sentencing aboriginals because of the systemic or background
factors that play a part in bringing them before the court.  The
appellant&#146;s background is a poignant example of just how much the
upbringing of an aboriginal can differ from that of most
Canadians.  The appellant was born in Moose Factory.  When he was
an infant his natural father was killed.  Both his mother and his
stepfather who raised him were alcoholics.  Domestic violence
permeated the household.  When the appellant was eight years old
he tried to commit suicide.  When he was nine he resorted to
drinking to relieve the tension and loneliness of his upbringing.
He often tried to run away from home.  He spent most of his
adolescent years in group homes or in custody.  He has a grade 10
education and few skills.  He has suffered from the effects of
alcohol and drug abuse.  Although the appellant&#146;s crimes warrant
a jail sentence, the hardships he has suffered should be taken
into account in determining a fit sentence.  In our view, the
sentencing judge did not do so.
[12] Moreover, the sentencing judge did not consider the nexus
between the two offences, a nexus attributable to the appellant&#146;s
consumption of drugs and alcohol, which in turn is related to the
systemic disadvantages the appellant has suffered.  The appellant
did commit two distinct offences, separated in time, against two
different victims.  But in doing so he was in a continuous state
of intoxication.  The sentencing judge&#146;s failure to consider that
these offences had an element of continuity bears on the question
of the totality of the sentence.
[13] We think that in the light of s. 718.2(e) of the Code and in
the light of the nexus between the two offences, a sentence of
eight and one-half years (including pre-trial custody) was
unreasonably long.  In our view, we can achieve a more
appropriate sentence by making the two and one-half year sentence
for aggravated sexual assault concurrent instead of consecutive.
By doing so the appellant effectively receives a sentence of six
years (giving the same credit for pre-trial custody as did the
trial judge).   In imposing this sentence we have also taken into
account the appellant&#146;s genuine expression of remorse both at
trial and in this court, and the reports from the institution
where he is residing that he has taken positive steps to
rehabilitate himself and that generally he is doing well.
[14] Therefore, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal
is allowed and the sentence is reduced by making the sentence for
aggravated sexual assault concurrent instead of consecutive.
[15] Finally, we wish to express our appreciation for the
excellent written submission prepared on behalf of the appellant
by the Queen&#146;s University Correctional Law Project under the
supervision of Mr. Goddard, and for the helpful submissions by
Mr. Lacey who acted as duty counsel and by Ms. Pomerance for the
Crown.</pre>
