    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Lederman dated October

[1]  This appeal involves the meaning of an &quot;accident&quot; within
s. 1 of the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule for accidents
after December 31, 1993 and before November 1, 1996 (O. Reg.
776/93) (&quot;SABS&quot;).
[2]  The respondent, a taxi driver, was assaulted outside his
taxicab on June 8, 1996, as a result of an argument stemming from
the refusal by two customers to pay their fare.  The respondent
was seriously injured.
[3]  The issue is whether the assault is an &quot;accident&quot; within the
meaning of s. 1 of the SABS, that is, &quot;an incident in which
directly or indirectly, the use or operation of an automobile
causes an impairment&quot;, entitling the respondent to statutory
accident benefits.
[4]  Lederman J. (the &quot;motions judge&quot;) found in favour of the
respondent.  The appellant appeals this decision.
[5]  The motions judge, relying on the liberal approach
pronounced by Major J. in Amos v. Insurance Corporation of
British Columbia, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 405, applied the &quot;purpose test&quot;
and the &quot;causation test&quot; to the facts before him.  In Vijeyekumar
v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (1999), 44 O.R.
(3d) 545 (C.A.), this court confirmed that the provision
considered in Amos was sufficiently similar to the definition of
&quot;accident&quot; in s. 1 of the SABS that the Amos test may be applied
to this definition.
[6]  The motions judge was therefore correct in applying the Amos
test to the facts of this case.  He found that the assault was
the end product of the commercial relationship that had been
created when the ride in the taxicab had started.   He also found
that an unbroken line of causation existed, beginning with the
ride in the taxicab and ending with the assault.
[7]  He thus concluded that the injuries sustained by the
respondent were caused, at least indirectly, by the use and
operation of the taxicab.
[8]  The motions judge did not misapprehend or fail to appreciate
the evidence.  His findings and the inferences he drew are well
founded on the evidence.  We agree with his analysis and
conclusion.
[9]  The appeal is dismissed with costs.</pre>
