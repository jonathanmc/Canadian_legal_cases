    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Hoilett J. dated April 25, 1996.</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY AND FELDMAN JJ.A.:</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is another in a series of cases which raises the issue
of the applicability of the doctrine of issue estoppel where a
former employee has applied for benefits under the Unemployment
Insurance Act1, had the matter adjudicated, then sued the
employer for wrongful or constructive dismissal. This case
involves the added question whether the doctrine of issue
estoppel can apply to the discharge of an accused from Criminal
Code charges after a preliminary inquiry.</pre>
    <pre>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</pre>
    <pre>[2]  This case came before the court below as a motion brought by
the respondent Ontario, under rule 21.01(2)(a) of the Rules of
Civil Procedure 2 for the determination of a question of law
after the close of pleadings. The question of law was whether the
appellant was estopped from bringing his constructive dismissal
action by the findings of the Umpire under the Unemployment
Insurance Act.  These findings formed the basis of the Umpire&#146;s
conclusion that the respondent was entitled to terminate the
appellant for misconduct. Ontario was permitted to introduce
evidence on the motion. The evidence consisted of the reasons for
decision of the Umpire dated September 29, 1994,in respect of the
appellant&#146;s claim for unemployment insurance benefits following
his resignation from employment with the Ministry of Education of
the Government of Ontario.
[3]  There was also a supplementary motion record filed which
contained further documentation from the Unemployment Insurance
Commission in respect of the appellant&#146;s claim including notices
of hearing and the appellant&#146;s notice of appeal to the Umpire.
[4]  The appellant brought a similar cross-motion. He was
discharged after a preliminary inquiry of fraud charges arising
out of his employment.  He sought to strike out as issue
estopped, the defences in  the Statement of Defence which
responded to his constructive dismissal action on that basis.  He
filed evidence consisting of excerpts from the transcript of the
preliminary inquiry, a list of exhibits from that hearing, and a
report prepared by Price Waterhouse for the Ontario Government in
respect of his activities while employed.3
[5]  We refer to the procedural history and the state of the
record in order to indicate that because this is not an appeal
after a trial (as in Rasanen4, Minott5 and Frito-Lay6), or after
a summary judgment motion (as in Randhawa7) there is no sworn,
coherent version of the &#147;facts&#148; in the record either below or
before this court. Hoilett J. stated that the relevant facts were
not in dispute, referring to the appellant&#146;s employment history
with two ministries of the Ontario government, and to the
procedural history. Of course, it is the allegations of
wrongdoing against Mr. Schweneke which are in dispute and were
not the subject of sworn evidence on the motion, subject to the
fresh evidence which Ontario seeks to file on the appeal.
[6]  The facts set out below are based on the pleadings together
with the evidence filed on the motion and the reasons of the
motions judge.</pre>
    <pre>FACTS
</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The appellant was employed by the Ontario Ministry of
Education from before 1980. He was posted in Germany where he
developed and ran seminars and language programs for students and
teachers until 1990, except for a period in 1981-1982. Ontario
states that in 1982 it was party to an agreement with Mr.
Schweneke and a German government funded institution known as the
Institut(e) for Auslandsbeziehungen (the IFA) whereunder the
appellant was to be seconded to the IFA for two years. However,
Ontario alleges that without its knowledge, the appellant became
a full-time employee of both Ontario and the IFA and received
double compensation including salary, benefits and expenses from
1982 to 1990. The IFA also ran similar seminars to the ones for
which the appellant was responsible on behalf of Ontario.
[8]  The appellant&#146;s position is that he was seconded to the IFA
for three years (1982-1985) and all financial accounting between
the parties in respect of the secondment arrangements was regular
and accepted by Ontario. After that Ontario elected to rent space
for the appellant in the IFA Stuttgart office. He denied that
there was any irregularity in his expense claims.
[9]  In 1985 the appellant began to work for both the Ontario
Ministry of Education and the Ontario Ministry of
Intergovernmental Affairs and was moved first to Frankfurt, then
to Stuttgart. In the spring of 1990, the appellant was
investigated by the German authorities in connection with an
audit of the IFA. This investigation included the execution of a
search warrant at Ontario&#146;s Stuttgart office. Ultimately in
August an arrest warrant was issued for the appellant in Germany
for fraud in respect of the operation of the IFA.
[10] At the same time the appellant asked Ontario for
compassionate leave to return to Canada because his father was
ill. He refused to return to Germany thereafter. Ontario learned
of the German investigation and suspended the appellant without
pay on September 25, 1990, without pay while it conducted its own
investigation. Ontario retained Price Waterhouse to prepare a
report which it received on October 16, 1990. Ultimately the
appellant resigned on July 12, 1991. The pleadings reveal a
dispute between the parties as to whether Ontario offered the
appellant the opportunity for a hearing under the Public Service
Act8 and whether Ontario made full disclosure to the appellant in
order for him to participate fully in that hearing.
[11] In July, 1992 Ontario charged the appellant with three
counts of fraud by collecting double salary and expenses as an
employee of IFA while he was also an employee of Ontario. The
appellant was discharged on all three charges after a preliminary
inquiry in April 1993.
[12] The Statement of Claim in this matter was issued on October
20, 1993, against Ontario and certain individuals in the
Ministries of Education, Intergovernmental Affairs and the
Attorney General claiming damages for constructive dismissal and
for malicious prosecution, conspiracy to injure and negligent
prosecution. The Statement of Defence and Counterclaim is dated
March 24, 1995. The counterclaim seeks an accounting of all
profits from double employment. The Statement of Defence and
Counterclaim makes no reference to issue estoppel or to the
appellant&#146;s application for unemployment insurance benefits.
[13] The respondent brought this motion in July 1995. The
appellant responded with his cross-motion together with a Reply
and Defence to Counterclaim pleading dated October 18, 1995. It
is in that pleading that the appellant responds to the
allegations concerning his double employment. We have already
referred above to the position he takes on the issue.
[14] Nowhere in any of the pleadings is there reference to
unemployment insurance.
[15] It appears that the appellant applied for unemployment
insurance following his resignation and that his application was
allowed. The first document in the supplementary motion record is
a letter dated January 30, 1992, from the Clerk of the Board of
Referees to the appellant informing him that the Ministry of
Education had appealed to the Board in respect of his claim and
setting a hearing date for February 26, 1992. The decision of the
Board bears that date. The text of the decision reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          The  Commission allowed Mr.  Schweneke&#146;s
          claim    for    Unemployment   Insurance
          benefits  and  it is their opinion  that
          the claimant did not lose his employment
          by   reason   of  his  own   misconduct,
          pursuant   to   Section   28   of    the
          Unemployment Insurance Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The    employer    is   appealing    the
          Commission&#146;s decision.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  claimant attended the hearing.  The
          representative  of  the  employer,   Kim
          Twohig,  was  present  via  a  telephone
          hearing  at the C.E.C. 3505, 4th  floor,
          2221   Young   [sic]  Street,   Toronto,
          Ontario.  The hearing was taped.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Facts
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  Board reviewed the extensive  facts
          submitted  by  both  parties  but   gave
          particular attention to the third  party
          submission of Price Waterhouse.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The Unemployment Insurance Commission at
          the  time of allowing the appeal was not
          in receipt of all the documentation that
          was available to the Board of Referees.
          </pre>
    <pre>          The   Board   conducted  a  hearing   by
          telephone  with Ms. Kim Twohig  and  the
          claimant was present.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  reviewing  all the  submissions  the
          Board  gave strong emphasis to the Price
          Waterhouse report in Exhibit 20  (Volume
          1) Table 9.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Decision:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The  Board  allows  the  appeal  of  the
          employer.    The  Board   recommends   a
          disqualification period of 12 weeks  for
          misconduct.
          
[16] By letter of April 15, 1992 the appellant appealed the
Board&#146;s decision to the Umpire. On September 29, 1994, the Umpire
upheld the decision of the Board.
[17] The Umpire heard from Mr. Schweneke (either by way of
evidence or submissions or both) and had the Price Waterhouse
Report. He noted that the Report detailed the receipt by the
appellant of DM 52,080,68 from the German government, that
Ontario alleged that he received the equivalent amount from it in
Canadian funds, and that the appellant denied that he had worked
for both governments full-time and that he had received duplicate
expense reimbursements. The report itself concludes only that
&#147;[t]he expenses which hence appear to have been collected twice
by Mr. Schweneke during this period amount to DM 52,080,68&#133;.&#148;
(emphasis added)
[18] The issue before the Umpire was whether the Board made an
error of law or an egregious error on the facts in determining
whether the appellant was guilty of misconduct which would
disqualify him from receiving benefits under the Act. The
relevant subsection was 28(1) which read as follows:</pre>
    <pre>          28(1)  A claimant is disqualified  from
          receiving benefits under this  Part  if
          he lost his employment by reason of his
          own  misconduct  or if  he  voluntarily
          left his employment without just cause.
</pre>
    <pre>[19] In considering the issue of misconduct, the Umpire reviewed
s. 20(1)(c) of Reg. 881 of the Public Service Act  headed
&#147;Conflict of Interest&#148; which provides:</pre>
    <pre>          20(1)  A public servant shall not engage
          in   any   outside  work   or   business
          undertaking&#133;(c) in which his work  would
          otherwise      constitute      full-time
          employment for another person.</pre>
    <pre>Although the Umpire does not specifically refer to it, s. 20(4)
provides:</pre>
    <pre>          Contravention  of any of the  provisions
          of  subsection (1) or disregard  of  the
          provisions of subsection (2) or (3)  may
          be considered as cause for dismissal.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[20] In his decision to dismiss the appeal from the Board of
Referees, the Umpire made the following findings: first, the
employer had justification under s. 20(1)(c) to discharge the
appellant for misconduct;  second, the misconduct was that the
appellant worked from 1985 to 1990 for both the Ontario and the
German governments and he received money for travel expenses from
both as set out in the Price Waterhouse Report.</pre>
    <pre>THE FINDINGS OF THE JUDGE ON THE MOTION
</pre>
    <pre>[21] The motion judge set out only one question in respect of the
application of issue estoppel: &#147;Does the decision of the Umpire
pursuant to the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act
engage the principles of res judicata or issue estoppel so as to
render moot the issues raised in the plaintiff&#146;s claim for
wrongful dismissal?&#148; In the course of his analysis he referred to
the collateral issue of whether the discharge of the appellant at
the preliminary inquiry operates &#147;so as to render neutral the
principle of issue estoppel&#148;.
[22] The motion judge relied on this court&#146;s decision in Rasanen,
supra. He found that the appellant had full notice of the
hearings at the Unemployment Insurance Commission and
participated in them and that he did not seek judicial review of
the Umpire&#146;s decision so that it was final. He concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>          It  is  my opinion that the facts  found
          and   the  conclusions  reached  by  the
          Umpire  in  his  decision addressed  the
          very issue focused by the pleadings.  He
          made   conclusive   findings   of   fact
          unfavourable to the plaintiff and, prima
          facie, based upon the principle of issue
          estoppel,  those facts ought not  to  be
          relitigated.
</pre>
    <pre>[23] He further held that the appellant&#146;s discharge at his
preliminary hearing could not form the basis for issue estoppel.
          </pre>
    <pre>ISSUES
</pre>
    <pre>[24] The appellant raised the following issues on appeal:</pre>
    <pre>  1)   The decision of the Umpire should not be treated as having
       the effect of issue estoppel in this case for the following
       reasons:
       </pre>
    <pre>       a)  The  decision of the Umpire was not on the same  issue
       as  raised in this action because, based on the  case  law
       at  the  time,  the  relevant test  under  s.  28  of  the
       Unemployment  Insurance Act was only the  subjective  test
       of  whether the employer was satisfied that the misconduct
       complained of warranted dismissal.
       </pre>
    <pre>       b)   The   consequences  of  the  unemployment   insurance
       application  were  insignificant  in  comparison  to   the
       wrongful   dismissal  so  that  the  appellant  in   those
       circumstances  should  not  be  deprived   of   his   full
       opportunity to be heard in a trial.
       </pre>
    <pre>       c)  The appellant did not have an adequate opportunity  to
       present   his  case  before  the  Umpire.   He   was   not
       represented  by  counsel,  the  Price  Waterhouse   report
       formed  the  basis for the decision although  it  did  not
       reach  a  definite conclusion, nor did the appellant  have
       the   opportunity  to  cross-examine  the  author  of  the
       report.
       </pre>
    <pre>       d)  There  should be a trial because there have  been  two
       proceedings  with conflicting outcomes, neither  of  which
       should therefore govern the result of this action.
       </pre>
    <pre>  2)   Hoilett J. erred in concluding that the discharge of the
       appellant after his preliminary inquiry did not operate as
       issue estoppel  to prevent Ontario from asserting misconduct
       in employment as just cause for constructive dismissal.
       
</pre>
    <pre>ISSUE ESTOPPEL</pre>
    <pre>[25] The general principles underlying issue estoppel were
recently thoroughly reviewed in this court&#146;s decision in Minott
v. O&#146;Shanter Development Co., supra. Laskin J.A. succinctly
stated the purpose of the doctrine at p. 329: &#147;Issue estoppel
prevents the relitigation of an issue that a court or tribunal
has decided in a previous proceeding.&#148; The three requirements of
issue estoppel are: first, that the same question has been
decided; second, that the judicial decision which is said to
create the estoppel was final; third,  that the parties to the
judicial decision or their privies were the same persons as the
parties to the proceedings in which the estoppel is raised or
their privies.
[26] The appellant argues that the issue is not the same and that
the first requirement for issue estoppel is absent.
[27] The issue before the Umpire was whether the appellant lost
his employment because of misconduct as defined under s. 28 of
the Unemployment Insurance Act. The Umpire referred to the Public
Service Act and its regulations that govern civil servants
including the appellant, and determined that the appellant was
guilty of misconduct under s. 20(1)(c) of  Regulation 881.  The
misconduct was that between 1985 and 1990 he had worked for both
Ontario and for the German government and he had received money
for travel expenses from both as set out in the Price Waterhouse
Report.
[28] The issue raised by the Statement of Defence is whether
Ontario had just cause to dismiss the appellant for either a)
breach of s. 20(1)(c) i.e. engaging in work for another entity
which constituted full-time employment; or b) breach of fiduciary
duty by accepting a salary from both employers and by double
claiming expenses from Ontario and from the IFA.
[29] We agree with Hoilett J. that the Umpire made findings of
fact on the very issue that is raised between these parties, that
is, was there just cause for the constructive dismissal of the
appellant. The Umpire did not, as in Minott, merely come to a
legal conclusion that there was misconduct. He found what the
misconduct was and that it constituted a statutory ground for the
appellant&#146;s dismissal. The same statutory ground is pleaded in
this action. However, to the extent that the pleadings raise
issues such as failure of Ontario to hold a hearing under the
Public Service Act, or issues of mitigating considerations, such
issues would not be barred by estoppel.
[30] There is no merit to the appellant&#146;s submission that the
Umpire applied a subjective test of whether the employer believed
there was misconduct, based on the case of Canada v. Jewell.9
The reasons of the Umpire disclose no reference to a subjective
test or to the Jewell case. He reviews several cases on the
meaning of misconduct, then concludes that the onus is on the
employer to prove that misconduct &#147;in fact existed&#148;.
[31] There is no issue raised as to the finality of the Umpire&#146;s
decision, or as to the parties to the decision. We therefore
conclude that the three tests for issue estoppel have been met in
respect of the decision of the Umpire. However, that does not end
the role of the court.
[32] In Minott, this court held that a court always retains a
discretion to refuse to apply issue estoppel &#147;when to do so would
cause unfairness or work an injustice.&#148; Although the appellant
has not based his argument on the exercise of an overriding
discretion to prevent unfairness, the three submissions of the
appellant, 1)b) &#150;d) reflect the basis upon which that discretion
could be exercised in this case.
[33] Before turning to that issue, however, the appellant has
raised the question whether the discharge after a preliminary
inquiry can also have the effect of issue estoppel.
[34] The first question is, did the preliminary inquiry decide
the same issue as is raised in this action, is it a final
judgment, and did it involve the same parties or their privies?
Paragraph 548(1)(b) of the Criminal Code10 prescribes the role of
a judge on a preliminary inquiry in respect of a discharge:
</pre>
    <pre>            548(1) When all the evidence has been taken by the
            justice, he shall</pre>
    <pre>               (b)  discharge the accused,  if  in  his
               opinion on the whole of the  evidence no
               sufficient case is made out to  put  the
               accused on trial for the offence charged
               or   any  other  indictable  offence  in
               respect of the same transaction.</pre>
    <pre>[35] The role of a preliminary inquiry judge is not to make any
findings of fact, but only to determine if the Crown has led
sufficient evidence which could, if accepted, result in a
conviction.11  Therefore the only issue on the preliminary inquiry
was whether there was sufficient evidence presented to bind the
accused over for trial. The fact that the evidence led was
determined not to be sufficient does not amount to a finding that
the appellant did not collect double salary or expenses. It is
only a finding that the evidence led, even if accepted, would not
be sufficient to prove that he did. Therefore the effect of the
discharge was not to decide the same issue as the issues in this
civil action.
[36] Because the issue was not the same, it becomes unnecessary
to consider the 2nd and 3rd tests of finality and identity of the
parties.</pre>
    <pre>THE APPLICATION OF ISSUE ESTOPPEL IN THIS CASE</pre>
    <pre>[37] Persons who lose their jobs may have resort to various
tribunals empowered to grant various forms of statutory relief.
Those same persons may also have a common law action for wrongful
dismissal.  Recent case law accepts that a finding by one of the
various tribunals from whom an employee may seek redress may
support an issue estoppel claim in the subsequent wrongful
dismissal litigation.12 The case law also recognizes that the
mechanistic application of the doctrine to findings made by those
tribunals may result in an injustice in the subsequent civil
litigation.  The proceedings before the tribunals are summary in
nature and designed to provide a speedy resolution to specific,
relatively modest statutory claims.  An automatic application of
issue estoppel where the conditions precedent for its operation
exist in civil proceedings where procedural rights are much more
elaborate and the stakes potentially much higher, raises
legitimate fairness concerns.  The discretion to decline to give
effect to issue estoppel in subsequent civil proceedings protects
against injustices that may arise in specific cases.13
[38] The discretion to refuse to give effect to issue estoppel
becomes relevant only where the three prerequisites to the
operation of the doctrine exist.  The party relying on the
doctrine has the burden of establishing those prerequisites.  The
exercise of the discretion is necessarily case specific and
depends on the entirety of the circumstances.  In exercising the
discretion the court must ask &#150; is there something in the
circumstances of this case such that the usual operation of the
doctrine of issue estoppel would work an injustice?  The party
seeking to invoke the discretion has the burden of demonstrating
that injustice.
[39] Although resort to the discretion described above may be
particularly useful where the finding relied on was made by a
tribunal whose procedures are adapted for the speedy resolution
of specific claims, the discretion cannot be so broad as to
preclude the operation of the doctrine of issue estoppel to
findings made by those tribunals.  The discretion cannot swallow
whole the rule that makes the doctrine applicable to findings
made by tribunals whose processes, although judicial, are less
elaborate than those employed in civil litigation. For example,
some tribunals do not routinely allow cross-examination of
witnesses.  Findings made by those tribunals may nevertheless be
judicial findings for the purposes of the application of issue
estoppel.  If the discretion to refuse to apply the doctrine is
to be exercised whenever there was no cross-examination at the
tribunal,  the discretion will effectively have overtaken the
rule that findings of fact made by such tribunals can provide the
basis for the application of the doctrine.
[40] In our view, it is not enough that a party resisting issue
estoppel demonstrate that the process leading to the finding did
not provide the full panoply of procedural protections available
in civil litigation.  The party must go further and show that in
the circumstances of the particular case shortcomings in the
procedures of the tribunal, whose finding is relied on in support
of an issue estoppel claim, were such that it would be unjust to
give effect to that finding in subsequent civil litigation.
[41] Nor, in our opinion can a party seeking to invoke the
discretion rely on general fairness concerns which exist whenever
the finding relied on emanates from a tribunal whose procedures
are summary and whose tasks are narrower than those used and
performed by the courts.  The party must demonstrate how
unfairness actually occurred in the circumstances of the specific
case.
[42]  In Minott v. O&#146;Shanter Development Co. supra, at pp. 341-
343, Laskin J.A. identified five potential factors, that could
result in an injustice if issue estoppel was applied to a finding
of a tribunal in a subsequent action for wrongful dismissal.  We
agree  with his observations.  However, before these factors can
provide the basis for the exercise of the discretion to refuse to
apply issue estoppel it must be demonstrated that they have
application to the facts of the particular case.  For example, at
pp. 341-342, Laskin J.A. writes:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133;.  employees  apply for  benefits  when
          they  are  most vulnerable,  immediately
          after losing their job. The urgency with
          which  they must invariably seek  relief
          compromises their ability to  adequately
          put  forward their case for benefits  or
          to respond to the case against them: &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          Applying  issue estoppel  may  therefore
          cause  real  injustice to  an  aggrieved
          employee.

</pre>
    <pre>[43] In our view, a party seeking to invoke the discretion cannot
simply rely on the potential for the kind of injustice described
in the above quoted passage from Minott but must demonstrate that
the situation described in that passage actually arose in the
particular case.  The discretion must respond to the realities of
each case and not to abstract concerns that arise in virtually
every case where the finding relied on to support the doctrine
was made by a tribunal and not a court.
[44] We turn now to this record.  Does it demonstrate that an
injustice would occur if issue estoppel were applied to the
finding of the tribunal?  We will first consider the record apart
from the discharge of the appellant at his preliminary inquiry in
April 1993 and without regard to the fresh evidence submitted on
appeal by the respondent.
[45] The appellant&#146;s employment ended on July 11, 1991.  He
successfully applied to the Compensation Insurance Commission for
unemployment insurance benefits.  His employer (the Ministry of
Education) appealed that determination to the Board of Referees
(the Board).  The appellant received notice of that appeal by
letter dated January 30, 1992.  The letter said in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>          You  and/or your representative have the
          right to be present at hearing.  If  you
          have  information you feel could  affect
          the  decision made on this claim  or  if
          you  are  unclear about how to  proceed,
          please  contact  the  person  identified
          below  within  five days of  receipt  of
          this letter:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Clerk  of the Board of Referees at  666-
          6327.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Please be advised that this hearing will
          proceed  as scheduled, even  if  you  or
          your  representative  do  not  wish   to
          attend.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[46] The Board held a hearing on February 26, 1992.  The
appellant was present and a representative of the employer was
present via the telephone.  According to the Board&#146;s reasons,
both parties submitted &#147;extensive facts&#148;, including a report from
Price Waterhouse.  The Board allowed the appeal and recommended
that the appellant be disqualified from receiving unemployment
insurance benefits for a period of twelve weeks by virtue of his
&#147;misconduct&#148;.  The Board relied on the Price Waterhouse report
but did not specify the nature of the misconduct.
[47] By notice of appeal dated February 26, 1992, the appellant
appealed the Board&#146;s findings to the Umpire.  He alleged that the
Board made errors in fact and law.  The appellant did not
contend, although he was entitled to do so under the operative
statutory provisions, that the Board had failed to observe the
appropriate standards of procedural fairness.
[48] By letter dated April 15, 1992, the appellant set out his
complaints with respect to the decision of the Board.  He raised
several objections to the Price Waterhouse report including:
</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre> the allegations in the report were untrue.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> the conclusions in the report were matters of interpretation
 and not findings of fact.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> the documents relied on in the report did not substantiate
 the figures  in the report and did not substantiate the
 conclusions in the report.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> the Board was in no position to verify the allegation in the
 report.
</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[49] The appellant&#146;s letter indicates that as of April 1992, he
was fully aware of the contents of the Price Waterhouse report
and had access to the documents relied on by those who prepared
the report.  He was able to make very specific submissions as to
the alleged failings of the report.
[50] By letter date stamped May 25, 1992, the appellant was
advised of the following on behalf of the Umpire:
</pre>
    <pre>          With  reference to your  appeal  to  the
          Umpire from the decision of the Board of
          Referees given at Vancouver, B.C. on  26
          February  1992 in connection  with  your
          claim  for benefit, I enclose a copy  of
          the material which is being submitted to
          the Umpire.
          </pre>
    <pre>          You or your representatives, as well  as
          any  person  or  association  having  an
          immediate interest in the decision,  may
          file  a  statement  of  observations  or
          representations for consideration by the
          Umpire.   Such statement of observations
          should  be filed at the local office  of
          the  Commission  where  the  appeal  was
          filed within fifteen days of the date of
          this  letter  for  transmission  to  the
          Umpire.
          </pre>
    <pre>          As  an  oral hearing has been  requested
          you will be advised by the Registrar  of
          the  Umpire of the time and place of the
          hearing.  [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[51] The appellant commenced this action in October 1993, while
his appeal to the Umpire was pending.
[52] The hearing before the Umpire was initially scheduled for
April 20, 1994.  It was adjourned at the request of counsel for
the appellant and rescheduled for September 13, 1994.  The
hearing before the Umpire (A. H. Hollingsworth, Q.C.) eventually
took place on September 29, 1994.  The appellant, who had been
represented by counsel earlier when he obtained the adjournment
in April, appeared without counsel before the Umpire.  He made
submissions and filed additional material before the Umpire.  The
employer was also represented.
[53] The appellant was advised of the Umpire&#146;s decision in
January of 1995.  The letter said:

          The  decision of the umpire on an appeal
          from a decision of a board of referee is
          final  and,  except for judicial  review
          under  the  Federal Court  Act,  is  not
          subject  to appeal to or review  by  any
          court.   On  new  facts,  however,   the
          umpire may rescind or amend his decision
          (s. 86 of the Act).
</pre>
    <pre>[54] The appellant took no steps to challenge the decision of the
Umpire.
[55] The Umpire upheld the decision of the Board.  He gave
extensive reasons for doing so and made express findings.  His
reasons included the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I exercise my powers under Section 81 of
          the  Act to give the decision the  Board
          of  Referees should have given.  I  make
          findings    that   the   employer    had
          justification under Section 20(1)(c)  of
          Regulation  881  of the  Public  Service
          Act,  Revised Statutes of Ontario, 1980,
          Chapter  418  to discharge the  claimant
          for  misconduct,  the  misconduct  being
          that the claimant worked from the period
          of  1985  to  1990 for both the  Ontario
          government and the German government and
          also   that   he  received   money   for
          travelling   expenses  from   both   the
          Ontario   government  and   the   German
          government.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[56] The appellant knew no later than February 1992 that the
Ministry was alleging that he had worked full-time for another
employer while employed by the Ministry and that he had cheated
the Ministry by claiming expenses which he also claimed from the
other employer.  The appellant knew that if either allegation was
substantiated his dismissal was justified.  The appellant
appeared before the Board and had a full opportunity to present
his version of events.  He made extensive submissions to the
Board and put factual material before the Board.
[57] The appellant appealed the Board&#146;s finding setting out in
some detail his reasons for challenging that finding.  It is
clear from his correspondence that he appreciated the contents of
the Price Waterhouse report and was able to make specific
submissions about the reliability of that report and the
inappropriateness of relying on that report.  The appellant
received all of the material that had been forwarded to the
Umpire in May of 1992.  He had almost 2 ½ years to prepare for
the hearing before the Umpire.  He had counsel for part of that
time.  Counsel did not appear before the Board or Umpire but
there was nothing to suggest that counsel could not have appeared
had the appellant elected to have counsel.
[58] When the appellant appeared before the Umpire he made
submissions and placed additional material before the Umpire.
There was nothing to prevent him from placing whatever additional
material before the Umpire he thought was appropriate and
necessary to support his position. He could have placed whatever
material he thought appropriate before the Umpire to demonstrate
that the Price Waterhouse report should not be relied on by the
Umpire.  It is also noteworthy that the appellant had commenced
this action about a year prior to the hearing before the Umpire.
It is fair to assume that preparation for this action would also
have involved the preparation of an effective response to the
Price Waterhouse report.
[59] The appellant knew exactly the case he had to meet before
the Board and the Umpire, had every opportunity to present his
case and, in fact, did so before both the Board and the Umpire.
The absence of various procedural mechanisms (eg. discovery,
cross-examination of witnesses) in the summary procedure followed
by the Board and the Referee have not been shown to have worked
any injustice in this case.
[60] Nor can the appellant claim that the urgency of his
circumstances or financial pressures precluded him from properly
putting his case forward before the Board or the Umpire.  He made
no such claim in response to this motion, no doubt because almost
2 ½  years passed between the initiation of his appeal to the
Umpire and the hearing of the appeal.  The appellant was
represented by counsel for part of that time and had all of the
pertinent information.
[61] In Minott v. O&#146;Shanter Development Co. Ltd. supra, Laskin
J.A. also indicates that the expertise or lack thereof of a
tribunal may be relevant in determining whether issue estoppel
should be applied to findings made by that tribunal. That factor
is neutral in this case.  The findings of misconduct made by the
Referee are not findings for which any special expertise was
needed.  It cannot be said that either the Referee or a court
would be better suited to make those findings.
[62] One of the factors identified by Laskin J.A. in Minott v.
O&#146;Shanter Developments Co. Ltd. supra, at p. 342, does operate in
favour of the appellant. The financial stakes involved in the
proceedings before the Board and the Umpire were significantly
less than those involved in the suit initiated by the appellant.
That factor may support a refusal to apply the doctrine of issue
estoppel.  It is, however, the only factor operating in favour of
the appellant.  Standing alone it cannot justify a refusal to
apply the doctrine.  It will almost inevitably be the case that
the stakes in civil proceedings are much higher.  If that factor
alone justified the refusal to apply the doctrine then one would
be driven to the position that issue estoppel cannot be applied
to findings of fact made by tribunals like the Board or the
Umpire.  The law in this province is to the contrary.
[63] Setting aside for the moment, the results of the preliminary
inquiry and the fresh evidence tendered by the respondent, the
appellant has not made out a case for the exercise of the
discretion to refuse to apply issue estoppel.</pre>
    <pre>EFFECT OF THE DISCHARGE AFTER THE PRELIMINARY INQUIRY
</pre>
    <pre>[64] We turn next to the effect of the appellant&#146;s discharge at
the preliminary inquiry.  The appellant faced three charges at
the preliminary inquiry.  Counts one and two alleged that he
defrauded the Ministry of Education by falsely representing that
he was engaged in employment only with the Government of Ontario.
Count three alleged that he defrauded the Government of Ontario
by obtaining reimbursement for expenses from the Government of
Ontario and from a German entity.  He was discharged on count
three when the Crown failed to adduce admissible evidence of
expenses paid by the German entity.  He was discharged on counts
one and two when according to the preliminary inquiry judge the
Crown failed to prove the elements of fraud or false pretences.
[65] The outcome of the preliminary inquiry has no relevance in
the exercise of the discretion to refuse to apply the doctrine of
issue estoppel.  The discharge at the preliminary inquiry says no
more than that the Crown had failed to put forward a prima facie
case of criminal fraud.  It does not, in our view, say anything
about whether the appellant was in fact working for both the
Ontario Government and a German entity at the same time.  The
discharge at the preliminary inquiry does not detract from the
findings of fact made by the Umpire.  The outcome of the
preliminary inquiry should have no effect on the applicability of
issue estoppel arising out of the findings made by the Board and
the Umpire.
</pre>
    <pre>THE FRESH EVIDENCE TENDERED BY THE RESPONDENT</pre>
    <pre>[66] As we would dismiss the appeal on the record, it is
unnecessary for us to address the fresh evidence tendered by the
respondent.  We will, however, do so.
[67] The fresh evidence indicates that the German authorities
charged the respondent with fraud arising out of his business
dealings in Germany between 1986 and 1990.  The frauds were
alleged to have been perpetrated against various German agencies.
In September 1996, after the motion was heard before Hoilett J.,
the appellant pleaded guilty in Germany to numerous fraud
charges.  The fresh evidence consists  of a certified copy of the
decision of the German court and a certified English translation
of that decision.
[68] In its reasons for judgment and sentence the German court
said:</pre>
    <pre>          &#133;  On 20 September 1985, the accused was
          posted from Canada to Frankfurt as  Head
          of  the  Ontario Office.  He  worked  in
          this  position  until he  was  appointed
          Head  of  the  new  Ontario  Office   in
          Stuttgart in 1989.  Simultaneously,  the
          accused  continued to work for  the  IFA
          after  20  September 1985, initially  in
          his  original function as  Head  of  the
          North America Department and, from  1989
          on,   as   Head  of  Working  Group   IV
          (Information and Public Relations)&#133;.
          
</pre>
    <pre>[69] There is nothing in the fresh evidence to indicate whether
the appellant admitted that he was working simultaneously for the
Ontario Government and the German agency in the proceedings
before the German court.  Nor, if he did not make any such
admission, is there any indication of the basis upon which the
German Court made that finding.  Furthermore, the above quoted
passage from the reasons of the German Court is found in Part I
of the reasons in which  the Court set out background information
as a prelude to its detailed consideration of the actual
transactions giving rise to the fraud charges.
[70] If the fresh evidence demonstrated that the appellant had
admitted working for both the Ontario Government and German
agencies in the proceedings in the German Court, or if the basis
for the finding made by the German Court was evident from the
fresh evidence, or if the finding was central to the verdicts
reached by the German Court, then it would have told strongly
against the appellant&#146;s contention that it would be unfair to
apply the doctrine of issue estoppel against him. However, on the
basis of this fresh evidence we cannot find that the appellant
made any such admission or that his simultaneous employment by
the Ontario Government and German entities was material to the
proceedings before the German court.  Absent anything beyond the
reasons of the Court, we would not be prepared to hold that the
unexplained finding of the German Court on a preliminary matter
should be weighed against the appellant in determining whether
the dictates of fairness required that the doctrine of issue
estoppel not be applied against him.


DISPOSITION
</pre>
    <pre>[71] We would dismiss the appeal with costs.
