    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Judge B. MacPhee dated March 23, 1999

MACPHERSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>Introduction</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   Thousands of store owners and operators throughout  Ontario
sell  cigarettes to customers.  The legal issue presented by this
appeal  is  of genuine practical consequence to them.  The  issue
is:  what  is  the  responsibility in law  of  store  owners  and
operators with respect to the sale of cigarettes to young people?
Specifically, what forms of identification may a vendor accept to
verify that a potential customer is legally permitted to purchase
cigarettes?


A.   Factual Background
     </pre>
    <pre>(1)  The parties and the events
     </pre>
    <pre>[2]   At about 3:40 p.m. on August 13, 1997, Raymond Gervais went
to  Seaway Gas &amp; Fuel Ltd. (&#147;Seaway&#148;), a small gas bar and  store
in  Cornwall, to buy cigarettes.  Raymond was born on  March  26,
1981.   Accordingly,  he was 16 years old  and  was  not  legally
permitted to purchase cigarettes.</pre>
    <pre>[3]    Mrs.   Param   Phambri,   the   store   clerk,   requested
identification.     Raymond   produced   a    laminated    school
identification  card with writing at the top  indicating  Conseil
Scolaire  Public de Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry Public  School
Board.  The card also contained the school&#146;s logo or insignia and
a  recent photograph of Raymond with a date of birth of March 26,
1978  (thus establishing, it appeared, that he was 19  years  old
which is the legal age for purchasing cigarettes).</pre>
    <pre>[4]    Mrs.  Phambri  sold  a  package  of  DuMaurier  King  Size
cigarettes  to Raymond.  He departed the store and rode  away  on
his bicycle.  Two provincial offences officers, Inspectors Robert
Gilchrist  and Yves Decoste, had been conducting surveillance  on
Seaway.   They stopped Raymond a few blocks from the  store.   He
provided  the inspectors with his proper name and address.   When
asked about his date of birth, Raymond replied truthfully &#150; March
26,  1981.   Raymond  admitted  to the  inspectors  that  he  had
purchased cigarettes at Seaway and that he had produced a student
card  as  identification.  Raymond had himself prepared the  card
with its false birth date, March 26, 1978, with the assistance of
his computer.</pre>
    <pre>[5]   Later  the  same  day,  Inspectors  Gilchrist  and  Decoste
proceeded  to Seaway.  They questioned Mrs. Phambri  and  advised
her  that  she  was being charged under the Tobacco Control  Act,
S.O.  1994, c. 10, with selling tobacco products to someone under
the age of 19.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   Mrs. Phambri called her husband Kulwant Phambri, the  owner
and  president of Seaway.  He came to the store.  The  inspectors
informed him that charges would be laid against both Seaway,  the
corporate entity, and Mrs. Phambri, the store clerk who made  the
sale.
</pre>
    <pre>(2)  The litigation</pre>
    <pre>     
[7]   The  charges against Seaway and Mrs. Phambri  proceeded  to
trial  on March 18, 1998 before Her Worship Justice of the  Peace
Louise  Rozon.   Seaway  and  Mrs.  Phambri  were  charged   with
violating  s. 3(1) of the Tobacco Control Act which provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>          3. (1)    No person shall sell or supply
               tobacco  to  a person who  is  less
               than 19 years old.</pre>
    <pre>[8]   On  June  2, 1998, Justice of the Peace Rozon rendered  her
decision.  She dismissed the charges against both Seaway and Mrs.
Phambri.  In reaching this conclusion, the trial judge considered
s.  3(3) of the Tobacco Control Act and a regulation dealing with
forms of identification under the Act.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  Section 3(3) of the Act provides a defence to a charge under
s. 3(1).  It provides, in part:

            3. (3)     It is a defence to a charge
                 under  subsection (1) &#133; that  the
                 defendant  believed  the   person
                 receiving the tobacco  to  be  at
                 least  19  years old because  the
                 person   produced  a   prescribed
                 form  of  identification  showing
                 his  or her age and there was  no
                 apparent  reason  to  doubt   the
                 authenticity of the  document  or
                 that  it was issued to the person
                 producing it.
</pre>
    <pre>[10] Referring to the words in the bottom half of this provision,
the  trial  judge  found  that Mrs. Phambri  was  diligent  about
seeking   identification  from  Raymond  Gervais  and  that   the
identification appeared to be authentic:</pre>
    <pre>          The   identification   produced   is   a
          laminated public school board card  with
          photo,  name,  and date of  birth.   The
          card   does  not  appear  to  have  been
          tampered with, i.e. date of birth.
          </pre>
    <pre>          
[11]  The  trial  judge  recognized that this  did  not  end  the
inquiry.   Raymond  Gervais had produced a school  identification
card when asked for proof of age.  Was this &#145;a prescribed form of
identification&#146; within s. 3(3) of the Act?  On that question,  it
was  necessary  for  the  trial judge to  consider  a  regulation
promulgated under the Tobacco Control Act, namely O. Reg. 613/94:
           </pre>
    <pre>	1.   The following forms of identification are 
	     prescribed for the purposes of subsection 3(3)
	     of the Act:
               </pre>
    <pre>		1.   A driver&#146;s licence issued by the Province
		     of Ontario with a photograph of the person
		     to whom the licence is issued.</pre>
    <pre>		2.   A Canadian passport.</pre>
    <pre>		3.   A Canadian citizenship card with a 
	             photograph to whom the card is issued.</pre>
    <pre>		4.   A Canadian Armed Forces identification card.</pre>
    <pre>		5.   A photo card issued by the Liquor Licence 
		     Board of Ontario.
                    
</pre>
    <pre>[12] In interpreting this provision, the trial judge considered a
number of factors.  She examined the dictionary definition of the
word &#145;prescribed&#146;.  She also discussed the difficulty non-Ontario
customers would have in places like Cornwall (which is very close
to  both  Quebec  and New York state) if they  were  required  to
produce  one  of  the  prescribed forms  of  identification.   In
addition, she referred to s. 13 of the regulation which  required
retailers  to  post signs informing customers  of  the  forms  of
identification &#147;that may &#133; be produced under subsection 3 (3)  of
the  Act.&#148; [Emphasis is trial judge&#146;s.]  Finally, the trial judge
noted  that s. 13 of the regulation requires stores to post signs
listing   the  five  forms  of  identification,  but   with   the
introductory words &#147;Acceptable I.D.&#148;; in her view,  if  only  the
five  forms  of identification set out in s. 1 of the  regulation
were  permitted,  the regulation would have said &#147;The  acceptable
I.D.&#148; or &#147;Only acceptable I.D.&#148; [Emphasis is trial judge&#146;s.]</pre>
    <pre>[13]  Taking  these  considerations  together,  the  trial  judge
reached the conclusion:
          </pre>
    <pre>          I  am  satisfied that Ontario Regulation
          613/94  is  a  guide to be followed  and
          other forms of I.D. may be presented.
          
</pre>
    <pre>Since she found that Mrs. Phambri had exercised due diligence  in
requesting  identification, and that the identification  produced
seemed  to  be authentic as to both the person and his  age,  she
dismissed the charges against Seaway and Mrs. Phambri.</pre>
    <pre>[14]  The  Crown  appealed.  The appeal was  heard  by  Judge  B.
MacPhee of the Ontario Court of Justice (Provincial Division)  in
Cornwall  on  February 3, 1999.  On March 23,  1999,  the  appeal
judge rendered his decision, dismissing the appeal.  On the legal
issue of whether the five forms of identification set out in s. 1
of   the   regulation  was  an  exhaustive  list  of   acceptable
identification,  the appeal judge agreed with the  trial  judge&#146;s
negative answer.  He said:</pre>
    <pre>          I  see  no error in the Justice  of  the
          Peace&#146;s  assessment  of  s.  13  of  the
          regulation as it affects s.  1  of   the
          regs. and thereby s. 3(3) of the Act.  &#133;
          The   Tobacco   Control  Act   and   its
          regulations  as drafted, allow  for  the
          proof    of    age   through    credible
          documentation other than that listed  in
          the regulations.
          </pre>
    <pre>[15]  The  Crown sought leave to appeal Judge MacPhee&#146;s decision.
Pursuant  to s. 139 of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O.  1990,
c.P. 33, Rosenberg J.A. granted leave on June 4, 1999.</pre>
    <pre>B.   Issue
</pre>
    <pre>[16] There is a single legal issue in this appeal.  What are  the
acceptable forms of identification that a customer may show to  a
store  operator who challenges his or her capacity, in  terms  of
age,  to  purchase  cigarettes?  Or, put another  way,  is  it  a
defence  to  a  charge under s. 3(1) of the Tobacco  Control  Act
(selling  tobacco  products to underage persons)  for  the  store
operator  to  establish  that  he  or  she  reviewed  a  form  of
identification, but not one listed in s. 1 of O. Reg. 613/94?</pre>
    <pre>C.   Analysis
</pre>
    <pre>[17] My starting point is the same as that of both parties.   The
Tobacco  Control  Act (&#147;the Act&#148;) is a regulatory  statute  which
creates  strict liability offences; the offences come within  the
middle  category  of  offences set  out  by  Dickson  J.  in  his
important  and  innovative decision in R. v. City of  Sault  Ste.
Marie,  [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299.  Dickson J. described this category
of  offence,  and  its consequences for both the  Crown  and  the
accused, in this fashion, at p. 1326:

           2.   Offences  in  which  there  is  no
             necessity  for  the  prosecution   to
             prove the existence of mens rea;  the
             doing  of  the prohibited  act  prima
             facie  imports  the offence,  leaving
             it  open  to  the  accused  to  avoid
             liability  by  proving that  he  took
             all  reasonable care.  This  involves
             consideration  of what  a  reasonable
             man    would   have   done   in   the
             circumstances.  The defence  will  be
             available  if the accused  reasonably
             believed  in a mistaken set of  facts
             which, if true, would render the  act
             or  omission innocent, or if he  took
             all  reasonable steps  to  avoid  the
             particular  event.   These   offences
             may  properly be called  offences  of
             strict liability.
</pre>
    <pre>[18] Section 3(1) of the Act, which prohibits the sale of tobacco
to  a person who is less than 19 years old, is a strict liability
offence.   Thus,  in  Dickson  J.&#146;s  words,  &#147;the  doing  of  the
prohibited  act prima facie imports the offence.&#148;   There  is  no
dispute  in the present case that the respondents, the store  and
its clerk, sold cigarettes to a person less than 19 years old.</pre>
    <pre>[19]  However,  a  strict liability offence is  not  an  absolute
liability  offence: this is the fundamental lesson of Sault  Ste.
Marie.   There  is  a  balancing of factors in  strict  liability
offences.  On the one side, an absence of mens rea to commit  the
offence does not assist the accused.  On the other side, however,
the  accused  can,  in  Dickson J.&#146;s words, &#147;avoid  liability  by
proving  that he took all reasonable care&#148;.  This is  the  common
law statement of the defence of due diligence.</pre>
    <pre>[20]  In  the present case, however, the Ontario legislature  has
attempted to define the contents of the due diligence defence  in
respect  of  the  offence of selling tobacco  products  to  young
people.   In  effect,  the legislature has provided  a  statutory
definition  of  what constitutes &#145;all reasonable care&#146;  for  this
offence.   The legislature has done this in s. 3 (3) of  the  Act
which, for ease of reference, I set out again:</pre>
    <pre>          3. (3)     It  is a defence to a  charge
               under  subsection (1)  &#133;  that  the
               defendant   believed   the   person
               receiving  the  tobacco  to  be  at
               least  19  years  old  because  the
               person  produced a prescribed  form
               of  identification showing  his  or
               her  age  and there was no apparent
               reason to doubt the authenticity of
               the  document or that it was issued
               to the person producing it.
</pre>
    <pre>[21]  It  can  be  seen that there are three components  to  this
statutory  defence: the defendant believed the  person  receiving
the  tobacco  was at least 19 years old because  (1)  the  person
produced a prescribed form of identification showing his  or  her
age;  (2)  there was no apparent reason to doubt the authenticity
of  the  document; and (3) there was no apparent reason to  doubt
that  the  document was issued to the person presenting  it.  The
respondents do not challenge the power of the legislature both to
create  a strict liability offence and to provide a due diligence
defence.   Nor does the respondent suggest that there is anything
unreasonable  about  the contents of the  due  diligence  defence
established  by  s.  3(3) of the Act.  Accordingly,  the  crucial
issue on this appeal is the interpretation of this provision.</pre>
    <pre>[22] In the present appeal, there is no issue with respect to (2)
and  (3).   The  trial  judge found that the  store  clerk,  Mrs.
Phambri,  properly  asked her customer for  identification.   The
customer, Raymond Gervais, produced a school identification  card
which  included  his name, photo and date of  birth.   The  trial
judge  found:  &#147;The  card does not appear to have  been  tampered
with, i.e. date of birth.&#148;  Moreover, the photo on the card was a
picture of her customer.  Accordingly, the trial judge held  that
there was no apparent reason for Mrs. Phambri to doubt either the
authenticity of the card or the identity of the person  producing
it.   The Crown does not quarrel with these aspects of the  trial
judge&#146;s decision.</pre>
    <pre>[23]  The real issue is precisely the one identified by the trial
judge in her reasons: &#147;What is an issue in the matter before this
court is whether it was  acceptable I.D.&#148;  That issue falls to be
determined  on  the  interpretation to  be  given  to  the  words
&#145;prescribed form of identification&#146; in s. 3(3) of the Act.</pre>
    <pre>[24]  By  O. Reg. 613/94, the Ontario government has defined  the
contents  of &#145;prescribed form of identification&#146;.  Section  1  of
the   regulation   states   that  &#147;[t]he   following   forms   of
identification are prescribed for the purposes of subsection 3(3)
of  the Act.&#148;  Five forms of identification are then listed &#150;  an
Ontario driver&#146;s licence with a photograph of the person to  whom
the   licence  is  issued,  a  Canadian  passport,   a   Canadian
citizenship  card including photograph, a Canadian  Armed  Forces
card,  and  a  photo card issued by the Liquor Licence  Board  of
Ontario.</pre>
    <pre>[25] In my view, subject to a minor qualification I will make  at
the  conclusion of these reasons, these five items constitute  an
exhaustive list of the forms of identification that a  vendor  of
tobacco  products may examine when deciding whether a prospective
customer  is  entitled to buy a package of cigarettes.   I  reach
this conclusion for several reasons.</pre>
    <pre>[26]  First,  the dictionary definition of the word  &#145;prescribed&#146;
suggests exclusivity and compulsion.  In her judgment, the  trial
judge stated:</pre>
    <pre>          &#147;Prescribed&#148;  not being defined  in  the
          Interpretation Act, I then verified  the
          definitions  in  the  dictionary.    The
          dictionary  definitions of  &#147;prescribed&#146;
          are as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   &#147;To set down as a direction or rule
               to be followed; to lay down the rules
	       of the law.&#148; &#150; Canadian Law Dictionary.</pre>
    <pre>          2.   &#147;To lay down as a guide, direction, or
	       rule of action.&#148; &#150; Webster&#146;s Collegiate
	       Dictionary.</pre>
    <pre>          3.   &#147;To lay down or impose authoritatively.&#148;
	       &#150; Oxford English Dictionary.
</pre>
    <pre>[27]  This is a fair selection of dictionary definitions.  Having
set  them  out  in  her reasons, the trial judge  did  not  state
explicitly  how she interpreted these definitions.  In  my  view,
the  words  &#145;rule to be followed&#146;, &#145;rule of action&#146;  and  &#145;impose
authoritatively&#146;  suggest something that is  mandatory.   In  the
context  of  s.  3(3) of the Act that means that  a  vendor  must
insist that a customer produce one of the five statutory forms of
identification.</pre>
    <pre>[28] Second, I do not think there is an inconsistency between the
words  &#146;prescribed&#146;  in  s. 3(3) of the  Act  and  s.  1  of  the
regulation  and  &#145;acceptable&#146; in s. 13(5) of the regulation.   In
The  New  Oxford  Dictionary  of English  (1998),  the  principal
definition  of the word &#145;acceptable&#146; is: &#147;able to be  agreed  on;
suitable  &#133; . adequate; satisfactory&#133;&#148; (at p. 10).  In  my  view,
this definition is consistent with the definition of &#145;prescribed&#146;
in  the  context  of the Act.  When s. 1 of the regulation  lists
five  forms of identification as &#145;prescribed&#146;, and s. 13  of  the
same  regulation  lists the same five forms of identification  as
&#145;acceptable&#146;, the two adjectives mean the same thing &#150;  a  vendor
must insist that a prospective customer produce one of them.</pre>
    <pre>[29] Third, I do not think that the word &#145;may&#146; in s. 13(1) of the
regulation  means  that  other forms  of  identification  may  be
considered  by  a  store  operator.   In  the  context  of   five
&#145;prescribed&#146;   forms  of  identification  in  s.   1   and   five
&#145;acceptable&#146; forms of identification in s. 13(5), the word  &#145;may&#146;
in s. 13(1) simply means that the customer may produce any of the
five  listed  forms  of identification, not something  completely
different.</pre>
    <pre>[30]  Fourth, I do not think that s. 3(6) of the Act assists  the
respondents.  Section 3(6) provides:</pre>
    <pre>          3. (6)   No  person  shall  present   as
              evidence   of   his   or   her   age
              identification    that    was    not
              lawfully issued to him or her.

    <pre>                  
In their factum, the respondents submit that this provision is &#147;a
logical limit to the extent of due diligence to be exercised by a
clerk or store owner.&#148;  Since it appeared to the store clerk that
the  school identification card had been lawfully issued  to  the
customer  producing it, the store clerk was justified  in  making
the sale.</pre>
    <pre>[31] I do not agree with this submission.  The purpose of s. 3(6)
is to create an offence for persons who produce a fake version of
one  of the five forms of prescribed identification.  The section
does not purport to convert other forms of identification (e.g. a
student   identification   card)   into   prescribed   forms   of
identification simply because they are authentic  and  have  been
lawfully issued to the holder by the relevant authority  (e.g.  a
school board).</pre>
    <pre>[32]  Fifth, it needs to be recalled that the Act is an important
public  health statute.  The Act and its regulations  attempt  to
regulate  in a strict and careful fashion the distribution  of  a
dangerous  product.   In RJR-Macdonald Inc. v.  Canada  (Attorney
General),  [1994]  1  S.C.R. 311, the  Supreme  Court  of  Canada
considered the federal Tobacco Products Control Act, R.S.C. 1985,
c.  14,  and some of the regulations promulgated pursuant to  it.
Referring to the general purposes of the regulations, Sopinka and
Cory JJ. said, at p. 353:
</pre>
    <pre>          These  are  clear indications  that  the
          government  passed the regulations  with
          the   intention  of  protecting   public
          health and thereby furthering the public
          good.
</pre>
    <pre>Later  in their reasons, the justices referred to &#147;the undeniable
importance of the public interest in health and in the prevention
of   the   widespread  and  serious  medical  problems   directly
attributable to smoking&#148; (at pp. 353-54).</pre>
    <pre>[33]  In  my view, this reasoning is entirely applicable  to  the
Ontario  Tobacco Control Act and suggests that the provisions  of
the Act and regulations should be interpreted with a judicial eye
firmly focussed on the public health purposes of the legislation.
One  of the most important purposes of the legislation is to make
sure that minors are not able to buy cigarettes.  The legislation
should be strictly interpreted to help achieve that purpose.</pre>
    <pre>[34]  Sixth,  I  do  not think that it is an  accident  that  the
government chose only five &#150; and five quite specific &#150;  forms  of
identification.   The  wallets of young people  are  filled  with
identification  cards  &#150; school cards, sports  team  cards,  club
membership cards, retail store cards, movie rental cards,  and  a
myriad of other types of cards.  It would be easy for a minor  to
alter  the  information, including birth date, on some  of  these
cards.   That  is what Raymond Gervais did in this case;  as  the
trial  judge  put it: &#147;Mr. Gervais admitted in evidence  that  he
prepared the I.D. on his computer.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>[35]  The five forms of identification listed in s. 1 of O.  Reg.
613/94  fall  into a different category.  They are  quite  formal
documents issued by federal and provincial authorities.  They are
not  easy to obtain; care is taken by the authorities in  issuing
them.   I  think a fair inference is that the Ontario legislature
chose these five forms of identification because it knew that the
authorities  are careful in scrutinizing the relevant information
before  they  are  issued.  In other words,  there  is  a  strong
likelihood  that  the  information on, for  example,  a  Canadian
passport or an Ontario driver&#146;s licence is accurate.</pre>
    <pre>[36]  Seventh,  the  position of Ontario merchants  is  one  that
combines  privilege  and responsibility.  The  privilege  is  the
merchant&#146;s opportunity to sell products to the public and to earn
a   profit,   or  even  to  gain  a  livelihood,  thereby.    The
responsibility  arises from the fact there is a direct  interface
or  relationship  between the merchant and  the  customer.   With
respect  to  regulated products, it is crucial that the  merchant
understand and respect the limits of its privilege to sell to the
public.   As expressed by Dickson J. in Sault Ste. Marie,  supra,
at p. 1322:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The element of control, particularly  by
          those  in  charge of business activities
          which  may endanger the public, is vital
          to promote the observance of regulations
          designed to avoid that danger.
</pre>
    <pre>[37]  Applying  this passage to the sale of tobacco  products  in
Ontario,  the  message to vendors is a simple one:  you  must  be
scrupulously  vigilant in ensuring that you do not  sell  tobacco
products  to  minors.   One of the ways  a  vendor  fulfils  this
responsibility is by insisting that a young person seeking to buy
cigarettes  is  in fact old enough to do so, as  demonstrated  by
production  of one of the five forms of identification prescribed
in the regulation.</pre>
    <pre>[38] For these reasons, I do not think that the interpretation of
s. 3(3) of the Act by the trial and appeal judges was correct.</pre>
    <pre>[39]  I  need  to make a minor qualification to the conclusion  I
have reached.  I recognize that there is at least one anomaly  in
the  legislation in this domain.  What is a store operator to  do
with   the  young  person  he  or  she  challenges  who  produces
identification from another jurisdiction that is similar  to  one
of  the  five  prescribed forms of identification in the  Ontario
regulation?   For example, must a store operator refuse  to  sell
cigarettes   to  a  challenged  young  person  who  produces   an
apparently  valid  Quebec  driver&#146;s  licence  or  United   States
passport?  This situation can arise anywhere in Ontario  but  is,
of  course, particularly prevalent in a place like Cornwall which
is very close to both Quebec and New York state.</pre>
    <pre>[40]  Moreover,  the anomaly is not limited to only  visitors  to
Ontario.   An  additional  category  would  be  current   Ontario
residents   who  possess  only  formal  documents  from   another
jurisdiction &#150; for example, a student from British Columbia, with
a  valid  British Columbia driver&#146;s licence, attending an Ontario
university.</pre>
    <pre>[41]  Section 1 of O. Reg. 613/94 does not provide an  answer  to
the  store  operator  in these situations.  My  answer  to  these
scenarios  is only partial, but it is the traditional  answer  of
the common law method: they are not this case.</pre>
    <pre>[42]   The   Ontario  legislature  is  properly  concerned   with
proscribing consumption of tobacco products by young people.   It
has, therefore, legislated in this area.  Part of the legislative
response  is  a  statutory due diligence defence  anchored  in  a
limited  number  of formal Canadian and Ontario government-issued
documents.</pre>
    <pre>[43] This statutory due diligence defence, by its terms, does not
cover  every  situation.  It does not address  the  situation  of
sales   to   young   people   from   other   jurisdictions   with
identification  similar to that prescribed in  the  Ontario  law.
Nor  does  it  cover sales to some current Ontario residents  who
might only possess identification from other jurisdictions.</pre>
    <pre>[44]  It may well be that, with respect to sales to young  people
in  these  categories, the common law defence of  due  diligence,
grounded  in Dickson J.&#146;s language in Sault Ste Marie &#150;  &#147;leaving
it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took
all  reasonable  care&#148; &#150; would play a residual role  and  provide
protection  to  store operators.  However, whatever  difficulties
might  be  presented by a relatively small group of consumers  of
tobacco products, those difficulties should not detract from  the
clear  and  strict regime the legislature has put  in  place  for
merchants and the vast majority of their customers.  With respect
to  those  customers,  the merchant must insist  that  the  young
person  he  or she challenges produce one of the five  prescribed
forms of identification.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition
</pre>
    <pre>[45]  I  would allow the appeal.   Findings of  guilt  should  be
entered against both respondents for committing  the  offence  of
selling a tobacco product to a minor contrary to s. 3(1)  of  the
Tobacco Control  Act.   In the circumstances of this case,  it is
appropriate to grant both respondents absolute discharges.
