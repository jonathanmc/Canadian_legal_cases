    <pre><strong>RE:            VIREN SHAH (Plaintiff/Respondent) v. XEROX CANADA

    <pre><strong>               Anna Perschy

    <pre><strong>HEARD:         February 2, 2000
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Cullity J. dated October 22, 1998
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      E N D O R S E M E N T</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The plaintiff, Viren Shah, worked for Xerox for twelve and
one-half years. On May 21, 1996 he resigned. He then sued for
wrongful dismissal. The trial judge, Cullity J., concluded that
before his resignation Shah had been constructively dismissed by
Xerox. Cullity J. held that Xerox&#146;s treatment of Shah made his
continued employment intolerable and, therefore, amounted to an
unjustified repudiation of the employment relationship. He
awarded Shah damages equivalent to twelve months notice.
[2]  Xerox appeals only against liability. It makes one
submission:  the trial judge applied the wrong legal test for
constructive dismissal, and had he applied the correct test he
would have had to conclude that Shah had not been constructively
dismissed. Xerox argues that the trial judge should have
ascertained the terms of Shah&#146;s employment contract and found
that he was constructively dismissed only if Xerox had
unilaterally changed a fundamental term of that contract. In
other words, to establish that he had been constructively
dismissed, Shah had to show that Xerox had breached a specific
fundamental term of his employment contract.
[3]  In making this submission Xerox relies on the judgment of
the Supreme Court of Canada in Farber v. Royal Trust Co., [1997]
1 S.C.R. 846 at 864, and on the reasons of this court in Re
Stolze and Addario (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 323.
[4]  In Farber, Gonthier J. wrote at p. 864:</pre>
    <pre>	Thus, it has been established in a number of 
	Canadian common law decisions that where an 
	employer unilaterally makes a fundamental or 
	substantial change to an employee&#146;s contract of
        employment &#150; a change that violates the contract&#146;s 
	terms &#150; the employer is committing a fundamental 
	breach of the contract that results in its 
	termination and entitles the employee to consider
        himself or herself constructively dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[5]  In Re Stolze this court similarly stated at p. 326:</pre>
    <pre>	The law is clear that in assessing whether there 
	has been a constructive dismissal of an employee 
	the terms of the employment contract between the 
	parties must be ascertained. The court must then 
	consider whether the act or acts of the employer 
	have been such as to constitute a repudiation of 
	the fundamental terms of the contract. If so, the 
	employee was constructively dismissed when the 
	facts constituting the repudiation were completed.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Cullity J., however, concluded that the court may find an
employee has been constructively dismissed, without identifying a
specific fundamental term that has been breached, where the
employer&#146;s treatment of the employee makes continued employment
intolerable. We agree with Cullity J. The passages from Farber
and Re Stolze relied on by Xerox reflect a more general principle
of contract law. Gonthier J. referred to this general principle
in Farber at 195:</pre>
    <pre>	In cases of constructive dismissal, the courts in 
	the common law provinces have applied the general 
	principle that where one party to a contract 
	demonstrates an intention no longer to be bound by 
	it, that party is committing a fundamental breach 
	of the contract that results in its termination.</pre>
    <pre>The application of this principle will vary depending on the
conduct of the employer in question.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  In cases where an employer requires an employee to relocate
or take on a different position as part of a restructuring, the
court, obviously, must decide whether in doing so the employer
has changed a fundamental term of the employment contract.
[8]  In some cases, however, the employer&#146;s conduct amounts not
just to a change in a specific term of the employment contract
but to repudiation of the entire employment relationship. For
example, in Whiting v. Winnipeg River Brokenhead Community
Futures Development Corp. (1998) 159 D.L.R. (4th) 18 (Man. C.A.),
the trial judge concluded that an employee had been
constructively dismissed because of a series of incidents
culminating in the imposition of probation. The employer had
unjustifiably criticized the employee, levelled vague and
unfounded accusations against her, and created a hostile and
embarrassing work environment. The trial judge concluded that,
&#147;viewed objectively, the plaintiff&#146;s continued employment in such
environment was no longer possible.&#148;  This conclusion was upheld
by the Manitoba Court of Appeal. Thus, the decision in Whiting v.
Winnipeg reflects the general principle referred to by Gonthier
J. in Farber. The employer in the Whiting case had by its conduct
demonstrated an intention no longer to be bound by the contract.
[9]  The case before us is similar. Xerox&#146;s treatment of Shah
between November, 1995, and May, 1996, demonstrated that it no
longer intended to be bound by the employment contract, and that
it had, therefore, constructively dismissed Shah. The following
evidence reasonably supports Cullity J.&#146;s finding of constructive
dismissal.</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>(a) until taking on the new position of technical support
    analyst in May, 1995, Shah had had a successful career 
    at Xerox, regularly receiving good performance reviews, 
    bonuses and pay raises;

(b) the performance concerns raised by Shah&#146;s new manager
    in November, 1995, were largely unsubstantiated and 
    resulted from a misunderstanding about Shah&#146;s duties;

(c) the subsequent critical performance review on March 18,
    1996 provided few details and relied on reports that 
    were not verified;

(d) the warning letter received by Shah the following day,
    March 19, 1996, was not only unexpected, but was 
    unjustified;

(e) the warning letter of May 14, 1996, &#147;was again short on
    specifics&#148; and again &#147;without justification&#148;;

(f) the letter of May 17, 1996, putting Shah on probation
    was also unwarranted. The trial judge found that, 
    instead of telling Shah what was expected of him and 
    giving him a reasonable opportunity to respond to the 
    criticisms against him, the responsible Xerox manager 
    became &quot;more authoritarian, impatient and intolerant&#148; 
    and &#147;subsequently acted impulsively and without 
    justification.&#148;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10] On this evidence Cullity J. could reasonably find that Xerox
had made Shah&#146;s position intolerable and had constructively
dismissed him. That finding is entitled to deference in this
court. We have not been persuaded that we should interfere with
it.
[11] The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs.
