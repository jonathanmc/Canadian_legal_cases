    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of N. Mossip J., dated July 31, 1998
made at Guelph.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CARTHY J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  an appeal from a judgment of Mossip J.  declaring
that  a  vendor&#146;s lien for the unpaid purchase price of land  has
priority  over a first mortgage registered against  the  land  on
closing  of  the  sale.  The decision created a  sufficient  stir
among real estate practitioners that the Canadian Bar Association
&#150;  Ontario sought, and was granted, leave to intervene to support
the appellant.
[2]  The intervenor moved to introduce new evidence on the
appeal, largely solicitors&#146; affidavits directed to describing the
impact of the decision upon conveyancing practice.  I would admit
that evidence and at the same time observe that its value is
minimal. As understandable as the expressed concerns may be, the
court must declare the rights of the parties to the litigation
and conveyancing practices must adjust accordingly.
[3]  The facts are straightforward and for simplicity in
narrating them I will ignore the numbered companies and identify
the parties as individuals.  Joseph Silaschi owned a number of
vacant lots and Richard Sharpe wished to purchase one, borrow
money on a first mortgage from Carl DeGroot, build a home on the
lot, and then sell it at a profit.  The sale agreement provided
that a down payment would be made on closing and the balance of
the sale price, which turned out to be $23,624.73, would be
secured by a second mortgage. DeGroot was given a first mortgage
for $110,000 upon which he advanced $55,000 on closing.  Sharpe
did not succeed in his commercial venture and there was a sale of
the property to meet the demands of creditors.  The proceeds were
insufficient to repay both DeGroot and Silaschi and thus this
priority contest. Silaschi asserted that in addition to his
mortgage security he had a vendor&#146;s lien for the unpaid purchase
price which took priority over De Groot&#146;s first mortgage.
[4]  In her reasons for judgment, found at (1998), 20 R.P.R. (3d)
320, Mossip J. relies upon a series of authorities supporting the
proposition that a vendor&#146;s lien is not waived by the mere act of
taking other security.  She concludes that where, as here, the
first mortgagee has notice of the unpaid purchase price, his
security stands behind the vendor&#146;s lien.
[5]  However, none of the cases cited deal with a situation where
a first and second mortgage are registered on closing and all
parties are dealing with a common purpose.  DeGroot was putting
forward construction financing and clearly wanted his money out
first.  Silaschi was equally clear in deferring to DeGroot, at
least to the extent of the advance.  Then, after the fact, a
vendor&#146;s lien claim is asserted against the first mortgage to
turn the transaction on its head and create a business
transaction that no one could have intended or would have entered
on those terms.
[6]  The authorities Mossip J. cites in support of her conclusion
by and large illustrate sensible applications of the equitable
claim to a vendor&#146;s lien.  For instance, in Lang v. McMillan,
[1958] O.W.N. 341, the taking of a mortgage back did not affect
the priority of the vendor&#146;s lien against an execution creditor.
In Galt v. Erie and Niagara Railroad Co., [1869] Ch. 637, there
was a mortgage back and the vendor&#146;s lien was held to protect the
vendor against pre-existing rights of the railway company.
[7]  The vendor&#146;s lien finds its origin prior to the 19th century
when English common law did not permit execution against land.
Equity stepped in to provide a form of relief to a vendor of
property who had not received the full purchase price.  This
equitable lien was, in effect, a remedy to permit the vendor to
sell the property to satisfy the sale price.  In 1838, reform
legislation was enacted enabling land to be sold under execution,
introducing another application of the vendor&#146;s lien &#150; to protect
the vendor against competing execution creditors.
[8]  Halsbury&#146;s Laws of England offers a succinct description of
the vendor&#146;s lien as one of the equitable liens at Vol. 28, 4th
ed. reissue (1997), para. 704, p. 354:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>704. Equitable lien.  An equitable lien is a species of
equitable charge arising by operation of law independent 
of possession. Although the vendor&#146;s and the purchaser&#146;s 
equitable liens arise in circumstances where there is a 
contract, a contract is not necessary for the creation 
of an equitable lien.  Since it arises in equity it is 
subject to all the usual conditions affecting equitable 
rights.  It is not possible to state a general principle 
which accounts for the diversity of situations in which 
an equitable lien arises.  Apart from equitable liens 
arising from contractual dealings in property, equitable 
liens have been based upon general considerations of justice 
or upon the principle that he who seeks the aid of equity
in enforcing some claim must admit the equitable rights of 
others associated with the subject matter.  The vendor&#146;s 
lien is founded on the principle of equity that he who has 
obtained possession of property under a contract for 
payment of its value will not be allowed to keep it without 
payment.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[9]   The  principle to be followed in giving  application  to  a
vendor&#146;s lien was fully expressed by Spragge V.-C. in Boulton  v.
Gillespie (1860), 8 Gr. 223 at 228:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Prima facie, certainly the lien exists, and it lies
upon the grantee to rebut it.  It is the vendor&#146;s &#147;natural
equity,&#148; as it has been termed, to have a lien on his estate
until he has been paid for it; but the vendee may show, I
apprehend, that under the circumstances of the purchase it 
is not equitable that such a lien should be retained, and 
if he can shew that the retention of such lien would defeat 
or even materially interfere with the known object of the 
purchase, so as to clog it with difficulties which it is 
reasonable to conclude that the parties could not have 
intended that the purchase should be encumbered with; then 
I think he rebuts the vendor&#146;s prima facie equity and 
establishes a state of things under which the retention of 
a lien would be the reverse of equitable.  It is sometimes 
put &#150; that the parties indicate an intention that the lien 
should not be preserved &#150; sometimes that the intention to
retain a lien is negatived; but inasmuch as the right to a 
lien does not grow out of contract or intention, but out of 
the natural equity of the vendor, it seems to follow that 
wherever it can be shewn to be more equitable that the 
purchaser should have his land free from the lien, than that 
the vendor should retain it, no lien for unpaid purchase 
money can exist, for the equity against it outweighs the 
equity in favour of it &#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[10]  This  statement of principle was specifically  endorsed  in
Freeborn v. Goodman, [1969] S.C.R. 923 at 938-939 in support of a
conclusion  by  the  majority of that  court  that  the  equities
prevailed against enforcement of a vendor&#146;s lien.  In that  case,
the  assignee  of a second mortgagee vendor sought to  enforce  a
vendor&#146;s lien against purchasers of exclusive occupancy rights in
an  apartment building in circumstances where the vendor had also
obtained   as  additional  security,  an  agreement   to   retain
possession  of  unsold apartment units pending their  sale.   The
court found that there was no intention to retain the lien,  that
the agreement to retain possession of unsold suites as additional
security stood in substitution for the vendor&#146;s lien and that  in
all  the circumstances the equities stood against the recognition
of  a  lien.    This authority is not referred to by  Mossip  J.,
presumably  because  it was not presented in argument.   Although
the facts are different, particularly in that in the present case
there  is  no  additional  substituted  security,  the  principle
expressed  is apposite and offers direction as to the appropriate
test to be applied in the present case.
[11] This court applied Freeborn in Central Mortgage and Housing
Corp. v. Co-operative College Residences, Inc. et al. (1975), 13
O.R. (2d) 394.  Howland J.A., speaking for the court, observed at
p. 413:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It was contended by counsel for Revenue that even if
Revenue&#146;s purchase money second mortgage was subsequent 
in priority to the mortgage of CMHC, Revenue, as an 
unpaid vendor still had a vendor&#146;s lien, and this lien 
had priority over the mortgage of CMHC.  A vendor&#146;s 
lien can be waived, but it has to be shown that the 
parties intended that there should be no lien.  This 
cannot be inferred simply from the fact that the vendor 
took back a purchase money mortgage: Lang v. McMillan, 
[1958] O.W.N. 341, 13 D.L.R. (2d) 778.  The parties 
may have intended that the purchase money mortgage be 
additional security to the vendor&#146;s lien.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Howland J.A. concluded at p. 414:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In this case a series of postponement agreements was
executed by Revenue, whereby Revenue released its 
interest in the mortgaged lands, so that the interest 
of CMHC under its mortgage would be prior to that of 
Revenue under its purchase money mortgage. It was a 
condition of the CMHC mortgage that it be a first 
mortgage and CMHC would not have advanced the moneys 
under its mortgage unless such advances were to have 
priority over Revenue&#146;s purchase money mortgage. The 
advances were made largely to Revenue to finance the 
construction of the building.  The parties clearly 
intended that the purchase money mortgage should be 
in lieu of the vendor&#146;s lien.  It would not be 
equitable for Revenue to retain a vendor&#146;s lien in 
the circumstances. There is therefore no validity in 
the contention that Revenue retained a vendor&#146;s lien 
which had priority over the mortgage of CMHC.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12]  The  court was obviously moved in Central Mortgage  by  the
successive postponements, not present in this case, but again  we
find   the   emphasis  upon  the  equities   arising   from   the
circumstances.
[13] It is interesting that the Court of Appeal in England has
ruled that the mere taking of a purchase money mortgage is
evidence that the vendor obtained all he bargained for and thus
has no vendor&#146;s lien.  (See Capital Finance Co. Ltd. v. Stokes,
[1969] 1 Ch. 261 (C.A.) at 279.)  That court has come closer than
we have to recognizing the modern reality of reliance upon
security documents, title searches and priority of registration
to evidence claims upon title and priorities.
[14] In the present case, there was more to the circumstances
than simply the &#147;additional security&#148; of a mortgage.  There was
the fact that the security was to stand in second position to a
first mortgage, the initial funds from which were intended to
support construction of a house and thus increase the equity
available to protect the mortgagees.  This was not a contest
between an unpaid vendor and an execution creditor, requiring a
consideration of the position of each and weighing of equities.
There is no equity favouring the second mortgagee.  The only
possible interpretation of the intention of the first and second
mortgagees was that the vendor&#146;s lien was not to be enforced as
between them. Otherwise, their agreed priorities (agreed to by
order of registration) would be reversed and the business sense
of the transaction would be skewed.  The first mortgagee&#146;s money
would be going into construction of the building with no initial
equity beyond the down payment and the second mortgagee would be
the immediate recipient of the benefit of the improvements.  The
first mortgagee knew the vendor was partially unpaid, but they
both knew and intended that the second mortgagee was prepared to
be paid in second priority.
[15] In these reasons, I have avoided the label &#147;waiver&#148; used in
some of the authorities.  As I see it, whether a vendor&#146;s lien is
termed a charge, encumbrance or interest in land, when it comes
to asserting it as an equitable right, the equities may, as here,
stand in the way of enforcement.  However, the lien may survive
to provide priority over another interest presented in different
circumstances and, thus, would not be waived for all purposes.
[16] As a general conclusion, and to provide some certainty to
the practice of conveyancing, I would say that it must invariably
be the case that a vendor&#146;s lien gives way to a first mortgage
when the first and a second purchase money mortgage are placed on
title on closing.  The parties are together, they are proceeding
in concert, and their intentions as to priority are indelibly
engraved on the transaction.
[17] The appellant also argued that the vendor&#146;s lien is lost
upon signing a transfer or deed because of the provisions of the
Land Registration Reform Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.4 or the
Conveyancing and Law of Property Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.34. In
light of my reasons to this point it is not necessary to deal
with this issue, but because it was fully argued I will briefly
express my reasoning and conclusion.
[18] It is only necessary to deal with one statute because for
the purposes of this application they are essentially the same.
Section 5 of the Land Registration Act provides that a transfer
shall be deemed to include a release of  &#147;all the transferor&#146;s
existing claims on the land&#148;.
[19] In Derry &amp; Tomken Business Centre Inc. v. Canadian Imperial
Bank of Commerce et al. (1999), 116 O.A.C. 304, this court gave a
broad construction to the words &#147;existing claims on the land&#148; and
brought within it a right of first refusal, which is not
understood to be an interest in land.
[20] In my view, the vendor&#146;s lien is not &#147;an existing claim on
the land&#148; and does not fall within the scope of s. 5.  It is not
a claim on the land emanating from the vendor as an existing
right at the time of signing an agreement to sell or closing the
transaction.  The vendor&#146;s lien is part of the consideration
which the purchaser gives in place of payment.  The consideration
should not be diminished by reading into the transfer document a
deemed proviso.
[21] This was the reasoning of the British Columbia Court of
Appeal in Gordon v. Hipwell,  [1952] 3 D.L.R. 173 at 191:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In the conveyance, made pursuant to the Short Form of
Deeds Act, R.S.B.C. 1936, c. 262, from the respondent 
to Hipwell the former released all his claims, both at 
law or in equity, upon the lands in question.  It is 
submitted that he thereby abandoned his vendor&#146;s lien.
I think this provision has no application to a lien 
arising between the parties to the deed, by reason of 
the failure of the appellant to pay the purchase-price.
The covenant was made in consideration of this payment, 
which the respondent thought had been made, and should 
not operate against the respondent, who certainly had 
no intention of giving up any rights which he had 
against the appellant for failure to pay the
consideration.  Under these circumstances I think there 
was no &#147;manifest intention&#148; that the lien should not exist.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[22] The final issue concerns the priority of the second advance.
Silaschi  indicated he was unwilling to postpone his mortgage  to
accommodate  a  second advance under the first mortgage.  He  did
sign  a  document recognizing the first mortgage, that it  was  a
construction mortgage and that it was advanced to the  extent  of
$55,000  with  contemplation of a further advance of  $30,000  to
complete  construction. The intended purpose of that document  is
uncertain, but it was clearly not a postponement to the  advance,
as  conceded  by the appellant.  If it induced the advance,  then
DeGroot  must  bear  responsibility  for  not  obtaining   proper
documentation.   I  therefore  agree  with  Mossip  J.  that  the
priority  of the first mortgage is limited to the amount  of  the
first advance.
[23] In passing, it may be noted that if confirmation is needed
of the intent of the parties at the time of closing, it is
clearly found in this note signed by Silaschi confirming the
priorities and, on one reading, challenging DeGroot to make
another advance without a postponement.
[24] The appeal should therefore be allowed with costs, the
judgment below set aside and judgment to issue in accordance with
these reasons.
