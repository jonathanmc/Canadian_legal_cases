    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Ferrier
dated July 14, 1998.</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT

    <pre>[1]  The appellants argue that the applications judge erred in
using the market value approach, here an average of the quoted
stock market trading prices, rather than the net asset value to
arrive at the fair value of the shares of the respondent.
[2]  The method to be used in ascertaining fair value depends on
the facts of each case.  The shares in this case traded at a
discount from the net value of the underlying assets.
Nevertheless, there was expert evidence that the fair value was
best determined by the market price of the shares.  This evidence
was based in part on the nature of the respondent as a closed end
investment fund, the gold-bullion related performance of its
shares, and the illiquid nature of the some of the assets held by
the respondent in its investment portfolio.  The expert examined
the trading history of the shares of the respondent and expressed
the opinion that there was a sufficient volume of shares traded
to render the trading price a reliable guide to the fair value of
those shares.
[3]  We were told that this case was presented to the
applications judge on the basis that the shares should be valued
by using either the market value or the net asset value approach.
The opinions expressed by the opposing experts supported the
valuation on the basis of one or other of these methods.  There
was no evidence supporting a valuation approach that used a
combination of the two.
[4]  In the circumstances, it was open to the applications judge
to accept the evidence of the expert who valued the shares using
the stock exchange trading prices.
[5]  We are not persuaded that in accepting this evidence, the
applications judge rejected the net asset value approach solely
because the shares are not subject to redemption by the
shareholders.  Undoubtedly, the applications judge attached
significance to this fact as did the expert upon whose opinion he
relied.  It was a relevant factor and, combined with the illiquid
nature of some of the assets held by the respondent, provided a
reasonable explanation why the shares would be valued by the
market at less than next asset value.  We see no error in the
decision by the applications judge to adopt the market value
approach.
[6]  In the result, we would dismiss the appeal with costs.</pre></td>
