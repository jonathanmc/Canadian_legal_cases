    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Farley J. dated October 24, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>O&#146;CONNOR J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is a motion to quash an appeal from the order of Farley
J. made on October 24, 1999.  By his order, Farley J. approved
the sale of the assets of Hyal Pharmaceutical Corporation by the
court-appointed receiver of Hyal to Skyepharma PLC.  Bioglan
Pharma PLC, a disappointed would be purchaser of those assets has
appealed, asking this court to set aside the sale approval order
and to direct that there be a new sale process.
[2]  The receiver moves to quash the appeal on the ground that
Bioglan, as a potential purchaser, did not have any rights that
were finally determined by the sale approval order.  Accordingly,
the receiver contends, this court does not have jurisdiction to
hear the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>BACKGROUND</pre>
    <pre>[3]  Skyepharma, the largest creditor of Hyal, moved for the
appointment of Pricewaterhouse Coopers Inc. as the receiver and
manager of all of the assets of Hyal.  On August 16, 1999, Molloy
J. granted the order which included provisions authorizing the
receiver to take the necessary steps to liquidate and realize
upon the assets, to sell the assets (with court approval for
transactions exceeding $100,000) and to hold the proceeds of any
sales pending further order of the court.
[4]  On August 26, 1999, Cameron J. made an order approving the
process proposed by the receiver for soliciting, receiving and
considering expressions of interest and offers to purchase the
assets of Hyal.
[5]  The receiver reported to the court on September 27, 1999 and
set out the results of the sale process.  The receiver sought the
court&#146;s approval to enter into exclusive negotiations with two
parties which had made offers, Skyepharma and Cangene
Corporation.  The receiver indicated that it had also received an
offer from Bioglan and explained why, in its view, the best
realisation was likely to result from negotiations with
Skyepharma and Cangene.
[6]  In its report, the receiver pointed out the importance of
attempting to finalize the sale of the assets at an early date.
The interest and damages on the secured and unsecured debt of
Hyal were increasing in the amount of approximately $70,000 a
week.  Professional fees and operational costs were also adding
to the aggregate debt of the company.
[7]  On September 28, 1999 Farley J. ordered that the receiver
negotiate exclusively with Skyepharma and Cangene until October
6,  in an attempt to conclude a transaction that was acceptable
to the receiver and that realised the superior value inherent in
the offers made by Skyepharma and Cangene.1  The court also
directed that no party would be entitled to retract, withdraw,
vary or counteract any outstanding offer prior to October 29,
1999 and that, if the receiver was unable to reach agreement with
Skyepharma or Cangene, then it would have the discretion to
negotiate with other parties.
[8]  On October 13, the receiver reported to the court on the
results of the negotiations with Skyepharma and Cangene. The
parties had been unable to structure the transaction to take
advantage of Hyal&#146;s tax loss positions.  Nevertheless, the
receiver recommended approval for an agreement to sell the assets
of Hyal to Skyepharma. In its report, the receiver pointed out
that the agreement it was recommending did not necessarily
maximize the realisation for the assets but that it did minimize
the risk of not closing and also the risk of liabilities
increasing in the interim period up to closing, which risks arose
from the provisions and timeframes contained in other offers.
The receiver said that these risks were not immaterial.
[9]  At the same time that the receiver filed its report it
brought a motion for approval of the agreement with Skyepharma.
The motion was heard by Farley J. on October 20, 1999.  Counsel
for Skyepharma, Cangene and Bioglan appeared and were permitted
to make submissions.  Skyepharma, which was both a creditor of
Hyal and the purchaser under the agreement for which approval was
being sought, supported the motion.  Cangene and Bioglan, which
in addition to being unsuccessful prospective purchasers, were
also creditors of the company, opposed the motion.
[10] It is apparent that the motions judge heard the submissions
of Cangene and Bioglan in their capacities as creditors of Hyal
and not in their role as unsuccessful bidders for the assets
being sold.  In his endorsement made on October 24 he said:

          Unsuccessful bidders have no standing to
	  challenge a receiver&#146;s motion to approve
	  the sale to another candidate.  They
          have no legal or proprietary right as
	  technically they are not affected by the
	  order.  They have no interest in the fundamental
          question of whether the court&#146;s approval is in
	  the best interests of the parties directly involved.</pre>
    <pre>The motions judge continued by saying that he would &quot;take into
account the objections of Bioglan and Cangene as they have
shoehorned into the approval motion&quot;. This latter comment, as
it applied to Bioglan, appears to refer to the fact that Bioglan 
only became a creditor after the receiver was appointed and then 
only by acquiring a small debt of Hyal in the amount of $40,000.</pre>
    <pre>[11] The motions judge approved the agreement for the sale of the
assets to Skyepharma.  In his endorsement, he noted that the
assets involved were &#147;unusual&#148; and that the process to sell these
assets was complex.  He attached significant weight to the
recommendation of the receiver who, he pointed out, had the
expertise to deal with matters of this nature.  The motions judge
noted that the receiver&#146;s primary concern was to protect the
interests of the creditors of Hyal.  He recognized the advantages
of avoiding risks that may result from the delay or uncertainty
inherent in offers containing conditional provisions.  The
certainty and timeliness of the Skyepharma agreement were
important factors in both the recommendation of the receiver and
in the reasons of the court for approving  the sale.
[12] The motions judge said that &#147;at first blush&#148;, it appeared
that the receiver had conducted itself appropriately throughout
the sale process.  He reviewed the specific complaints of Cangene
and Bioglan and concluded that, although the process was not
perfect (my words), there was no impediment to approving the sale
to Skyepharma.
[13] This court was advised by counsel that the transaction
closed immediately after the order approving the sale was made.
[14] Bioglan has filed a notice of appeal seeking to set aside
the approval order and asking that this court  direct that the
assets of Hyal be sold pursuant to a court-supervised judicial
sale or, alternatively, that the receiver be required to reopen
the bidding relating to the sale.  The notice of appeal does not
set out any specific grounds of appeal.  It states only that the
motions judge erred in approving the sale agreement.
[15] In argument, counsel for Bioglan said that there are two
grounds of appeal.  First, the receiver misinterpreted the order
of September 28, 1999 and should have negotiated further with the
non-exclusive bidders, including Bioglan, once it determined that
a transaction based on the tax benefits of Hyal&#146;s tax loss
position could not be structured.  Second, the motions judge
erred in holding that Bioglan had a full opportunity to
participate in the process and was the author of its own
misfortune by using a &#147;low balling strategy.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>[16] The receiver moves to quash the appeal on the ground that
this court does not have jurisdiction.
[17] Section 6(1)(b) of the Courts of Justice Act provides for a
right of appeal to this court from a final order of a judge of
the Superior Court of Justice.  A final order is one that finally
disposes of the rights of the parties:  Halbert v. Netherlands
Investment Company, [1945] S.C.R. 329.
[18] The issue raised by the motion is whether Bioglan had a
right that was finally disposed of by the sale approval order.
Bioglan submits that there are four separate ways by which it
acquired the necessary right.  The first is one of general
application that would apply to all unsuccessful prospective
purchasers in court supervised sales.  The other three arise from
the specific circumstances of this case.
[19] First, Bioglan submits that because it made an offer to buy
the assets of Hyal, it acquired a right that entitled it to
participate in the sale approval motion and to oppose the order
sought by the receiver.  This right, Bioglan maintains, was
finally disposed of by the order approving the sale to
Skyepharma.
[20] A similar issue was considered by Anderson J. in Crown Trust
v. Rosenberg (1986), 60 O.R. (2d) 87, 22 C.P.C. (2d) 131, 67
C.B.R. (N.S.) 320 (note), 39 D.L.R. (4th) 526 (H.C.J.).  In that
case, a receiver brought a motion to approve the sale of certain
properties.  On the return of the motion, Larco Enterprises, a
prospective purchaser whose offer was not being recommended for
approval by the receiver, moved to intervene as an added party
under rule 13.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure.  The relevant
portion of that rule, at the time, read as follows:

    	13.01(1) Where a person who is not a party to a
	proceeding claims,

        (a) an interest in the subject matter of the 
	proceeding;
        
	(b) that he or she may be adversely affected 
	by a judgment in the proceeding;

        &#133;

        the person may move for leave to intervene as 
	an added party.2 

[21] Anderson J. concluded that &#147;the proceeding&#148; referred to in
rule 13.01 only included an action or an application.  The motion
for approval of the sale by the receiver was neither.  He
therefore dismissed Larco&#146;s motion.  He continued, however, and
held that even if the proceeding was one to which the rule
applied, Larco did not satisfy the criteria in it because it did
not have an interest in the subject-matter of the sale approval
motion nor did it have any legal or proprietary right that would
be adversely affected by the court's order approving the sale.
[22] I adopt both his reasoning and his conclusion.  At p. 118,
he said:

               The motion brought by Clarkson to approve
	  the sales is one upon which the fundamental
	  question for consideration is whether that 
	  approval is in the best interests of the parties
	  to the action as being the approval of sales
	  which will be most beneficial to them.  In that
	  fundamental question Larco has no interest at all.
	  Its only interest is in seeking to have its
          offer accepted with whatever advantages will
	  accrue to it as a result.  That interest is
	  purely incidental and collateral to the central
	  issue in the substantive motion and, in my view,
	  would not justify an exercise of the discretion
	  given by the rule.

               Nor, in my view, can Larco resort
          successfully to cl. (b) of rule 13.01(1)
          which raises the question whether it may be
          adversely affected by a judgment in the
          proceeding.  For these purposes I leave aside
          the technical difficulties with respect to
          the word &#147;judgment&#148;.  In my view, Larco will
          not be adversely affected in respect of any
          legal or proprietary right.  It has no such
          right to be adversely affected.  The most it
          will lose as a result of an order approving
          the sales as recommended, thereby excluding
          it, is a potential economic advantage only.</pre>
    <pre>[23] The British Columbia Supreme Court reached a similar
conclusion in British Columbia Development Corporation v. Spun
Cast Industries Limited et al. (1977), 26 C.B.R. (N.S.) 28
(B.C.S.C.).  In that case the receiver in a debenture holder&#146;s
action for foreclosure moved for an order to approve the sale of
assets.  A group of companies, the Shaw group, had made an offer
and sought to be added as a party under a rule which authorized
the Court to add as a party any person &#147;whose participation in
the proceeding is necessary to ensure that all matters in the
proceeding may be effectively adjudicated upon &#133;&#148;.  Berger J.
dismissed this motion.  At p. 30, he said:
   
          The Shaw group of companies has no legal interest
	  in the litigation at bar.  It has a commercial
	  interest, but that is not, in my view, sufficient
	  to bring it within the rule.  Simply because it
	  has made an offer to purchase the assets of the
          company does not entitle it to be joined as a
	  party.  Nothing in Gurtner v. Circuit [cite
	  omitted] goes so far.  No order made in this
	  action will result in any legal liability being
	  imposed on the Shaw group, and no claim can be
	  made against it on the strength of any such order.</pre>
    <pre>[24] Although the issues considered in these cases are not
identical to the case at bar, the reasoning applies to the issue
raised on this appeal.  If an unsuccessful prospective purchaser
does not acquire an interest sufficient to warrant being added as
a party to a motion to approve a sale, it follows that it does
not have a right that is finally disposed of by an order made on
that motion.
[25] There are two main reasons why an unsuccessful prospective
purchaser does not have a right or interest that is affected by a
sale approval order.  First, a prospective purchaser has no legal
or proprietary right in the property being sold. Offers are
submitted in a process in which there is no requirement that a
particular offer be accepted.  Orders appointing receivers
commonly give the receiver a discretion as to which offers to
accept and to recommend to the court for approval. The duties of
the receiver and the court are to ensure that the sales are in
the best interests of those with an interest in the proceeds of
the sale.  There is no right in a party who submits an offer to
have the offer, even if the highest, accepted by either the
receiver or the court:  Crown Trust v. Rosenberg, supra.
[26] Moreover, the fundamental purpose of the sale approval
motion is to consider the best interests of the parties with a
direct interest in the proceeds of the sale, primarily the
creditors.  The unsuccessful would be purchaser has no interest
in this issue.  Indeed, the involvement of unsuccessful
prospective purchasers could seriously distract from this
fundamental purpose by including in the motion other issues with
the potential for delay and additional expense.
[27] In making these comments, I recognize that a court
conducting a sale approval motion is required to consider the
integrity of the process by which the offers have been obtained
and to consider whether there has been unfairness in the working
out of that process.  Crown Trust v. Rosenberg, supra;  Royal
Bank of Canada v. Soundair Corp., (1991), 4 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.).
The examination of the sale process will in normal circumstances
be focussed on the integrity of that process from the perspective
of those for whose benefit it has been conducted.  The inquiry
into the integrity of the process may incidentally address the
fairness  of the process to prospective purchasers, but that in
itself does not create a right or interest in a prospective
purchaser that is affected by a sale approval order.
[28] In Soundair, the unsuccessful would be purchaser was a party
to the proceedings and the court considered the fairness of the
sale process from its standpoint.  However, I do not think that
the decision in Soundair conflicts with the position I have set
out above for two reasons.  First, the issue of whether the
prospective purchaser had a legal right or interest was not
specifically addressed by the court.  Indeed, in describing the
general principles that govern a sale approval motion, Galligan
J.A., for the majority, adopted the approach in Crown Trust v.
Rosenberg.  Under the heading &#147;Consideration of the interests of
all the parties&#148;, he referred to the interests of the creditors,
the debtor and a purchaser who has negotiated an agreement with
the receiver.  He did not mention the interests of unsuccessful
would be purchasers.  Second, the facts in Soundair were unusual.
The unsuccessful offeror was a company in which Air Canada had a
substantial interest.  The order appointing the receiver
specifically directed the receiver &#147;to do all things necessary or
desirable to complete a sale to Air Canada&#148; and if a sale to Air
Canada could not be completed to sell to another party.
Arguably, this provision in the order of the court created an
interest in Air Canada which could be affected by the sale
approval order and which entitled it to standing in the sale
approval proceedings.
[29] In limited circumstances, a prospective purchaser may become
entitled to participate in a sale approval motion.  For that to
happen, it must be shown that the prospective purchaser acquired
a legal right or interest from the circumstances of a particular
sale process and that the nature of the right or interest is such
that it could be adversely affected by the approval order.  A
commercial interest is not sufficient.
[30] There is a sound policy reason for restricting, to the
extent possible, the involvement of prospective purchasers in
sale approval motions.  There is often a measure of urgency to
complete court approved sales.  This case is a good example.
When unsuccessful purchasers become involved, there is a
potential for greater delay and additional uncertainty.  This
potential may, in some situations, create commercial leverage in
the hands a disappointed would be purchaser which could be
counterproductive to the best interests of those for whose
benefit the sale is intended.
[31] In arguing that simply being a prospective purchaser accords
a broader right or interest than I have set out above, Bioglan
relies on the decision of the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal in
Cameron v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1981), 38 C.B.R. (N.S.) 1, 45
N.S.R. (2d) 303, 86 A.P.R. 303 (C.A.).  In that case, the
receiver invited tenders to purchase lands of the debtor and
received three offers. The receiver accepted Cameron&#146;s offer and
inserted a clause in the sale agreement calling for court
approval.  On the application to approve the sale, Treby, an
unsuccessful bidder, was joined as an intervener.  Treby opposed
approval, arguing that he had been misled into believing that he
would have another opportunity to bid on the property.  The court
directed that all three bidders be given a further opportunity to
bid by way of sealed tender.  Cameron appealed the order.  The
tender process proceeded.  Treby and the third bidder submitted
bids; Cameron did not.  The receiver accepted Treby&#146;s offer and
the court approved the sale to Treby.  Cameron also appealed this
order and Cameron&#146;s two appeals were heard together.  Hart J.A.
held that both Cameron and Treby had a right to appear at the
original hearing because both were parties directly affected by
the decision of the court. He concluded that the first decision
reopening the bidding process and the order approving the sale to
Treby were both final in their nature in that they amounted to a
final determination of the rights of Cameron and Treby.  He did
not set out specifically what &#147;rights&#148; he was referring to.
Having regard to the facts in the case, it is not clear to me
that Cameron stands for the proposition asserted by Bioglan, that
an unsuccessful would be purchaser, without more, has a right
that is finally determined by an order approving a sale.  If it
does, I would, with respect, disagree.
[32] In the result, I conclude that the fact that Bioglan made an
offer to purchase Hyal&#146;s assets did not give it a right or
interest that was affected by the sale approval order.  It was
not entitled to standing on the motion on that basis nor is it
now entitled to bring this appeal on that basis.
[33] As an alternative, Bioglan relies upon three circumstances
in this case, each of which it says, in somewhat different ways,
results in it having the right to appeal the sale approval order
to this court.  First, Bioglan submits that it acquired this
necessary right under the provision in the order of September 28
which directed that &#147;no party shall be entitled to retract,
withdraw, vary or countermand any offer submitted to the receiver
prior to October 29 1999.&#148;
[34] Bioglan&#146;s offer was, by its terms, to expire on October 4.
Bioglan argues that the order of September 28 imposed an
obligation on it to keep that offer open until October 29.  That
being the case, Bioglan maintains that it acquired a right to
appear and oppose the  motion to approve the sale.
[35] I do not accept this argument.  The ordinary meaning of the
language in the order did not require Bioglan to extend its
outstanding offer.  The order did nothing more than preclude
parties from taking steps to either amend or withdraw their
offers before October 29.  By its terms, Bioglan&#146;s offer was to
expire on October 4.  The order of September 28 did not affect
the expiry date of the offer.
[36] Even if the language of the September 28 order is
interpreted to preclude an existing offer from expiring in
accordance with its terms, the result would be the same.  Bioglan
made  its offer to the receiver under terms and conditions of
sale approved by the court on August 26.  The terms and
conditions of the sale were deemed to be part of each offer made
to the receiver.  Clause 14 of the terms and conditions provided:

          &#133; No party shall be entitled to retract, withdraw,
	  vary or countermand its offer prior to acceptance
	  or rejection thereof by the vendor (receiver).
	  [My emphasis.]</pre>
    <pre>[37] The order of September 28 tracks the emphasized language.
If  the language in the order is interpreted  to preclude an
existing offer from expiring according to its terms, then when
Bioglan submitted  its offer it agreed, by virtue of clause 14 in
the terms and conditions of sale ,that its offer would remain
open until it was either accepted or rejected by the receiver.
Assuming this interpretation, the order of September 28 added
nothing to the obligation that Bioglan had assumed  when it made
its offer.
[38] Accordingly  I would not give effect to this argument.
[39] Next, Bioglan submits that the order of September 28 created
a duty on the receiver to negotiate further with the non-
exclusive bidders once it determined that a transaction based on
the tax benefits of Hyal&#146;s tax loss position could not be
structured.  This duty, it is argued, created a corresponding
legal right in Bioglan to participate further in the process.
This right, Bioglan maintains, was violated by the receiver when
it recommended the Skyepharma agreement.
[40] I do not read the order of September 28 as imposing this
duty on the receiver.  The order provided the receiver with a
discretion as to whether to negotiate further with the non-
exclusive bidders.  It did not require the receiver to do so.
Moreover, the order of September 28 did not limit the receiver to
entering into an agreement with the exclusive bidders only if an
agreement could be structured to take advantage of the tax
losses.  The order of September 28 did not create either the duty
or the right asserted by Bioglan.
[41] Finally, Bioglan submits that it acquired the necessary
right to bring this appeal because the motions judge permitted it
to make submissions on the sale approval motion.  Again, I see no
merit in this argument.  As I have set out above, it seems
apparent that the motions judge heard Bioglan&#146;s argument solely
because it was a creditor of Hyal and not because it was an
unsuccessful prospective purchaser.  Bioglan does not seek to
bring this appeal in its role as a creditor, nor does it complain
that the sale approval order is unfair to the creditors of Hyal.
[42] The motions judge approved the sale based on the
recommendation of the receiver that it was in the best interests
of the creditors.  The fact that Bioglan was given an opportunity
to be heard in these circumstances did not create a right which
would provide standing to bring this appeal.  The order sought to
be appealed does not finally dispose of any right of Bioglan as
creditor.</pre>
