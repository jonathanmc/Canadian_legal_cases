      <pre><b>On appeal from the judgment of Lamek J. dated August 26, 1999.</b></pre>
      <pre><b>BY THE COURT:</b></pre>
      <pre>[1]  The appellant appeals from the decision of Lamek J.  That
decision stayed the defamation action filed by the appellant on
the basis that the subject matter of the dispute was covered by a
collective agreement and that an action in the courts was
foreclosed.</pre>
      <pre>[2]  The essential character of the dispute between the appellant
and the respondent
board arises from alleged disciplinary actions taken by the
respondent board against the appellant in relation to his
employment.  The employment relationship is governed by a
collective agreement, which includes a just cause provision as
well as a grievance procedure and binding arbitration.</pre>
      <pre>[3]  In our view, the matters complained of by the appellant are
matters that are subject to the collective agreement.  This court
held in Bhaduria v. Toronto Board of Education, [1999] O.J. 582
that where the essential character of the claim for defamation
pertains to termination from a teaching position, it arises under
the collective agreement.  That is the situation here.  The claim
for defamation is based on unfavourable performance reviews of
the appellant, as a teacher, that led to his termination.  Lamek
J. was correct in concluding that the claim was governed by
Bhaduria and a similar decision of this court in Giorno v. Pappas
(1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 626, as well as the general principles
articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in Weber v. Ontario
Hydro (1995), 125 D.L.R. (4th) 583.  As those cases hold, where
the essence of the claim arises from a dispute that is subject to
the collective agreement, a party in the position of the
appellant cannot escape the arbitration regime under the
collective agreement by attaching to his claim a label such as
“defamation”.</pre>
      <pre>[4]  There is no merit in the argument that the exclusive
jurisdiction of the arbitrator offends s.96 of the Constitution
Act.  The dispute between the appellant and the respondent board
is properly characterized as a labour relations matter.  As with
the jurisdiction issue, the appellant cannot escape that
characterization by attaching to his claim the label
“defamation”.   It is well-established that the jurisdiction of
arbitrators in labour relations matters does not offend s.96.</pre>
      <pre>[5]  Accordingly the appeal must be dismissed.</pre>
