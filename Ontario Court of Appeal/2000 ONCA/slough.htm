Rosenberg, M. R. Meehan and M. L. Caswell JJ.) dated January 20,
1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A.:

</strong>[1]   This appeal concerns the interpretation of s. 19(3) of  the
Assessment  Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. A.31 as it stood  in  the  years
1993  to  1995.  The narrow issue is whether land that  is  being
held for development but is being used for farm purposes is to be
assessed  as  farm land or is to be assessed as  industrial  land
because  it is zoned for industrial use and agricultural  use  is
illegal.   The  Ontario Municipal Board had held that  the  lands
were  to  be  assessed as farm land.  On appeal,  the  Divisional
Court  held  that  the land must be assessed as industrial  land.
For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and restore
the decision of the Ontario Municipal Board.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS</pre>
    <pre>[2]   The  appeal  concerns fourteen properties in  the  City  of
Mississauga  and  nine  properties  in  the  Town  of   Oakville.
Historically,  the  lands had been farmed and  assessed  as  farm
lands in accordance with s. 19(3) of the Assessment Act.  I  will
set out the applicable provisions of the Act below.  However,  in
effect,  s.  19  of the Act provides that, while land  is  to  be
assessed  at its market value, subsection (3) sets out a  special
regime  for determining the market value of lands used  only  for
farm purposes.
[3]  The appellants purchased the lands in question in the late
1980&#146;s with the intention of developing them for industrial and
commercial purposes.  In 1987 and 1988, the lands were rezoned to
permit industrial and commercial uses.  The agricultural use of
the lands was terminated after the rezoning to allow for initial
servicing of the lands.  Plans of subdivision and servicing
agreements were registered on title.  In 1992, the lands were
returned to agricultural use when the market for serviced land
collapsed.  The appellants leased the lands to farmers who farmed
the lands.
[4]  In 1993, the Regional Assessment Commissioner assessed the
lands as industrial lands.  The appellants appealed these
assessments to the Ontario Municipal Board.  In 1994 and 1995,
the Commissioner assessed the lands as farm lands.  Oakville
appealed the 1994 and 1995 assessments.  Mississauga did not
appeal the 1994 assessment but did appeal the 1995 assessment.
However, the 1995 assessment was not part of the hearing before
the Board.
[5]  For the purposes of this appeal, the appellants concede that
farming is not a legal use of the lands in view of the zoning
during the relevant years.</pre>
    <pre>THE LEGISLATION</pre>
    <pre>[6]   This appeal turns on the proper interpretation of s.  19(3)
of  the  Assessment Act.  However, that section must be  read  in
context  with  other  parts  of the  section,  which  provide  as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>
          19.&#151;(1)   Subject to this section, land shall 
	  be assessed at its market value.

              (2)    Subject  to  subsection  (3),  the
          market  value of land assessed is the  amount
          that the land might be expected to realize if
          sold  in the open market by a willing  seller
          to a willing buyer.

              (3)    For  the  purposes  of  subsection
	  (2), in ascertaining the market value of farm
	  lands used  only  for  farm  purposes  by the
	  owner thereof or used only for farm  purposes
	  by a tenant of such an  owner  and  buildings
	  thereon  used  solely  for   farm   purposes,
	  including  the  residence  of  the  owner  or
	  tenant  and  of  the   owner's  or   tenant's
	  employees   and   their   families   on   the
          farm  lands, consideration shall be given  to
          the  market value of the lands and  buildings
          for farming purposes only, and in determining
          the market value, consideration shall not  be
          given  to  sales  of lands and  buildings  to
          persons  whose principal occupation is  other
          than farming.

              (4)    Where  the  owner  of  farm  lands
          entitled  to  the benefit of  subsection  (3)
          dies  or  retires, the market  value  of  the
          lands  and  buildings  in  respect  of  which
          subsection  (3) applies shall be  ascertained
          in  the manner provided in subsection (3)  in
          assessing  the  lands during the  period  the
          lands are held by the owner after his or  her
          retirement or held by his or her estate after
          his  or her death, but in no case beyond  the
          two  years immediately following the  owner's
          death  or  retirement unless  the  lands  are
          occupied  by  the  surviving  spouse  of  the
          deceased owner or by the retired owner.

              (5)    When  an  appeal  has  been  taken
          in  respect  of the assessment of farm  lands
          mentioned in subsection (3) from the decision
          of   the   Assessment   Review   Board,   the
          assessment  as finally determined  on  appeal
          shall  remain fixed in respect  of  the  same
          lands and buildings for a period of two years
          after the year in respect of which the appeal
          was  taken so long as the lands and buildings
          are   owned   by  a  person  whose  principal
          occupation  is  farming, but this  subsection
          does   not   apply  to  prevent  a  different
          assessment of any farm lands in any  year  in
          which  a  different assessment  generally  is
          made  of  lands in the municipality in  which
          the farm lands are situated. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  appellants also placed some emphasis on  a  subsequent
amendment  to  s. 19.  In 1997, the Fair Municipal  Finance  Act,
1997, S.O. 1997, c. 5, s. 12 changed the basis of assessment from
&#147;market value&#148; to &#147;current value&#148;.  Section 19(3) became s. 19(5)
as a result of those amendments but was essentially unchanged.  A
further amendment was made to s. 19 by the Fair Municipal Finance
Act,  1997  (No. 2) S.O. 1997, c. 29, s. 9.  This amendment  came
into  force  on January 1, 1998 and added subsections  (5.3)  and
(5.4), which provide as follows:

              (5.3)   It is not necessary, for subsection
	  (5) to apply to farm land used only for farm
	  purposes, that the use be permitted under
	  municipal zoning by-laws.

              (5.4) Subsection (5) does not apply in the
	  circumstances prescribed by the  Minister. 
	  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>THE DECISION OF THE ONTARIO MUNICIPAL BOARD</pre>
    <pre>[8]   The  Board gave extensive reasons in which it reviewed  the
history of the assessment of farm land in Ontario.  It noted that
s.  19(3) creates a distinct regime for valuation of such  lands.
In summary, the Board concluded that the provision,</pre>
    <pre>
   specifically directs that in ascertaining the market value
   of such lands, consideration is to be given only to the market
   value of such lands &#147;for farming purposes only&#148;, and explicitly
   indicates that no consideration is to be given to the sales of
   such to persons &#147;whose principal occupation is other than
   farming&#148;.  As such, the provision creates a distinct and unique
   regime for the valuation of such lands, taking them out of the
   realm of determining market value as &#147;the amount that the land
   might be expected to realize if sold in the open market by a
   willing seller to a willing buyer&#148; (as per the text of s. 19(2)),
   which is the valuation regime that applies to all other lands.</pre>
    <pre>[9]   The  Board  held that the determination whether  lands  are
&#147;being used for farm purposes&#148; involved a finding of fact.   That
finding  depended upon evidence as to the use  of  the  lands  as
opposed  to  what the Board referred to as the &#147;juridical&#148;,  i.e.
zoning,   considerations.   This  finding  of  fact  required   a
consideration  of  the &#147;functional use as well  as  the  physical
attributes  of the lands&#148; based on evidence as to  the  types  of
activities carried out on the lands, the physical characteristics
of  the  land,  the characteristics of the tenant or  owner,  the
purpose  of the activities and the timing of the activities.   It
recognized  that  a  &#147;peripheral&#148;  use  of  land  only  tenuously
associated  with  farming was not sufficient to satisfy  the  use
requirement.
[10] The Board traced the history of the special regime for
assessment of farm lands in the province and the treatment of the
various legislative provisions by the courts and the Board.  The
Board concluded that until the decision of the Divisional Court
in Amoco Canada Petroleum Co. v. Regional Assessment
Commissioner, Region No. 27 et al. (1994), 75 O.A.C. 356, the
courts had consistently refused to take zoning into
consideration.  I will discuss the Amoco decision below.
[11] Finally, the Board concluded that as a matter of fact, all
of the lands in questions were farm lands used only for farm
purposes within the meaning of s. 19(3).  The Board based this
decision on evidence that included the following:</pre>
    <pre>
          (i)   the  lands  were  cleared  of   debris,
	  ploughed,  seeded,   cultivated   and   crops
 	  removed;

          (ii)  the  lands   displayed   the   physical
          characteristic of land used for  agricultural
          purposes  at different stages of the  farming
          cycle;  the presence of certain roads,  curbs
          and lighting notwithstanding; and

          (iii) the    tenant   farmers    were    bona
          fide farmers running a farming operation  and
          effectively farming numerous parcels of land.</pre>
    <pre>THE DECISION OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</pre>
    <pre>[12]  The  reasons  of  the  Divisional  Court  were  based  upon
application  of  the  earlier  Amoco  decision.   In  its   brief
endorsement, the court held as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
   As stated by the board and confirmed before us, the parties
   agreed that the zoning by-laws do not permit farm use and there
   was no non-conforming use.  Accordingly, in our view, the Amoco
   decision is on point.  We adopt the reasoning of Adams J. when he
   states, &#147;We do not accept that s. 19(3) of the Assessment Act
   envisages a use that is expressly proscribed by law&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>
ANALYSIS</pre>
    <pre>
     Application of the principles of statutory interpretation</pre>
    <pre>[13]  As  I  stated  at the outset, this case is  concerned  with
statutory  interpretation.  In the recent judgment of this  court
in  Macartney v. Warner [2000] O.J. No. 30, at para.  47,  Laskin
J.A.  described the task of a court in approaching  an  issue  of
statutory interpretation:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>A basic principle of statutory interpretation is that 
the ordinary meaning of a legislative provision should 
prevail absent a good reason to reject it.  The ordinary 
meaning is presumed to be the intended or most 
appropriate meaning unless the context or the purpose 
and scheme of the legislation, or the consequences of
adopting the ordinary meaning suggest otherwise. 
Professor Ruth Sullivan, who edited the third edition 
of Driedger on the Construction of Statutes, sets out 
the presumption in favour of the ordinary meaning at 
p. 7:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(1) It is presumed that the ordinary meaning of a 
    legislative text is the intended or most
    appropriate meaning. In the absence of a reason
    to reject it, the ordinary meaning prevails.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(2) Even where the ordinary meaning of a legislative
    text appears to be clear, the courts must consider
    the purpose and scheme of the legislation, and the
    consequences of adopting this meaning.  They must
    take into account all relevant indicators of
    legislative meaning.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(3) In light of these additional considerations, the
    court may adopt an interpretation in which the
    ordinary meaning is modified or rejected. That
    interpretation, however, must be plausible; that
    is, it must be one the words are reasonably capable
    of bearing.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[14] The ordinary meaning of the text of s. 19(3) is that if  the
lands  are &quot;farm lands used only for farm purposes&quot;, market value
is  to be ascertained without regard to sales of lands to persons
whose  principal occupation is not farming.  Rather,  the  market
value  is to be determined solely by consideration of the  land&#146;s
value  for farming purposes.  As the Board noted, subsection  (3)
operates   as   an   exception  to  the  general   principle   in
subsection (2) that market value is to be determined by what  the
land might be expected to sell for on an open market by a willing
seller   to  a  willing  buyer.   In  my  view,  the   focus   of
subsection  (3) is on the use of the land, a factual  issue,  not
its  zoning,  a  legal  issue.  If  the  land  has  the  relevant
characteristic, its market value must be determined in accordance
with the methodology prescribed by subsection (3).
[15] Unless there is some reason to adopt a different meaning,
this meaning should prevail.  This requires a consideration of
the purpose and scheme of the legislation, and the consequences
of adopting this interpretation.  In making this determination,
all relevant indicators of legislative meaning must be taken into
account.
[16] There are a number of relevant indicators as to the
legislative intent that, in my view, point to adopting the
ordinary meaning of the legislation.  Section 19(3) refers to
&#147;used&#148;, rather than &#147;lawfully used&#148;.  In other legislation
dealing with related subjects, where the legislature has intended
that the lawful use be considered, it has done so expressly.  For
example, s. 14 of the Expropriations Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26
provides that the &quot;market value of land expropriated is the
amount that the land might be expected to realize if sold in the
open market by a willing seller to a willing buyer&quot;, which is the
same language used in s. 19(2) of the Assessment Act.  However,
s. 14 goes on to provide that in determining the market value of
land &#147;no account shall be taken of, &#133; (c) any increase in the
value of the land resulting from the land being put to a use that
could be restrained by any court or is contrary to law &#133;&#148;.  No
such language appears in s. 19.
[17] In this respect, I agree with the views of Sutherland J. in
McLear v. Mason (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 228 (H.C.J.) at 243.  That
case concerned the interpretation of a part of a zoning by-law
dealing with non-conforming uses and whether the applicable
provisions should be confined to previous legal non-conforming
uses. Sutherland J. held that the term &#147;lawfully&#148; should not be
read into the provision and that the by-law should be given its
plain meaning especially given the general approach to non-
conforming uses under the Planning Act, 1983.  As he said, terms
should not be implied into legislation except for compelling
reasons as where it may be necessary to avoid impossibility,
absurdity or gross conflict with other provisions or enactments.
[18] There is nothing in the legislative scheme of assessments
that suggests &#147;lawfully&#148; should be added to s. 19(3).  The scheme
of the Act is that the initial assessment is performed by
assessors who have no legal training or expertise.  The evidence
before the Board was that assessors determine the value of farm
lands without regard to the lawfulness or legality of the land
use, in part because they are not qualified to do so.  While the
assessors may be able to ascertain the zoning of a particular
piece of land, whether the use of the land as farm land is legal
or illegal involves different and more complex considerations.
As the Board pointed out, &quot;the issue of the 'legality' or the
'lawfulness' of a use is not necessarily one that can be
ascertained from a reading of the relevant Zoning By-law
provisions&quot;.  The Board pointed out that even the exercise of its
own jurisdiction does not lead to a declaration that a certain
use is legal or illegal.
[19] The respondents did not point to any obvious conflict with
other legislation that would require &#147;lawfully&#148; to be added to s.
19(3).  As pointed out by Henry J. in Re City of North York and
Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 10 (1981), 127
D.L.R. (3d) 637 (Ont. H.C.J.), the municipality has other means
of enforcing compliance with its zoning regime.  In that case,
Henry J. was considering s. 27(3) of the Assessment Act, R.S.O.
1970, c. 32, which is virtually identical to s. 19(3).  He
rejected the claim of the municipality that the lands in question
were not farm lands because they were zoned for industrial use.
He wrote as follows at pp. 640-41:</pre>
    <pre>          In  my  opinion,  the  position  taken  by the
	  respondent companies is  right.  In the  first
	  place,  the   lands   are   under   commercial
 	  cultivation  over  a substantial  acreage as I
	  find. By any reasonable test  of  lexicography
  	  or common sense, these are farm lands and that
	  is all that need be said.</pre>
    <pre>          Second,  s. 27(3)  of   the   Assessment  Act
          has   nothing  to  do  with  zoning;  it   is
          concerned  with  use: see Re County  Assessor
          for  Ontario County and Runnymede  Investment
          Corp. Ltd., [1966] 1 O.R. 577, 54 D.L.R. (2d)
          410  (Ont. C.A.); Re Roman Catholic Episcopal
          Corp.  of  Diocese of Hamilton  and  Town  of
          Stoney Creek, [1970] 2 O.R. 304.</pre>
    <pre>          Third,    s.  27   is    neutral    in    its
          application, in the sense that  it  takes  no
          account of the lawfulness or otherwise of the
          use  to  which the land is put,  whether  the
          user is breaching a contract, is a trespasser
          or as alleged here is contravening the zoning
          by-law. I find support for this conclusion in
          the judgment of Bowen J. in Norab Development
          Ltd.  v.  Alberta Assessment Appeal Board  et
          al. (1977), 3 A.R. 358.</pre>
    <pre>          Assuming, therefore, without  deciding,  that
	  the use of the lands contravenes By-law  7625
	  that  is  not  a  factor  to  be  taken  into
          account in assessing the lands for tax.
               &#133;
               In effect, the city has elected to allow
          the breach, as it sees it, to continue and to
          seek  a higher tax revenue by asserting  that
          the    respondent   companies   cannot   take
          advantage of the alleged unlawful use of  the
          lands by their tenants to reap a tax benefit.
          I  say simply, that the Assessment Act is not
          a  vehicle for enforcement of the by-law; the
          machinery  of  enforcement lies elsewhere  if
          the city chooses to use it. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[20]  Finally,  the ordinary meaning of s. 19(3)  appears  to  be
consistent  with  the  policy  of the  Legislature.   In  several
decisions,  the  Board has recognized that the policy  underlying
s.  19(3)  is  to  maintain farm land in production  as  long  as
possible,  and  to assist farmers as owners or  tenants  in  this
regard  although  the  lands undergo a change  of  ownership  and
change  of land use controls.  The intent also appears to  be  to
encourage developers and persons purchasing land with the  intent
of  ultimately  developing it to maintain  land  in  agricultural
production  as  long as possible.  The respondents conceded  that
this   was   the  policy  behind  the  legislation.   In   N.H.D.
Developments Ltd. v. Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region  11
(1981), 12 O.M.B.R. 332 at 337-38, the Board stated:</pre>
    <pre>
          The Board agrees that the sole intent of the
	  Legislature is to assist farmers in continuing
	  to farm land despite the pressures to sell the
	  land which would be particularly aggravated
          if their taxes were raised to the rate which
	  would be paid if the lands were not being utilized
	  for farm purposes.  It is the belief of this panel
	  of the Board that those purchasing lands with the
	  intent of subdividing are thereby also encouraged
	  to keep land in food production as long as possible.
	  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[21]  As  I  have  indicated, the appellants  also  rely  upon  a
subsequent  amendment  to  s.  19  as  further  evidence  of  the
Legislature&#146;s intent.  The new provision provides expressly  that
it is not necessary for the successor to subsection (3) &quot;to apply
to  farm  land  used  only  for farm purposes  that  the  use  be
permitted under municipal zoning by-laws&quot;. Sections 17 and 18  of
the  Interpretation  Act,  R.S.O.  1990,  c.  I.11  provide  that
amendment of an act shall be deemed not to be a declaration as to
the  previous state of the law or that the law under the act  was
considered by the Legislature to have been different from the law
as  amended. Thus, the Legislature&#146;s view at the relevant time is
embodied  in  its then existing enactments and  it  may  be  that
little  weight can be attached to this expression of  legislative
intent.   See R. v. Shirose (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 257  (S.C.C.)
at 285.  At most the new provision indicates that the Legislature
does  not consider that it is inconsistent with proper assessment
policy  that  the  particular  land  use  may  be  illegal,  thus
confirming the views of Henry J. in Re City of North York.
[22] The respondents argue that under the legislation in place at
the time of these assessments, zoning was not only relevant, but
determinative.  They suggest this interpretation of the relevant
sections:</pre>
    <pre>
          Subsection 19(3) does not create a wholly different
          valuation scheme.  Instead, it creates a special
	  rule for the application of Subsection 19(2) to
	  &#147;farm lands used only for farm purposes&#148;.  In
	  Subsection 19(2) market value is defined as &#147;the
          amount that the land might be expected to realize
	  if sold in the open market by a willing seller to
	  a willing buyer&#148;.</pre>
    <pre>               &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          In  other   words,   when   Subsection  19(3)
          applies,  the lands are valued  as  if  their
          highest and best use is for farm purposes and
          as  if they had been purchased by a full-time
          farmer.  No weight is given to the value  the
          lands might have for other uses.
               &#133;
                In  assessing &#147;farm lands used only for
          farm  purposes&#148;, the assessor is to determine
          the  amount  that the farm lands -  the  very
          farm lands forming the subject-matter of  the
          appeals  -  might be expected to  realize  if
          sold  in  the  open market to a person  whose
          principal occupation is farming.  If  farming
          may  not  be  carried on legally,  the  lands
          cannot  have a value to a farmer and must  be
          outside   the  special  valuation  rules   in
          Subsection 19(3). [Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[23]  I  cannot accept this interpretation of s. 19(3)  since  it
would require a reversal of the methodology mandated by s. 19  as
a whole.  Section 19(2) provides that &#147;subject to subsection (3)&#148;
the  market  value of land is assessed by its value  in  an  open
market.   The  assessor  therefore turns  to  subsection  (3)  to
determine if the rule of market value on the basis of sale on  an
open  market does not apply.  By its terms, subsection  (3)  sets
out  a method for ascertaining market value &#147;for farm lands  used
only for farm purposes&#148;.  If the lands fall, as a matter of fact,
within  this  description, the method mandated by subsection  (3)
must  be  used.  The other problem with the respondents&#146; argument
is that it is premised on the notion of a sale in the open market
&#150;  the  very  methodology  ousted by the  combined  operation  of
subsections (2) and (3).

               Previous decisions of the courts</pre>
    <pre>[24]  As I indicated, until the decision of the Divisional  Court
in   Amoco,  the  courts  have  interpreted  s.  19(3)  and   its
predecessors  as  holding that the fact  the  land  is  zoned  as
industrial  does  not preclude application of  the  section.  The
respondents correctly point out that in most of the decisions  it
is  not  clear that farming was actually an illegal  use,  as  is
alleged to be the case here.  It may be that in the earlier cases
the  farming use was a permitted non-conforming use.  An  example
is  the  decision of this court in Re County Assessor for Ontario
County  and Runnymede Investment Corp., [1966] 1 O.R. 577 (C.A.).
The appeal in that case was by way of stated case.  The facts  in
the stated case were as follows:

          The respondent is a corporate entity which purchased
	  in 1964 from the Receiver and Manager of Principal
	  Investments Limited, about 365 acres of vacant land
	  in the Township of Pickering, in the County of
	  Ontario zoned &#145;industrial&#146;.  In the year 1964 the
          Respondent commenced to farm the whole of the lands
	  and did grow and harvest during the year 1964 a crop
	  of buckwheat.  The Respondent is an investment
	  company which acquired these lands for speculative
	  and investment purposes and although it farms other
	  lands which it owns its chief occupation or business
	  is other than farming.  The assessment was made
	  against the Respondent without application of 
	  s. 35(3) of The Assessment Act.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[25]  The  County  Court Judge who heard  the  appeal  from  this
assessment  held  that the lands were not properly  assessed  and
that the lands were farm lands used only for farm purposes by the
respondent and therefore entitled to the benefit of s.  35(3)  of
the  former  Act, a predecessor to s. 19(3).  In  brief  reasons,
this  court  held that the County Court Judge was  right  in  his
construction of the meaning and effect of the provision.
[26] I have already referred to the decision of Henry J. in City
of North York.  The respondents are again correct in pointing out
that there was no express finding that agricultural use was an
illegal use.  On the other hand, it is also clear from the
excerpts set out above that Henry J decided the case on the basis
that such a use was illegal.

               The decision in Amoco</pre>
    <pre>[27]  The  respondents  rely heavily upon  the  decision  of  the
Divisional Court in Amoco.  The appellants rightly point out that
Amoco  can be distinguished on the facts.  The facts as disclosed
in  the decision of the Board, reported as Dome Petroleum Ltd. v.
Ontario (Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 27) (1992),
28  O.M.B.R. 47, show that when Dome Petroleum Limited  purchased
the  property in 1978 it was industrially zoned vacant land  that
was  subject to the reservation of a salt-mine operation that was
ongoing below the surface.  The company decided to farm the  land
in  1987.  The farmer approached by the company to farm the  land
indicated  that the land had not been maintained  for  years  and
needed  &#147;cleaning up&#148;.  A fifty-foot wide paved road ran  through
the  property to the main section of the Amoco operation.   There
were  a  number of drainage ditches on the property  as  well  as
active  and inactive well-heads, apparently related to the  salt-
mine  operation.  As a result, the property was  divided  into  a
number  of small parcels that were covered by weeds, grasses  and
scrub and some of the land was marshy.  The farmer was only  able
to farm a little over one-half of the land.
[28] The Board concluded that the property was not &#147;farm lands
used only for farm purposes&#148;.  It pointed out that the property
was in an industrial area in the core of the city, that there
were no other agricultural uses in the vicinity, that the lands
were designated for what was described as &#147;more intense&#148;
industrial use and had been zoned for that purpose since 1948,
that the zoning did not permit agricultural uses and it had not
been cultivated or farmed from that time until 1987.  It also
took into account that the property could not legally be
developed and used for an agricultural purpose.  Based on those
facts, it was open to the Board to find that the property did not
constitute farms lands used only for farm purposes.
[29] On appeal by the company, Adams J. wrote the reasons for the
Divisional Court.  He held as follows at p. 357 of the reasons:</pre>
    <pre>
          We do not find any error in law with the Board&#146;s
	  approach.  The Board did not find that the
  	  industrial zoning was determinative in the sense
	  of holding that land zoned industrial could never
	  qualify as farm land for the purposes of s. 19(3).
          Rather, the Board took into account all of the 
	  circumstances before it. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[30]  I  agree with that part of the reasons of Adams J.   It  is
consistent  with an earlier decision of Sweet Co. Ct.  J.  in  Re
Roman  Catholic Episcopal Corporation of the Diocese of  Hamilton
and  Town of Stoney Creek, [1970] 2 O.R. 304 who held as  follows
at p. 307:</pre>
    <pre>
          I am of the opinion that the zoning and permitted
	  use of these lands and the development for
	  residential purposes to the extent that it now
	  exists in their vicinity, are not items to be
          taken into consideration in determining whether
	  or not these lands come within the category of
	  lands dealt with in s. 35(3).
         
          It  would  be  my  view   that   there  could
          possibly be cases where permitted use, zoning
          and  use of surrounding lands and the general
          nature  of  the locality would be factors  in
          determining whether or not a parcel  of  land
          is  farm  land  within  the  meaning  of  the
          legislation.   Certainly common  sense  would
          impel an assessor not to treat as farm lands,
          a parcel of vacant land at the corner of King
          and Yonge Sts. in Toronto or at the corner of
          King  and  James  Sts.  in  Hamilton,  merely
          because  the owner, for whatever reason,  may
          have   decided  to  plant  it  in   tomatoes.
          However, this is a far cry from the situation
          existing here.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[31]  However, in Amoco Adams J. then went on to hold as  follows
at p. 358:</pre>
    <pre>
          In any event, it is our view that the zoning, in 
	  this particular case was determinative because an
	  industrial use was the only permitted use on the
	  express wording of the by-law.   Therefore, the
	  agricultural activity on this land was in
          violation of the zoning by-law and was unlawful.
	  We do not accept that s. 19(3) of the Assessment
	  Act envisages a use which is expressly proscribed
	  by law.  In Re County Assessor for Ontario County
	  and Runnymede Investment Corp. Ltd., [1966] 1 O.R.
          577, the Ontario Court of Appeal did not hold that
	  an unlawful use fell within the meaning of the
	  subsection.  Similarly, Re City of North York and
	  Regional Assessment Commissioner, Region No. 10
	  (1981), 127 D.L.R. (3d) 637, does not assist the
          appellant.  In that case, the land had been assessed
	  as farm land since the mid l960's and where,
	  accordingly, the owner was not acting &quot;without
 	  colour of right&quot;.  [Emphasis in original.]</pre>
    <pre>[32] For the reasons set out above, I cannot agree with this part
of  the  decision.   Further, it seems to me that  Adams  J.  has
misconstrued  the reasons of Henry J. in the City of  North  York
case.   Henry J. held that s. 19(3) applied even if  the  use  as
farm land was illegal.1</pre>
    <pre>CONCLUSION</pre>
    <pre>[33]  In  my view the Divisional Court erred in holding that  the
industrial  zoning  was determinative of the  application  of  s.
19(3),  even  if farm use was illegal.  Whether lands  are  &#147;farm
lands  used  only for farm purposes&#148; is a question  of  fact  and
there was a basis upon which the Board could reasonably find that
the lands in question in this appeal fell within that phrase.  On
the other hand, as I have indicated, I would not hold that zoning
(as  opposed  to legality or illegality) is entirely  irrelevant.
It is one circumstance that the assessor or the Board is entitled
to consider, as discussed by Sweet Co. Ct. J. in the passage from
Re  Roman  Catholic  Episcopal  Corporation  of  the  Diocese  of
Hamilton and Town of Stoney Creek, set out above.  It also  seems
to  me  that  this interpretation is consistent with  the  recent
amendment to the section.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION</pre>
    <pre>[34]  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the  order
of  the  Divisional Court and restore the order  of  the  Ontario
Municipal Board.  The appellants are entitled to their  costs  in
this court, including the costs of the application for leave, and
to  their costs in the Divisional Court from the respondents.   I
would not make any costs order against the interveners.</pre>
