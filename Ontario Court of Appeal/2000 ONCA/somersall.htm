    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Harvey Spiegel

</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CHARRON J.A.:</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal concerns the right of an insured person to claim
against  his own insurer under the underinsured motorist coverage
of  an  Ontario Standard Automobile Policy when the right of  the
insured  to enforce a claim against the tortfeasor has been  lost
or compromised.
[2]  On January 29, 1989, the appellants, Pearl Somersall and
Gwendolyn Somersall, were involved in a motor vehicle accident
with the vehicle owned and operated by the respondent Jerry
Friedman. They both sustained serious bodily injury as a result
of the accident. On January 28, 1991, they issued a Statement of
Claim against Friedman. The appellant Janice Somersall joined the
action to claim damages under the Family Law Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c. F.3 on her behalf and on behalf of other family members. On
September 12, 1991, Friedman delivered a Statement of Defence.
[3]  As a result of an exchange of various correspondence during
the months of October to December 1991, the following agreement
was concluded between the appellants&#146; solicitor and Friedman&#146;s
solicitor:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre> Friedman would admit liability for the accident at trial;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> the appellants would not make any claim against Friedman or
 his insurer in excess of Friedman&#146;s insurance policy limits
 of $200,000.00; and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre> Friedman&#146;s insurer would (and did) make an advance payment
 of $50,000 to the appellants.
       </pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>For  the sake of convenience, this agreement will be referred  to
as the &#147;Limits Agreement.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre>[4]  On July 4, 1994, the appellants added their own insurer, the
respondent Scottish &amp; York Insurance  Co. Limited (&#147;S &amp; Y&#148;), as a
defendant  to the action. S &amp; Y filed a Statement of  Defence  to
the  action and cross-claimed against Friedman. Friedman  amended
his  Statement  of  Defence to plead  the  terms  of  the  Limits
Agreement.
[5]  Counsel for the appellants and S &amp; Y both moved pursuant to
Rule 21.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990,
Reg. 194, for the determination, before trial, of the following
question of law raised by the pleadings:

     Does  the  agreement reached between  counsel  for  the
     plaintiffs  and  counsel  for  the  defendant  Friedman
     limiting  the  plaintiffs' claim  to  that  defendant&#146;s
     policy limits preclude the plaintiffs from advancing  a
     claim   against  Scottish  &amp;  York  pursuant   to   the
     Underinsured Motorist Provisions of its policy?
     
[6]   The  appellants&#146; claim against S &amp; Y  is  pursuant  to  the
underinsured coverage provisions, the S.E.F. 44 Family Protection
Endorsement,  contained in an Ontario Standard Automobile  Policy
issued  to the appellant Pearl Somersall. Under these provisions,
S &amp; Y is obligated to:</pre>
    <pre>          
     &#147;indemnify each eligible claimant for the amount that
     such eligible claimant is legally entitled to recover
     from an inadequately insured motorist as compensatory
     damages in respect of bodily injury or death sustained
     by an insured person by accident arising out of the use
     or operation of an automobile.&#148;  [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[7]   The  question for determination on the motion and  on  this
appeal turns on the interpretation of the words &quot;legally entitled
to  recover.&quot;  These words appear repeatedly  in  the  S.E.F.  44
endorsement,  the relevant parts of which are appended  to  these
reasons for ease of reference.
[8]  Spiegel J. held that the appellants, by reason of having
entered into the Limits Agreement, were no longer &#147;entitled to
recover&#148; damages from the underinsured motorist Friedman within
the meaning of the underinsured coverage provision. He therefore
answered the Rule 21.01 question in the affirmative. It was
agreed between the parties at the hearing of the motion that, if
the answer was in the affirmative, the action against S &amp; Y
should be dismissed. Consequently, by order dated June 4, 1998,
the motions judge dismissed the appellants&#146; action against S &amp; Y.
The appellants appeal against this order and S &amp; Y is a
respondent on the appeal. Friedman did not participate in the
appeal.
[9]  Although the precise question before Spiegel J. was novel,
it is my view that its answer was governed by existing
jurisprudence from this court and that the motions judge, on the
strength of those authorities, was bound to answer it in the
negative. The motions judge carefully considered these
authorities but distinguished them from the fact situation at
hand. With respect, it is my view that he erred in doing so.
[10] S &amp; Y takes the position that the words &#147;legally entitled to
recover&#148; mean that the appellants must have a legally enforceable
right to recover compensatory damages from the tortfeasor in an
amount which is in excess of the tortfeasor&#146;s insurance limits.
Since the Limits Agreement has effectively extinguished that
right, S &amp; Y argues that the appellants&#146; claim under the S.E.F.
44 endorsement must fail. Alternatively, S &amp; Y submits that, even
if the appellants are still &#147;legally entitled to recover&#148; from
the tortfeasor within the meaning of the insuring agreement, they
have significantly interfered with S &amp; Y&#146;s right of subrogation
by entering into the Limits Agreement and have therefore lost
their right to claim the benefits of the S.E.F. 44 endorsement.
[11] The appellants take the position that it has been
authoritatively determined by this court in Johnson v. Wunderlich
(1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 600 (C.A.) and in Chambo v. Musseau (1993),
15 O.R. (2d) 305 (C.A.) that they have a direct right of action
in contract against S &amp; Y under the S.E.F. 44 endorsement. They
submit that these authorities make it clear that this right of
action can accrue regardless of whether they  commence an action
against the tortfeasor, obtain a judgment against him, or still
have an enforceable claim against him. The requirement that they
be &#147;legally entitled to recover damages&#148; against the tortfeasor,
as interpreted in those authorities, simply means that, in their
action against the S &amp; Y, the appellants must establish (1) that
the tortfeasor is at fault and (2) the amount of damages caused
by such fault. Consequently, the appellants submit that, even if
they are precluded under the terms of the Limits Agreement from
claiming an amount against Friedman in excess of his policy
limits, they can still establish that he was at fault and the
amount of their damages and therefore are entitled to assert
their claim against S &amp; Y under the S.E.F. 44 endorsement. With
respect to the subrogation issue, the appellants take the
position that the Limits Agreement does not interfere with S &amp;
Y&#146;s rights of subrogation. Alternatively, if the Limits Agreement
does interfere with S &amp; Y&#146;s rights, they submit, on the strength
of the same authorities, that this effect is not fatal to their
claim.
[12] In my view, the appellants&#146; position is correct. The
decision of the motions judge runs counter to the principles
established by this court in Johnson v. Wunderlich and in Chambo
v. Musseau.  Spiegel J. held that the interpretation of the words
&#147;legally entitled to recover&#148; in those cases &#147;should be
restricted to cases where the insured&#146;s right to proceed against
the tortfeasor is barred by virtue of a limitation period.&#148;1
Quite apart from the fact that this was not the fact situation in
Johnson v. Wunderlich (the insured had commenced an action
against the tortfeasor within the limitation period), I see no
principled reason to restrict the application of these
authorities to cases involving the expiry of a limitation period.
[13] In Johnson v. Wunderlich, the plaintiffs were involved in a
motor vehicle accident which occurred in June 1980. They
commenced an action against the tortfeasor in May 1982, within
the two-year limitation period contained in s.180(1) of the
Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 198. In October 1982, the
plaintiffs added their own insurer as defendant to the action in
order to claim under the uninsured motorist coverage of their
policy. By s.8(2) in the schedule to s.1 in R.R.O. 1980, Reg.535,
under the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1980, c.218, &quot;every action or
proceeding against the insurer for the recovery of a claim shall
be commenced within two years from the date on which the cause of
action against the insurer arose and not afterwards.&#148; At the
commencement of the trial, the insurer brought a motion to
determine whether the plaintiffs&#146; action was statute-barred. The
trial judge held that the action was statute-barred because it
had not been commenced within two years of the accident. An
appeal to this court was allowed.
[14] In determining the appeal, Morden J.A., in writing for the
majority, thoroughly reviewed the relevant legislation and the
various options open to an insured person seeking to recover
under the uninsured motorist coverage provisions of an insurance
policy. In particular, he reviewed the provisions of s.4(1)(c) of
Regulation 535 (now R.R.O. Reg. 676), which provisions are also
applicable to the appellants&#146; claim in this case under the
underinsured motorist coverage provisions of the insurance
policy:
          </pre>
    <pre>               4(1) The determination as to whether the
	  person insured under the contract is legally
	  entitled to recover damages and, if so entitled,
	  the amount thereof shall be determined,
          </pre>
    <pre>                (a)  by  agreement between  the  person
          insured under the contract and the insurer,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b) at the request of the person insured
          under  the contract, and with the consent  of
          the insurer, by arbitration by some person to
          be  chosen by both parties, or if they cannot
          agree on one person, then by two persons, one
          to  be chosen by the person insured under the
          contract and the other by the insurer  and  a
          third  person to be appointed by the  persons
          so chosen; or
          </pre>
    <pre>               (c) by a court of competent jurisdiction
          in  Ontario in an action brought against  the
          insurer  by  the  person  insured  under  the
          contract,  and  unless the determination  has
          been previously made in a contested action by
          a court of competent jurisdiction in Ontario,
          the  insurer  may include in its defence  the
          determination  of liability  and  the  amount
          thereof.
</pre>
    <pre>[15]  The  parties  before the court in  Johnson  v.  Wunderlich,
including  the Minister of Consumer and Commercial  Relations  as
intervener,  took  the position that it was open  to  an  insured
under  s.4(1)(c)  to claim directly against the  insurer  without
first  claiming  against  or obtaining  a  judgment  against  the
tortfeasor.  Morden  J.A.  expressly  agreed  that  s.4(1)(c)  so
provided.   He   adopted   this   interpretation   despite   some
reservations which he expressed as follows at p. 608:</pre>
    <pre>          
     The reservation that I expressed about this is 
     primarily based on the concern that a claim confined
     to the direct-action route could result in the
     insurer&#146;s subrogation rights being frustrated (see
     Royal Ins. Co. of Canada v. Aguiar (1984), 48
     O.R. (2d) 705, 16 D.L.R. (4th) 477&#133;) as well as the
     insurer&#146;s inability to confine its liability to the
     balance of what is owed on a judgment obtained against
     the tortfeasor (see s.5(2) of the Schedule). If,
     however, my interpretation, and apparently that of
     the parties, does not reflect the intention of the
     drafters the necessary correction lies close to hand
     in the form of an amendment to Reg. 535.
</pre>
    <pre>[16]  Morden J.A. then defined the elements of the direct  action
against the insurer (at 608-09):</pre>
    <pre>          
     Accepting, then, that a direct action for recovery is
     authorized by s.4(1)(c) I think that the elements of
     this cause of action are (1) a person insured (2) who
     is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner
     or driver of (3) an uninsured or unidentified automobile.
     &#133;The cause of action accrues when the plaintiff (the
     person insured) has discovered these material facts or
     ought to have discovered them by the exercise of
     reasonable diligence: see Judy et al. v. Neal (1986),
     57 O.R. (2d) 129 (C.A.)

     &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>     The words &#147;legally entitled to recover&#148; do not
     import a requirement that this issue must have 
     received a prior judicial determination but,
     rather, simply that the person insured must  
     establish that the uninsured or unidentified
     owner or driver is at fault and the amount of
     damages: [authorities omitted.] [Emphasis added.]
</pre>
    <pre>[17]  In the end result, the court in Johnson v. Wunderlich  held
that the plaintiffs&#146; cause of action did not necessarily arise on
the  date  of  the  accident. It only arose when  the  plaintiffs
discovered,  or  ought  to have discovered,  the  material  facts
giving rise to the right of action, which included the fact  that
the  tortfeasor  was uninsured. Since the facts set  out  in  the
motion material did not reveal when the plaintiffs had discovered
all of the material facts, it could not be determined whether the
action was statute-barred. The order appealed from was set  aside
and the matter remitted for trial.
[18] The recognition that an insured has a direct right of action
against his insurer which does not require a prior judicial
determination of liability against the tortfeasor is crucial in
the determination of the question on this appeal. It means that
the appellants can bring their action against S &amp; Y without
exhausting their remedies against Friedman. The necessary
elements of the action are (1) an eligible claimant (2) who is
legally entitled to recover compensatory damages from a motorist
(3) who is inadequately insured. For the purposes of this appeal,
we can assume that the appellants are eligible claimants and that
Friedman is inadequately insured. As determined in Johnson v.
Wunderlich, in order to prove that they are legally entitled to
recover compensatory damages against Friedman, the appellants
need only establish that Friedman was at fault in the accident
and damages caused by such fault in excess of Friedman&#146;s
insurance policy limits. If there was any doubt after Johnson v.
Wunderlich on the question whether it was necessary for the
insured to also establish that any right of action that he may
have against the tortfeasor was still subsisting, it is my view
that the issue was put to rest in Chambo v. Musseau.
[19] In Chambo v. Musseau, the plaintiff Chambo was injured in a
motor vehicle accident which she alleged was caused by the
negligence of David Musseau who was driving an uninsured car
owned by Albert Musseau. Two years and four days after the
accident, she commenced an action in negligence against the
Musseaus and against her own insurer under the uninsured motorist
coverage of her insurance policy. The insurer moved for summary
judgment under Rule 20 of the Rules of Civil Procedure on the
ground that the plaintiff&#146;s failure to commence her action within
two years of the accident as prescribed under the Highway Traffic
Act was fatal to her action against the owner and the driver and,
consequently, also fatal to her claim against the insurer since
she could not establish that she was &#147;legally entitled to recover
damages&#148; against  the uninsured owner and driver. The motions
judge accepted this argument and dismissed the plaintiff&#146;s
action. On appeal, this court rejected the insurer&#146;s argument and
held that the motions judge erred in dismissing the action
against the insurer.
[20] Osborne J.A., in writing for the court, referred extensively
to the judgment in Johnson v. Wunderlich and reiterated that an
insured person can make a claim directly against the insurer.
The court noted that the claim against the insurer is different
from that against the tortfeasor. It is based in contract and is
subject to its own limitation period. As in Johnson v.
Wunderlich, the judgment of the motions judge was set aside and
the matter was remitted for trial because the motion material did
not establish when the plaintiff discovered that the Musseau
vehicle was uninsured. Hence, it could not be determined on this
motion for summary judgment whether the action was statute-
barred.
[21] The court in Chambo v. Musseau reiterated that &#147;the words
&#145;legally entitled to recover damages&#146; require the insured person
to establish only that the uninsured tortfeasor is at fault and
the quantum of the insured person's damages.&#148; The court held
further, at p. 314, that:
          </pre>
    <pre>     [i]n relation to her direct action against the [insurer],
     the appellant does not have to establish that her action
     against the tortfeasors was commenced within the time
     prescribed in s.180(1) of the Highway Traffic Act. That
     is a non-issue in the direct action against the [insurer],
     whether or not the uninsured tortfeasors were also named
     as defendants in the action.
</pre>
    <pre>[22]  Quite clearly, if this court in Chambo v. Musseau had  been
of  the view that it was necessary for the plaintiff to establish
that   her  right  of  action  against  the  Musseaus  was  still
enforceable  in  order to succeed against  the  insurer,  as  the
insurer contends in this case, it would have reached the opposite
result.  Based on the reasoning advanced by S &amp; Y in  this  case,
the  insurer in Chambo v. Musseau would have been entitled  to  a
dismissal of the action because the plaintiff&#146;s claim against the
tortfeasors was prescribed by statute and no longer enforceable.
[23] I see no principled reason to distinguish this case from the
fact situation in Chambo v. Musseau. The fact that the appellants
have compromised their right of action against the tortfeasor by
entering into an agreement, as opposed to having missed a
limitation period, can be of no moment. Surely missing a
limitation period is the worst compromise of the action that can
be made. Even if the Limits Agreement was found to have
interfered with the insurer&#146;s rights of subrogation, a question
which does not have to be determined on this appeal, it would not
advance the insurer&#146;s position since the missing of a limitation
period by a plaintiff against a tortfeasor also defeats an
insurer&#146;s subrogated claim: see Royal Insurance Co. of Canada v.
Aguiar (1984), 48 O.R. (2d) 705 (C.A.).
[24] The appellants&#146; position is also supported by another
decision of this court in Beausoleil v. Canadian General
Insurance Co. (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 754 (C.A.). The plaintiff
Beausoleil was injured in a motor vehicle accident in
Massachusetts and suffered substantial damages. He commenced an
action against the tortfeasors in Massachusetts but the maximum
that he could expect to recover from the insurers of the
defendants in Massachusetts  was $50,000. Beausoleil therefore
commenced an action against his own insurer under the
underinsured motorist coverage of his policy. A motion was
brought to determine whether the action against the insurer was
premature because Beausoleil had not first obtained a judgment
against the tortfeasors and exhausted his remedies against them.
The motions judge held that the action was premature and issued
judgment accordingly. The decision was reversed on appeal to this
court.
[25] This court in Beausoleil considered the provisions of the
applicable S.E.F. 42 endorsement, noting that the endorsement had
been replaced by S.E.F. 44 but that there was no essential
distinction in the terms, and concluded, at p. 758, that the
words &#147;legally entitled  to recover&#148; did &#147;not require a judgment
and most certainly [did] not require that the insured exhaust his
remedies under that judgment.&#148; The court referred extensively to
the decision in Johnson v. Wunderlich and rejected the argument
that the case should be distinguished on the basis that it dealt
with the uninsured motorist coverage as opposed to the
underinsured motorist coverage. Grange J.A., in writing for the
court, noted Morden J.A.&#146;s reservations as expressed in Johnson
v. Wunderlich on the issue of subrogation and stated as follows
(at p.760):
          </pre>
    <pre>               In any event, the concern over the insurer&#146;s
	  subrogation rights cannot affect the rights of the
	  insured to recover under this policy. As Morden
	  J.A. put it &#147;the necessary correction lies close
	  to hand in the form of an amendment to&#148; S.E.F. 42.
          </pre>
    <pre>                I  might  just add here  that  the  new
          S.E.F.  No. 44 does contain a specific clause
          subrogating the insurer to the rights of  the
          insured. I am not sure why this was necessary
          in  light  of the general subrogation  rights
          given  by s.278 of the Insurance Act,  R.S.O.
          1990, c.I.8.
</pre>
    <pre>[26]  I  note further that s.278(6) of the Insurance Act,  R.S.O.
1990,  c.  I.8  provides that &#147;[a] settlement  or  release  given
before  or after an action is brought does not bar the rights  of
the  insured or the insurer, as the case may be, unless they have
concurred  therein.&#148; In any event, it is not necessary to  decide
whether  S  &amp;  Y&#146;s  rights of subrogation have in  any  way  been
compromised  in this case.  Further, it would not be  appropriate
to  decide this issue since Friedman did not participate  in  the
appeal.
[27] There is one further argument made by S &amp; Y that I wish to
comment upon. S &amp; Y submits that, if the appellants&#146; position is
correct, it could mean that even if a plaintiff&#146;s claim against a
tortfeasor is barred for any reason, including the operation of
the various &#147;no-fault&#148; regimes in effect in Ontario since June of
1990, the plaintiff&#146;s claim against an insurer under the
uninsured or the underinsured motorist coverage could still be
maintained, so long as the plaintiff could establish fault on the
part of the tortfeasor and damages. Hence, it is argued, a
decision of this court in favour of the appellants would serve to
defeat the statutory regime presently in place in Ontario in all
cases where there is an uninsured or underinsured motorist
involved. S &amp; Y advanced the same argument in first instance, and
the appellants conceded before Spiegel J. (a position they no
longer maintain) that this result would be a logical extension of
the position they were advancing. The motions judge found the
argument compelling. He stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>     This would result in a situation that a person injured by
     the negligence of an uninsured or inadequately insured
     tortfeasor would be in a better position than if the
     tortfeasor was fully insured. I am not prepared to
     interpret the words in question in a manner which would
     create such an anomalous result.
</pre>
    <pre>[28] Consequently, the motions judge held that the interpretation
of  the words &#147;legally entitled to recover&#148; adopted in Johnson v.
Wunderlich  and  reiterated  in  Chambo  v.  Musseau  should   be
restricted to cases where the insured&#146;s right to proceed  against
the tortfeasor is barred by virtue of a limitation period.
[29] I do not accept the argument advanced by S &amp; Y. It ignores
the fact that, as discussed earlier, one of the elements that
must be established by the insured in a claim against the insurer
is that the uninsured or underinsured person is &#147;at fault&#148;. The
determination of &#147;fault&#148; must be made in the context of all
applicable laws. In my view, an insured could not successfully
argue that an uninsured or underinsured motorist is &#147;at fault&#148; if
the injuries caused by such alleged &#147;fault&#148; were sustained in a
motor vehicle accident occurring in a jurisdiction governed by a
&#147;no-fault&#148; regime, unless the insured can meet the requirements
under the particular regime. Indeed, one of the cases relied upon
by S &amp; Y is consistent with this approach. See MacKenzie v.
Zurich Insurance Co. (1990),  65 D.L.R. (4th) 765 (Ont. High Ct.)
where the court held that no claim lies in Ontario on an
underinsured motorist endorsement unless the person responsible
for the accident is &#147;legally liable.&#148; Since the accident occurred
in the Province of Quebec and Quebec law provided for a no fault
compensation scheme, the underinsured motorist was not liable and
the endorsement did not apply.
[30] Finally, I wish to make a few comments on those cases relied
upon by S. &amp; Y that may appear to be in conflict with the
position advanced by the appellants.
[31] S &amp; Y relies on two cases from Alberta, Fogarty v. Co-
operators Group Limited, [1990] ILR 1-2545 (Alta Q.B.) and
Nielson v. Co-operators General Insurance, [1997] A.J. No. 1108
(Alta. C.A.). In Fogarty, the plaintiff commenced an action
against the Estate of the deceased tortfeasor after the expiry of
a limitation period. She later agreed to discontinue her action
against the Estate and also consented to a judgment distributing
certain insurance proceeds amongst various claimants of the
Estate. The judgment expressly dismissed the plaintiff&#146;s claim
and set out that her action had been commenced outside the
limitation period. The plaintiff then commenced an action against
her own insurer under the underinsured motorist endorsement of
her policy, the S.E.F. 42. The endorsement provided that the
determination of legal liability and amount of damages could be
made by agreement or by arbitration in language equivalent to
s.4(1)(a) and (b) of the Ontario Regulation 535, set out earlier
in this judgment.  The court held, at p. 9908, that the plaintiff
could no longer maintain her action against the insurer for the
following reason:
          </pre>
    <pre>    I am respectfully of the view that once there has been a
    final judicial decision dealing with the matter of
    liability of the tort-feasor owner-operator vis-à-vis
    the insured, it is no longer reasonably possible to
    refer that judicially determined matter for agreement
    or arbitration under s.4 of S.E.F. No. 42.  In the case
    at bar, the insured, having consented to a judgment-
    which judgment was entered &#150; dismissing the liability
    claim of the insured against the tort-feasor owner and
    driver, the insured has thereby foreclosed its opportunity
    to prove by arbitration or otherwise that plaintiff is
    &#147;legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator&#148;
    under S.E.F. NO. 42.
</pre>
    <pre>[32]  It is important to note that the Alberta S.E.F. No.  42  in
question did not provide that liability and the amount of damages
could also be determined &#147;by a Court of competent jurisdiction in
Ontario  in  an action brought against the insurer by the  person
insured  under  the contract&#133;&#148; as provided in  s.4(1)(c)  of  the
Ontario  regulation. It will be recalled that it is on the  basis
of  this  court&#146;s  interpretation  of  s.4(1)(c)  in  Johnson  v.
Wunderlich and in cases that follow that the principles  relating
to the &#147;direct action&#148; were established. As evidenced by the case
in Fogarty, the Alberta provision does not contain the equivalent
to  our  s.4(1)(c).  It follows that both  the  Fogarty  and  the
Nielson  cases can be of limited assistance. I note further  that
the  Nielson  decision  is  a nine-line  memorandum  of  judgment
delivered orally by the Alberta Court of Appeal that provides  no
analysis.
[33] For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside
paragraph 1 of the order of Spiegel J. dated June 4, 1998, and
instead, declare that the question of law raised by the pleadings
be answered as follows:

     Does  the  agreement reached between  counsel  for  the
     plaintiffs  and  counsel  for  the  defendant  Friedman
     limiting  the  plaintiffs' claim  to  that  defendant&#146;s
     policy limits preclude the plaintiffs from advancing  a
     claim   against  Scottish  &amp;  York  pursuant   to   the
     Underinsured Motorist Provisions of its policy?
     </pre>
    <pre>     No.
     

[34]  I would also allow the appellants their costs of the motion
and of the appeal.</pre>

</pre>
    <pre>2.   INSURING AGREEMENT</pre>
    <pre>     In  consideration of the premium charged and subject to  the
     provisions  hereof,  it is understood and  agreed  that  the
     Insurer  shall  indemnify  each eligible  claimant  for  the
     amount  that  such eligible claimant is legally entitled  to
     recover   from   an   inadequately   insured   motorist   as
     compensatory  damages in respect of bodily injury  or  death
     sustained  by an insured person by accident arising  out  of
     the use or operation of an automobile.
</pre>
    <pre>3.   LIMIT OF COVERAGE UNDER THIS ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  The Insurer's maximum liability under this endorsement,
          regardless  of  the  number of eligible  claimants,  or
          number  of insured persons injured or killed, or number
          of  automobiles insured under the policy shall  be  the
          amount by which the Limit of Family Protection Coverage
          exceeds  the  total  of  all limits  of  motor  vehicle
          liability  insurance, or bonds, or  cash  deposits,  or
          other  financial guarantees as required by law in  lieu
          of such insurance, of the inadequately insured motorist
          and of any person jointly liable therewith.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Where this endorsement applies as excess, the Insurer's
          maximum liability under this endorsement is that amount
          determined in accordance with paragraph 3(a)  less  the
          amounts available to eligible claimants under any first
          loss  insurance as referred to in paragraph 7  of  this
          endorsement.
</pre>
    <pre>4.   AMOUNT PAYABLE PER ELIGIBLE CLAIMANT
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  The  amount  payable  under  this  endorsement  to  any
          eligible  claimant shall be ascertained by  determining
          the  amount of damages the eligible claimant is legally
          entitled  to  recover  from  the  inadequately  insured
          motorist  and deducting from that amount the  aggregate
          of the amounts referred to in paragraph 4(b), but in no
          event shall the Insurer be obliged to pay any amount in
          excess  of  the  limit of coverage as determined  under
          paragraph 3 of this endorsement.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  The amount payable under this endorsement to any eligible
          claimant is excess to any amount actually recovered by the
          eligible claimant from any source (other than money payable
	  on death under a policy of insurance) and is excess to any
	  amounts the eligible claimant is entitled to recover (whether
	  such entitlement is pursued or not) from:</pre>
    <pre>          (i)    the insurers of the inadequately insured motorist,
                 and from bonds, cash deposits or other financial
                 guarantees given on behalf of the inadequately
                 insured motorist;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (ii)   the insurers of any person jointly liable with the
                 inadequately insured motorist for the damages
                 sustained by an insured person;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iii)  the Régie de l'assurance automobile du Québec;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iv)   an unsatisfied judgment fund or similar plan or
                 which would have been payable by such fund or plan
                 had this endorsement not been in effect;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (v)    the uninsured motorist coverage of a motor
		 vehicle liability policy;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (vi)   any automobile accident benefits plan applicable
                 in the jurisdiction in which the accident occurred;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (vii)  any policy of insurance providing disability
                 benefits or loss of income benefits or medical
                 expense or rehabilitation benefits;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (viii) any Worker's Compensation Act or similar law
                 of the jurisdiction applicable to the injury or
                 death sustained;
          </pre>
    <pre>          (ix)   any Family Protection Coverage of a motor
                 vehicle liability policy.</pre>
    <pre>     . . .
</pre>
    <pre>5.   DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT AN ELIGIBLE
     CLAIMANT IS LEGALLY ENTITLED TO RECOVER
     </pre>
    <pre>     (a)  The   amount  that  an  eligible  claimant  is  legally
          entitled  to recover shall be determined in  accordance
          with the procedures set forth for determination of  the
          issues  of  quantum  and  liability  by  the  uninsured
          motorist coverage provisions of the policy.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  In  determining  the  amount an  eligible  claimant  is
          legally  entitled  to  recover  from  the  inadequately
          insured motorist, issues of quantum shall be decided in
          accordance  with the law of the province governing  the
          policy  and  issues of liability shall  be  decided  in
          accordance with the law of the place where the accident
          occurred.
     </pre>
    <pre>     (c)  In  determining  any  amounts an eligible  claimant  is
          legally  entitled  to  recover,  no  amount  shall   be
          included   with   respect   to  pre-judgment   interest
          accumulating  prior  to  notice  as  required  by  this
          endorsement.</pre>
    <pre>     . . .
</pre>
    <pre>6.   PROCEDURES</pre>
    <pre>     (a)  The following requirements are conditions precedent  to
          the  liability of the Insurer to the eligible  claimant
          under this endorsement:</pre>
    <pre>          (i)   the  eligible claimant shall promptly give written
                notice,  with  all available particulars,  of  any
                accident  involving injury or death to an  insured
                person  and  of any claim made on account  of  the
                accident,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (ii)  the  eligible  claimant  shall,  if  so  required,
                provide  details  of  any policies  of  insurance,
                other  than life insurance, to which the  eligible
                claimant may have recourse,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (iii) the  eligible claimant and the insured person
                shall  submit to examination under oath, and shall
                produce  for examination at such reasonable  place
                and  time as is designated by the Insurer  or  its
                representative, all documents in their  possession
                or control that relate to the matters in question,
                and  they shall permit extracts and copies thereof
                to be made.
          </pre>
    <pre>     (b)  Where an eligible claimant commences a legal action for
          damages  for bodily injury or death against  any  other
          person  owning or operating an automobile  involved  in
          the  accident, a copy of the Writ of Summons  or  other
          initiating  process  shall  be  delivered  or  sent  by
          registered mail immediately to the chief agency or head
          office  of  the  Insurer in the province together  with
          particulars of the insurance and loss.</pre>
    <pre>     (c)  Every  action  or  proceeding against the  Insurer  for
          recovery  under  this endorsement  shall  be  commenced
          within  12 months from the date upon which the eligible
          claimant or his legal representatives knew or ought  to
          have  known that the quantum of the claims with respect
          to  an  insured person exceeded the minimum limits  for
          motor  vehicle liability insurance in the  jurisdiction
          in  which  the accident occurred.  No action  which  is
          commenced  within 2 years of the date of  the  accident
          shall be barred by this provision.</pre>
    <pre>     . . .
</pre>
    <pre>9.   SUBROGATION</pre>
    <pre>     Where a claim is made under this endorsement, the Insurer is
     subrogated to the rights of the eligible claimant by whom  a
     claim  is  made, and may maintain an action in the  name  of
     that  person  against the inadequately insured motorist  and
     the persons referred to in paragraph 4(b).
</pre>
    <pre>10.  ASSIGNMENT OF RIGHTS OF ACTION</pre>
    <pre>     Where  a payment is made under this endorsement, the Insurer
     is  entitled  to  receive  from the  eligible  claimant,  in
     consideration thereof, an assignment of all rights of action
     whether  judgment  is  obtained or  not,  and  the  eligible
     claimant undertakes to cooperate with the Insurer, except in
     a  pecuniary way, in the pursuit of any subrogated action or
     any right of action so assigned.
</pre>
    <pre>_______________________________
1 Although S &amp; Y plead in its Statement of Defence that the
plaintiffs&#146; claims are barred by the limitation period prescribed
under s.6(c) of the S.E.F. 44 endorsement, the issue is not
raised on this Rule 21 motion.</pre></td>
