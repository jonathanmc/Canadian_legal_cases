      <pre><b>On appeal from the order of Cameron J. dated November 25, 1998</b></pre>
      <pre><b>BORINS J.A.:</b></pre>
      <pre>[1]  This is an appeal from the decision of Cameron J., reported
in (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 391, striking out paragraphs 8 to 15 of
the appellant’s statement of claim, with leave to amend, as well
as paragraph 16, consequent to the respondents’ motions under
rule 21.01(1)(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure.  For the
reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and set aside the
order of the motions judge, with the exception of that part of
the order striking out paragraph 16.</pre>
      <pre><b>Background</b></pre>
      <pre>[2]  This is a “tobacco liability” case.  The late Mirjana Spasic
died of lung cancer in 1998 after smoking cigarettes for a
lengthy period.  Before her death, she commenced this claim
against the respondent tobacco manufacturers.  The claim is
continued by her estate.
[3]  In her statement of claim, it is alleged that the defendants
negligently and deceitfully manufactured defective and dangerous
devices – tobacco products – and participated in a conspiracy to
deceive the public about their defects and dangers.  In an
additional, or an alternative claim, she pleaded in paragraphs 8
to 15 that the defendants intentionally destroyed evidence
relating to the inherent dangers of cigarettes, relying on the
tort of intentional spoliation of evidence.  In addition, in
paragraph 16 she pleaded and relied on “the doctrine of omnia
praesumuntur contra spoliatorem” – all things are presumed
against a wrongdoer.
[4]  Paragraphs 8 to 15 are very detailed and comprise eight
pages of the twenty-seven page statement of claim.  There is no
need to reproduce these paragraphs.  A brief summary of their
contents will suffice.  It is pleaded that since the 1950s, the
defendants knew that cigarettes were hazardous and “inherently
defective” and that they “engaged in various schemes to conceal,
destroy and alter evidence that established their knowledge”.
The schemes alleged included contrived document retention and
destruction policies and plans.  It is further pleaded that “as a
result of the defendants’ participation in such schemes, the
plaintiff has been deprived of the opportunity to properly and
fully investigate and prove the facts upon which her causes of
action are based”.
[5]  The respondents were successful in their motions to strike
out paragraphs 8 to 16 on the ground that they did not disclose a
reasonable cause of action.  However, with respect to paragraphs
8 to 15, Cameron J. granted leave to the plaintiff to amend the
statement of claim “by pleading material facts which included
those relating to spoliation, as part of the circumstances
constituting a wrong for which compensatory damages may be
awarded”.  The respondents cross-appeal from the order granting
the plaintiff leave to amend.</pre>
      <pre><b>Reasons of the motions judge</b></pre>
      <pre>[6]  In his reasons for judgment at p. 393, Cameron J. noted that
the respondents attacked the spoliation claim on the ground that
it was plain and obvious that it could not succeed because it
failed to disclose a reasonable cause of action as no such cause
of action existed under Ontario law.
[7]  At p. 394, Cameron J. set out the legal test which, in his
view, applied to the respondents’ motions:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In order to survive a motion under rule 21.01(1)(b) 
there must be a legally sufficient claim for which a 
court may grant relief. “If there is no such claim, 
litigation of it would be a waste of both the 
parties’ and the court’s time”: Dawson v. Rexcraft 
Storage Inc., Ont. C.A., Docket No. C22661, August 
13, 1998 [reported 164 D.L.R. (4th) 257, 20 R.P.R. 
(3d) 207].  The test on such a motion is whether it 
is plain and obvious that the pleading of the cause 
of action has no reasonable chance of success.  A 
cause of action should not be struck merely because
it is novel.  In deciding the issue the facts pleaded 
must be assumed to be true: see Hunt v. Carey Canada 
Inc., [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959 at pp. 979-80, 74 D.L.R. 
(4th) 321; Prete v. Ontario (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 161, 
110 D.L.R. (4th) 94 (C.A.).</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[8]  The motions judge then referred to the decision of the
Divisional Court in Rintoul v. St. Joseph’s Health Centre (1998),
42 O.R. (3d) 379 in which a majority of the court, relying on
Endean v. Canadian Red Cross Society (1998), 157 D.L.R. (4th) 465
(B.C.C.A.), ruled that a separate cause of action for spoliation
by a party to the lawsuit did not exist in Ontario.  He concluded
at p. 396 that as he was “bound by the majority decision in
Rintoul as a matter of stare decisis”, paragraphs 8 to 15 of the
statement of claim were to be struck out on the ground that they
did not disclose a reasonable cause of action.  We were informed
by counsel that although the Supreme Court of Canada granted
leave to appeal in Endean, the appeal had been abandoned.
[9]  Strictly speaking, it was unnecessary for the motions judge
to say more because he was bound to follow the decision of the
Divisional Court in Rintoul.  However, he continued and expressed
his views why a separate tort of spoliation by a party to the
action, as contrasted with a tort of spoliation by a third party,
is unnecessary.  In doing so, he referred to the extensive
American case law that is divided on whether the protection of
the integrity of the adversary system requires a separate tort to
prevent, or deter, the act of intentionally destroying or
otherwise suppressing evidence in civil litigation rendering it
difficult, or impossible, for a party to prove its case.
[10] It appears that Cameron J., in concluding that a separate
spoliation tort was unnecessary, was influenced by the position
taken by those American courts which have reached a similar
conclusion on the basis that the harm to a litigant caused by
spoliation can be dealt with in other ways, such as various
discovery sanctions, the “spoliation inference” captured by the
Latin maxim omnia praesumuntur contra spoliatorem cited in Armory
v. Delamirie (1722), 1 Str. 504, 93 E.R. 664 (K.B.), statutory
punishments for obstruction of justice and referral to bar
associations for professional sanctions. The spoliation inference
represents a factual inference or a legal presumption that
because a litigant destroyed a particular piece of evidence, that
evidence would have been damaging to the litigant.
[11] It was on the ground that the spoliation inference discussed
by the Supreme Court of Canada in St. Louis v. The Queen (1895),
25 S.C.R. 649 provided an adequate remedy for spoliation that the
court in Endean concluded that a separate tort of spoliation was
not required.  O’Driscoll J., writing on behalf of a majority of
the Divisional Court in Rintoul, applied Endean, observing at p.
384 “that the foreseeable trend is to view ‘spoliation’ as an
evidentiary rule that raises a presumption and not as a stand-
alone, independent tort”.
[12] Writing in dissent in Rintoul, Corbett J. observed at p.
390, correctly in my view, that St. Louis did not deal with the
question of whether the tort of spoliation existed, or should
exist, in Canada.  The issue in St. Louis was whether the
spoliation inference had been applied correctly by the lower
courts.  Referring to the principles stated in Hunt v. Carey
Canada Inc. that a claim should not be struck out on the ground
that it discloses no cause of action unless it is plain and
obvious that it cannot succeed or merely because it is novel,
Corbett J. stated at pp. 388-389:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The tort of spoliation is essentially novel in 
Canada. Canadian authorities have traditionally 
viewed the destruction of evidence as a matter of 
evidence giving rise to procedural remedies, 
including rule 30.08(2) of our rules, where 
warranted. This view that procedural remedies are 
sufficient should not preclude consideration of a 
substantive remedy for the wilful destruction of 
evidence.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>In concluding that the claim should not be struck out as failing
to disclose a reasonable cause of action, she held at pp. 390-
391:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Given the seriousness of the claim involved and the 
policy objective of preserving records, particularly 
where the public body in question has a legal duty to 
preserve that record and to make it available to the 
public upon request, a tort of spoliation in some form 
may be appropriate.</pre>
        <pre>I am therefore of the view, and in agreement with [the 
motions judge] Feldman J., when she stated in her 
decision of March 18, 1998, at p. 6:</pre>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>A motion such as this is not the place to 
set out a detailed treatise on the tort of
spoliation for many reasons, chief among 
them being that as with virtually all legal
analysis, a factual nexus is needed to
properly assess the consequences of the
various conclusions.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <pre><b>Analysis</b></pre>
      <pre>[13] I agree with those portions of the reasons of Corbett J. in
Rintoul which I have quoted.  As I will explain, for the reasons
of Wilson J. in Hunt, I am of the view that paragraphs 8 to 15 of
the statement of claim should not have been struck out and that
the appellant’s claim pleaded in those paragraphs should be
allowed to proceed to trial.
[14] At the outset of my analysis it is helpful to repeat what
this court said in Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage Inc. (1998), 164
D.L.R. (4th) 257 at 264 in identifying the two categories of
motions that are commonly brought under rule 21.01(1)(b):</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Because the purpose of a rule 21.01(1)(b) motion is 
to test whether the plaintiff’s allegations (assuming 
they can be proved) state a claim for which a court 
may grant relief, the only question posed by the 
motion is whether the statement of claim states a 
legally sufficient claim, i.e., whether it is
substantively adequate.  Consequently, the motions 
judge, as mandated by rule 21.01(2)(b), does not 
consider any evidence in deciding the motion.  The 
motions judge addresses a purely legal question: 
whether, assuming the plaintiff can prove the
allegations pleaded in the statement of claim, he 
or she will have established a cause of action 
entitling him or her to some form of relief from the 
defendant.  Because dismissal of an action for failure 
to state a reasonable cause of action is a drastic 
measure, the court is required to give a generous 
reading to the statement of claim, construe it in the 
light most favourable to the plaintiff, and be 
satisfied that it is plain and obvious that the 
plaintiff cannot succeed: See Hunt v. Carey Canada 
Inc.,  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, 74 D.L.R. (4th) 321.</pre>
        <pre>In some cases, a statement of claim will be vulnerable 
to dismissal under rule 21.01(1)(b) because the 
plaintiff has sought relief for acts that are not 
proscribed under the law.  The typical textbook example 
is a statement of claim that alleges that the defendant 
made a face at the plaintiff, or that the defendant drove 
a car of an offensive colour.  In other cases, however,
the statement of claim may be defective because it has 
failed to allege the necessary elements of a claim that, 
if properly pleaded, would constitute a reasonable cause
of action.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>In this appeal, it is the first category of a rule 21.01(1)(b)
motion that is under consideration.
[15] In my view, this court should apply the reasoning of Wilson
J. in Hunt and permit the plaintiff’s claim, based on the alleged
spoliation of evidence by the respondents, to proceed to trial.
The claim advanced in Hunt was very similar to the one advanced
in this case.  The plaintiff alleged that the defendant asbestos
producers were negligent and, as well, that they conspired to
withhold information concerning the effects of asbestos fibres on
workers such as himself.  He alleged that “after 1934 the
defendants knew that asbestos fibres could cause disease in those
exposed to the fibres …. that all of the defendants conspired to
withhold information about the dangers associated with asbestos
and that as a result of that conspiracy he contracted
mesothelioma” (p. 963).  At the time the plaintiff’s claim was
launched, the tort of conspiracy to withhold information was
unknown in law.  On this basis the defendants succeeded in
striking out this portion of the plaintiff’s claim.
[16] Wilson J. delivered the reasons for the Supreme Court of
Canada in Hunt in which she held that the plaintiff’s claim
should proceed to trial.  In the course of her reasons she
reviewed the jurisprudence of this province on the test to be
applied when it is sought to strike out a statement of claim for
failing to state a reasonable cause of action, and stated at p.
977:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Thus, the Ontario Court of Appeal has firmly embraced 
the “plain and obvious” test and has made clear that it 
too is of the view that the test is rooted in the need 
for courts to ensure that their process is not abused.  
The fact that the case the plaintiff wishes to present 
may involve complex issues of fact and law or may raise 
a novel legal proposition should not prevent a plaintiff 
from proceeding with his action.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[17] In his concurring reasons in the British Columbia Court of
Appeal, Esson J.A.  had specifically declined to embark upon a
detailed consideration of the law of conspiracy, noting as Wilson
J. stated at p. 967:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It has not generally been part of our tradition and, 
given the complexity and novelty of some of the issues 
raised in this case, it would I think be particularly 
undesirable to render a such decisions [sic], as it 
were, in a vacuum.</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>At p. 986, Wilson J. approved of this approach:          </pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>I agree completely with Esson J.A. that it is not 
appropriate at this stage to engage in a detailed 
analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of Canadian 
law on the tort of conspiracy.          </pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[18] As I have noted, this is not a case in which it is argued
that a portion of the statement of claim should be struck out
because it pleads a recognized claim which contains a radical
defect.  Rather, the position taken by the respondents is that
the statement of claim sets forth a claim which has been
recognized in some jurisdictions, but which has not been
recognized in Ontario, nor should it be recognized.  I would
note, however, that prior to Rintoul the tort of spoliation was
permitted to proceed to trial by Molloy J. in Coriale (Litigation
Guardian of) v. Sisters of St. Joseph’s of Sault Ste. Marie
(1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 347 (Gen. Div.), from which, we were told,
leave to appeal to the Divisional Court was refused.  As she was
of the opinion that it was not plain and obvious that spoliation
could not form the basis of an independent tort, Molloy J. found
that it was far preferable to develop legal precedent within the
factual context of a trial and not on an interlocutory motion.
[19] Wilson J.’s response to a similar argument in Hunt is found
at pp. 989-991:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>If the facts as alleged by the plaintiff are true, 
and for the purposes of this appeal we must assume 
that they are, then it may well be that an agreement 
between corporations to withhold information about a 
toxic product might give rise to harm of a magnitude 
that could not have arisen from the decision of just
one company to withhold such information.  There may,
accordingly, be good reason to extend the tort to this 
context.  However, this is precisely the kind of 
question that it is for the trial judge to consider in 
light of the evidence.  It is not for this Court on a 
motion to strike out portions of a statement of claim 
to reach a decision one way or the other as to the
plaintiff’s chances of success.  As the law that spawned 
the “plain and obvious” test makes clear, it is enough 
that the plaintiff has some chance of success.</pre>
        <pre>The issues that will arise at the trial of the 
plaintiff’s action in conspiracy will unquestionably be 
difficult.  The plaintiff may have to make complex 
submissions about whether the evidence establishes that 
the defendants conspired either with a view to causing 
him harm or in circumstances where they should have known 
that their actions would cause him harm.  He may well 
have to make novel arguments concerning whether it is
enough that the defendants knew or ought to have known 
that a class of which the plaintiff was a member would 
suffer harm.  The trial judge might conclude, as some of
the defendants have submitted, that the plaintiff should 
have sued the defendants as joint tortfeasors rather 
than alleging the tort of conspiracy.  But this Court’s
statements in Inuit Tapirisat of Canada and Operation 
Dismantle Inc., as well as decisions such as Dyson and 
Drummond-Jackson, make clear that none of these 
considerations may be taken into account on an application
brought under Rule 19(24) of the British Columbia Rules of 
Court.</pre>
        <pre>…..</pre>
        <pre>The fact that a pleading reveals “an arguable, difficult 
or important point of law” cannot justify striking out 
part of the statement of claim.  Indeed, I would go so
far as to suggest that where a statement of claim reveals
a difficult and important point of law, it may well be 
critical that the action be allowed to proceed.  Only in 
this way can we be sure that the common law in general, 
and the law of torts in particular, will continue to 
evolve to meet the legal challenges that arise in our 
modern industrial society. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[20] The respondents also submitted that a cause of action in
spoliation is not available where the plaintiff has available
another cause of action.  Wilson J. rejected a similar argument
in Hunt for two reasons.  Her second reason, in my view, is
applicable to this appeal.  At pp. 991-992 she stated:</pre>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>This brings me to the second difficulty I have with 
the defendants’ submission.  It seems to me totally 
inappropriate on a motion to strike out a statement 
of claim to get into the question whether the 
plaintiff’s allegations concerning other nominate 
torts will be successful.  This a matter that should 
be considered at trial where evidence with respect 
to the other torts can be led and where a fully 
informed decision about the applicability of the 
tort of conspiracy can be made in light of that 
evidence and the submissions of counsel.  If the 
plaintiff is successful with respect to the other 
nominate torts, then the trial judge can consider
the defendants’ arguments about the unavailability 
of the tort of conspiracy.  If the plaintiff is 
unsuccessful with respect to the other nominate 
torts, then the trial judge can consider whether 
he might still succeed in conspiracy.  Regardless 
of the outcome, it seems to me inappropriate at 
this stage in the proceedings to reach a conclusion 
about the validity of the defendants’ claims about
merger.  I believe that this matter is also properly 
left for the consideration of the trial judge. [Emphasis 
added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <pre>[21] As I stated earlier, I view the plaintiff’s claim based on
the tort of spoliation as an additional, or alternative, claim to
be considered only if it is established that the destruction or
suppression of evidence by the respondents results in the
inability of the plaintiff to establish the other nominate torts
pleaded in the statement of claim.  This, as well, is a good
reason why trial efficiency commends that the pleading of the
tort of spoliation remain intact so that all of the issues may be
considered by the same trial judge.
[22] Therefore, I would apply the reasoning of Wilson J. in Hunt
and permit the plaintiff’s claim based on the tort of spoliation
to proceed to trial.  As in Hunt, there is no need to embark on a
detailed consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of the
law, including the Canadian law, on the tort of spoliation.  If
it is established that the conduct of the respondents resulted in
harm to the plaintiff by making it impossible for her to prove
her claim, then it will be for the trial judge, in the context of
a complete record, to determine whether the plaintiff should have
a remedy.  This is how the progress of the common law is marked
in cases of first impression, where the court has created a new
cause of action where none had been recognized before.  I need
refer only to Donoghue v. Stevenson [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.) as but
one example.  Expanding on what Wilson J. stated, when it is
clear that a person’s interests are entitled to legal protection
against the conduct of another, the fact that the claim is novel
will not in itself operate as a bar to a remedy.  As well, I do
not see why the existence of procedural sanctions or the
“spoliation inference” which may, or may not, ameliorate the
effects of spoliation should in themselves preclude the
recognition of an independent tort.  As the appellant relies on
the spoliation inference, the trial judge will hear and consider
evidence of spoliation in any event.  I can see no reason why the
trial judge should be precluded from considering all possible
remedies, including a separate tort, on the basis of the record
that will be developed.
[23] In my view, this case represents a paradigm of when a claim
should be permitted to proceed to trial.  As Finlayson J.A.
stated on behalf of this court in R.D. Belanger &amp; Associates Ltd.
v. Stadium Corporation of Ontario Ltd. (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 778 at
782: “Matters of law which have not been settled fully in our
jurisprudence should not be disposed of at this [interlocutory]
stage of the proceedings.”  See, also, Temilini v. Ontario
Provincial Police (Commissioner) (1990), 73 O.R. (2d) 664 (C.A.);
Hanson v. Bank of Nova Scotia (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 142 (C.A.).
[24] For the assistance of the trial judge, consideration should
be given to whether Rintoul precludes the trial judge from
determining whether the appellant’s claim based on the tort of
spoliation should be recognized, should this issue be raised.  In
my view, the trial judge should not be bound by the result in
Rintoul.  While we are not required to overrule Rintoul, I
believe that there is good reason to doubt the correctness of the
result reached by the majority.  As I have indicated, I believe
that the reasoning of the majority in purporting to apply St.
Louis, which was also applied in Endean, is flawed.  Cameron J.
and counsel for the respondents referred to the substantial body
of case law in the United States which has accepted and rejected
the tort of spoliation.  The very few Canadian cases which have
considered the question are far from definitive.  Accordingly,
the trial judge is free to consider the appellant’s claim based
on the tort of spoliation as if it were a claim at first
instance.
[25] The appellant, as indicated earlier, has also appealed from
the decision of the motions judge striking out paragraph 16 of
the statement of claim in which “the doctrine of omnia
praesumuntur contra spoliatorem” was pleaded and relied on.  It
was submitted that paragraph 16 is not objectionable as it is the
pleading of a point of law, which is permitted by rule 25.06(2).
I do not agree.  The “doctrine”, as is apparent from St. Louis,
is a rule of evidence and states no principle of law.  The maxim
res ipsa loquitur is also a rule of evidence and states no
principle of law: Hellenius v. Lees (1971), 20 D.L.R. (3d) 369 at
373 (S.C.C.).  In Hansen v. Weinmaster, [1951] O.W.N. 868 at 869
(C.A.) it was held that there was no rule of pleading that
requires the pleading of res ipsa loquitur as it is a rule of
evidence.  It follows that as omnia praesumuntur contra
spoliatorem is a rule of evidence, there was no need to plead it,
and the motions judge did not err in striking out paragraph 16.
[26] I would, therefore, allow the appeal and set aside the order
of Cameron J. with the exception of paragraph 16 of the statement
of claim, which is to be struck out as it offends rule 25.06(2).
In the circumstances, there is no need to consider the cross-
appeal, and it is dismissed without costs.  The appellant is to
have costs of the motion and the appeal.</pre>
