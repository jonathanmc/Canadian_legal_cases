    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction of first degree murder on December
1, 1994 following his trial before Glithero J., sitting with a
jury.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>FINLAYSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Peter Stark appeals his conviction on December 1, 1994,
following a trial before the Honourable Mr. Justice Glithero and
a jury, of the murder in the first degree of Julie Stanton.</pre>
    <pre>Overview of the facts</pre>
    <pre>[2]  On April 16, 1990, at approximately 2:00 p.m., 14 year-old
Julie Stanton was seen getting into the appellant&#146;s car.  She was
never seen alive again and her body was not found until after the
appellant&#146;s conviction.
[3]  Up until about one week before the jury was selected, the
appellant denied to the police that he was with Julie that day.
At the opening of the trial, however, he made the following
formal admission:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>....at approximately 2 p.m. on Monday April 16, 1990, he
[the appellant] picked up Julie Stanton on Lynn Heights 
drive at the corner of Maury Crescent in Pickering, 
Ontario.  Mr. Stark admits that he was driving a 1979 
gray Monte Carlo with a defective exhaust system. Peter 
Stark admits that he lied to his wife, the Stantons and 
the Authorities about having met Julie Stanton on April 
16, 1990.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[4]  The appellant was the 47 year-old father of one of Julie
Stanton&#146;s friends, Kim Stark.  He had apparently arranged to meet
Julie for lunch that day in Pickering to talk about Kim.  He
maintained in statements to family that he dropped her off in
Pickering before returning to his boat at 1:00 p.m.  He said he
fell asleep on his boat until 4:00 p.m. and then left to pick-up
his wife Alison at work in Toronto.  He had to stop on the side
of Highway 401 because the catalytic converter fell off his car.
The Crown called extensive evidence to demonstrate that the
appellant lied about his whereabouts and his activities that day,
in a variety of ways, to his family, to his friends, to the
Stantons, and to the police.
[5]  The appellant explained his lateness in picking up his wife
from work on the evening of April 16th, the presence of eight
scratches on his back, and the dirt on his clothes, as having
been caused by his attempts to fix the catalytic converter on his
car after it had fallen off.  The Crown called evidence to
demonstrate that his car did not have a catalytic converter.
[6]  There was other after-the-fact conduct capable of supporting
the inference that the appellant had a guilty mind besides the
appellant&#146;s lies about his activities on April 16.  For example,
he uncharacteristically showered that evening.  Also, early the
next morning, he laundered only the clothes he had been wearing
the day before and then threw them out because he said he could
not get them clean.
[7]  The Crown called similar fact evidence of a previous
incident from which the jury could conclude that the appellant
had a sexual interest in Julie Stanton.  In the summer of 1989,
he asked Julie to meet him on his boat alone to talk about Kim
(the same purpose he gave for the 1990 meeting).  Five hours
later, Julie turned up, sitting on a friend&#146;s steps, incoherent,
with her pant zipper undone, having urinated in her pants, with
no memory of anything after drinking a blue drink given to her by
the appellant.  The appellant acknowledged that he had given
Julie a cooler, and subsequently put her in a cab.  There was
evidence that the appellant had been prescribed Halcion (a small
blue pill) and he admitted that he had liquefied Halcion in his
possession that summer, for which he could offer no reason when
asked by the police.  Expert evidence was called to confirm that
Julie&#146;s behaviour was consistent with the ingestion of Halcion.
[8]  The appellant also made a number of statements to his wife,
his daughter, a friend, and to a jailhouse informant (Gerald
Udall) about finding Julie&#146;s body, that there would be an axe
there with his finger prints on it, that he killed her with an
axe, or that the police would make sure that his teeth marks
would be &#147;in her ass&#148;.  According to Udall&#146;s testimony, he also
told Udall that he drugged and raped Julie Stanton and provided
other details about the events.
[9]  The appellant did not testify nor did he call any defence
evidence.
[10] The theory of the Crown was that the appellant had a
romantic interest in the victim, that he invited her for lunch on
the pretext of discussing problems he was having with his
daughter, that he instead sexually assaulted her after picking
her up in his car, and that he killed her to prevent her from
complaining.  There was also some suggestion that he had drugged
her.
[11] The theory of the defence was that, after having lunch with
Julie Stanton that day, the appellant dropped her off outside the
Pickering Town Centre and never saw her again.
[12] As indicated, the body of Julie Stanton had not been found
at the time of the trial.  Accordingly, there was no crime scene
evidence placed before the jury, nor any other forensic evidence
establishing a connection between the appellant and Julie
Stanton.  The case against the appellant was entirely
circumstantial except for the statements the appellant allegedly
made to Gerald Udall, the jailhouse informant.  The primary
pieces of evidence connecting the appellant to the disappearance
of Julie Stanton were the appellant&#146;s admission that he had
picked her up, his lies about his activities on the day in
question, and his subsequent conduct.
[13] The remains of Julie Stanton were found on June 27, 1996,
about a year and a half after the appellant&#146;s conviction, the
remains of Julie Stanton were found.  The appellant seeks leave
to have certain evidence relating to the location and forensic
examination of the remains admitted on this appeal, including an
agreed statement of fact that sets out the non-contentious
narrative facts.</pre>
    <pre>Issues</pre>
    <pre>[14] While a number of grounds of appeal were argued by the
appellant, the court called on the Crown with respect to the
following two issues:
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   The admissibility of the evidence of the jailhouse
informant.</pre>
      <pre>2.   The admissibility of the fresh evidence relating to 
the discovery of the body of Julie Stanton.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Issue 1. The jailhouse informant</pre>
    <pre>[15] At the time of trial, the jailhouse informant, Gerald Udall,
had 39 convictions, most involving acts of dishonesty.  Like the
appellant, he was on the protective custody range of the Whitby
Jail.  He had acted as a police informant in the past.  The
appellant&#146;s alleged jailhouse confessions to Udall took place in
two stages.
[16] Period of September 10 &#150; 24, 1992.  During this period, the
appellant allegedly told Udall, upon questioning by the latter,
that he had killed Julie by chopping her up with an axe.  Udall
elicited this information from the appellant after having a brief
meeting, on September 10, with police Detective Mercier.  The
meeting with Mercier was initiated by Udall who offered to
provide information about two persons in custody other than the
appellant.  He had nothing that interested Mercier.  However,
Mercier, who was not involved in the police investigation
respecting the disappearance of Julie Stanton, asked Udall
whether he knew the appellant and said: &#147;we&#146;re very interested,
the community, Durham Region, the public, her family, &#133; in
finding out where the body is&#148;.   The detective did not, however,
do or say anything further to enlist Udall&#146;s assistance, nor
offer him any reward for information.  The subsequent conduct of
Udall that resulted in eliciting the alleged confession, was not,
in the findings of the trial judge, infra, in any way the result
of the control or manipulation of the police. Udall did not go
back to Mercier with his information about the appellant but made
arrangements to meet with the officer in charge of the Stanton
investigation, Detective Curwain.  He provided a statement in
return for an undertaking from the Crown regarding his
outstanding charges and his pending release.  Udall&#146;s testimony
was admitted at the appellant&#146;s trial after the trial judge held
in a voir dire that Udall was not acting as a police agent when
the appellant&#146;s statements were made since Mercier had not
intended to recruit him as an agent.
[17] Period of October 2-16, 1992.  During this period, in tape
recorded conversations with Udall, the appellant allegedly
referred to his earlier confession when he told Udall that he
would never have been arrested if he had stayed in Florida during
a recent visit.  Udall was careful not to take any action that
was designed to elicit incriminating remarks.  The appellant
simply disputes the police identification of his voice on the
tapes.
[18] It was agreed at trial and on appeal that the significant
period to examine to determine the admissibility of this evidence
is the first stage, during which Udall met with Detective
Mercier.  It is agreed that the appellant&#146;s right to silence was
not violated by the manner in which the statements were made
during the second stage to Udall who by then was admittedly a
police agent.  See R. v. Hebert (1990), 57 C.C.C. (3d) 1
(S.C.C.).
[19] However, with respect to the admissions made in the first
period, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in
failing to find that his right to silence guaranteed under s. 7
of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (&#147;Charter&#148;) was
not violated by the admission of his jailhouse statements.  He
argues that these statements should have been ruled inadmissible
pursuant to R. v. Broyles (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 308 (S.C.C.),
since Udall elicited the statements from him and was acting as a
police agent at the time.  The appellant does not take issue with
the trial judge&#146;s finding that no agreement or promise of any
benefit was made to Udall in exchange for his statements.
Instead, the appellant argues:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In principle, all that is necessary to create a state 
agency relationship is for the police to specifically 
direct a motivated informant to the desired police 
target such that the resulting contact with the accused 
would not have occurred but for the police direction.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] Broyles, supra, is the leading case on when a prisoner
becomes a state agent for the purposes of an analysis under s. 7
as to whether a fellow prisoner&#146;s right to silence has been
violated.  Here, Iacobucci J., for the Court, at pp.317-19, held
that the right to silence is triggered when the accused is
subjected to the coercive powers of the state through his
detention.  It may be violated not only by the conduct of an
undercover police officer but also by the conduct of any agent of
the state.  In deciding whether or not a person, such as a fellow
prisoner, is an agent of the state, it is appropriate to focus on
the effect of the relationship between the informer and the
authorities, and on the particular exchange or contact with the
accused.  Iacobucci J. stated at p.319:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; I would, accordingly, adopt the following simple test:
would the exchange between the accused and the informer 
have taken place, in the form and manner in which it did 
take place, but for the intervention of the state or its 
agents?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21] The ruling of the trial judge is very detailed and not
uncritical of Udall.  It is also critical of Mercier because of
the detective&#146;s failure to take notes of his meeting with Udall.
However, the trial judge found that Udall was not a police agent
when he obtained a series of inculpatory statements from the
appellant, and later relayed these statements to Detective
Curwain.  I rely particularly on the following findings:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In the case before me, I think the following facts are
important:  The inmate Udall was obviously of a mind to 
be an informant in exchange for any benefit he could 
get.  In fact, he offered information about three people 
on September 10, 1992.  It was Udall who initiated the 
contact with the police on September 10, 1992.  On that 
date, I find he was given no instructions or information 
in respect of the Stark case.  The police did not in any 
way control or manipulate the informant&#146;s dealings with
Stark.  Udall was already on the same range as the accused 
and the police did nothing to facilitate contact between 
Udall and Stark.  While I am satisfied that Udall hoped 
to gain an advantage for himself by informing on other 
inmates, I am also satisfied that there was no promise 
of any benefit to him or requested by him when he met with 
Mercier.  When Udall made the report to the police of the 
alleged admissions, it was he who initiated the further 
contact with the police on September 24, 1992.  In making 
that request, Udall asked to speak to the investigating 
officer in the Stark case rather than asking to speak to 
Mercier, which one might expect to have been more natural 
if indeed he had struck any sort of arrangement with
Mercier during the earlier meeting.  There was no follow-up
contact between Mercier and Udall after September 10, 1992.
Mercier did not intend to elicit Udall as an agent, nor did
Mercier believe what he had said to Udall to have had that
effect.  Udall did not understand Mercier to be recruiting 
him as a police agent, nor did Udall seek to offer his 
services as such in respect of Stark.
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In my view, the highest the defence position can be 
legitimately placed is that the Mercier-Udall conversation 
on September 10, 1992 had the effect, whether intended or
not, of focusing or directing Udall&#146;s attention to the 
accused.  Udall was obviously a person willing to exchange
information on other inmates for his own benefit.  I accept 
that Udall knew nothing of the accused&#146;s case as of 
September 10, 1992.  What he did learn on that date is that 
the police were interested in information about the 
whereabouts of a missing body.  Later, when he observed the 
accused reading the newspaper story about his own case, 
Udall learned that the Stark case involved a missing body.  
I am satisfied that, being as shrewd as I view him to be, 
he would have connected, at that time, the two pieces of
information.  I am satisfied that Udall then realized the 
potential for converting this opportunity to his own 
advantage.  He was experienced enough to realize the 
probability that some material advantage could be obtained 
as a result of bartering the information.  Thereafter, 
Udall set about, on his own initiative and by his own 
design, to gain inculpatory admissions from Stark.  The
steps Udall took were entirely of his own formulation and 
free of police suggestion or direction.</pre>
      <pre>. . . .</pre>
      <pre>Accordingly, I find that Udall was not a state agent when 
he allegedly received the admissions from the accused.  
While he elicited the information from the accused, he
did so at a time when he was operating independently of 
the police.  In my view, there was, accordingly, no 
violation of s. 7 of the Charter and the defence application
will be dismissed.  The evidence of Udall in respect of 
admissions by the accused between September 10 and 24, 
1992 may be led before the jury.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[22] The appellant seizes upon one of the trial judge&#146;s
statements as being incompatible with the &#147;but for&#148; test in
Broyles, supra.  The trial judge said:  &#147;A mere expression of
interest which is not accompanied by the development of any form
of relationship between police and informant is, in my view,
generally not sufficient&#148;.  This short statement, taken out of
context, does not accord with the spirit of Broyles and in a
different fact situation might be an error in law.  However, the
statement is preceded by:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In my view, all the circumstances of the police-informant
contact must be considered.  What is really at issue is 
whether the state has intervened in such a way as to 
conscript the informant to obtain for the state that which 
the accused had chosen not to give the state voluntarily.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[23] It is to be noted that Iacobucci J., in Broyles,
specifically addressed the scenario where a police officer had
made contact with a cellmate of the accused prior to the cellmate
approaching the accused.  He observed as follows at p.319:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>I would add that there may be circumstances in which 
the authorities encourage informers to elicit statements 
without there being a pre-existing relationship between 
the authorities and individual informers.  For example, 
the authorities may provided an incentive for the 
elicitation of incriminating statements by making it 
known that they will pay for such information or that 
they will charge the informer with a less serious 
offence.  The question in such cases will be the same:
would the exchange between the informer and the accused 
have taken place but for the inducements of the 
authorities? [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[24] Accordingly, there is no presumption in law that &#147;a mere
expression of interest&#148; by the police officer constitutes the
informant as a police agent.  The trial judge must simply take
this into consideration, along with all the evidence, in
determining whether in fact the informant became a police agent.
In the case in appeal, the trial judge could have concluded
otherwise, but his conclusion is a finding of fact that merits
deference on appeal.  I think the comments of Rosenberg J.A. of
this Court in R. v. McInnis (1992), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 515 at p. 532
are apt:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In this case, there is evidence from which the trial judge
could have found that the exchange between the appellant 
and Doe [the jail house informant] was conducted differently 
because of the police intervention.  I note in particular 
the statement by Sergeant Crosby to Doe on October 4, 1988 
that a simple admission from the appellant that he killed 
Côté was &#147;not enough&#148;.  However, the trial judge found 
otherwise and I cannot say that this finding is unreasonable, 
or that he otherwise erred in principle in concluding that 
the appellant&#146;s rights under s. 7 were not violated.  
Accordingly, Doe&#146;s evidence was properly admitted.
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[25] Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2.  The fresh evidence</pre>
    <pre>[26] On June 27th, 1996, a Mr. Jansen was working on his
property, located 35 kilometers north of where the appellant
lived at the time of Julie Stanton&#146;s disappearance, when he
discovered human remains.  That same day, the police were
notified and performed a search of the area.  Detective Ginn of
the Ontario Provincial Police and Detective Curwain of the Durham
Regional Police Force conducted a follow-up police investigation.
On June 30th, Dr. Crook, after reviewing dental records,
identified the remains as those of Julie Stanton.
[27] The remains were examined on behalf of the Crown by Dr.
Chiasson, the Chief Forensic Pathologist, Office of the Chief
Coroner of Ontario, and by Dr. Melbye, a forensic anthropologist
from the Centre of Forensic Science (CFS).  Dr. Melbye also
attended at the scene and supervised the dig of the remains site.
Further, Dr. Mayer, a toxicologist and Head of the toxicology
section of the CFS, conducted tests on the bone marrow to
determine if Halcion had been ingested by Julie Stanton.
Finally, Dr. Jaffe, a forensic pathologist and former Medical
Director at the CFS, conducted a post-mortem examination of the
remains on behalf of the defence.
[28] The appellant submits that this fresh evidence should be
admitted as it meets the criteria established by Palmer and
Palmer v. The Queen (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 at 205 (S.C.C.),
namely:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   The evidence could not have been adduced at trial by due
diligence;

2.   the evidence is relevant;

3.   the evidence is credible; and

4.   the evidence is such that it could reasonably be expected 
to have affected the result.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[29] The Crown concedes that only the last criterion is in issue.
As to this criterion, the appellant submits that: (1) the absence
of indications on the remains of axe blows could provide a jury
with a basis upon which to reject Mr. Udall&#146;s evidence that the
appellant killed Julie by chopping her body up with an axe; (2)
the absence of forensic evidence of a sexual assault throws doubt
on the theory of the Crown that the victim was sexually assaulted
before being killed; (3) the absence of any trace of Halcion in
the remains undermines the theory of the Crown that the victim
was drugged; and (4) the fact that there was no forensic
connection between the crime scene and the appellant is a
significant fact that could affect the jury&#146;s conclusion.
[30] I think that the last three points can be disposed of in
short order.  As to the fourth point, the fact that the site does
not furnish any evidence directly connecting the appellant to the
killing is of no significance given the years of exposure to the
elements.  On the other hand, the remoteness of the location
provides further evidence of the efforts made to conceal the
body.  While the soil samples do not directly connect the
appellant&#146;s car to the site of the remains, they provide some
confirmation of the trial evidence with respect to the dark soil
and leaves observed by Alison Stark on the appellant&#146;s hands and
clothes on the night in question.
[31] As to the second and third points, regarding the absence of
forensic evidence of sexual contact or drugs, this is hardly
surprising, and of little probative value, given the state of the
remains and the length of time that had elapsed.  All soft
tissue, organs, hair, fingernails, and toenails were missing.
Only 60% of the skeletal remains were found, scattered over an
area 79 meters by 51 meters, together with much of the clothing
and personal effects.  Many long bones from limbs or the torso
were missing.  Most of the bones were severely damaged by animal
chewing.
[32] Accordingly, it is not surprising that the toxicologist Dr.
Mayer was unable to detect Halcion in the bone marrow.  In any
event, Dr. Mayer stated that there was no scientific basis for
determining how long it would take Halcion to reach bone marrow.
He could only state that it would take longer (perhaps several
hours) than the absorption rate of Halcion into the blood, which
itself takes as long as two hours, depending on the contents of
the stomach.  Consequently, the Halcion might never get to the
bone marrow, depending on the time of death relative to the time
of ingestion.  Further, Dr. Mayer stated that it is also possible
that the Halcion was degraded from the six years of exposure.  As
a result, the test results neither confirm nor exclude the
presence of Halcion.
[33] There is, however, new evidence arising out of the
investigations which provides additional support for the
allegation of sexual assault.  Dr. Melbye observed that the
clothing appeared not to be on the lower half of the body at the
time the body was deposited at the site.  There were no bones in
the clothing from the lower half of the body, while there were
bones in the shirt.   Further, the hip joint was in place,
suggesting that animals had not removed the clothing after death.
Dr. Melbye was of the opinion that it was unlikely that animals
could remove the clothing over the legs, had the body not yet
decomposed.  Had the clothing been removed after the body had
decomposed, Dr. Melbye was of the opinion that this would have
dislodged the hip joint.
[34] The real force of the appellant&#146;s submissions was directed
towards the first point: the doubt created by the post-mortem
that the appellant used an axe to dismember the body of the
victim.  In addressing this point, it is necessary to recall that
there is nothing in the first degree murder theory of the Crown
that is dependent upon the dismemberment of the body, much less
by an axe.  Rather, the Crown relies upon forcible confinement,
sexual assault, and an intentional killing of the victim to
ensure her silence.  The use of an axe simply adds colour to the
Crown&#146;s theory.  Its genesis lies in the appellant&#146;s jailhouse
confession to Udall.
[35] The appellant submits that the post-mortem is fatal to the
credibility of Udall in that it demonstrates that the appellant
could not have described the murder of Julie Stanton in the
manner in which Udall said he did.  As the appellant puts it in
his factum:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It is respectfully submitted that the fresh evidence in 
this case satisfies the test for admission and provides 
a basis upon which Mr. Stark should be granted a new 
trial.  The discovery of the remains furnishes Mr. Stark 
with an evidentiary foundation to defend himself in a 
manner which was not possible before.  In particular, it 
furnishes good reason to doubt the veracity of Mr. Udall's 
evidence of Mr. Stark&#146;s confession.   This, in turn, 
affects the jury's assessment of the whole of the evidence 
as it relates to the use of an axe.  When one considers 
the fact that the site of the remains is not forensically 
connected to Mr. Stark, the fresh evidence gains additional 
cogency.  This fresh evidence pertains to and adversely 
affects the reliability and credibility of important 
evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove that Mr. Stark 
killed Julie Stanton.  As a result a new trial should be 
ordered.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[36] However, Dr. Jaffe was the only expert who was prepared to
testify affirmatively that the use of an axe was &#147;highly
unlikely&#148; given the condition of the bones that were found.1  He
said that the cause of death could not be determined, but that
the bones revealed no evidence of pre-death injury.  The fact
that Dr. Jaffe was prepared to be so positive in the absence of
34 of the 54 bones of the upper limbs of the victim, and 45 of
the 52 bones from the lower limbs, is somewhat surprising.  The
missing bones included the right radius and ulna, the left femur,
and the left tibia.  Further, the Crown justifiably pointed out
Dr. Jaffe&#146;s limited experience in examining skeletal remains.  I
think the evidence of Dr. Melbye is to be preferred.
[37] On July 4, 1996, Dr.  Melbye attended at the scene of the
remains and determined that a further search using anthropology
students would be advisable.  He organized and personally
supervised the subsequent search which took place July 15-19,
1996.  Also, together with Dr. Chiasson, he conducted a personal
examination of the skeletal remains on July 23 and 24, 1996.
After the examination, Dr. Melbye prepared a report in which he
concluded that, due to the extensive post-mortem damage and
scattering by various animals, nothing could be said about post-
mortem damage.
[38] Given the state of the remains, Dr.  Melbye concluded that
he could neither exclude nor confirm the use of an axe.  He noted
that, with the exception of the skull, which was intact, many of
the bones had suffered extensive post-mortem damage caused by the
gnawing of rodents, which could have obliterated any evidence of
blows from a hatchet.  He stated that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It is an axiom of scavenged bodies that any trauma that
breaks the skin is an open invitation to animals who are
attracted to the area of trauma first.  As a result one 
can see greater post mortem damage to the skeletal 
remains at the initial site of trauma.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[39] Accordingly, one can deduce that, had there been any trauma
to a particular bone, this would have attracted the very
intrusion by animals that would in all likelihood have
obliterated evidence of the source of the original trauma.
[40] Accordingly, having read the fresh evidence, I think the
fairest conclusion is that, because of the state of the remains
of Julie Stanton, the possibility that an axe was used to inflict
some injury to the body cannot be excluded.  This result cannot
be treated as contradicting the appellant&#146;s version of the
killing as reported by Udall.  However, even if the court were to
accept the evidence of Dr. Jaffe that the use of an axe was
unlikely, this limited conclusion would not affect the
credibility of Udall.  He was merely recounting what the
appellant told him.
[41] More importantly, the appellant made other references to an
axe to persons whose credibility was never in issue.  First,
Alison Stark testified that the appellant told her that an axe
was missing from the boat, that Pat Stanton [Julie&#146;s mother] had
stolen it, and that she would plant it with the body.  The
missing axe had a 12&quot; handle and was normally stored on the back
deck on a shelf.  Alison Stark confirmed that it had not been
seen since the boat was brought up from New York the summer
before.  Second, the appellant told his daughter, Kim Stark, that
the axe would probably be placed with his fingerprints on it with
the body.
[42] Besides his statements about the axe, the appellant made
other statements that tend to corroborate Udall&#146;s report of his
confession.  According to Alison Stark, from the time when the
appellant&#146;s mother Emily called Alison (on April 17, 1990), to
the time the boat was searched (in late April, 1990), the
appellant believed that Julie was dead.  He told Alison that &#147;he
hoped, for his own sake, that they didn&#146;t find the body&#148;.  When
Alison responded that they did not even know if she was dead, he
said again:  &#147;If she is dead, I hope they don&#146;t find the body&#148;.
Finally, the appellant told Allan Whitaker that when they found
the body they would make sure it had his teeth marks in her ass.
[43] In overview, it is obvious to me that the fresh evidence,
far from casting doubt on the guilt of the appellant, adds
additional support for the theory of the Crown.  One of the
critical hurdles the Crown had at trial was to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that Julie Stanton was dead.  As the trial judge
instructed the jury, if they had a reasonable doubt on that
issue, &#147;you need not go any further in your deliberations&#148;.  The
Crown proceeded to meet this burden by relying on both
circumstantial and direct evidence.  The circumstantial evidence
consisted of testimony relating to Julie&#146;s personality and
lifestyle, and evidence showing that she had not been heard from
in four years and that extensive searches for her had been
unsuccessful.  The direct evidence was that of Udall.  He
provided the only affirmative explanation of what happened to
Julie Stanton.  Once the body was found, half buried in a bog,
there was no longer any doubt that she was dead and that she died
as a result of some unlawful means.  The fresh evidence thus
starkly confirms the theory of the Crown that Julie Stanton had
not simply disappeared.  The admission of the appellant that he
picked the victim up on April 16, 1990, coupled with the evidence
that he was the last person to see her alive, went a long way to
wrapping up the circumstantial case against the appellant.
[44] At the end of the day, the appellant&#146;s counsel conceded
that, effectively, the significance of the fresh evidence was
limited to the credibility of the testimony of Udall.  It is
therefore useful to note what else the appellant is alleged to
have said to Udall and what confirmation there is of it.
[45] Gerald Udall, the informant, testified that the Appellant
told him, while they were in the Whitby jail together in
September, 1992, that:</pre>
    <pre>
     He killed Julie Stanton.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He raped Julie Stanton.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He wanted to fuck her; she wouldn&#146;t go for it and started
     crying.  He got scared that she was going to run to her
     parents and that&#146;s when he chopped her.  He chopped her up
     with an axe.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He was meeting her weekly.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He drugged her with Valium/Diazepam.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He wore surgical gloves so there were no fingerprints.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He went to Florida and shouldn&#146;t have come back; he wouldn&#146;t
     have been arrested.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He was asked where the body was and said not to ask him
     that.  Without the body they couldn&#146;t convict him.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He knew the police were following him and he would take a
     ride &#147;out there&#148;.  He was playing games with them.
     </pre>
    <pre>     On that day he went to a muffler shop and he got his
     haircut.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He was changing his clothes that day so he couldn&#146;t be
     placed in one spot or another.
     </pre>
    <pre>     There was rust on the doorframe or bottom of his car.
     </pre>
    <pre>     He got three scratches from her but the police couldn&#146;t
     prove it because he was in the hospital at the time.</pre>
    <pre>[46] Apart from the location of the body, obviously the subject
of foul play, there is other confirmatory evidence supporting
significant details in what the appellant told Udall.  There is
evidence that the appellant bought a pair of &#147;dentist&#148; gloves to
use while working on his boat, that he had scratches that he
could not explain, that he had bought Halcion that was prescribed
for him, that he was seen to have changed clothes on the day in
question, that there was rust on his car, and that he had taken
the car to a muffler shop on April 16, 1990.  Later, as tape
recorded in conversations between Udall and the appellant, he
said he knew that he had told Udall &#147;I did it&#148;.  He also said, as
recorded, that if he got 25 years he would come out after 5 years
and confess to what he did.
[47] This appeal as it respects fresh evidence related to the
evidence of a jail house informant is somewhat unique.  We do not
have a purported recantation to place against the testimony of
the informant at trial as was the case in R. v. Babinski (1999)
44 O.R. (3d) 695 (C.A.) and R. v. Kelly (1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d)
449 (C.A.).  We have credible, albeit somewhat conflicting,
opinion testimony about the state of the remains of the deceased
that was unavailable to the jury at trial.  Even if the court was
to order a new trial, the fresh evidence cannot be used to
confront the informant because he is dead.  At the option of the
Crown, his evidence on the first trial could probably be read in
pursuant to s. 715 of the Criminal Code.  If the Crown elected to
do so, the opinion evidence as to the lack of affirmative
evidence of axe blows to the remains of the deceased does not
mean that the appellant did not make the statements attributed to
him by Udall.  In point of fact, the fresh evidence does not
affect the credibility of any Crown witness.  The evidence of
what the appellant said to Udall is uncontradicted by the
appellant who did not testify.  Indeed it finds support in the
fresh evidence and in other statements attributed to the
appellant by witnesses whose credibility is not in issue.
[48] Accordingly, I am of the opinion that the fresh evidence, if
it had been available at trial, would not have affected the
result.
[49] For the reasons set out above, I would dismiss the appeal.
