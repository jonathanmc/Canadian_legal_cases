    <pre><strong>On appeal from the orders of Mr. Justice Hambly dated August 16,
1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ABELLA J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issue in these appeals is whether an insured who
purports to rescind a settlement under s. 9.1(4) of Ontario
Regulation 664 to the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8 is
obliged to return all monies received under that settlement
before the rescission is effected.
[2]  Clarence Stephan was involved in a motor vehicle accident on
July 2, 1996 in Ontario.  At the time, he had a motor vehicle
policy of insurance with the Insurance Corporation of British
Columbia and was a resident of British Columbia.
[3]  After the accident, he entered into negotiations with an
adjuster in British Columbia and settled his claim for accident
benefits for the sum of $32,112.95.
[4]  The terms of the settlement as reflected in the Release
include:</pre>
    <pre>          
               FULL AND FINAL RELEASE OF ALL CLAIMS
          </pre>
    <pre>               In consideration of the payment of, or
          the promise to pay, the sum of THIRTY-TWO
          THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED &amp; TWELVE----95/100
          dollars ($32,112.95)
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               The undersigned&#133; hereby release and
          forever discharge The Insurance Corporation
          of British Columbia under Part VII of the
          Regulations&#133; from any and all actions, causes
          of action, claims and demands&#133; in consequence
          of a car accident at or near Elmira, Ontario
          on or about the 2nd day of July, 1996.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               And it is hereby declared that the terms
          of this settlement are fully understood; that
          the amount stated herein is the sole
          consideration of this release and that the
          said sum is accepted voluntarily for the
          purpose of making a full and final
          compromise, adjustment and settlement of all
          claims for injuries, losses and damages
          resulting or to result from the said
          accident.  I confirm that I have been advised
          to consult legal counsel regarding any claims
          regarding W.C.B. and pain and suffering
          claims in Ontario. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[5]  Mr. Stephan was not given the written notice the insurer was
required to give him under s. 9.1(2) of Regulation 664 to the
Insurance Act.  This section states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          9.1(2)    Before a settlement is entered into
 	  between an insurer and an insured person, the
	  insurer shall give the insured person a written
	  notice that contains the following:
          </pre>
    <pre>          1.   A description of the benefits that
          may be available to the insured person under
          the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule and
          any other benefits that may be available to
          the insured person under a contract of
          automobile insurance.
          </pre>
    <pre>          2.   A description of the impact of the
          settlement on the benefits described under
          paragraph 1, including a statement of the
          restrictions contained in the settlement on
          the insured person&#146;s right to mediate,
          litigate, arbitrate, appeal or apply to vary
          an order as provided in sections 280 to 284
          of the Act.
          </pre>
    <pre>          3.   A statement that the insured person
          may rescind the settlement within two
          business days after the settlement is entered
          into by delivering a written notice to the
          insurer.
          </pre>
    <pre>          4.   A statement that the tax
          implications of the settlement may be
          different from the tax implications of the
          benefits described under paragraph 1.
          </pre>
    <pre>          5.   If the settlement provides for the
          payment of a lump sum in an amount offered by
          the insurer and, with respect to a benefit
          under the Statutory Accident Benefits
          Schedule that is not a lump sum benefit, the
          settlement contains a restriction on the
          insured person&#146;s right to mediate, litigate,
          arbitrate, appeal or apply to vary an order
          as provided in sections 280 to 284 of the
          Act, a statement of the insurer&#146;s estimate of
          the commuted value of the benefit and an
          explanation of how the insurer determined the
          commuted value.
          </pre>
    <pre>          6.   A statement advising the insured
          person to consider seeking independent legal,
          financial and medical advice before entering
          into the settlement.</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Mr. Stephan signed a Release incorporating the settlement in
British Columbia on July 29, 1997 and received the agreed funds.
[7]  Section 9.1(3) gives an insured an unconditional right to
rescind a settlement within two days:
          </pre>
    <pre>          9.1(3)    A settlement may be rescinded by the
	  insured person, within two business days after
	  the settlement is entered into, by delivering
	  a written notice to the insurer.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  At the heart of the appeal is an interpretation of s. 9.1(4)
which states:</pre>
    <pre>          (4)  If the insurer did not comply with subsection
	  9.1(2), the insured person may rescind the settlement
	  after the period mentioned in subsection (3) by
	  delivering a written notice to the insurer.</pre>
    <pre>The insurance company does not dispute that a notice under s.
9.1(2) was not provided to Mr. Stephan prior to his entering into
the settlement.  In a letter dated November 3, 1998, Mr. Stephan,
through his counsel, notified the insurer that he was rescinding
the settlement pursuant to s. 9.1(4).</pre>
    <pre>[9]  An application and a cross-application were before the
court.  Mr. Stephan sought an order declaring that the Release he
signed on July 29, 1997 in favour of the Insurance Corporation of
British Columbia does not prohibit him from pursuing a claim for
statutory accident benefits as against the Insurance Corporation
of British Columbia pursuant to the Ontario Insurance Act.  Since
he was not given the required notice by the insurer under s.
9.1(2), Mr. Stephan asserted that he was entitled under s. 9.1(4)
to rescind the settlement and have the Release set aside simply
by delivering a written notice to the insurer.
[10] The cross-application of the Insurance Corporation of
British Columbia was for an order that if Mr. Stephan was
successful in obtaining an order declaring that the settlement
was rescinded under s. 9.1(4), he was obliged to repay to the
Insurance Corporation of British Columbia the $32,112.95 he had
received pursuant to that settlement.
[11] The issue arises because the Financial Services Commission
of Ontario, which has the jurisdiction under s. 280 of the
Insurance Act to appoint a mediator to settle any disputes about
an insured&#146;s entitlement to statutory accident benefits, will not
accept Mr. Stephan&#146;s application until the Release is set aside.
The insurer refuses to set aside the Release until all the money
it has paid under the settlement has been returned.  It asserts
that since the settlement consists both of the signing of the
Release by the insured and the payment of the funds by the
insurer, the settlement cannot be said to be rescinded unless
both parties are put back into their pre-settlement position.  In
other words, to be effective under s. 9.1(4), rescission requires
both the setting aside of the Release and the return of the
settlement money.
[12] The applications judge held that the requirements of s.
9.1(4) were satisfied and that Mr. Stephan&#146;s written notice
rescinded the settlement. Mr. Stephan was accordingly entitled to
pursue his accident benefits claim against the insurance company.
The insurance company&#146;s application to recover the funds was
dismissed without reasons.  This is an appeal by the insurer from
both orders.
[13] The narrow issue in these appeals is whether the phrase
&#147;rescind the settlement&#148; in s.9.1(4) of the Regulations requires
the repayment of any funds by an insured before a rescission has
crystallized.  In my view, there is no such prior obligation.
[14] The insurer argues that &#147;rescind&#148; in s. 9.1(4) should be
interpreted in accordance with the approach to the equitable
remedy of rescission:  unless both parties can be restored to
their original situations, rescission will not be granted. (See:
Guaranteed Company of North American v. Gordon Capital
Corporation (1999), 178 D.L.R. (4th) 1;  and Abram Steamship
Company v. Westville Shipping Company, [1923] A.C. 773 at 781
(H.L.).)  In the case before us, the insurer argues, that means
that the required mutuality involves the return of the settlement
funds as well as the setting aside of the Release.
[15] But it should be noted that even under equitable rescission,
the court will not order full restitution if it is not just to do
so (Fridman, The Law of Contract, 4th ed. (1999), at p.740).
Having put the insured in the position of thinking the funds are
properly his pursuant to a valid settlement, it can hardly be
said to be just that the insurer insist on restitio in integrum
before Mr. Stephan can pursue the rights he could have pursued
earlier had the insurer given him the required notice.
[16] In any event, we are not dealing here with the application
of the equitable remedy of rescission.  We are, instead, applying
a statutory right to rescind based on the failure by the insurer
to comply with a duty to provide the insured with written notice
of his rights.
[17] The settlement regulation in s. 9.1 of Ontario Regulation
664 is in the nature of consumer protection legislation.  (See
McLellan v. Pilot Insurance, [1997] O.I.C.D. No. 59 (O.I.C.).)
It requires written disclosure by the insurer to the insured of
the range of options available before a settlement is entered
into.  This gives the insured the opportunity to make an informed
choice between settlement and pursuing statutory accident
benefits.  Section 9.1(4) ensures that if this notice as set out
in s. 9.1(2) is not given, any settlement reached will not, at
the option of the insured, be binding.  Any monies paid under
such a settlement are monies paid by an insurer entering into a
contract it knows is voidable, to an insured who thinks the
settlement is binding.
[18] What then is the status of any money paid under the
settlement?  The simple answer is that the insurer is entitled to
it.  This is different from the argument made by the insurer in
this case that it is entitled to the money before the rescission
contemplated by s.9.1(4) can be said to have taken place.  When
the insured delivers the written notice under s. 9.1(4), the
settlement contract is rescinded.  The insured at that moment
becomes indebted to the insurer for any money received under that
settlement.  But he or she is not precluded from treating the
settlement as void if the settlement funds have not been fully
repaid.
[19] The intention of the statutory right of rescission under s.
9.1(4) is to remedy the failure of the insurer to inform the
insured of all options with respect to the claim.  To give effect
to this intention, it naturally flows that if the settlement is
rescinded, the Release, which incorporates the settlement, is no
longer binding.
[20] To me, the issues of whether the settlement has been
rescinded and whether Mr. Stephan is obliged to repay the money
are discrete and severable.  The settlement is rescinded once
written notice is given under s.9.1(4).  Mr. Stephan is thereby
obliged to repay the settlement money.  But there is no duty of
contemporaneity imposed on him, and the repayment of the
settlement money is not a condition precedent to an insured&#146;s
entitlement to pursue claims for statutory accident benefits
under the Insurance Act.
[21] There are, in short, four legal consequences which
immediately flow from the delivery of the written notice under s.
9.1(4):</pre>
    <pre>   1.  The settlement is rescinded;</pre>
    <pre>   2.   The Release incorporating the settlement is voided;            </pre>
    <pre>   3.   Any settlement monies paid to the insured become due
        and owing;  and</pre>
    <pre>   4.   The insured has the right to pursue a claim for statutory
        accident benefits.</pre>
    <pre>[22] Interpreting the legislation in this way does not condone
double recovery.  The money Mr. Stephan has received from the
insurance company is a debt which came into existence when he
invoked his s. 9.1(4) rights.  It may be that after a
determination by an arbitrator of his rights, the insurance
company will owe Mr. Stephan more than it had previously paid;
on the other hand, Mr. Stephan may be found to be entitled to
less.  Those eventualities have nothing to do with whether Mr.
Stephan is entitled to exercise his right to set aside the
settlement in circumstances where, in violation of the statutory
duty, his rights were not explained to him.  Nor do they have
anything to do with the insurer&#146;s right immediately to enforce
the debt Mr. Stephan now owes.
[23] Accordingly, the appeal from the order setting aside the
Release signed by the applicant on July 29, 1997 is dismissed and
Mr. Stephan is entitled to pursue his benefits claim.
[24] The appeal from the order dismissing the insurer&#146;s
application should, however, be allowed.  The order of Hambly J.
dismissing the insurer&#146;s application is, therefore, set aside.
As stated above, the rescission of a settlement under s. 9.1(4)
entitles an insurer to the return of any funds paid pursuant to
the settlement.  There will therefore be an order as requested by
the insurer in its cross-application declaring that it is
entitled to the return of the settlement funds.
[25] Since there has been mixed success in this case, there will
be no order as to costs.
