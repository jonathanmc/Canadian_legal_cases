<p><b>On appeal from the judgment of Justice B.T. Granger J. dated 17 June 1997.</b></p>
<p class=headingtitle><u>MACPHERSON J.A.:</u></p>
<p class=headingtitle><u>INTRODUCTION</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In 1992 Wayne Strong was the Plant Manager of General Motors of Canada 
  Ltd.’s Trim Plant in Windsor, Ontario.  On November 17, 1992, General Motors 
  (“GM”) dismissed him because of his alleged sexual assault on Micheline Paquet.  
  In 1992 Paquet was an employee at GM’s head office in Oshawa.   She made a complaint 
  related to an incident seven years earlier, when she had been a GM employee 
  in Montreal and attended a training session at the Guild Inn in Scarborough.  
  Strong was an instructor at the session.  She alleged that Strong raped her 
  in his bedroom.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> GM investigated Paquet’s complaint and decided to dismiss Strong.  After 
  his dismissal, Strong initiated two lawsuits:  one against Paquet for defamation; 
  the other against GM for wrongful dismissal.  Paquet counterclaimed for damages 
  for sexual assault.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The two actions were heard together by Granger J.  He dismissed both 
  of Strong’s actions.  He also dismissed Paquet’s counterclaim on the basis that 
  it was statute barred by the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Strong and Paquet both appeal from Granger J.’s decision.  Strong’s 
  principal ground of appeal is that the trial judge’s decision was unreasonable 
  because he made factual findings unsupported by the evidence, misconstrued the 
  evidence, and made palpable and overriding errors of law.  Paquet asserts in 
  her cross-appeal that the <i>Limitations Act</i> is not a bar to her counterclaim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Strong’s appeal raises the issue whether the trial judge made a palpable 
  and overriding error in his assessment of the evidence or in his factual findings. 
  Paquet’s cross-appeal raises the issue whether a trial judge can apply a statutory 
  limitation period that is not pleaded by the party who will benefit from it.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On August 25, 1992, Paquet reported that she had been sexually assaulted 
  by Strong on August 27, 1985.  Paquet’s complaint related to a GM training seminar 
  organized by Strong that she attended in August 1985.  Paquet testified at trial 
  that, at Strong’s request, she went to Strong’s room.  After consuming a drink 
  offered by Strong, she became dizzy and unable to move.  Strong removed Paquet’s 
  clothing and then had intercourse with her.  When Paquet woke up, she returned 
  to her room and then went to bed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Paquet testified that the next morning she informed Catherine Ramsay 
  (another GM employee attending the seminar) what had happened to her.  This 
  was confirmed by Ramsay’s testimony.  Paquet further testified that, upon her 
  return from the seminar, she informed Carol Beaudry (a co-worker) that she had 
  been drugged and raped by Strong.  Beaudry testified that, although Paquet did 
  not tell her that she had been raped, Paquet did tell her that she believed

  </span> After receiving the complaint from Paquet, William Tate and Douglas 
  Burke (both senior executives at GM) met with Strong on October 14, 1992.  At 
  that meeting, Strong was advised that GM had received an allegation of sexual 
  misconduct on his part – specifically, that a complainant (Paquet was not identified 
  at this meeting) alleged that he drugged and raped her on August 27, 1985.  
  Strong was advised that GM intended to investigate the complaint, and also to 
  determine if there had been other instances of sexual misconduct or harassment 
  on his part.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The investigation revealed other instances of alleged sexual harassment.  
  These other complainants testified at trial.  Geraldine Lesperance complained 
  of two occasions of sexual harassment.  Lesperance testified that in 1991, while 
  she was attending a retirement party, Strong stood behind her and rubbed her 
  buttocks for five minutes.  Strong denied this.  Lesperance also testified that 
  during a blood donor clinic held at the GM plant, Strong, in the presence of 
  other employees, asked how she answered questions concerning her sexual history.  
  Strong indicated that there was some joking between himself, Lesperance and 
  other employees, but denied posing the question to Lesperance.  Lynda Gallop 
  accompanied Strong on a series of recruitment trips in 1980.  Gallop testified 
  that Strong acted in a flirtatious manner with hotel staff and flight attendants.  
  Gallop further testified that, on a flight in early 1980, Strong asked her what 
  kind of men she liked.  Strong denied making such a statement to Gallop.  Cynthia 
  Ulrich testified that on one occasion Strong stated that he and another employee 
  had been with at least one hundred women at the plant.  Strong denied making 
  this statement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After completing their investigation, Tate and Burke arranged to meet 
  with Strong on November 16, 1992.  At this meeting, Tate informed Strong that 
  the complainant was Paquet.  Tate then read Paquet’s statement.  Strong denied 
  knowing Paquet and denied any sexual misconduct.  Strong took the position that 
  Paquet was never in his hotel room.  Strong also denied any sexual harassment 
  or misconduct towards Lesperance, Gallop or Ulrich.  Strong acknowledged that 
  GM policy required him to refrain from sexual relations with subordinate workers.  
  He was shown a list of female employees who had been subordinate to him, and 
  he denied having sexual relations with any of them.  (Strong later testified 
  that he had, in fact, had sexual relations with some of these women.)  At the 
  end of the meeting, Tate advised Strong that GM would be recommending to its 
  U.S. parent termination of Strong’s employment. That afternoon, the recommendation 
  was accepted and Strong’s employment was terminated.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On November 17, 1992, Strong was advised in writing that his employment 
  had been terminated for cause.  He was offered 11 months’ salary.  Strong accepted 
  GM’s offer and, on November 19, 1992,  executed a full and final release with 
  respect to GM.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On November 2, 1994, Strong commenced an action against Paquet for damages 
  for defamation.  Paquet counterclaimed for damages for sexual assault.  On November 
  28, 1994, Strong commenced an action against GM for damages for wrongful dismissal.  
  By judgment dated June 17, 1997, Granger J. dismissed all claims and counterclaims.  
  After hearing further submissions, the trial judge ordered that Strong pay the 
  costs of Paquet and GM on a solicitor and client basis.  He fixed those costs 
  at $228,780.19 plus GST.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'>(2)       
  <u>The trial judgment</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found that Strong was not a credible witness.  This 
  finding was based on, <i>inter alia</i>, the fact that Strong lied to Tate and 
  Burke during the meeting of November 16, 1992, and Strong’s willingness to embarrass 
  employees or former employees.  In contrast, the trial judge found that Ulrich, 
  Gallop and Lesperance were reliable witnesses and accepted their evidence.  
  The trial judge also found Paquet to be a reliable witness, and accepted her 
  evidence.  In assessing Paquet’s credibility, the trial judge noted that the 
  cross-examination did little to test the relevant parts of her evidence.  Moreover, 
  it was directed to showing that Paquet had consented to sexual intercourse with 
  Strong, although Strong had taken the position that the incident did not occur.  
  The trial judge further found that Paquet’s statements to Ramsay and Beaudry 
  were consistent with her evidence as to what happened in Strong’s hotel room, 
  and helped to determine her credibility.  Finally, the trial judge concluded 
  that the fact that Paquet did not immediately report the incident did not detract 
  from the veracity of her complaint.  He attributed Paquet’s decision to report 
  the assault to changed attitudes on the part of GM.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After reviewing the evidence, the trial judge found as a fact that it 
  was the effect of alcohol, and not any drug, that caused Paquet to feel dizzy.  
  He then concluded that he was “satisfied on a balance of probabilities … that 
  Ms. Paquet attended at Mr. Strong’s hotel room on the evening of August 27, 
  1985, and was sexually assaulted by Mr. Strong.”  He was “also satisfied that 
  Mr. Strong sexually harassed Ms. Ulrich, Ms. Gallop and Ms. Lesperance.”  In 
  general, he found “Mr. Strong’s denials to be hollow and unconvincing.”  On 
  the basis of these findings, he dismissed Strong’s action against Paquet on 
  the ground that “the statements which Mr. Strong claims defamed him were true 
  and as such are a complete defence to his action against Ms. Paquet.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge then considered Strong’s action against GM.  He had 
  some criticism for the manner in which GM carried out its investigation, finding 
  that GM had accepted the allegations as true prior to the meeting on November 
  16, 1992.  However, notwithstanding such criticism, he dismissed Strong’s action 
  for damages for wrongful dismissal on the  grounds that sexual assault constituted 
  cause for termination of employment without notice.  Having reached this conclusion, 
  he found that it was not necessary to determine whether the instances of sexual 
  harassment, or the failure to be truthful at the November 16 meeting, also constituted 
  cause for termination without notice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also reviewed the release executed by Strong.  He found 
  that, on its face, the release would preclude Strong from bringing any action 
  against GM.  He further found that there was no evidence of unconscionability, 
  fraud or misrepresentation on the part of GM, or lack of capacity on the part 
  of Strong.  Accordingly,  he found that Strong was bound by the release.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the trial judge found that Paquet’s counterclaim against Strong 
  was statute barred pursuant to s. 45(1)(j) of the <i>Limitations Act</i> which 
  requires that  a civil action for assault be brought within four years after 
  the cause of action arose.  Paquet made her claim against Strong only after 
  he had sued her for defamation in 1994.  This was nine years after the alleged 
  sexual assault in the Scarborough hotel room.  In reaching this decision, the 
  trial judge held that a counterclaim was an action and was, therefore, covered 
  by s. 45(1)(j) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  He applied the decision of this 
  court in <i>Attorney General for Ontario v. Palmer et al.</i> (1979), 28 O.R. 
  (2d) 35 (C.A.), stating that it “remains the law in Ontario and as such is binding 
  upon me”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, the trial judge also indicated that, if Paquet’s counterclaim 
  were not statute barred, he would have found in her favour on the merits and 
  assessed damages for the sexual assault at $100,000.</p>

  </span> <u> ‘Palpable and overriding error’</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant asserts that the trial judge made several major errors 
  in his assessment of the evidence and in his factual findings.  These alleged 
  errors can be divided into three categories.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, the appellant submits that the trial judge made several findings 
  of fact that were unsupported by the evidence.  In particular, the appellant 
  submits that the trial judge should not have accepted Paquet’s testimony, given 
  his conclusion that her dizziness was probably caused by alcohol, rather than 
  a drug slipped into her drink. The appellant argues that in the absence of a 
  reasonable explanation for what Paquet experienced in the hotel room, it is 
  impossible to accept that Paquet was in fact in the hotel room.  Further, the 
  appellant submits that there is no basis for the trial judge’s conclusion that 
  GM did little to encourage employees to report sexual harassment until 1992.  
  The appellant argues that, if this finding is set aside, Paquet’s reliability 
  is called into question as there is no reasonable explanation for her failure 
  to report the incident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the appellant contends that the trial judge made several findings 
  of fact which resulted from a misapprehension of evidence.  In particular, the 
  appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended the following:  the timing 
  of comments made by Strong at a meeting of the Women’s Advisory Council at the 
  Windsor Trim Plant;  Paquet’s statements to Ramsay and Beaudry soon after the 
  hotel room incident;  the thrust and effectiveness of the cross-examination 
  of Paquet;  and the testimony of the other female employees who described incidents 
  they had experienced with Strong.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge’s finding that the 
  release Strong signed was a bar to his action against GM was unreasonable in 
  so far as it was premised entirely upon his rejection of Strong’s evidence and 
  did not attach appropriate weight to the supporting opinion evidence of Dr. 
  Howard Book.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> An appellant faces a high hurdle when he challenges on appeal a trial 
  judge’s assessment of the evidence, including the credibility of witnesses, 
  and factual findings.  The appellant must establish that the trial judge committed 
  a palpable and overriding error in these domains.  As expressed by Ritchie J. 
  in the leading case, <i>Stein v. The Ship “Kathy K”</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802 
  at 808:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>These authorities are not to be taken as meaning that the 
  findings of fact made at trial are immutable, but rather that they are not to 
  be reversed unless it can be established that the learned trial judge made some 
  palpable and overriding error which affected his assessment of the facts.  While 
  the Court of Appeal is seized with the duty of re-examining the evidence in 
  order to be satisfied that no such error occurred, it is not, in my view, a 
  part of its function to substitute its assessment of the balance of probability 
  for the findings of the judge who presided at trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the appellant does not come close to demonstrating that 
  the trial judge in this case committed a palpable and overriding error in his 
  assessment of the evidence or in his factual findings.  The fundamental fact 
  is that the trial judge believed Paquet and disbelieved Strong.  Moreover, he 
  did not state these conclusions in a bald, unsupported fashion.  Rather, he 
  was at pains to substantiate his findings by referring in considerable detail 
  to the testimony of many of the witnesses and to the other evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In particular, the trial judge provided a full explanation for his conclusion 
  that Strong’s denials were “hollow and unconvincing”.  He pointed out that Strong 
  had lied during GM’s investigation and that his lies (which he maintained until 
  his examination for discovery) cast aspersions on the integrity of several female 
  GM employees.  Moreover, he also lied in a letter he wrote to the President 
  of GM protesting his innocence.  The trial judge was also unimpressed by the 
  manner in which Strong conducted himself at the trial:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>During the course of this trial, Mr. Strong never apologized 
  or indicated any remorse for branding employees at General Motors as liars when 
  he knew in fact they had told the truth.  On the contrary, Mr. Strong demonstrated 
  a willingness to embarrass employees or former employees of General Motors who 
  appeared at this trial by revealing or suggesting mistakes which they may have 
  made in their private lives and which had very little, if any, relevance to 
  the issues before this Court.  Much of the cross-examination of Cyndy Ulrich, 
  Lynda Gallop, Geraldine Lesperance and Micheline Paquet was designed to embarrass 
  and humiliate each of them on matters which did not go to the core of their 
  evidence or to the issues in this trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the appellant’s first ground of appeal is essentially an 
  invitation to this court to re-try the case.  In light of the high hurdle of 
  the ‘palpable and overriding error’ test, and in light of the trial judge’s 
  clear and fully documented findings concerning the credibility of witnesses, 
  especially Paquet and Strong, the invitation must be declined.  The trial judge’s 
  ultimate conclusion was:  “I am satisfied on a balance of probabilities and 
  I must state that I am also satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that Ms. Paquet 
  attended at Mr. Strong’s hotel room on the evening of August 27, 1985 and was 
  sexually assaulted by Mr. Strong.”  I see no reason to interfere with this conclusion.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge awarded solicitor and client costs to both Paquet and 
  GM.  The appellant appeals the award to Paquet on the basis that all of her 
  costs would have been indemnified by GM.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Strong initiated two separate actions, one against Paquet for defamation, 
  the other against GM for wrongful dismissal.  Both defendants retained Mr. O’Sullivan 
  and Ms. Wynne.  The actions were joined and Mr. O’Sullivan and Ms. Wynne represented 
  the defendants throughout the nine-day trial.  In his supplementary reasons 
  for judgment dealing with costs, the trial judge stated:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>I was assured by Ms. Wynne that Ms. Paquet had retained 
  Mr. O’Sullivan, and that his firm was at liberty to send Ms. Paquet an account 
  for legal services rendered.  If Ms. Paquet was not obligated to pay any monies 
  to the solicitors that acted on her behalf, she would not be entitled to make 
  a claim for costs.  As she retained Mr. O’Sullivan and obligated herself to 
  be responsible for his legal services, she is entitled to seek costs against 
  Mr. Strong.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify'>There is nothing in the record before this court 
  to call into question either Ms. Wynne’s assurance or the trial judge’s conclusion.  
  I would not, therefore, give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge dismissed Paquet’s counterclaim for damages for sexual 
  assault on the basis that it was barred by s. 45(1)(j) of the <i>Limitations 
  Act</i>:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>45.(1) The following actions shall be commenced within and 
  not after the times respectively hereinafter mentioned, …</p>

<p style='text-align:justify'>The trial judge held that a counterclaim was an

<p class=headingNUMBER> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Paquet contends that the trial judge erred in two respects – first, 
  he should not have considered the limitation issue because Strong had not pleaded 
  it; and second, he should not have applied <i>Palmer</i> because it cannot stand 
  in light of more recent decisions  of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with

  </span> <u>The pleadings issue</u></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue of the <i>Limitations Act</i> was a live one at the trial.  
  Paquet pleaded in her Statement of Defence that Strong’s action against her 
  was barred by s. 45(1)(i) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  The trial judge dealt 
  fully with this issue in his judgment.  It appears that during closing arguments 
  the trial judge raised the question whether Paquet’s counterclaim might be barred 
  by s. 45(1)(j) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  Counsel were given time to prepare 
  submissions on this issue and, in the result, the trial judge decided that Paquet’s 
  counterclaim was barred.  In his reasons on this issue, the trial judge dealt 
  only with whether a counterclaim was covered by the word ‘action’ in s. 45(1)(j).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In her Notice of Cross-Appeal, Paquet challenged the trial judge’s decision 
  on the counterclaim/action issue.  However, her first  ground of appeal was 
  that Strong had not pleaded s. 45(1)(j) of the <i>Limitations Act</i> and that 
  this failure was fatal to his, and the trial judge’s, reliance on it.  Unfortunately, 
  although this argument was advanced before the trial judge, he did not address 
  it in an otherwise comprehensive judgment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, Paquet is entitled to succeed on this ground of appeal.  
  There is nothing in Strong’s pleadings about the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  In 
  <i>Kalkinis (Litigation Guardian of) v. Allstate Insurance Co. of Canada</i> 
  (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 528 at 533 (C.A.), Finlayson J.A. said:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>It has long been established that the parties to a legal 
  suit are entitled to have a resolution of their differences on the basis of 
  the issues joined in the pleadings: see rule 25.06.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, are particularly 
  specific about the pleading of affirmative defences.  Rule 25.07(4) provides:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE>25.07(4)  In a defence, a party shall plead any matter on 
  which the party intends to rely to defeat the claim of the opposite party and 
  which, if not specifically pleaded, might take the opposite party by surprise 
  or raise an issue that has not been raised in the opposite party’s pleading.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Ontario courts have consistently held that rule 25.07(4) applies 
  to pleadings relating to limitations that might bar an action: see <i>Pringle 
  v. London (City) Police Force</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 1834 (C.A.); <i>D.S. Park 
  Waldheim v. Epping</i> (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 83 (Gen. Div.); and <i> B.(P.) v. 
  B. (W.)</i> (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 161 (Gen. Div.).  See also Mew, <i>The Law 
  of Limitations</i> (Markham: Butterworths, 1991), at p. 54.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see no reason for departing from these authorities in the present 
  appeal.  The fact that the trial judge gave counsel time to prepare submissions 
  on the issue after he raised it during closing argument does not remove the 
  potential prejudice to Paquet.  If Strong had raised the issue in his pleadings, 
  Paquet might have tried to settle, or even have abandoned, her counterclaim.  
  Either decision might have had costs consequences.  Another potential source 
  of prejudice arises from the fact that counsel for Paquet might have adopted 
  different tactics at trial.  In particular, counsel might have called different 
  or additional evidence to support an argument that the discoverability principle 
  applied.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, I note that Strong’s claim against Paquet (defamation) and 
  Paquet’s claim against Strong (sexual assault) were essentially mirror images 
  of each other.  In such circumstances, the result reached by the trial judge, 
  namely Strong’s claim against Paquet was not statute barred but Paquet’s claim 
  against Strong was statute barred, is an anomalous and unsatisfactory result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, I note that at no time during the trial, including during the 
  closing arguments when the trial judge raised the limitation issue, did Strong 
  seek to amend his pleadings.  Nor, indeed, did he seek such an amendment during 
  the appeal hearing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons, I would allow the cross-appeal on the pleadings issue.  
  Fortunately, the trial judge considered the question of Paquet’s damages in 
  the event he was wrong in dismissing the cross-appeal.  He assessed those damages 
  at $100,000.  I see no basis for interfering with that assessment.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In light of my conclusion on the pleadings issue, it is not necessary 
  to consider whether this court’s decision in <i>Attorney General for Ontario 
  v. Palmer et al</i>., <i>supra</i>, should be overruled.  Since anything I would 
  say on this important issue would be <i>obiter</i>, I am inclined to forego 
  discussion of it.  However, since Paquet argued vigorously that <i>Palmer</i> 
  should be overruled, I note that this court has a general practice of constituting 
  a five-judge panel if a party submits that the court should overrule one of 
  its previous decisions: see, for example, <i>R. v. White</i> (1996), 29 O.R. 
  (3d) 577 (C.A.), and <i>Bates v. Bates</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 2269 (C.A.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would dismiss the appeal.  I would allow the cross-appeal and order 
  that Strong pay Paquet $100,000 in damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would award Paquet her costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal.  
  There is no need to alter the trial judge’s costs order because he awarded costs 
  to Paquet even though success at the trial was, in a formal sense, divided.
