<p>On appeal from the judgment of Pitt J. dated September 1, 1999.</p>
<p>AUSTIN J.A.: </p>
<p>[1] This appeal considers whether rents received by a commercial landlord are 
  trust funds and remain so by reason of s. 7(2) and (3) of the Construction Lien 
  Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.C30 (&#147;the Act&#148;) until a contractor working on the 
  property is paid.</p>
<p>[2] Westcola Holdings Inc. (&#147;Westcola&#148;) is a commercial landlord. 
  It owns a commercial building in Toronto and leases parts of it to various tenants. 
  Frank Colatosti (&#147;Colatosti&#148;) is the sole principal of Westcola.</p>
<p>[3] Structural Contracting Limited (&#147;Structural&#148;) is a construction 
  company. In April 1997 Structural contracted with Westcola to renovate the underground 
  parking garage of Westcola&#146;s building. The final price agreed upon was 
  $215,000.</p>
<p>[4] The work was completed by September 29, 1997. The contract provided that 
  the progress of the work was to be certified by Westcola&#146;s consultant Trow 
  Consulting Engineers Ltd. (&#147;Trow&#148;). Trow certified substantial completion 
  of the work on October 23, 1997 and published the Certificate of Substantial 
  Completion on October 28, 1997.</p>
<p>[5] Westcola did not undertake any financing specifically for the work contracted. 
  Instead, in so far as it made payments to Structural, they were paid out of 
  general revenue. Approximately $90,000 remained unpaid and Structural commenced 
  this action to recover that money.</p>
<p>[6] After the certification of substantial completion, Westcola received rents 
  on a regular basis from the tenants of the building. These were deposited in 
  Westcola&#146;s bank account. From that account, payments were made with respect 
  to various services and expenses necessary for the continued operation of the 
  building. These included heat, hydro, janitorial, maintenance, property taxes, 
  goods and services tax and mortgage payments. The total amount of the payments 
  exceeds the amount claimed by Structural.</p>
<p>[7] Following the production of documents and the examination for discovery 
  of Colatosti, Structural moved for summary judgment. Westcola admitted liability 
  on the basis of the contract. On September 1, 1999, Pitt J. found both defendants 
  liable on the basis of breach of trust. That basis is reflected in the formal 
  judgment; the admitted liability of Westcola in contract is not so reflected 
  in the formal judgment. To that extent, the formal judgment is deficient although 
  no claim to correct it was raised by Structural on this appeal.</p>
<p>[8] Both defendants purport to appeal against the judgment as pronounced. Westcola&#146;s 
  appeal is moot in the sense that whatever might happen on its appeal, it should 
  remain liable in contract. It is not moot in the sense that by reason of the 
  opening words of s.13(1) of the Act, Colatosti&#146;s liability in trust is 
  dependent upon Westcola first being found liable for breach of trust under s.7(3). 
  Accordingly, it is necessary to deal with the liability of both Westcola and 
  Colatosti in considering Colatosti&#146;s appeal.</p>
<p>[9] The claim for damages for breach of trust is based upon the Act, ss. 7 
  and 13. Those provisions as are follows: </p>
<p class="indent">Trust Provisions</p>
<p class="indent">7.(1) All amounts received by an owner, other than the Crown 
  or a municipality, that are to be used in the financing of the improvement, 
  including any amount that is to be used in the payment of the purchase price 
  of the land and the payment of prior encumbrances, constitute, subject to the 
  payment of the purchase price of the land and prior encumbrances, a trust fund 
  for the benefit of the contractor.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Where amounts become payable under a contract to a contractor 
  by the owner on a certificate of a payment certifier, an amount that is equal 
  to an amount so certified that is in the owner&#146;s hands or received by the 
  owner at any time thereafter constitutes a trust fund for the benefit of the 
  contractor.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where the substantial performance of a contract has been 
  certified, or has been declared by the court, an amount that is equal to the 
  unpaid price of the substantially performed portion of the contract that is 
  in the owner&#146;s hands or is received by the owner at any time thereafter 
  constitutes a trust fund for the benefit of the contractor.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) The owner is the trustee of the trust fund created by subsection 
  (1), (2) or (3), and the owner shall not appropriate or convert any part of 
  a fund to the owner&#146;s own use or to any use inconsistent with the trust 
  until the contractor is paid all amounts related to the improvement owed to 
  the contractor by the owner. 1983, c. 6, s. 7. [Emphasis added.]</p>
<p class="indent">&#133;</p>
<p class="indent">13.(1) In addition to the persons who are otherwise liable in 
  an action for breach of trust under this Part,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) every director or officer of a corporation; and</p>
<p class="indent">(b) any person, including an employee or agent of the corporation, 
  who has effective control of a corporation or its relevant activities,</p>
<p class="indent">who assents to, or acquiesces in, conduct that he or she knows 
  or reasonably ought to know amounts to breach of trust by the corporation is 
  liable for the breach of trust.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The question of whether a person has effective control of 
  a corporation or its relevant activities is one of fact and in determining this 
  the court may disregard the form of any transaction and the separate corporate 
  existence of any participant.</p>
<p class="indent">(3) Where more than one person is found liable or has admitted 
  liability for a particular breach of trust under this Part, those persons are 
  jointly and severally liable.</p>
<p class="indent">(4) A person who is found liable, or who has admitted liability, 
  for a particular breach of a trust under this Part is entitled to recover contribution 
  from any other person also liable for the breach in such amount as will result 
  in equal contribution by all parties liable for the breach unless the court 
  considers such apportionment would not be fair and, in that case, the court 
  may direct such contribution or indemnity as the court considers appropriate 
  in the circumstances. 1983, c. 6, s. 13.</p>
<p>[10] Structural&#146;s position is straightforward and simple and may be stated 
  as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">(a) Part II of the Act creates trusts designed to protect persons 
  engaged in the construction industry. Specifically, s. 7 creates trusts binding 
  the owner and s. 8 creates trusts binding the contractor.<br>
  <br>
  (b) In this case s. 7(3) and (4) apply.<br>
  <br>
  (c) Rents and other money in excess of $90,000 came into Westcola's hands after 
  the certification of substantial completion and was paid out without Structural 
  being paid in full.<br>
  <br>
  (d) The moneys paid to Westcola were impressed with a trust by reason of the 
  non-payment of Structural when money was due to it.<br>
  <br>
  (e) The only beneficiary of the trust was Structural.<br>
  <br>
  (f) When Westcola paid the trust money out to anyone other than Structural, 
  contrary to s. 7(4), it breached the trust and is thus liable to Structural 
  for the full amount of its claim.<br>
  <br>
  (g) Colatosti is also liable for breach of the trust by reason of the application 
  of s. 13 and by reason of the fact that he is the sole officer, director, signing 
  officer and controlling mind of Westcola and the person who signed all the cheques 
  by which funds were paid out of the corporation.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>[11] Colatosti raised three defences: </p>
<p class="indent">(a) Section 7(3) of the Act does not apply to money received 
  as rent and paid out for overhead expenses and mortgages;<br>
  <br>
  (b) In order for s. 13 to apply, it must be shown in evidence that Colatosti 
  assented to or acquiesced in conduct that he knew or reasonably ought to have 
  known amounted to a breach of trust. Only a trial can establish this knowledge.<br>
  <br>
  (c) Section 35 of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23 provides relief for 
  persons such as Colatosti in these circumstances.<br>
  <br>
</p>
<p>[12] In my respectful opinion, none of these defences is applicable to the 
  facts of this case.</p>
<p>(A)</p>
<p>[13] The first defence requires the interpretation of s. 7(3). In oral argument 
  counsel for Colatosti advanced a proposition even broader than as set out in 
  paragraph 11 (a) of these reasons. Counsel&#146;s position was that in order 
  for there to be any business at all, the trust in s. 7(3) had to be limited 
  to the amount of the profit in the owner&#146;s hands. The owner was free to 
  pay, and would have to pay, in order to keep the business functioning, heat, 
  light, gas, other utilities, municipal taxes and mortgage expenses. If he did 
  not, the business would fail and no one would be paid. Counsel was candid in 
  admitting that there was no jurisprudence which directly supported his proposition; 
  there simply were no cases on this issue.</p>
<p>[14] Counsel went on to raise obvious difficulties. What about tenants&#146; 
  rent deposits? What if the owner had a cheque in the mail en route to a mortgagee 
  when the certificate of a certifier was received? What is the owner to do, stop 
  payment on the cheque to the mortgagee? It was not suggested that any of these 
  specific situations actually existed in the instant case. They were just illustrations 
  of the problems that would inevitably arise if s. 7(3) were to be interpreted 
  as decided by Pitt J.</p>
<p>[15] It is therefore not necessary to deal with these questions as there is 
  no evidentiary support for them in the instant case. It may be the case, however, 
  that tenants&#146; deposits are subject to a separate trust and, therefore, 
  not available to Structural. Section 66 of the Act provides ready access to 
  the court for directions in such circumstances. It provides as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">66. Where a person is in possession of an amount that may be subject to a trust 
  under Part II, the person may apply to the court for direction and the court 
  may give any direction or make any order that the court considers appropriate 
  in the circumstances. 1983, c. 6. s.68.</p>
<p>No application was brought by either Westcola or Colatosti for directions.</p>
<p>[16] In so far as mortgage payments are concerned, mortgagees have their own 
  remedies, as do mortgagors. The concern in this appeal is not the protection 
  of mortgagees, but the protection of contractors and subcontractors.</p>
<p>[17] The Act provides no support for the argument of the owner. Section 7(3) 
  deals with cases where substantial performance is certified. That is the instant 
  case. The subsection provides that &#147;an amount that is equal to the unpaid 
  price&#133;that&#133;is received by the owner&#133;constitutes a trust fund 
  for the benefit of the contractor&#148;. Section 7(2) provides for cases where 
  amounts become payable by an owner to a contractor by virtue of certificates; 
  the relevant language is identical to that of s. 7(3). Section 7(4) prohibits 
  the use of any such funds by the owner until the contractor has been paid. It 
  may be that some payments coming into the hands of, or paid out of the funds 
  of, an owner such as Westcola are not subject to the trust imposed by s.7(3). 
  None were drawn to the court&#146;s attention in the instant case. </p>
<p>[18] As noted earlier, s. 8 of the Act deals with circumstances in which a 
  trust is imposed upon a contractor or subcontractor. Sections 9,10, 11 and 12 
  set out circumstances in which the amount of trust in either section 7 or 8 
  may be reduced. Sections 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 provide as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">8.(1) All amounts,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) owing to a contractor or subcontractor, whether or not due 
  or payable; or </p>
<p class="indent">(b) received by a contractor or subcontractor,</p>
<p class="indent">on account of the contract or subcontract price of an improvement 
  constitute a trust fund for the benefit of the subcontractors and other persons 
  who have supplied services or materials to the improvement who are owed amounts 
  by the contractor or subcontractor.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The contractor or subcontractor is the trustee of the trust 
  fund created by subsection (1) and the contractor or subcontractor shall not 
  appropriate or convert any part of the fund to the contractor&#146;s or subcontractor&#146;s 
  own use or to any use inconsistent with the trust until all subcontractors and 
  other persons who supply services or materials to the improvement are paid all 
  amounts related to the improvement owed to them by the contractor or subcontractor. 
  1983, c. 6, s.8.</p>
<p class="indent">9.(1) When the owner&#146;s interest in a premises is sold by 
  the owner, an amount equal to,</p>
<p class="indent">(a) the value of the consideration received by the owner as 
  a result of the sale,</p>
<p class="indent">less,</p>
<p class="indent">(b) the reasonable expenses arising from the sale and the amount, 
  if any, paid by the vendor to discharge any existing mortgage indebtedness on 
  the premises,</p>
<p class="indent">constitues a trust fund for the benefit of the contractor.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) The former owner is the trustee of the trust created by 
  subsection (1), and shall not appropriate or convert any part of the trust property 
  to the former owner&#146;s use or to any use inconsistent with the trust until 
  the contractor is paid all amounts owed to the contractor that relate to the 
  improvement.</p>
<p class="indent">10. Subject to Part IV (holdbacks), every payment by a trustee 
  to a person the trustee is liable to pay for services or materials supplied 
  to the improvement discharges the trust of the trustee making the payment and 
  the trustee&#146;s obligations and liability as trustee to all beneficiaries 
  of the trust to the extent of the payment made by the trustee. 1983, c. 6, s. 
  10.</p>
<p class="indent">11.(1) Subject to Part IV, a trustee who pays in whole or in 
  part for the supply of services or materials to an improvement out of money 
  that is not subject to a trust under this Part may retain from trust funds an 
  amount equal to that paid by the trustee without being in breach of the trust.</p>
<p class="indent">(2) Subject to Part IV, where a trustee pays in whole or in 
  part for the supply of services or materials to an improvement out of money 
  that is loaned to the trustee, trust funds may be applied to discharge the loan 
  to the extent that the lender&#146;s money was so used by the trustee, and the 
  application of trust money does not constitute a breach of the trust. 1983, 
  c. 6, s. 11.</p>
<p class="indent">12. Subject to Part IV, a trustee may, without being in breach 
  of trust, retain from trust funds an amount that, as between the trustee and 
  the person the trustee is liable to pay under a contract or subcontract related 
  to the improvement, is equal to the balance in the trustee&#146;s favour of 
  all outstanding debts, claims or damages, whether or not related to the improvement. 
  1983, c. 6, s. 12.</p>
<p>[19] Sections 9, 10, 11 and 12 demonstrate that the Legislature considered 
  the question of reducing the amount of a trust fund, but the Act contains no 
  exceptions of the kind suggested by the appellants. The strictures of a trust 
  apply to any and all money coming in to the hands of the owner, up to the amount 
  owing to the contractor, in this case approximately $90,000. As a practical 
  matter, the limitation on the application of s. 7(3) proposed by counsel for 
  the defendants, namely restricting the trust to profits in the hands of the 
  owner, would turn actions to enforce the trust sections of the Act into accounting 
  exercises. Nothing in the Act suggests that that was the intention of the Legislature 
  in passing s. 7(3). Indeed, the italicized portion of s.7(4), which is set out 
  in para. [9], which conforms with ss. 8(2), 9(2) and 11(2) illustrates the contrary.</p>
<p>[20] The appellant&#146;s factum draws a distinction between ss. 7 and 8 of 
  the Act. As noted earlier, s. 8 imposes a trust upon certain funds received 
  by the contractor while s. 7 imposes a trust on the owner. A line of cases has 
  decided that the contractor is not entitled to pay overhead from those funds 
  at the expense of subcontractors. (See for example: Rudco Insulation Limited 
  v. Toronto Sanitary Inc. et al (1998) 42 O.R. (3d) 292 (C.A.)). </p>
<p>[21] The appellants argue that the same considerations do not apply to s. 7, 
  particularly where the funds are received on account of rent, without which 
  the owner would be unable to provide the services required by its lease obligations. 
  I do not see how this submission can prevail given the language of s. 7(4).</p>
<p>[22] That argument must be rejected. Westcola is essentially a landlord. Rent 
  is not an incidental matter to it. Rent is its lifeblood, its raison d&#146;&ecirc;tre. 
  To exclude rent from the trust in the case of a landlord would be to exclude 
  Westcola from the application of s. 7. No justification has been suggested for 
  such a step.</p>
<p>[23] The appellant&#146;s first defence must therefore fail.</p>
<p>(B)</p>
<p>[24] The second defence is raised on behalf of Colatosti only. He relies on 
  s. 13 of the Act. For liability to attach to him, it must be shown in evidence 
  that he assented to or acquiesced in conduct that he knew or reasonably ought 
  to have known amounted to a breach of trust. He argues that those conclusions 
  cannot be drawn by inference and that only a trial can establish the necessary 
  knowledge. I disagree.</p>
<p>[25] Colatosti swore that he was a licensed real estate broker, that he was 
  not involved in the construction industry, that he was not familiar with the 
  provisions of the Act, that he was not aware of the publication of the Certificate 
  of Substantial Completion and that it never occurred to him, nor was it ever 
  suggested to him, that the rent payments received by the corporation might be 
  viewed as trust funds.</p>
<p>[26] Although it was a s. 8 case, a similar situation occurred in Tam-Kal v. 
  Stock Mechanical Inc. (1998), 43 C.L.R. (2d) 94 (Ont. Gen. Div.) aff&#146;d 
  [1999] O.J. No. 4371 (Ont. C.A.). There the issue was whether one Michael Cannone 
  was personally liable for the breaches of trust. In concluding that he was, 
  Ground J. said at p. 116: </p>
<p class="indent">[54] Counsel for Mr. Cannone submitted that the test must be subjective and 
  that there is no evidence before this court that Mr. Cannone actually knew or 
  should have known that certain of the payments made by Stock were not proper 
  trust fund payments. I reject such submission. The test in the statute is disjunctive 
  i.e. &#147;knows or reasonably ought to know&#148;. It seems to me that the 
  second wing of the test must necessarily depend upon an objective analysis as 
  to what a reasonable person ought to know in the circumstances. It is particularly 
  significant in our case that Mr. Cannone was the chief executive officer of 
  Stock and presumably the person responsible for making decisions as to payments 
  to suppliers and others. In Andrea Schmidt Construction Ltd. v. Glatt (1979), 
  25 O.R. (2d) 567 (Ont. H.C.), Saunders J. stated: </p>
<p class="indent">In my opinion, the participation by Burnac was of such a degree as to at least 
  put Burnac on inquiry as to whether there was a breach of trust committed by 
  the diversion. There were circumstances that would indicate to a reasonable 
  person that such a diversion might constitute a breach of trust and if a reasonable 
  inquiry had been made, the failure to pay Schmidt would, in all probability, 
  have been revealed.</p>
<p>And in G.V.B.S. Inc. v. Hydro Guard Inc. (1998), 40 C.L.R. (2d) 272 (Ont. Gen. 
  Div.), Somers J. stated at para. 58: </p>
<p class="indent">In my view, it is no defence that if a corporation&#146;s conduct 
  constituted a breach of the trust the person sought to be held responsible was 
  apparently acting mistakenly or pursuant to what he believed to be the true 
  situation.</p>
<p class="indent">[55] I must conclude that a person in the position of Mr. Cannone 
  with his years of experience in the construction industry and being the chief 
  executive officer of Stock, on any reasonable person test, ought to have known 
  that the payments referred to above, which I have disallowed as payments to 
  trust funds beneficiaries, were improper payments out of trust funds and that 
  accordingly Mr. Cannone has personal liability for breach of trust pursuant 
  to ss. 13(1) of the C.L.A. to the extent of the amount paid by Stock which were 
  improper applications of trust funds.</p>
<p>[27] In its endorsement dismissing the appeal from Ground J., this court said 
  at paragraph 16: &#147;In our opinion, Ground J. did not err in his application 
  of this [s. 13] section to the facts of this case&#148;.</p>
<p>[28] As Ground J. pointed out, the test in s. 13(1) of the Act is disjunctive. 
  As a result, one of the tests is &#147;reasonably ought to know&#148;. Unlike 
  Michael Cannone, Colatosti was the only person involved. He was the sole officer, 
  director, controlling mind and signing officer of the corporation and the person 
  who signed all of the cheques in question. Whether or not he knew he was committing 
  a breach of trust, it is beyond argument that he reasonably ought to have known 
  as he had effective control of the activities of the corporation. Accordingly, 
  the defence based upon s. 13 of the Act must fail.</p>
<p>(C)</p>
<p>[29] Colatosti&#146;s third defence is s. 35 of the Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990 
  c.T.23. It reads as follows: </p>
<p class="indent">Technical Breaches of Trust</p>
<p class="indent">35. If in any proceeding affecting a trustee or trust property 
  it appears to the court that a trustee, or that any person who may be held to 
  be fiduciarily responsible as a trustee, is or may be personally liable for 
  any breach of trust whenever the transaction alleged or found to be a breach 
  of trust occurred, but has acted honestly and reasonably, and ought fairly to 
  be excused for the breach of trust, and for omitting to obtain the directions 
  of the court in the matter in which the trustee committed the breach, the court 
  may relieve the trustee either wholly or partly from personal liability for 
  the same. R.S.O. 1980, c. 512, s. 35.</p>
<p>[30] In Dietrich Steel Ltd. v. Shar-Dee Towers (1987) Ltd. (1999), 45 C.L.R. 
  (2d) 178 (Ont. C.A.), a personal defendant appealed the finding of a trial judge 
  that he was personally liable for the breach of s. 8 of the Act. Before dealing 
  with the question of personal liability, the Court of Appeal had to deal with 
  the liability of the company which had defaulted at trial. In dealing with that 
  issue, the argument was raised whether s. 35 could apply to a breach of a specific 
  statutory trust. McKinlay J.A. speaking for the court said at pp. 8.359 and 
  8.360: </p>
<p class="indent">Assuming, without deciding the question, that s. 35 could apply to a breach 
  of a specific statutory trust, I have difficulty in seeing how the provisions 
  of s. 35 could apply to give relief to a contractor who becomes a trustee by 
  virtue of the provisions of s. 8 of the Construction Lien Act. The whole purpose 
  of the Act is to protect persons supplying services and materials to an &#147;improvement&#148; 
  to real property, and s. 8(2) sets out specific duties of a trustee. The trustee 
  must not appropriate funds to its own use or to a use inconsistent with the 
  trust until all amounts owed money by the trustee for services or materials 
  supplied to the improvement are paid. If we assume that a trustee passes the 
  test of honesty required by s. 35, I do not see how the trustee could pass the 
  test of reasonableness if it has acted contrary to the specific provisions of 
  s. 8(2). To say that the trustee&#146;s actions could be reasonable in such 
  a situation would be to subvert the whole raison d&#146;&ecirc;tre of the Act.</p>
<p>[31] McKinlay J.A. went on to relieve the personal defendant of liability, 
  but applying her words referable to the company to Colatosti, I conclude that 
  s. 35 is simply not available to him. Following the reasoning of McKinlay J.A. 
  and assuming without finding that Colatosti acted honestly, it is beyond argument 
  that he did not act reasonably. Nor can what happened here be described as a 
  &#147;technical breach of trust&#148;. No evidence has been tendered to suggest 
  that he &#147;ought fairly to be excused for the breach of trust&#148;. Fairness 
  in these circumstances raises the question who should bear the loss &#150; Colatosti 
  or Structural? There can be only one answer to that question.</p>
<p>[32] None of the defences raised can succeed. Colatosti raised, in addition, 
  a question respecting the rate of pre-judgment interest awarded against him. 
  The contract between Structural and Westcola specified interest at the rate 
  of 15 % per annum on overdue payments. The trial judge awarded this amount as 
  against both Westcola and Colatosti. The latter argues that he was not a party 
  to the contract and that if judgment is to be awarded against him, it is not 
  for breach of contract and accordingly the rate should be that specified by 
  the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990 c.C43 s. 128. I agree and paragraph 1 
  of the judgment should be varied to reflect that the pre-judgment rate of interest 
  awarded against Westcola is 15 percent and, as against Colatosti, is to be calculated 
  according to the Courts of Justice Act. If counsel are unable to agree on this 
  rate, it may be addressed by correspondence to the court.</p>
<p>[33] In all other respects, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
