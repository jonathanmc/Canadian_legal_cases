</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from verdicts rendered at a trial before a jury and Mr.
Justice R.G. Trainor.
</pre>
    <pre>DOHERTY J.A.:
                                I
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellants were charged with the first degree murder of
Constable Joe MacDonald.  It was acknowledged that Constable
MacDonald had been murdered in the course of the execution of his
duties, and that either Suzack or Pennett had fired the fatal
shots.  The Crown argued that the appellants, acting in concert,
had set upon Constable MacDonald when he stopped their vehicle
for a routine traffic stop, disabled him and then shot him five
times.  It was the Crown&#146;s position that both appellants beat
Constable MacDonald and shot him in the course of the attack.
Relying primarily on the physical evidence, the Crown argued that
Pennett had administered the fatal shots to the back of Constable
MacDonald&#146;s head.  The Crown contended that Pennett was guilty of
first degree murder as the shooter and that Suzack was guilty of
the same crime either as a co-perpetrator or an aider.  The Crown
also took the position that the jury could convict both men of
first degree murder as co-perpetrators or parties without
deciding which of the two had fired the fatal shots.
[2]  Suzack testified that Pennett had fired the fatal shots.  He
said that he was not party to any common design with Pennett to
murder Constable MacDonald.  Suzack admitted that he and Pennett
attacked the officer, and that he assumed the lead role in the
course of the assault on Constable MacDonald.  Suzack admitted
punching Constable MacDonald in the face and striking him several
times on the head with the murder weapon.  Suzack said, however,
that he never fired the gun and did not intend to kill Constable
MacDonald.  He only wanted to disable the officer so he could
escape.  Suzack was a parole violator and knew that if Constable
MacDonald learned his identity, he would have to go back to jail.
Suzack said that after he struck the officer several times, he
momentarily moved away from Constable MacDonald.  Pennett was on
top of MacDonald.  As Suzack moved back towards Constable
MacDonald intent upon continuing his assault, the Constable drew
his weapon and fired several shots, hitting Suzack four times.
Suzack said he remembered being shot, but very little of what
happened after he was shot.  He concluded that Pennett must have
picked up the murder weapon and shot and killed Constable
MacDonald to save Suzack&#146;s life.  Suzack&#146;s counsel conceded that
on his version of events, Suzack was guilty of manslaughter.
[3]  Pennett also testified.  He said he played no role in the
assault on Constable MacDonald by Suzack and had no idea Suzack
would attack the officer.  He admitted that at one point while
Suzack and Constable MacDonald were struggling on the ground, he
attempted to take Constable MacDonald&#146;s gun from its holster.  He
said that he did so because Suzack ordered him to and he was
afraid of Suzack.  He hoped that by getting the officer&#146;s gun he
would defuse the situation.  Pennett said that as Constable
MacDonald lay on the ground being hit by Suzack, he drew his
revolver and shot Suzack.  Suzack fired back, shooting and
killing MacDonald.  Pennett said that he sat &#147;frozen&#148; in fear
about 4 or 5 feet away as Constable MacDonald and Suzack
exchanged gunfire.  In support of his position, Pennett adduced
evidence of Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence and evidence of
statements made by Suzack to two witnesses (Paul Gibbs and Mike
Sweeney) before the shooting.  According to both witnesses,
Suzack said he would &#147;shoot it out&#148; with the police rather than
go back to jail.  Gibbs also testified that Suzack spoke to him
after the killing and admitted that he had shot Constable
MacDonald.  Suzack told Gibbs he acted in self-defence.
[4]  After a lengthy and hard-fought trial, the jury convicted
both appellants of first degree murder.
[5]  Counsel for Suzack and Pennett on appeal have skillfully
argued several grounds.  I would not give effect to any and would
dismiss the appeals.</pre>
    <pre>				II</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Suzack and Pennett had been friends for many years.  Both
have extensive criminal records.  They spent considerable time
together in the days immediately preceding the murder trying to
arrange a large drug transaction.  On the evening of October 6th,
they continued their attempts to arrange that transaction.  Both
were drinking throughout the evening.  They were on their way to
complete the drug transaction when they were stopped by Constable
MacDonald.
[7]  Constable MacDonald was patrolling a residential  area in
Sudbury in his police car during the early morning of October
7th.  He was in uniform.  Constable MacDonald followed the
vehicle driven by Pennett.  Suzack was seated in the front
passenger seat.  At about 2:23 a.m., the vehicle driven by
Pennett pulled into a residential driveway on Gordon Avenue and
Constable MacDonald pulled the police cruiser in behind it.
Constable MacDonald did not know Pennett or Suzack and from his
perspective this was a routine traffic stop.  Pennett got out of
the vehicle and went back to the police car.
[8]  Pennett did not have a licence and smelled of alcohol.
Suzack was a parole violator and there was a warrant outstanding
for his arrest.  Pennett knew that Suzack was a fugitive.  Suzack
had some $9,000 to be used to complete the drug transaction.  He
also had a loaded 9 millimeter gun (the murder weapon) in his
possession.  Both men had fired the gun at a roadside sign
moments before they were stopped by Constable MacDonald.  Suzack
had reloaded the gun after firing at the sign.
[9]  Constable MacDonald spoke briefly with Pennett after Pennett
walked back to the police vehicle.  He started to write out a
traffic ticket for Pennett, but he never completed that ticket.
Within 2 or 3 minutes of stopping the vehicle, Constable
MacDonald was engaged in a life and death struggle on the lawn
and in the ditch in front of a residence on Gordon Avenue.
Suzack claimed that Pennett attacked Constable MacDonald and
Suzack went to Pennett&#146;s aid.  Pennett said that Suzack came out
of the car and pointed a gun at the officer and attacked him.
Regardless of how the struggle started, Constable MacDonald was
knocked to the ground shortly after it commenced.  He suffered a
badly broken leg when he fell and was virtually disabled from
that moment forward.  He never got off the ground.
[10] The noise from the struggle drew the attention of several
neighbours, some of whom called 911.  The first call was made at
2:26 a.m. about three minutes after the Pennett vehicle was
stopped by Constable MacDonald.  Several of the neighbours who
saw different parts of the events as they unfolded in front of
1124 Gordon Street testified for the Crown.  Not surprisingly,
given their different vantage points, the lighting and their
excitement as the violence escalated, the evidence of the
neighbours differed in several respects.  For example, some saw
three people struggling on the lawn, while at least one saw only
two people fighting on the lawn.  One neighbour heard someone say
the word &#147;kill.&#148;
[11] According to Suzack, both he and Pennett attacked the
officer after he fell to the ground.  Suzack punched the officer
in the face several times.  When this appeared to have little
effect, he struck the officer on the head several times with the
muzzle of the murder weapon.  He wanted to knock him out.
Constable MacDonald&#146;s blood was found on the muzzle of the gun.
[12] Pennett denied striking the officer during this struggle,
but admitted that he did try to take Constable MacDonald&#146;s gun
away from its holster as he lay on the ground being attacked by
Suzack.  Constable MacDonald was lying on his right side and
doing his best to keep his assailants from taking his revolver.
At one point, Pennett ripped MacDonald&#146;s radio from his belt.
That radio was later found in the Pennett vehicle.  Pennett
admitted taking the radio but denied that his intention was to
monitor police calls to assist in his attempted escape.
[13] Mr. Jessie Hawes, a neighbour, heard the struggle and went
out onto his porch.  He saw one man (Suzack) bent over with an
object in his hand.  He appeared to be striking someone or
something on the ground.  Mr. Hawes left his home and headed
towards the confrontation.  He told his wife to call to 911.  He
saw the cruiser and thought that a police officer was being
attacked.  As he approached the area where the assault was
occurring, he heard a voice behind a bush say &#147;asshole fucker.&#148;
He then heard another voice say &#147;why not let me up and we&#146;ll talk
about it.&#148;  He then saw a person walking towards the appellants&#146;
vehicle.  Mr. Hawes said &#147;Alright you guys, that&#146;s enough leave
him alone.&#148;  The person who had walked towards the vehicle
(Suzack) turned, looked at Mr. Hawes and said &#147;you stay out of
this or I&#146;ll shoot you.&#148;  Mr. Hawes turned and left the area in a
hurry.  As he left he heard the person on the ground (MacDonald)
call out &#147;help me, help me call the police.&#148;  Suzack admitted
that he had threatened Hawes.
[14] When Suzack threatened Mr. Hawes, he racked the gun.  That
action placed a bullet in the chamber and readied the gun for
firing.  Once the gun was racked, all of the bullets in the gun
could be fired without re-racking the gun.  Seconds after Suzack
threatened Hawes, several shots rang out.
[15] The first shot was fired at 2:28 a.m., about 2 or 3 minutes
after the struggle started.  Although the evidence of the
witnesses varied as to the sequence and number of shots fired, it
would appear that 11 or 12 shots were fired in about 20 to 30
seconds.
[16] Six shots were fired by Constable MacDonald as he lay on the
ground.  Two struck Suzack in the chest and one shot grazed his
neck.  Constable MacDonald was hit with five shots fired from the
murder weapon.  He was struck in the right arm, the left arm and
three times in the back of the head.  One of the three bullets
entered his head directly and the other two passed through his
left shoulder before entering his head.  The wounds were
consistent with Constable MacDonald having taken a defensive
position face down with his arms above his head and his head
tucked below his shoulders.  The three shots which struck
Constable MacDonald in the head appeared to have come from the
rear and to the left of the officer.  It was possible that the
shots that hit Constable MacDonald in the arms also came from
behind.  The wounds suggested that the shooter was at least 18&#148;
from Constable MacDonald when the shots were fired.
[17] Pennett was struck in the right hand with a shot fired from
the murder weapon.  The shot was fired from close range.  It was
the Crown&#146;s contention that this was the same bullet that passed
through Constable MacDonald&#146;s right arm and that Pennett was
struck as he was trying to get the officer&#146;s gun.  It was
Suzack&#146;s position that Pennett had fired all of the shots and had
somehow shot himself in the hand.  Pennett had no explanation for
how he had been shot as on his evidence, he was 4 or 5 feet from
Constable MacDonald when Constable MacDonald and Suzack opened
fire on each other.  Pennett also had no sensible explanation for
how Suzack, who was in front of Constable MacDonald when he was
shot by him, could have fired three shots into the back of
MacDonald&#146;s head.  According to the expert evidence, Suzack was
about 12 to 17 inches in front of Constable MacDonald when
Constable MacDonald shot him.
[18] After the shooting had stopped, Suzack, who was badly
wounded, pleaded with Pennett to help him.  Pennett initially
refused to do so, but then relented and dragged Suzack to the
car.  Pennett backed the vehicle up struck the police vehicle,
and then sped away with Suzack slumped in the front seat.  By
this time, the police had responded to the neighbours&#146; call and
encountered the Pennett vehicle speeding away.  A pursuit ensued.
When the Pennett vehicle was eventually stopped by the police,
the passenger door opened and Suzack fell out onto the ground in
a semi-conscious state.  Suzack was taken to the hospital.
[19] Pennett fled the scene on foot.  He was eventually caught
and subdued after a vigorous struggle.  According to the
officers, Pennett said &#147;shoot me, shoot me&#148; when encountered by
the police.  Pennett could not recall what he said.  He testified
that throughout the pursuit he was very afraid that the police
would shoot him because they would assume that he was involved in
the killing of Constable MacDonald.
[20] Spatters of Constable MacDonald&#146;s blood were found on
Suzack&#146;s vest.  The spatters were consistent with having been
caused by Suzack striking Constable MacDonald&#146;s head with the
murder weapon.  The blood patterns on the vest were not
consistent with the high energy impact spatters normally
associated with gunshots.
[21] Pennett&#146;s blood was found on Constable MacDonald&#146;s lower
right pant leg, his portable radio and possibly on his boot.
Pennett&#146;s blood was found on the grip of the murder weapon.
Suzack&#146;s blood was not on the gun.  The weapon was found in the
car near the driver&#146;s seat.  Pennett was driving.  Pennett&#146;s
blood was also found on the ground in the area where the struggle
with Constable MacDonald had occurred.
</pre>
    <pre>				III</pre>
    <pre>[22] Suzack advances seven grounds of appeal:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge erred in refusing to grant a change of
  venue;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge erred in holding that s. 635(2) of the
  Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, as amended, S.C. 1992, c.
  41, s.2, was not unconstitutional;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge erred in refusing Suzack&#146;s applications for
  severance;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the limited use
  it could make of the evidence of Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence
  introduced by Pennett;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the use it could
  make of Suzack&#146;s pre-trial silence and his access to Crown
  disclosure;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge misdirected the jury as to the legal basis
  upon which Suzack could be convicted of murder;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge erred in law in failing to correct Crown
  counsel&#146;s submissions as to the relevance of Constable
  MacDonald&#146;s actions to Suzack&#146;s intent.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[23] Pennett joins in Suzack&#146;s contention that a change of venue
should have been granted and raises five additional grounds of
appeal:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury as to
  the use it could make of  the evidence of Suzack&#146;s propensity for
  violence;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge erred in his instruction as to the inference
  of consciousness of guilt that could be drawn from Pennett&#146;s
  flight, his resistance upon arrest and his statements made
  immediately prior to his arrest;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge erred in holding that Pennett could not
  adduce evidence of his post-arrest statements through Crown
  witnesses;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge erred in giving an &#147;unsavoury witness&#148;
  warning with respect to two defence witnesses called by Pennett;
  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the trial judge&#146;s review of the evidence was skewed in
  favour of the Crown.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>				IV</pre>
    <pre>Did the trial judge err in refusing to grant a change of venue?</pre>
    <pre>[24] The appellants unsuccessfully sought a change of venue.
They relied on pre-trial publicity beginning with the shooting in
October 1993 and extending through to September 1994 when the
change of venue application was made.
[25] The media coverage was extensive and, in parts, highly
emotional.  It evinced the community&#146;s understandable outrage at
the murder of a police officer and its deep sympathy for his
family.  Some of the coverage suggested that the criminal justice
system had failed Constable MacDonald and the community.  These
references were primarily a reaction to Suzack&#146;s release on
parole, despite strong opposition, shortly before the murder.
[26] The media reports made many references to the heinous nature
of the murder, the criminal antecedents of both appellants,
particularly Suzack, and the fact that Suzack was a parole
violator when he participated in the killing of Constable
MacDonald.
[27] The media coverage linked Constable MacDonald&#146;s death to
broader issues such as:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the circulation of a petition referred to as the &#147;MacDonald
  petition&#148; calling for the return of the death penalty.  Some
  12,000 people signed the petition;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  calls for tougher criminal laws and better armed police.
  These calls were supported by a lobby group which organized a
  &#147;black ribbon campaign&#148; in memory of Constable MacDonald.  Some
  40,000 black ribbons were distributed in the Sudbury area.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[28] The media coverage also reflected the community&#146;s strong
sympathy for Constable MacDonald&#146;s family.  Constable MacDonald
was a well-liked and respected young officer.  A trust fund for
his children and a scholarship for disadvantaged children were
established in his memory.  A youth football league was also
named in his honour.
[29] The appellants advanced two arguments in support of their
contention that the trial judge should have ordered a change of
venue.  The first submission accepts the law as it presently
exists and argues that the trial judge failed to exercise his
discretion in a judicial manner.  The second, and more ambitious,
submission contends that the principles under which change of
venue applications have been determined must be recalibrated in
the light of the Charter guarantee of the right to a fair trial.
The appellants submit that the Charter right to a fair trial
requires that the Crown demonstrate that an accused&#146;s right to a
fair trial can be preserved without a change of venue.  I will
consider first the appellants&#146; claim that under the existing law
the trial judge erred in refusing to direct a change of venue and
then I will address the second argument advanced by the
appellants.
[30] It is a well-established principle that criminal trials
should be held in the venue in which the alleged crime took
place.  This principle serves both the interests of the community
and those of the accused.  There will, however, be cases where
either or both the community&#146;s interests and the accused&#146;s
interests in a fair trial are best served by a trial in some
other venue.  Section 599(1)(a) of the Criminal Code provides in
part:
          </pre>
    <pre>    A court &#133; upon the application of the prosecutor or the
    accused [may] order the trial to be held in a territorial
    division in the same province other than that in which the
    offence would otherwise be tried if
          </pre>
    <pre>    (a)  it appears expedient to the ends of justice, &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[31] As the section indicates, a change of venue should be
ordered where the judge is satisfied that it &#147;appears expedient
to the ends of justice&#148;.  This determination will depend on the
judge&#146;s assessment of the evidence led on the application and the
weighing of the various factors which favour or tell against a
change of venue.  In short, the trial judge&#146;s decision requires
an exercise of discretion.
[32] In Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)
(1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 193 at 223 (S.C.C.), L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J.,
for the majority, said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   The concept of discretion refers to decisions where the law
   does not dictate a specific outcome, or where the decision-maker
   is given a choice of options within a statutorily imposed set of
   boundaries.</pre>
    <pre>[33] A review of the case law in which change of venue
applications have been made in cases involving the murder of a
police officer demonstrates that in similar cases the discretion
created by s. 599(1)(a) may properly be exercised in different
ways:  see R. v. Frederick and Chater (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 532
(Ont. H.C.);  R. v. Fitzgerald and Schoenberger (1981), 61 C.C.C.
(2d) 504 (Ont. H.C.);  R. v. Lepage, unreported May 3, 1985 (Ont.
H.C.);  R. v. Collins (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 343 (Ont. C.A.).
[34] The appellants accept, for the purposes of their first
submission on this ground of appeal, that this court can
interfere with the trial judge&#146;s exercise of his discretion only
if the trial judge erred in principle or if it can be said that
the exercise of his discretion was unreasonable in all of the
circumstances.  An error in principle encompasses a failure to
consider relevant factors, the taking into account of irrelevant
factors, and a failure to properly weigh the various applicable
factors:  R. v. Rezaie (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 103 (Ont.
C.A.).
[35] Trainor J., the trial judge, described his approach to the
discretion vested in him by s. 599(1) in terms that are
consistent with the case law:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; The obligation or onus is on the defence to show, on a
   balance of probabilities, that there is a fair and reasonable
   likelihood of partiality or prejudice in the Sudbury area, that
   cannot be overcome by the safeguards in jury selection, including
   the oath, instructions from the trial judge to the jury panel
   including jury screening, peremptory challenges, challenges for
   cause and the rules of evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[36] In deciding against ordering a change in venue, Trainor J.
gave considerable weight to the three factors.  He stressed the
numerous safeguards available to protect the appellants&#146; rights
to a fair trial within the trial process, including their right
to an extensive challenge for cause process.  He also observed
that most of the potentially prejudicial media coverage
concerning the criminal activities of the appellants had appeared
in the media over a year before the scheduled trial date.
Finally, Trainor J. identified the real source of potential
prejudice to the appellants as the evidence to be adduced in the
trial rather than the pre-trial publicity.  Trainor J. observed
that by the end of the Crown&#146;s opening address, the jury selected
to try the case, wherever the venue, would be apprised of facts
that could prejudice them against the appellants.  Counsel for
the appellants submit that this factor supported their claim for
a change of venue and Trainor J. erred in principle in relying on
that factor in refusing the change of venue.
[37] Trainor J. was correct in identifying exposure to the facts
of this case as the strongest source of potential prejudice.  On
any version of events, this was a cold-blooded murder of a
helpless police officer acting in the execution of his duties.
Further, on any version of events, both appellants were
implicated in the attack and one or both had committed murder.
Any jury, no matter where the venue, would hear that Suzack was a
parole violator and that both appellants were involved in
criminal activity.  Wherever the trial was to take place, the
jury selected would have their ability to act impartially and
dispassionately severely tested by the evidence they would hear.
[38] Where the real potential for prejudice lies in the evidence
which the jury eventually selected to try the case will hear, a
change of venue does not assist in protecting an accused&#146;s right
to a fair trial.  The many safeguards built into the trial
process itself must provide that protection.  Trainor J. properly
considered the real source of the potential prejudice to the
appellants&#146; fair trial interests in considering whether a change
of venue would serve the ends of justice.
[39] The appellants also submit that Trainor J. failed to give
sufficient weight or gave too much weight to other relevant
factors in deciding that a change of venue should not be granted.
It is difficult to marry the concept of an error in principle
based on a failure to give appropriate weight to relevant factors
with the concept of deference to the decision of the trial judge.
It seems to me that the weight to be assigned to particular
factors is the essence of the exercise of the discretion vested
in the trial judge.  In any event, the argument as framed in this
case amounts to an attempt to re-argue the change of venue
application in the hope that this court would exercise its
discretion differently than did Trainor J.  I see no error in
principle in the weight assigned by Trainor J. to the various
relevant factors and I would not take up the appellants&#146;
invitation to engage in a de novo assessment of the evidence led
on the application.
[40] The appellants&#146; submission that the Charter right to a fair
trial requires a reformulation of the principles governing change
of venue applications starts with the non-contentious assertion
that legislation conferring a discretion may not be interpreted
so as to permit the exercise of that discretion in a manner which
infringes Charter rights.  Counsel then moved directly to s. 1 of
the Charter and submitted that the present approach on change of
venue applications fails to meet the minimum impairment component
of the proportionality test in s. 1 of the Charter.  As I
understand the argument, counsel contend that by placing the onus
on an accused to justify a change of venue, s. 599(1) does not
minimally impair the appellant&#146;s right to a fair trial.
[41] This argument misconceives the role of s. 1 of the Charter.
The minimal impairment analysis can only become relevant when the
court finds that there has been a violation of a Charter right.
The appellants&#146; argument treats s. 1 of the Charter as a free-
standing constitutional right.
[42] There can be no doubt that s. 599(1) must operate in a
manner that is consistent with Charter rights and in particular,
the right to a fair trial.  I regard s. 599(1) as one of many
mechanisms designed to protect an accused&#146;s right to a fair
trial.  If a judge is satisfied, having regard to the various
mechanisms available to protect an accused&#146;s right to a fair
trial, that an accused cannot receive a fair trial in the
assigned venue, then the interests of justice would clearly
require a change of venue under s. 599(1)(a).
[43] There is nothing inconsistent with an accused&#146;s right to a
fair trial and the placing of the onus on an accused to
demonstrate that a change of venue is &#147;expedient to the ends of
justice.&#148;  Placing the onus on the accused, if he is the
applicant on the change of venue motion, is nothing more than an
application of the traditional and well-established rules of the
adversarial process.  A party who seeks a remedy bears the onus
of showing the need for that remedy.  The Charter itself reflects
this traditional approach in that it is the party alleging a
breach of his or her Charter rights who bears the onus of
establishing a breach and the onus of establishing the
appropriate remedy under s. 24 of the Charter.
[44] Nor in my view does the right to a fair trial require a
change of venue wherever pre-trial publicity poses a risk to that
right.  The risk will exist to some extent in virtually every
case where there has been pre-trial publicity.  The right to a
fair trial is compromised where despite the available safeguards
there is a reasonable likelihood that an accused cannot receive a
fair trial in the local venue.
[45] The minimal impairment argument adds nothing to the
appellants&#146; submission that Trainor J. erred in refusing the
change of venue application.  If his refusal compromised the
appellants&#146; fair trial rights, then the exercise of that
discretion was clearly improper under the terms of s. 599(1) and
constituted a violation of the appellants&#146; right to a fair trial
under s. 11(d) of the Charter.  The Crown has not suggested that
s. 1 could somehow justify such a violation.  As indicated above,
however, I am satisfied that Trainor J. did not err in the
exercise of his discretion and that there was no infringement of
the appellants&#146; right to a fair trial.
[46] The application for a change of venue raised difficult
problems.  Trainor J. gave them careful consideration.  I think
he was in a much better position to make the subtle assessment
required by the change of venue motion than is this court.  I
would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Is s. 635(2) unconstitutional?</pre>
    <pre>[47] Following the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R.
v. Bain (1992), 69 C.C.C. (3d) 481 in which the section of the
Criminal Code granting the Crown 48 stand asides was held
unconstitutional, Parliament revamped the sections of the
Criminal Code setting out the procedures to be followed during
jury selection.  Its purpose in doing so was in part to eliminate
imbalances which existed between the rights accorded to the
accused and those provided to the Crown in the jury selection
process.</pre>
    <pre>[48] Section 635 of the Criminal Code was amended to read:
          </pre>
    <pre>               635.(1)The accused shall be called on
	  before the prosecutor is called on to declare
	  whether the accused challenges the first juror,
	  for cause or peremptorily, and thereafter the
	  prosecutor and the accused shall be called on
	  alternately, in respect of each of the remaining
	  jurors, to first make such a declaration.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  Subsection (1) applies where two or
          more accused are to be tried together, but
          all of the accused shall exercise the
          challenges of the defence in turn, in the
          order in which their names appear in the
          indictment or in any other order agreed on by
          them,
          </pre>
    <pre>               (a)  in respect of the first juror,
          before the prosecutor; and
          </pre>
    <pre>               (b)  in respect of each of the remaining
          jurors, either before or after the
          prosecutor, in accordance with subsection
          (1). [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[49] Under s. 635(1), the accused and Crown must alternate the
order in which they challenge prospective jurors.  The accused
must challenge the first juror before the Crown and the Crown
must challenge the second prospective juror before the accused.
[50] As there were two accused in this case, s. 635(2) applied.
Suzack appeared first on the indictment and, because counsel
could not agree on the order of challenges, he was required to
challenge prospective jurors before Pennett.  Consequently,
jurors were challenged in the following order:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>    juror number 1 &#150; Suzack &#150; Pennett &#150; Crown</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>    juror number 2 &#150; Crown &#150; Suzack &#150; Pennett</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>    juror number 3 : as per juror number 1</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>    juror number 4:  as per juror number 2, etc.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[51] Section 635 applies to both challenges for cause and
peremptory challenges.  Counsel at trial agreed that all
prospective jurors would be jointly challenged for cause by the
Crown and both appellants.  The dispute arose over the order in
which the appellants would be required to exercise their
peremptory challenges.  Each appellant had 20 peremptory
challenges and the Crown had 40 peremptory challenges (see s.
634(4)).
[52] Suzack submits that s. 635(2) arbitrarily gave Pennett a
tactical advantage over him by requiring Suzack to exercise his
peremptory challenges before Pennett in respect of all potential
jurors.  Suzack argues that his counsel wasted peremptory
challenges by challenging prospective jurors who would have been
challenged by Pennett had Pennett been required to challenge some
of the prospective jurors before Suzack.  He also contends that
the tactical advantage was significant because he and Pennett
were advancing antagonistic defences.  He assumes that since he
and Pennett had antagonistic defences, they had different
preferences with respect to potential jurors.
[53] It is contended that the process created by s. 635(2)
creates a reasonable perception of unfairness and therefore
violates ss. 11(d) and 7 of the Charter.  It is Suzack&#146;s position
that the trial judge should have struck down the section and
devised a procedure giving Suzack and Pennett an equal
opportunity to exercise their peremptory challenges last.
[54] An accused&#146;s right to a fair trial is protected by s. 7 and
s. 11(d) of the Charter. That broad right encompasses a number of
discrete rights, including the right to trial by an impartial
jury, the right to know the case for the Crown before being
called upon to answer that case and the right to make full answer
and defence.  I think it is the right to trial by an impartial
jury which is potentially implicated by the selection procedure
set out in s. 635(2).  If the appearance of the impartiality of
the jury is not affected by that process, I see no basis upon
which it can be argued that any of the other component parts of
the right to a fair trial are adversely affected by that section.
[55] In R. v. Bain, supra, the majority of the court declared the
former s. 634(2) unconstitutional.  That section gave the Crown
48 stand asides.  The majority equated stand asides with
peremptory challenges and held that combined with the 4
peremptory challenges given to the Crown, the 48 stand asides
gave the Crown 52 peremptory challenges while the accused had
only 12.</pre>
    <pre>[56] Cory J. for three of the four person majority said, at p.
511:
          </pre>
    <pre>    Apart from challenges for cause the provisions of the
    Criminal Code provide the Crown with the ability to stand by 48
    prospective jurors and to peremptorily challenge 4 jurors.  The
    accused in this case has but 12 peremptory challenges.  I do not
    suggest that the ideal of absolute equality is required by the
    Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  However, a discrepancy
    of 4.25 to 1 in favour of the Crown seems to be so unbalanced
    that it gives an appearance of unfairness or bias against the
    accused.  The impugned provisions permit the Crown to obtain a
    jury that would at the very least appear to be favourable to its
    position rather than an unbiased jury.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[57] Cory J. emphasized the appearance of impartiality created by
the significant imbalance in the respective roles of the Crown
and accused in the selection of the jury at p.512:
          </pre>
    <pre>    It may well be correct that it would be impossible to prove
    that a jury selected after the Crown had exercised all its stand-
    bys and peremptory challenges was in fact biased.  None the less
    the overwhelming numerical superiority of choice granted to the
    Crown creates a pervasive air of unfairness in the jury selection
    procedure.  The jury is the ultimate decision maker.  The fate of
    the accused is in its hands.  The jury should not as a result of
    the manner of its selection appear to favour the Crown over the
    accused.  Fairness should be guiding principles of justice and
    the hallmark of criminal trials.  Yet so long as the impugned
    provision of the Code remains, providing the Crown with the
    ability to select a jury that appears to be favourable to it, the
    whole trial process will be tainted with the appearance of
    obvious and overwhelming unfairness.  Members of the community
    will be left in doubt as to the merits of a process which permits
    the Crown to have more than four times as many choices as the
    accused in the selection of the jury.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[58] Stevenson J., who concurred in the result with Cory J., took
much the same approach.  After observing at p. 530 that:
          </pre>
    <pre>    The peremptory challenge is not, itself, under attack.  It
    may be used under partisan considerations, and so long as the
    right of exercise is proportionate neither the Crown nor the
    accused can be said to have an unconstitutional advantage.</pre>
    <pre>[59] He went on to hold that the disproportionate number of stand
asides and peremptory challenges gave the Crown a substantial
advantage in the shaping and fashioning of the constitution of
the jury.  That advantage produced a reasonable apprehension that
juries generated by that process would not be impartial.
[60] The effect of s. 635(2) is very different than that of the
former s. 634(2).  The present section does not give the Crown a
predominant role in the selection of the jury and does not give
the Crown any advantage over the accused in the selection of the
jury.  Nor does s. 635(2) give any party to the proceedings a
numerical advantage in the selection of the jury.  All
participants have an equal voice.  An accused who is tried with
another accused has the same number of challenges as he or she
would have if tried alone.
[61] The appellant cannot claim any unfairness as between himself
and the Crown, but only that s. 635(2) gave his co-accused a
tactical advantage over him.  I accept that a tactical advantage
may reach constitutional proportions.  I also accept that a law
which gives one accused an advantage over a co-accused could
infringe the constitutional rights of the disadvantaged co-
accused, although I would think that laws which favour one
accused over another are constitutionally less suspect than a law
which favours the Crown over the accused.
[62] Tactical disadvantages cannot, however, be equated with
unfairness in the constitutional sense.  Tactical advantages and
disadvantages are inherent in the adversarial process.  They come
and go with the ebb and flow of the process.  Where there is more
than one accused on trial, the question of which accused will go
first, last or somewhere in between will arise repeatedly in the
course of the trial (e.g. who will cross-examine Crown witnesses
first, who will call a defence first, who will go to the jury
first).  I do not understand the Charter to demand exact parity
at each and every procedural step of the criminal trial process.
Indeed, in R. v. Bain, supra, at p. 511, Cory J. acknowledged
that the Charter did not even require parity as between an
accused and the Crown in the selection of the jury.
[63] A tactical disadvantage in the selection of the jury becomes
a constitutional infringement if, when viewed in the context of
the entire process, it skews the fairness or the appearance of
the fairness of the proceeding so that a reasonable, well-
informed person would conclude that the process was so lacking in
balance as to be fundamentally unfair:  R. v. Bain, supra, at p.
511.  The test is not &#150; can one fashion a fairer process, but
rather is the process put in place by Parliament so lacking in
balance as to amount to a departure from the standard of
fundamental fairness to the accused?  It is important in
addressing this question to place the alleged disadvantage in the
context of the entire trial process.  The Charter is not a
criminal procedure statute and should not be used to micro manage
each and every facet of the process.  The Charter&#146;s approach is
broader and looks to the fundamental fairness of the process as a
whole.
[64] The tactical disadvantage asserted by Suzack cannot be
measured.  It is impossible to say how often an accused who is
required to challenge first will waste a peremptory challenge on
a juror who would have been challenged peremptorily by his co-
accused.  It is equally impossible to say how often the accused
who has wasted a peremptory challenge will run out of challenges
before the jury is selected.  The impossibility of making any
kind of informed assessment of the significance of this
disadvantage flows in large measure from the nature of peremptory
challenges.  They are exercised for a myriad of reasons, many of
which reflect only the subjective preferences of counsel
exercising the challenge.  There is no way of predicting how
counsel will exercise their peremptory challenges and, therefore,
no way of knowing the extent to which counsel for the co-accused
who must exercise his challenge first is put at a disadvantage.
Nor do I think that the fact that the accused have antagonistic
defences sheds any light on the extent of the disadvantage
suffered by the co-accused who must challenge first.  Accused may
have antagonistic defences and yet counsel may have exactly the
same view of those whom they do not want on the jury.  Counsel
for Suzack did not suggest how the profile of a juror deemed
suitable by Suzack might differ from that sought by Pennett.
[65] It is also clear that an accused who is required to exercise
his peremptory challenges ahead of a co-accused will, in some
cases, benefit in the selection of the jury from the presence of
the co-accused and the added 20 peremptory challenges.  There
will be cases where an accused who exercises his challenges first
runs out of challenges, but the co-accused still has challenges
and uses them to challenge jurors who would have been challenged
by the accused had he not run out of peremptory challenges.  In
such cases, while the accused suffers the disadvantage of
challenging before the co-accused, he enjoys the advantage of
having prospective jurors eliminated who would not have been
eliminated had the accused been tried alone.
[66] I also agree with the Crown&#146;s submission that there can be
disadvantages to exercising one&#146;s peremptory challenges last.
Some counsel will not want to be put in the position of rejecting
prospective jurors whom all other parties have declared to be
acceptable, particularly when the jury is partly picked and the
process has gone on for some time.
[67] The most that can be said about s. 635(2) is that it
potentially puts some accused who must challenge first at some
tactical disadvantage in some cases.  Considered in the context
of the entire process, I do not regard the potential disadvantage
as significant.
[68] The decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Rose
(1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 449 is instructive.  The majority drew a
distinction between procedures which were less advantageous to
the defence than other possible procedures and procedures which
were unfair for constitutional purposes.  In considering whether
s. 651(3), which required an accused to address the jury first
where the accused called a defence, rendered the trial unfair and
thereby infringed s. 11(d), Cory J., for the majority, said at p.
491:
          </pre>
    <pre>    In order for the appellant to demonstrate that s. 651(3) of
    the Code infringes his right to make full answer and defence, he
    must show that the inability to address the jury after the Crown
    has done so unfairly interferes with his ability to defend
    himself and to answer the Crown&#146;s case.  The essential question
    is whether the order of jury addresses set out in the impugned
    legislative provision creates an unfairness.  Unfairness would
    exist, for example, if addressing the jury last provided an
    advantage to the Crown which was therefore denied to the defence,
    or if addressing the jury first interfered with the accused&#146;s
    right not to incriminate himself.  Although there may be better
    ways that Parliament could structure the determination of the
    order of jury addresses, the question of whether or not the
    appellant&#146;s Charter rights have been infringed is concerned only
    with whether the existing provisions are unfair.  [Emphasis
    added.]</pre>
    <pre>[69] After a careful analysis, Cory J. concluded that there was
no significant advantage in addressing the jury first or last.
Consequently, he concluded that the order of addresses, depending
on whether a defence was called, did not infringe s. 11(d).  He
concluded at pp. 498-99:
          </pre>
    <pre>    &#133; Granting the accused an option as to whether to address
    the jury first or last would presumably be welcomed by defence
    counsel, who may feel that it assists differently in different
    cases to address the jury last rather than first, or the
    opposite.  However, as was stated earlier, granting the accused
    an additional advantage in this way does not equate to remedying
    an unfairness in the legislation.  The existing provisions
    regarding the order of jury addresses are fair;  they may just
    not be the most desirable.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[70] It cannot be argued that the ordering of peremptory
challenges as between co-accused has a potentially more
significant impact on the fairness of the process than does the
ordering of closing addresses as between the accused and the
Crown.  The former is much less significant than the latter.  The
above-quoted words of Cory J. are applicable to s. 635(2).  The
procedure set out in s. 635(2) for the ordering of peremptory
challenges as between co-accused does not violate s. 11(d) of the
Charter even if some other procedure might be regarded as more
desirable.1
[71] I would hold that s. 635(2) is constitutional.</pre>
    <pre>The Severance Applications
     </pre>
    <pre>     (i)  The Proceedings at Trial:</pre>
    <pre>[72] The appellants advanced what are referred to as &#147;cut throat&#148;
defences.  Each claimed that the other murdered Constable
MacDonald.  It was known to counsel prior to trial that the
defences would be antagonistic and that counsel for Pennett would
seek to elicit evidence of Suzack&#146;s bad character and his
propensity for violence especially when he had been drinking.
[73] The first attempt by Pennett to introduce evidence of
Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence came during the case for the
Crown.  The Crown wanted to call evidence that Suzack had met a
person named Vince Hurd in a tavern about five hours before the
murder.  They discussed a possible drug deal.  A quarrel
developed and Suzack threatened Hurd.  Hurd put a knife to
Suzack&#146;s throat.  Later, outside the tavern, Suzack threatened
Hurd with a nine millimeter handgun (the murder weapon) that he
had retrieved from the front seat of his car.  The trial judge
ruled that the Crown could lead some of the evidence proffered by
Hurd but it could not lead evidence of the threats and, in
particular, could not lead evidence of the threat made by Suzack
with the murder weapon.  Counsel for Pennett then indicated that
he intended to elicit that evidence on cross-examination of Hurd
to demonstrate Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence.  Counsel for
Suzack argued that neither the Crown nor Pennett should be
allowed to introduce any of the evidence.
[74] Trainor J. ruled that Pennett could adduce the evidence
which he had ruled the Crown could not lead.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>    &#133; However, the pointing of the nine mm. gun in the face of
    another human being, just hours before the same gun murdered
    Constable MacDonald, is relevant and sufficiently probative of
    the issues raised by the hostile defences to be admitted.  It is
    for the jury to say what weight should be given to the evidence
    in light of the fact that Mr. Suzack appears to have been easily
    persuaded to abandon his threat and in light of the evidence of
    the conduct of Mr. Hurd in placing a knife at the throat of the
    accused Suzack.  I will therefore, allow the cross-examination to
    the extent that I have indicated.</pre>
    <pre>[75] There was no application for severance after the trial
judge&#146;s ruling and counsel for Pennett adduced the evidence of
Suzack&#146;s threatening Hurd with the murder weapon.  The failure to
move for severance at this point is best explained by counsel for
Suzack&#146;s estimation of the probative value of the Hurd evidence.
In his later submissions, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>    The earlier evidence from Vince Hurd in my submission, told
    us nothing.  And as I said that it was inadmissible because it
    was provoked behaviour that did not include violence.</pre>
    <pre>[76] The Crown completed its case about two weeks after the Hurd
evidence was admitted.  There was no application for severance at
the end of the Crown&#146;s case.  Suzack testified in his own
defence.  During his examination-in-chief, he testified as to his
extensive criminal record.  He also acknowledged that he was a
long-time drug dealer and was proficient in the use of weapons,
including handguns.  He admitted that the murder weapon was his
and that he had it with him on the night of the murder.  He also
admitted that he repeatedly struck Constable MacDonald with his
fist and with the murder weapon.  Finally, he acknowledged that
he was on parole at the time of the murder and was in breach of
the terms of his parole.
[77] Counsel for Pennett began his cross-examination of Suzack
with a detailed review of his criminal record.  He questioned
Suzack extensively about the circumstances surrounding many of
the convictions, especially those involving assaults.  He also
cross-examined Suzack about the confrontation with Hurd.  Court
was adjourned for the day in the middle of this cross-
examination.  The next morning, counsel for Suzack made its first
application for severance.  He contended that the cross-
examination, while admissible from Pennett&#146;s perspective to show
Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence, so prejudiced Suzack&#146;s defence
as to require a severance.  The Crown and Pennett opposed the
motion.  The trial judge refused to sever the trials.
[78] Counsel for Pennett continued his cross-examination of
Suzack.  He suggested to Suzack that he had told a friend, Paul
Gibbs, a few days before the murder, that he was not going back
to jail and that if confronted by the police, he would &#147;shoot it
out.&#148;  Suzack denied making these statements.  Counsel also
suggested to Suzack that after the shooting, he had spoken to Mr.
Gibbs on the phone and told him that he shot MacDonald in self-
defence.  Suzack denied the conversation.  Counsel also suggested
to Suzack that in a subsequent conversation he told Mr. Gibbs
that Pennett was not &#147;willing to work with me&#148; on the defence.
Again,  Suzack denied this suggestion.  The trial judge cautioned
the jury that suggestions from counsel were not evidence.
[79] Counsel for Pennett suggested to Suzack that he had changed
his story from self-defence when he became aware of evidence
which could suggest that Pennett had fired the fatal shots.
Suzack indicated that his story had been &#147;consistent from the
start.&#148;  Counsel then said &#147;you&#146;ve never told anyone this story
&#145;til you got on the stand.&#148;  Suzack replied that he had told his
lawyers.
[80] At the conclusion of counsel&#146;s cross-examination, counsel
for Suzack made a second application for severance.  In addition
to the prejudicial effect of the propensity evidence adduced
during the cross-examination of Suzack, counsel relied on two
additional factors.  First, he argued that the suggestion that
Suzack had confessed to Mr. Gibbs prejudiced Suzack.  In making
this submission, counsel indicated that he assumed that Mr. Gibbs
would give evidence in support of the suggestions counsel had
advanced.2  Counsel for Suzack also argued that the suggestion
that Suzack had not told his story to anyone before he testified
could prejudice Suzack in that it might lead the jury to use
Suzack&#146;s exercise of his right to silence against him.
[81] Counsel for Pennett and the Crown opposed the motion and the
trial judge dismissed it.
[82] Suzack&#146;s third motion for severance came after counsel for
Pennett&#146;s opening statement to the jury at the commencement of
Pennett&#146;s defence.  Counsel told the jury that it was Pennett&#146;s
position that Suzack had killed Constable MacDonald.  Counsel
referred to Suzack as a &#147;coward&#148; and a &#147;psychopath.&#148;  Counsel for
Suzack claimed that the inflammatory nature of the opening had so
tainted the jury as to render it unable to return a true verdict
against Suzack.  Counsel for Pennett and the Crown opposed the
motion.  The trial judge refused to sever the trial.
[83] The fourth and final motion for severance came after counsel
for Pennett&#146;s closing address.  Suzack&#146;s counsel observed that
counsel for Pennett had made extensive reference to the evidence
which he suggested demonstrated Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence,
particularly when he had been drinking.  Counsel claimed that
Pennett&#146;s counsel had tried to focus the trial on Suzack&#146;s
character rather than on the events which had occurred
immediately before the shooting.  He referred to counsel&#146;s
description of Suzack as &#147;a time bomb&#148; and &#147;crazy and evil.&#148;  It
was counsel&#146;s submission that the stress laid on Suzack&#146;s
propensity for violence and the pejorative language used to
described Suzack made it impossible for Suzack to receive a fair
trial.  He also referred to one passage from the Crown&#146;s closing
address which counsel suggested amounted to an adoption by the
Crown of some of counsel for Pennett&#146;s comments about Suzack&#146;s
character.
[84] The trial judge dismissed this motion without calling on
counsel for the Crown or Pennett.</pre>
    <pre>     (ii) Should Trainor J. have ordered severance?</pre>
    <pre>[85] Motions for severance are governed by s. 591(3) of the
Criminal Code.  That section provides that a judge may direct
severance where &#147;the interests of justice so require.&#148;  Like the
change of venue provision, this section vests a broad discretion
in the trial judge.  That discretion must be exercised bearing in
mind the competing interests of the public and the accused.  In
this case, Trainor J. had to consider the competing interests of
Suzack, Pennett and the Crown.  Suzack wanted severance, the
other two did not.
[86] Appellate review of the exercise of the discretion to grant
or refuse severance must afford the same level of deference to
the trial judge as that accorded to other discretionary decisions
made by the trial judge:  see R. v. Litchfield (1993), 86 C.C.C.
(3d) 97 at 113-14 (S.C.C.).
[87] In reviewing Trainor J.&#146;s refusal to order severance, I
begin with the proposition that persons accused of the joint
commission of a crime should be tried together.  That presumption
applies with particular force where the co-accused are each
alleging that the other is the guilty party:  R. v. Crawford
(1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 497 (S.C.C.)
[88] Separate trials where co-accused are blaming each other for
the crime raise not only the danger of inconsistent verdicts, but
also a real concern that the truth will not be discovered at
either trial.  It is axiomatic that the truth of an allegation is
best tested through a process which requires the accuser to
confront the accused with the allegation and gives the accused a
chance to respond to the allegation.  If co-accused who are
blaming each other for a crime are allowed to do so in separate
trials, neither jury will have the benefit of that process.  If
the accused are tried separately, it is highly unlikely that
either jury will hear the complete story.  As Professor Elliot
said in &#147;Cut Throat Tactics:  the freedom of an accused to
prejudice a co-accused&#148;, [1991] Crim. L.R., 5 at 17:
          </pre>
    <pre>    &#133; it is undeniable that the full truth about an incident is
    much more likely to emerge if every alleged participant gives his
    account on one occasion.  If each alleged participant is tried
    separately, there are obvious and severe difficulties in
    arranging for this to happen without granting one of them
    immunity.  In view of this, on all but exceptional cases, joint
    trial will be resorted to, despite the double bind inevitably
    involved&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[89] In his reasons for refusing severance, delivered after the
trial, Trainor J. recognized both the presumption in favour of
joint trials in cases of alleged joint participation in crimes
and the risk that the truth could be a casualty of any severance
order:
          </pre>
    <pre>    Secondly, this killing appeared to me to be the result of a
    joint venture, where the two accused, who were long time friends,
    either acted in concert and assisted one another as principals or
    one was the shooter (that caused death) and the other aided for
    the purpose of the killing.  There were only three people on the
    lawn at 1124 Gordon Street that night.  They were Constable
    MacDonald, Clinton Suzack and Peter Pennett.  The fact that the
    shooter (the one that fired the fatal shots) was guilty of first
    degree murder was not an issue. The defence position was that the
    shooting was an isolated and totally unexpected act of violence.
    They told the jury that determination of the shooter was the
    vital issue to be decided.  Each accused said the other was the
    killer.  Counsel for each accused did his best to create a
    reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.
          </pre>
    <pre>               The jury heard and judged the evidence
          of each accused.  In separate trials the jury
          will not likely have this important evidence.
          That alone, in a case involving common
          participation and aiding, cannot be conducive
          to a just verdict.</pre>
    <pre>[90] The presumption in favour of a joint trial of accused
alleged to have jointly committed an offence had strong
application by the time Trainer J. was asked to order separate
trials.  Suzack, through his own testimony, admitted that he and
Pennett were involved in a joint criminal enterprise.  According
to him its purpose was to disable but not kill Constable
MacDonald.  The prosecution had led a formidable case in support
of its position that Pennett and Suzack were jointly responsible
for the murder of Constable MacDonald.  Trainor J. had much more
than an allegation of joint criminal conduct when he was asked to
order severance.  The evidence had overwhelmingly established
that Suzack and Pennett were engaged in a joint criminal
enterprise.  On Suzack&#146;s evidence only the scope of that joint
enterprise was in dispute.  Was it a common design to murder or
to disable?  It was only when Pennett testified that a version of
events not involving a joint criminal enterprise emerged.
[91] Counsel for Suzack&#146;s task in advancing this ground of appeal
is a difficult one.  He is faced with what I would describe, for
the reasons set out above, as a strong presumption in favour of a
joint trial.  He must also contend with the limited nature of
review of the trial judge&#146;s decision available on appeal.
Counsel attempts to overcome these hurdles by reliance on the
language of Sopinka J. in R. v. Crawford, supra, at 497-98:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; The general rule, therefore, is that the respective rights
   of the co-accused must be resolved on the basis that the trial
   will be a joint trial.  This does not mean, however, that the
   trial judge has been stripped of his discretion to sever.  That
   discretion remains, and can be exercised if it appears that the
   attempt to reconcile the respect rights of the co-accused results
   in an injustice to one of the accused.   [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[92] Counsel submits that the injustice to Suzack resulted from
the evidence of his bad character and propensity for violence
adduced by Pennett.  He concedes that the evidence was admissible
on behalf of Pennett to support his position that Suzack was the
shooter.  Counsel contends, however, that the probative value of
the evidence in aid of Pennett&#146;s defence was at least equaled by
the prejudicial effect it had on Suzack&#146;s defence.  He argues
that the prejudice to Suzack increased as the trial progressed.
What began as relatively unimportant evidence adduced during the
cross-examination of Hurd became a dominant theme of the trial by
the time Pennett&#146;s defence was complete.  In support of this
submission, counsel for Suzack points out that most of counsel
for Pennett&#146;s closing address was directed at Suzack&#146;s propensity
for violence.  It is counsel&#146;s position that no instruction
Trainor J. could have given to the jury could have adequately
protected Suzack against the misuse of the propensity evidence by
the jury when determining Suzack&#146;s culpability.  As Pennett was
entitled to elicit the evidence, counsel argues that severance
was the only way that each accused could be treated fairly.
[93] This submission turns on the contention that no instruction
could adequately protect Suzack against misuse of the propensity
evidence.  The other bases for severance advanced at trial are
not put forward as separate grounds for severance on appeal,
although counsel does argue that the inflammatory opening and
closing by Pennett&#146;s lawyer exacerbated the prejudice caused to
Suzack by the admission of the propensity evidence.
[94] The jury heard a good deal of evidence which cast Suzack in
a bad light.  However, much of that evidence would have been
properly before the jury had Suzack been tried alone.3  His very
extensive criminal record, his activities as a large-scale drug
dealer, his familiarity with and use of weapons, his status as a
parole violator, and the outstanding warrant for his arrest were
all before the jury by the time Suzack completed his evidence in-
chief and before he saw the need to apply for severance.  While
Mr. Hurd&#146;s testimony involving Suzack&#146;s threatened conduct
towards him about five hours before the murder would not have
been before the jury but for Pennett&#146;s participation in the
trial, I share Suzack&#146;s trial counsel&#146;s view that that evidence
was not particularly significant (see, supra, para. 74).  Any
significance it had was further diminished by Suzack&#146;s admission
that he used that very same weapon to do much more than threaten
Constable MacDonald immediately prior to his murder.  Suzack
admitted that he used the weapon in an effort to beat Constable
MacDonald into a state of unconsciousness.
[95] The extensive reference to the facts underlying Suzack&#146;s
numerous convictions would not have been admissible but for
Pennett&#146;s participation in the trial.  In my mind, that is the
only significantly prejudicial evidence that was before this jury
on the joint trial and would not have been before a jury had
Suzack been tried alone.  The admission of that evidence alone
does not overcome the competing interests which favoured a joint
trial.
[96] Suzack&#146;s argument does not, however, turn on the mere
admissibility of this prejudicial evidence, but rather on the use
that the jury were invited to make of that evidence.  Had Suzack
been tried alone, the Crown could not have suggested to the jury
that the evidence demonstrated Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence
and that propensity could be used in determining his involvement
in the murder of Constable MacDonald.  Indeed, the trial judge
would have had to make it clear to the jury that they could not
use the evidence for that purpose.  On a joint trial, Pennett
could, however, advance the propensity argument.  He did so
repeatedly and forcefully.
[97] Trainor J. had to decide whether he could reconcile the
competing rights of Suzack and Pennett and provide a fair trial
for both.  His ability to do so turned on whether the jury could
be instructed in such a way as to permit the use of the
propensity evidence as part of Pennett&#146;s defence while at the
same time preventing the misuse of the evidence as part of the
Crown&#146;s case against Suzack.  Fashioning the required instruction
was not an easy task and properly applying it was even more
challenging.
[98] Suzack relied on the judgment of Glithero J. in R. v.
Moscato and Thurston, [1995] O.J. No. 3712 (Gen. Div.) where, in
very similar circumstances, he ordered severance after concluding
that the jury could not be instructed on the proposed propensity
evidence in a manner which was fair to both accused.  I take no
issue with the manner in which Glithero J. exercised his
discretion in that case.  It is not, however, the law that
whenever a trial judge is faced with propensity evidence led by
one accused against another that he must order severance:  R. v.
Kendall and McKay (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 105 at 127-28 (Ont.
C.A.);  R. v. Tom, [1997] O.J. No. 2807 (C.A.).  Trial judges
must make individual evaluations of the efficacy of limiting
instructions in the particular circumstances of each case.
[99] In deciding that the difficulties inherent in properly
instructing the jury on the use of the evidence of Suzack&#146;s
propensity for violence did not warrant separate trials, Trainor
J. placed reliance on the jury&#146;s ability to follow and apply
difficult instructions.  In doing so, he echoed the strong words
of Chief Justice Dickson in R. v. Corbett (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d)
385 at 400-401 (S.C.C.):
          </pre>
    <pre>               In my view, it would be quite wrong to 
	  make too much of the risk that the jury might
	  use the evidence for an improper purpose.  This 
	  line of thinking could seriously undermine the
          entire jury system.  The very strength of the
	  jury is that the ultimate issue of guilt or
	  innocence is determined by a group of ordinary
	  citizens who are not legal specialists and who
	  bring to the legal process a healthy measure of
	  common sense.  The jury is, of course, bound to
	  follow the law as it is explained by the
          trial judge.  Jury directions are often long and
	  difficult, but the experience of trial judges is
	  that juries do perform their duty according to the
	  law. &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133; Juries are capable of egregious
          mistakes and they may at times seem to be ill-
          adapted to the exigencies of an increasingly
          complicated and refined criminal law.  But
          until the paradigm is altered by Parliament,
          the court should not be heard to call into
          question the capacity of juries to do the job
          assigned to them.  The ramifications of any
          such statement could be enormous.  Moreover,
          the fundamental right to a jury trial has
          recently been underscored by s. 11(f) of the
          Charter.  If that right is so important,  it
          is logically incoherent to hold that juries
          are incapable of following the explicit
          instructions of a judge. &#133;  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[100]     The Chief Justice made these comments in support of his
conclusion that the Crown could cross-examine an accused charged
with murder on a prior murder conviction because the jury could
properly follow a direction that evidence of the prior murder
conviction was relevant only to the credibility of the accused.
[101]     Trainor J. also considered the likelihood that the jury
would misuse the evidence of the prior misconduct by Suzack when
considering the case against him.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; The violence on the lawn on Gordon Street, some of which
   was admitted by Suzack and was otherwise proved by many
   witnesses, where a police officer was ambushed by one or the
   other of the accused and more likely by both, his leg fractured
   in two places at the outset, then, while unable to get up, he is
   punched by both accused, then pistol whipped by Suzack, while
   Pennett was holding him and trying to get his gun, then executed
   after emptying his pistol, is so extreme that it renders prior
   acts of violence by Suzack, disclosed in his record and cross-
   examination, of little consequence to a trier of fact.
   [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[102]     Trainor J.&#146;s assessment of the jury&#146;s ability to apply
difficult instructions and his assessment of the potential for
misuse of the propensity evidence by the jury were relevant
considerations in determining whether to grant severance.  I can
detect no error in either assessment.
[103]     In addition to arguing that no instruction could
protect Suzack from the misuse of the powerful propensity
argument advanced by Pennett, counsel for Suzack made two
additional submissions.  As indicated above, the trial judge gave
his reasons for refusing severance after the trial was completed.
Counsel does not suggest that there was anything improper with
the trial judge waiting until the end of the trial to give
detailed reasons for refusing severance.  He submits, however,
that the reasons reveal ex post facto reasoning based on the
verdicts of the jury.  I read Trainor J.&#146;s reference to the
verdicts of the jury in his reasons as no more than an indication
that in his mind those verdicts confirmed the correctness of his
decision to refuse severance and, specifically, his assessment
that propensity evidence would not sway the jury.  I do not think
that he used the verdicts to justify his decision, or that his
reasons suggest that he presumed the guilt of either Suzack or
Pennett when deciding whether to order severance.
[104]     Counsel also argued that the trial judge improperly
used the timing of the motion for severance as a factor
militating against severance.  As indicated above, Suzack first
moved for severance during his cross-examination.  Suzack knew
the nature of Pennett&#146;s defence before the trial started and he
knew that when he testified, he would expose himself to cross-
examination by counsel for Pennett on his character and on the
circumstances surrounding his many previous convictions for acts
of violence.  Despite this, he elected to enter upon his defence
in the course of the joint trial without bringing any motion for
severance.
[105]     The point in a trial at which a severance application
is made is relevant to the determination of the &#147;interests of
justice&#148;:  R. v. M.(B.) (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 1 at 9 (C.A.);  R.
v. C.(D.A.) (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 28 (B.C.C.A.), aff&#146;d, [1997]
1 S.C.R. 8.  As Proulx J.A. said in R. v. Cross (1996), 112
C.C.C. (3d) 410 at 420 (Que. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.
refused (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) vi:
          </pre>
    <pre>   However, the time at which such motion is brought is likely
   to have an influence on the judge&#146;s decision whether or not to
   order separate trials.  The considerations concerned with the
   proper administration of justice are more important at this
   stage.  This is all the more true where the trial is a jury
   trial. &#133; The trial judge has the duty to take into account the
   practical consequences which an order for separate trials may
   have.  He must also assess the potential prejudice which the co-
   accused will suffer should he grant the motion.</pre>
    <pre>[106]     Trainor J. had to consider the &#147;practical consequences&#148;
of ordering severance several weeks into a complicated and highly
publicized trial.  Dozens of witnesses had already testified and
a great deal of time and money had been spent bringing the trial
to the point it was at when the first severance motion was
brought.  The effective use of limited judicial resources and
some consideration of those who must undergo the ordeal of
testifying merit some weight when determining the dictates of
&#147;the interests of justice&#148; as required by s. 591(3).
[107]     Trainor J. also alluded to another practical problem
that would arise if he ordered severance part way through
Suzack&#146;s cross-examination.  If Trainor J. ordered severance,
Suzack&#146;s trial could not continue since the jury had heard the
potentially prejudicial evidence.  If Pennett&#146;s trial continued
before that jury, as he wanted it to, the status of the evidence
given by Suzack to that stage of the joint trial would have to be
resolved.  He had taken the stand in his own defence.  If
severance was ordered and Pennett&#146;s trial continued, would
Suzack&#146;s evidence be part of Pennett&#146;s trial?  Would Suzack be
required to resume the stand and subject himself to further cross-
examination?  Would Pennett be required to call Suzack as a
witness?  Or would the trial judge be obliged to declare a
mistrial and direct that two separate trials be held?  All of
these very practical problems had to be addressed because of the
timing of the application.  I see no error in Trainor J.&#146;s
factoring the timing of the application into his determination to
refuse severance.
[108]     The propensity evidence introduced by Pennett and his
heavy reliance on the propensity argument posed a threat to
Suzack&#146;s right to a fair trial.  Certainly, severance was an
option.  That option was not, however, without its own
difficulties.  The Crown and Pennett vigorously opposed
severance.  Trainor J. had to balance these competing interests.
I do not think his refusal to order severance reflects any error
in principle or resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s instruction on the propensity evidence</pre>
    <pre>[109]     Suzack&#146;s next ground of appeal flows from the trial
judge&#146;s refusal to grant severance.  He submits that Trainor J.
failed in the difficult task of properly instructing the jury as
to the use it could and could not make of the propensity
evidence.  Counsel contends that the trial judge failed to
reconcile the competing interests of Pennett and Suzack.  He
argues that Trainor J. had to make two propositions clear to the
jury:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  They could use the propensity evidence when considering
  Pennett&#146;s guilt.  The jury were entitled to use that evidence in
  support of Pennett&#146;s position that Suzack was the shooter and he
  was not involved in the murder.</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  They could not use the propensity evidence when determining
  Suzack&#146;s guilt.  The jury had to be instructed that the evidence
  could not assist the Crown in any way in proving Suzack&#146;s
  involvement in the murder.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[110]     The Crown counters this submission with the contention
that the second of the two instructions set out above was not
necessary.  The Crown argues that once propensity evidence was
properly admitted at the behest of Pennett, the jury was entitled
to use that evidence along with the rest of the evidence in
determining Suzack&#146;s guilt.  On this view of the law, both the
Crown and Pennett could rely on the propensity evidence as
circumstantial evidence of Suzack&#146;s culpability even though the
Crown could not have relied on the evidence for that purpose had
Suzack been tried alone.
[111]     Where accused are tried jointly, each is entitled to
the constitutional protections inherent in the right to a fair
trial.  Those protections include the right to make full answer
and defence and the right to be shielded from evidence which
unfairly prejudices an accused.  An accused&#146;s right to a fair
trial does not, however, entitle that accused to exactly the same
trial when tried jointly as the accused would have had had he
been tried alone:  R. v. Crawford, supra, at p. 497-98;  R. v.
Pelletier (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 533 (B.C.C.A.).  In joint
trials, one accused may elicit evidence or make submissions in
support of his defence that are prejudicial to the other accused
and could not have been elicited or made by the Crown.  In those
cases, the respective rights of each accused must be balanced by
the trial judge so as to preserve the overall fairness of the
trial.  In Crawford, supra, Sopinka J. said, at p. 498:
          </pre>
    <pre>   I have gone to some length to stress that Charter rights are
   not absolute in the sense that they cannot be applied to their
   full extent regardless of the context.  Application of Charter
   values must take into account other interests and, in particular,
   other Charter values which may conflict with their unrestricted
   and literal enforcement.  This approach to Charter values is
   especially apt in this case, in that the conflicting rights are
   protected under the same section of the Charter.</pre>
    <pre>[112]     Sopinka J. balanced the competing constitutional
interests in Crawford by holding that while an accused (unlike
the Crown) could lead evidence that the co-accused had failed to
give his version of events prior to trial, the co-accused was
entitled to a jury instruction that pre-trial silence was
relevant only to credibility and was not evidence of the co-
accused&#146;s guilt.  In addition the jury had to be told that pre-
trial silence was only one factor to be considered in assessing
credibility and that depending on the evidence, the co-accused&#146;s
pre-trial silence may be explained by factors which do not
reflect adversely on the co-accused&#146;s credibility: R. v.
Crawford, supra, at 500.  Sopinka J. balanced the competing
interests by allowing the co-accused to advance evidence of the
co-accused&#146;s silence  while at the same time placing limits on
how the jury could use that evidence.
[113]     R. v. Crawford, supra, is consistent with the earlier
decision of this Court in R. v. Kendall and McKay, supra, at p.
128.  Goodman J.A., for the court, held that the trial judge had
erred in excluding relevant and potentially probative evidence
offered by one accused because it potentially prejudiced the
defence of the other co-accused.  He observed that exclusion of
the evidence completely sacrificed the interests of one accused
in favour of those of the other.  He further held that a limiting
instruction and not the exclusion of the evidence was the
appropriate response when an accused sought to adduce evidence
which was relevant to his defence but prejudicial to the defence
of the co-accused.  Goodman J.A. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133;There are other conflicts which may arise during the course
   of a joint trial, prejudice from which can be avoided to either
   or both accused by a careful direction on the part of a trial
   judge&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[114]     The authorities fully recognize the need to balance the
competing interests of co-accused in a joint trial.  They regard
a carefully crafted  jury instruction as the best way to achieve
that balance.
[115]     For reasons which I cannot understand, the Crown
contends that there is no need to balance the competing interests
of co-accused where one leads evidence of the other&#146;s propensity
for violence.  The Crown takes the position that Suzack had to
suffer the use of propensity evidence to bolster the Crown&#146;s case
against him as a consequence of the joint trial.  According to
the Crown, fairness concerns which would preclude the Crown from
relying on Suzack&#146;s propensity for violence as evidence of his
culpability disappear when that evidence is adduced by a co-
accused.
[116]     I cannot accept the Crown&#146;s submission.  It is a
fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system that criminal
culpability depends on the Crown&#146;s ability to prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused committed the specific act
alleged in the indictment.  It has been established for over 100
years that the Crown cannot make its case by showing that the
accused engaged in misconduct other than that alleged against him
for the purpose of showing that the accused was the type of
person who would commit the crime alleged.  Makin v. The Attorney
General for New South Wales, [1894] A.C. 57 at 65 (P.C.).
Propensity evidence and the reasoning that it invites imperil
this fundamental tenet by inviting conviction based on the kind
of person the accused is shown to be or based on acts other than
those alleged against the accused: R. v. D.(L. E.) (1989), 50
C.C.C. (3d) 142 at 161-162 (S.C.C.).  I would not discard a rule
that is so central to an accused&#146;s right to a fair trial to
further a co-accused&#146;s right to make full answer and defence.
[117]     The Crown&#146;s position is also inconsistent with the
manner in which the competing rights of co-accused have
traditionally been balanced in joint trials where evidence is
adduced which is admissible against only one of the accused.  In
those cases, courts have held that a proper instruction limiting
the use of the evidence strikes the appropriate balance between
the respective rights of the co-accused.  For example, when the
Crown leads evidence of a statement made by one accused, the jury
must be told that the statement is admissible only against the
maker of the statement and cannot be considered in determining
the co-accused&#146;s culpability:  R. v. Olah (1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d)
389 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1998), 121
C.C.C. (3d) vi; R. v. Court (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 237 at 258-59
(Ont. C.A.).  I see no essential difference between that kind of
limiting instruction and one which limits the use of propensity
evidence tendered by one co-accused against the other.  It may
well be that a proper limiting instruction with respect to
propensity evidence will be more difficult for a jury to apply
than other kinds of limiting instructions.  That difficulty is a
matter to be considered by the trial judge in determining whether
to grant severance.  It is no reason to abandon entirely the
attempt to balance the respective rights of co-accused in a joint
trial.  If a trial judge is satisfied that a proper limiting
instruction cannot be given, then severance is clearly preferable
over a joint trial which sacrifices entirely one accused&#146;s right
to be tried on the allegation in the indictment and not on prior
misconduct.
[118]     The Crown relies on R. v. Valentini (1999), 132 C.C.C.
(3d) 262 (Ont. C.A.) in support of its submission that no
limiting instruction with respect to the propensity evidence was
necessary. In that case, Valentini and three co-accused were
charged with conspiracy to import cocaine and other related
charges.  Two of the co-accused advanced a duress defence
claiming that Valentini had threatened to kill them if they did
not take part in the importing scheme.  Valentini&#146;s defence was
that he had no part in any plan to import cocaine.
[119]     The Crown and co-accused led evidence of threats made
by Valentini in connection with the importation scheme that was
the subject of the conspiracy charge.  That evidence was relevant
to show Valentini&#146;s role in the conspiracy and to the duress
defence.  There was no objection to that evidence.
[120]     One of the co-accused also led evidence of prior acts
of violence committed by Valentini that were not connected to the
importation scheme.  The co-accused testified that he was aware
of these prior acts of violence when Valentini threatened him.
The evidence was led to support the co-accused&#146;s duress defence
and to establish the basis for the co-accused&#146;s fear that
Valentini would kill him if he did not co-operate.  The Crown
could not have led this evidence as part of its case.
[121]     The trial judge instructed the jury that evidence of
Valentini&#146;s prior acts of violence known to the co-accused was
admissible to support the duress defence.
[122]     On appeal, Valentini unsuccessfully challenged the
instructions on his prior acts of violence.  After pointing out
that, unlike the Crown, a co-accused can lead propensity evidence
against another co-accused, Rosenberg J.A. said, at p. 279:
          </pre>
    <pre>   Accordingly, the classic direction that must be given in a
   case where the prosecution is allowed to lead evidence of bad
   character [citation omitted] has limited application.  In my
   view, where evidence of bad character is led by a co-accused, the
   trial judge should, where possible, minimize the prejudice to the
   accused while ensuring that the jury understands the full force
   of the evidence in favour of the co-accused.  In order to best
   accomplish these dual purposes, the jury must be told in clear
   terms the reason why the evidence has been admitted.  [Emphasis
   added]</pre>
    <pre>[123]     This passage is entirely consistent with the balancing
process described in R. v. Crawford, supra.  The balance is
achieved by focussing the jury&#146;s attention on the permitted use
in favour of the co-accused and &#147;minimizing&#148; the prejudice to the
other accused.  It is also noteworthy that in the above passage
Rosenberg J.A. does not suggest that the &#147;classic&#148; limiting
instruction given with respect to disposition evidence has no
application when the evidence is led by a co-accused.  He points
out that the traditional instruction has &#147;limited application&#148;.
I take him to mean that the usual limiting instruction standing
alone would be inadequate since it could prejudice the position
of the co-accused who led the propensity evidence.
[124]     Rosenberg J.A. then reviewed the jury instruction and
found that it properly related the evidence of the prior acts of
violence to the duress defence.  He concluded this part of his
reasons at p. 280:
          </pre>
    <pre>   It would not have been appropriate to direct the jury that
   the prior acts of violence were not admissible to show that
   Valentini was the type of person likely to have committed the
   offence.  The prior acts of violence might well have been
   admitted for that purpose, as shown in Kendall [ R. v. Kendall
   (1987), 35 C.C.C. (3d) 105 (Ont. C.A.)].  The fact that the trial
   judge did not extend the use of the evidence for that purpose
   inured to Valentini&#146;s benefit.  There was little risk that the
   jury would have been overwhelmed by the prior acts of violence or
   diverted from the real issues in the case.  The threats made by
   Valentini as testified to by Marsh, Switzer Tepsa and Bonin in
   attempt to persuade them to enter the conspiracy were far more
   significant.  That evidence was an essential part of the Crown&#146;s
   case and the case for the other accused.  No complaint could be
   made about the admission of that evidence or its use to show that
   Valentini was a member and chief architect of the conspiracy.</pre>
    <pre>[125]     The Crown relies on the first sentence in this passage.
I do not read that sentence as suggesting that the jury could use
the evidence of prior acts of violence to infer Valentini&#146;s
propensity for violence to support the Crown&#146;s case against
Valentini.  Rather, I understand it to mean that the normal
limiting instruction standing alone would not have been a proper
instruction because propensity reasoning was available to the co-
accused in support of their duress defence.  Rosenberg J.A. does
not suggest that it would have been inappropriate to give the
customary limiting instruction if it was made referable only to
the Crown&#146;s case against Valentini.  Instead, he concludes that,
given the nature of the propensity evidence, the nature of the
allegation and the clear instruction as to the limited use which
could be made of the propensity evidence, there was no need for a
further limiting instruction.  In short, Rosenberg J.A. concluded
that the trial judge properly balanced the competing interests of
the co-accused.  He did not hold that the Crown was entitled to
use propensity reasoning to prove its case once propensity
evidence was adduced by a co-accused.
[126]     R. v. Valentini, supra, confirms the trial judge&#146;s
obligation to balance the competing interests of co-accused where
those interests clash in a joint trial. It also demonstrates that
the way the balance is achieved will vary with the circumstances
of the case.  What is important is that the jury understand the
purpose for which the evidence is admitted and that the prejudice
to the co-accused be minimized.
[127]     In a case like this one where an accused leads evidence
of the co-accused&#146;s propensity for violence in support of the
position that the co-accused committed the crime, a proper
balance of the competing interests requires that the jury be told
how it can use the evidence in considering the case of the
accused and how it cannot use the evidence in considering the
case of the co-accused.  An example of an appropriate limiting
instruction is found in the draft specimen charges developed by
the Ontario Specimen Jury Instruction Project under the direction
of the Honourable Mr. Justice David Watt.  That instruction
provides:
          </pre>
    <pre>               (1)  Sometimes a person charged with a
	  crime will say, &#147;it was not me, it was (an)
	  other person charged who did it&#148;, and will
	  point to evidence that this other person had
	  an opportunity and a disposition to do it.  In
	  this case, (NOA1) is saying that (NOA2) 
	 committed the crime, and points to evidence 
	 (NOA2) is the sort of person who would do 
	 such a thing.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (2)  It is up to you to determine
          whether the disposition evidence, alone, or
          together with other evidence, raises a
          reasonable doubt that (NOA1) committed the
          offence charged.  However you must not use
          the disposition evidence in any way when you
          consider whether Crown counsel has proven the
          case against (NOA2).  No one can be convicted
          of a crime just for being the sort of person
          who might have committed it.
          </pre>
    <pre>               (3)  In other words, you may consider
          evidence of (NOA2)&#146;s opportunity and
          disposition to commit the offence(s) charged
          in deciding whether you have a reasonable
          doubt that (NOA1) committed it (them), but
          you must not use evidence of (NOA2)&#146;s
          disposition to find (NOA2) guilty of it
          (them).</pre>
    <pre>[128]     Some will say that a jury could not possibly follow the
Committee&#146;s proposed instruction.  I do not pretend that there is
no risk that the jury would not follow that instruction.  Like
any limiting instruction, there is a risk that the jury will not
abide by it.  As long as we maintain trial by jury, however,
courts must proceed on the basis that juries accept and follow
the instructions given to them by the trial judge:  R. v.
Corbett, supra, at p. 401;  R. v. Eng (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 188
at 201-202 (B.C.C.A.).  That is not to say that in a specific
case a trial judge could not decide that the risk of misuse of
propensity evidence offered by one co-accused could not be
adequately addressed by a limiting instruction.  If a trial judge
reaches that conclusion, he or she will have no choice but to
order severance.  It would, however, be wrong for a trial judge
to accept as a general proposition that a jury would not or could
not abide by a limiting instruction.
[129]     Trainor J. did not have the advantage of the specimen
instruction prepared by Justice Watt&#146;s Committee and his
instruction did not conform with that specimen charge in all
respects.  The instruction did, however, in my view, adequately
protect Suzack&#146;s right to a fair trial.
[130]     Trainor J. told the jury that the evidence of Suzack&#146;s
threat against Hurd and the cross-examination on his criminal
acts were evidence of character and disposition for violence.  He
then immediately told the jury why the evidence had been
admitted:
          </pre>
    <pre>    &#133; The evidence was introduced by Mr. Fleming [counsel for
    Pennett] in cross-examination and there is other evidence on this
    subject including the accused&#146;s criminal record.  Mr. Fleming
    says that as between the two accused the question of who, Suzack
    or Pennett would be more likely to have shot Constable MacDonald
    makes the evidence of disposition for violence relevant.</pre>
    <pre>[131]     Trainor J. followed his instructions as to the purpose
for which the evidence was admitted with a limiting instruction:
          </pre>
    <pre>    The evidence cannot be used, however, to say that drug
    dealers are murderers or that people who on other occasions
    have acted violently committed murder on this occasion.
          </pre>
    <pre>    We try cases on the crime that was committed, not on the
    past records that persons have, or on the basis that they
    may be of bad character or be disposed towards violence.</pre>
    <pre>[132]     It would have been preferable had Trainor J. made it
clear that the limiting instruction applied only to the Crown&#146;s
use of the evidence.  I think, however, that the jury having just
heard the purpose for which the evidence was adduced would
understand that they could not use the evidence to convict Suzack
but they could use the evidence to acquit Pennett.
[133]     Trainor J. also minimized the potential prejudice to
Suzack by the admission of the propensity evidence in two other
important ways.  He instructed the jury that the evidence
concerning the threatening of Hurd with the gun was open to
different interpretations at least one of which supported
Suzack&#146;s evidence that he had racked the gun at the murder scene
and used it to threaten the officer but had not fired the gun.
Trainor J. also pointed out that Hurd admitted that he instigated
the violence which culminated in the threat made by Suzack.  More
importantly, the trial judge focussed the jury&#146;s attention on the
actual events which led to Constable MacDonald&#146;s murder.  He
said:
          </pre>
    <pre>               In this case there is much hard evidence
	  as to the commission of the crime, I urge you
	  to decide the case on the basis of the evidence
	  on Gordon Street.  There is ample hard evidence
	  of cruelty and unprovoked violence that you have
	  heard from witnesses arising from what happened
	  on Gordon Street.  My own view is, that the prior
	  violence does not match or come close to the
	  violence that you have heard about from the various
          witnesses as to the ongoing assault on Constable
	  MacDonald.
          </pre>
    <pre>               Therefore, violence on prior occasions
          adds very little to the case.  However,
          having said that, it is open to an accused
          person such as Peter Pennett and to his
          counsel, to say to you, look at Suzack&#146;s
          disposition for violence if you have any
          doubt who shot Constable MacDonald.
          </pre>
    <pre>               It is one piece of evidence that you may
          consider &#133;  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[134]     One last factor is relevant to the determination of
whether the instructions adequately protected Suzack&#146;s right to a
fair trial.  The propensity evidence was adduced by Pennett
primarily to demonstrate that Suzack, because of his character
and propensity for violence, was the shooter.  It was not the
Crown&#146;s theory that Suzack was the shooter.  To the contrary, it
was the Crown&#146;s primary position that Pennett was the shooter and
its secondary position that both were guilty of murder regardless
of which accused fired the fatal shots.  In these circumstances,
the risk that the jury would misuse the propensity evidence to
assist the Crown in the proof of its case against Suzack was
diminished.
[135]     Read as a whole and considering the positions of the
parties, I am satisfied that the instructions adequately
protected Suzack&#146;s right to a fair trial.</pre>
    <pre>The non-direction with respect to Suzack&#146;s exercise of his pre-
trial right to silence and access to Crown disclosure.</pre>
    <pre>[136]     Jurisprudence developed after Trainor J. instructed the
jury has made it clear that, unlike the Crown, a co-accused may
elicit evidence that the other accused failed to disclose his
position prior to trial.  Where the co-accused does so, the trial
judge must tell the jury that the co-accused&#146;s failure to tell
his version of events prior to trial is relevant to his
credibility but is not evidence of his guilt.  The jury should
also be told that the accused&#146;s failure to tell his version of
events prior to trial is but one factor to be considered along
with all other factors in assessing the credibility of that co-
accused:  R. v. Crawford, supra, at 500.  Suzack submits that the
trial judge failed to give this instruction.
[137]     Counsel for Pennett cross-examined Suzack on his
failure to reveal his version of events prior to testifying.
Suzack replied that his &#147;story&#148; had been consistent throughout
and that &#147;my lawyers have &#133; have my rendition of it right from &#133;
.&#148;  Counsel then interrupted with another question.
[138]     In his closing address, which fills some 132 pages of
the transcript, counsel for Pennett made two references to
Suzack&#146;s pre-trial silence.  The first reference was not a
comment on Suzack&#146;s silence, but rather a submission that he had
lied in his cross-examination when he said he spoke to no one
other than his lawyer.  Counsel for Pennett referred to the
evidence of Gibbs concerning certain conversations with Suzack
after the murder.
[139]     In the second reference, counsel for Pennett made the
point that his client did make a statement to the police and
Suzack did not.  He said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   Pennett makes an effort to explain what happened on May 15,
   1994 after the preliminary.  At least he tried. [This is a
   reference to Pennett&#146;s statement to the police.]  Suzack hangs
   back in the weeds and tells his story for the first time at
   trial, which he is entitled to do, but why didn&#146;t he come forward
   and make an effort to explain what happened earlier?  The answer
   is obvious.  He was prepared to sit back, see how things shaped
   up, tailor his evidence around the evidence &#150; the physical
   evidence and then be prepared to sacrifice Peter Pennett&#146;s life
   in this trial to try and save his own.</pre>
    <pre>[140]     I do not think this submission can be taken as a
suggestion that Suzack was guilty because he did not give a
statement to the police.  Rather, it is a submission that
Suzack&#146;s silence was part of his plan to blame Pennett for the
murder.  Pennett had led evidence that Suzack had told Gibbs
shortly after the murder that Suzack would &#147;fight his own angle&#148;
and that if Pennett would not co-operate there was nothing he
could do for Pennett.
[141]     The trial judge did not tell the jury that Suzack&#146;s pre-
trial silence could not be evidence of his guilt.  Nor did he
suggest to the jury that Suzack&#146;s pre-trial silence was relevant
to his credibility.  The trial judge did not address the topic.
I do not think that his failure to advert to Suzack&#146;s pre-trial
silence prejudiced Suzack.  The jury could not possibly have
taken from the evidence or counsel&#146;s submissions that Suzack&#146;s
silence was positive evidence of his guilt.  The trial judge&#146;s
failure to refer to his pre-trial silence in addressing factors
relevant to Suzack&#146;s credibility could not have prejudiced
Suzack.
[142]     In a closely related submission, Suzack also contends
that counsel for Pennett suggested to the jury that it could use
Suzack&#146;s access to Crown disclosure against Suzack in assessing
his credibility.  He contends that the submission was improper
and the trial judge erred in failing to so instruct the jury:  R.
v. Peavoy (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 at 233-34 (Ont. C.A.).
[143]     Counsel for Pennett did suggest to the jury in his
closing that Suzack had tailored his evidence to conform to the
physical evidence that had been disclosed to Suzack.  Counsel
made the submission in support of the contention that Suzack had
decided to blame the murder on Pennett when he became aware of
physical evidence which potentially implicated Pennett as the
shooter (e.g. Pennett&#146;s blood was on the murder weapon).  The
submission that Suzack had fabricated his defence came from the
evidence of Gibbs who testified that Suzack initially admitted
that he had shot Constable MacDonald but later said that he would
&#147;have to fight his own angle&#148; and that if Pennett did not co-
operate with him there was nothing Suzack would do for Pennett.
Unlike the situation in R. v. Peavoy, supra, at 234, there was an
evidentiary basis for counsel&#146;s submission that Suzack had
fabricated his evidence and the jury were entitled to consider
that contention in assessing Suzack&#146;s evidence.
[144]     I do not take counsel to have suggested that Suzack&#146;s
evidence was suspect merely because he had received Crown
disclosure.  Indeed, I would be surprised had counsel made that
submission since Pennett would also have received Crown
disclosure prior to making his statement.  I understand counsel
to have suggested to the jury that Suzack&#146;s access to Crown
disclosure gave him the opportunity to do what he had told Gibbs
he would do &#150; &#147;play his own angle&#148;.  Since counsel for Pennett
did not suggest that Suzack&#146;s exercise of his constitutional
right to disclosure should count against him in the eyes of the
jury, there was no need for the trial judge to deal with this
topic in his instructions.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s instructions on joint liability for murder.</pre>
    <pre>[145]     Counsel for Suzack submits that the trial judge
misdirected the jury as to Suzack&#146;s potential liability for
murder as a party to a common design with Pennett.  He also
submits that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that
if Suzack and Pennett acting independently of each other formed
the intention to murder Constable MacDonald then Suzack would be
guilty only of attempted murder if Pennett fired the fatal shot.
[146]     In his factum, counsel addresses the questions of
causation and the potential liability of co-perpetrators at a
somewhat abstract level.  I think the force of counsel&#146;s
submission is best assessed by examining what Trainor J. said to
the jury.
[147]     Trainor J. prefaced his instructions on the law with
this observation:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; The real issue for you, as is apparent from the way the
   case has been presented and argued, is whether the Crown has
   satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that Suzack and Pennett,
   or either of them, are liable for murder as principals or as
   parties.</pre>
    <pre>[148]     There was no doubt that both appellants knew that
Constable MacDonald was a police officer acting in the execution
of his duty when he was killed.  Therefore, if one or both were
guilty of murder, he or they were guilty of first degree murder
under s. 231(4)(a) of the Criminal Code.  It was also common
ground that whoever fired the fatal shots was, subject to the
possible &#147;defence&#148; of drunkenness, guilty of first degree murder.
[149]     After referring to s. 21(1) of the Criminal Code,
Trainor J. said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   If two or more persons act in concert, and by that I mean,
   in a common participation in the commission of an offence &#150; in
   this case murder &#150; and they assist one another in the commission
   of that offence, then they are liable as principals, provided
   that they each had the intention that I have referred to, meant
   to cause death, or meant to cause bodily harm as I have defined
   it.  Both may be found liable, even though you are uncertain as
   to which of them fired the fatal shots.</pre>
    <pre>[150]     According to this instruction, both Suzack and Pennett
could be convicted of murder regardless of which one fired the
fatal shots if the Crown established three things beyond a
reasonable doubt:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  that Suzack and Pennett acted in concert in the commission
  of the murder of Constable MacDonald;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  that Suzack and Pennett assisted each other in the murder of
  Constable MacDonald;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  that Suzack and Pennett each had the culpable state of mind
  necessary for the crime of murder.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[151]     The instruction was repeated near the end of the trial
judge&#146;s charge to the jury and was given to the jury in written
form, at their request, during their deliberations.
[152]     It is beyond question that where two persons, each with
the requisite intent, act in concert in the commission of a
crime, they are both guilty of that crime.  Their liability may
fall under one or more of the provisions of s. 21(1) of the
Criminal Code:  R. v. Sparrow (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 443 at 457-
58 (Ont. C.A.).  Trainor J. told the jury that if Suzack and
Pennett jointly participated in the murder with the necessary
intent, they were &#147;liable as principals.&#148;  This is potentially a
mischaracterization of their liability.  They may have been
principals or they may have been aiders or abettors depending on
what each did in the course of the common design:  R. v. Simpson
(1988), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 488-91 (S.C.C.).  As Griffiths J.A.
said in R. v. Wood (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 201 at 220:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133; Where evidence of concerted action in the commission of
   the offence exists, as in the present case, then it is open to a
   jury to convict all of the accused either as principals, under
   s.229(a), or as aiders or abettors pursuant to s. 21 of the Code,
   even though the extent of the individual participation in the
   violence is unclear. &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[153]     I do not, however, regard Trainor J.&#146;s error in
terminology as having any significance.  The crucial issue is not
whether he properly labelled the nature of the appellants&#146;
liability, but whether he properly instructed the jury as to the
essential elements which the Crown had to prove to establish
joint liability for murder where the jury could not determine
which of the two had fired the fatal shots.
[154]     In the passage quoted above, Trainor J. told the jury
that to convict Suzack as a joint participant in the murder, the
Crown had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  that he participated with Pennett in the commission of the
  murder;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  that he assisted Pennett in the commission of the murder;
  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  that he had one of the intents required by s. 229(a).</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[155]     In my view, Suzack was guilty of murder if the Crown
proved the three elements set out above.  In fact, the second
element (aiding) was perhaps superfluous in that it was
encompassed by the broader language set out in the first element.
It was unnecessary to label the nature of his participation.
Indeed s. 21(1) is structured so as to avoid distinctions based
on modes of participation in the crime.
[156]     I also do not accept Suzack&#146;s submission that causation
had any relevance under this theory of liability.  In R. v.
McMaster (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at 203 (S.C.C.), the
appellant and another person beat the deceased to death.  It was
argued that the trial judge failed to consider whether the
appellant&#146;s blows caused the death.  Lamer C.J.C. rejected this
argument stating, at p. 203:
          </pre>
    <pre>    &#133; However, the trial judge made it clear in his reasons that
    he was satisfied that the cousins were acting in concert and
    &#147;jointly involved&#148; in causing the death.  It is a well
    established principle that where a trier of fact is satisfied
    that multiple accused acted in concert, there is no requirement
    that the trier of fact decide which accused actually struck the
    fatal blow. &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[157]     I can find no error in Trainor J.&#146;s instructions as to
Suzack&#146;s potential liability for murder as a participant in a
common scheme with Suzack to commit murder.
[158]     Suzack&#146;s argument that the trial judge should have
instructed the jury that he was potentially guilty of attempted
murder is put this way in counsel&#146;s factum:
          </pre>
    <pre>    If the jury concluded that Suzack intended to kill MacDonald
    but did not act in concert with Pennett for this purpose, and
    found that Pennett had shot MacDonald in the head after
    independently forming the intent to kill, the correct verdict
    would have been to find Pennett guilty of murder and convict
    Suzack of attempted murder.</pre>
    <pre>[159]     There is no air of reality to this submission and the
instruction would have significantly prejudiced Suzack&#146;s only
real defence.  Suzack acknowledged that he and Pennett were
acting in concert when they attacked and beat Constable
MacDonald.  He maintained that he did not intend to kill
MacDonald and did not foresee that Pennett would kill MacDonald.
His purported lack of any intention to commit murder was the
linchpin of his entire defence and meant the difference between a
conviction for first degree murder and a conviction for
manslaughter.  An instruction premised on the possibility that
Suzack in fact intended to murder Constable MacDonald in the
course of the attack would have severely prejudiced that defence.
Furthermore, the suggestion that Suzack and Pennett jointly set
about to incapacitate Constable MacDonald by beating him into a
state of unconsciousness, that both formed the intention to
murder, but that Pennett acted independently of Suzack when,
during the course of the joint attack, he gave effect to that
intention by shooting Constable MacDonald is to put it
charitably, farfetched.
[160]     The trial judge&#146;s instructions were, of necessity,
lengthy and complicated.  He refused to add to that complexity by
instructing the jury on a potential basis of liability which
would prejudice Suzack&#146;s only real defence and depended upon the
jury taking a most improbable view of the evidence.  The jury
would inevitably have been thoroughly confused by an attempted
murder instruction when Suzack had admitted responsibility for
the death of Constable MacDonald.  Trainor J. was correct in
declining to direct the jury that Suzack was potentially liable
for attempted murder.  The direction could only have added
needless confusion to the instructions.</pre>
    <pre>Crown counsel&#146;s submission concerning Constable MacDonald&#146;s
actions.</pre>
    <pre>[161]     Constable MacDonald fired six shots at Suzack as Suzack
approached him armed with the murder weapon.  By this stage of
the attack, Constable MacDonald had been disabled and pistol
whipped by Suzack.  Crown counsel argued that Constable
MacDonald&#146;s actions were evidence that MacDonald perceived that
he was about to be shot by Suzack.  The Crown urged the jury to
rely on Constable MacDonald&#146;s reaction to Suzack and not on
Suzack&#146;s claim that he only intended to continue to beat
Constable MacDonald and not to kill him.  Crown counsel said:
          </pre>
    <pre>    Constable MacDonald had every reason to believe that he was
    about to be shot by Clinton Suzack.  Clinton Suzack says the
    officer just misunderstood.  Who would you believe? Constable
    MacDonald tells us by his conduct that he was about to be shot.
    Clinton Suzack says he wasn&#146;t.  Who would you believe?</pre>
    <pre>[162]     The trial judge dealt specifically with this submission
in his instructions.  After referring to the Crown&#146;s contention
that Constable MacDonald&#146;s reaction offered some evidence of
Suzack&#146;s intention, he said:
          </pre>
    <pre>    &#133; If Constable MacDonald was here testifying, he would tell,
    or he might tell you that he thought he was going to be shot and
    so he shot.  He could not tell you what was in the mind of the
    shooter.  That is a question for you, and you will resolve it
    after considering all of the evidence that has been presented
    including the evidence that Constable MacDonald fired the shots
    that struck Clinton Suzack.</pre>
    <pre>[163]     The jury was entitled to consider all of the
surrounding circumstances when deciding whether Suzack had the
state of mind necessary for the crime of murder.  Constable
MacDonald&#146;s reaction as Suzack approached him with the murder
weapon was one of the circumstances.  The fact that Constable
MacDonald&#146;s response taken by itself does not prove an intent to
kill as opposed to some lesser intent does not render his
reaction valueless in assessing Suzack&#146;s state of mind.  Pieces
of evidence are not examined in isolation.
[164]     It may be that the Crown&#146;s submission overstated the
potential probative force of Constable MacDonald&#146;s reaction.  If
the submission went too far, Trainor J.&#146;s instructions prevented
any prejudice to Suzack.</pre>
    <pre>				V</pre>
    <pre>PENNETT&#146;S GROUNDS OF APPEAL</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s instruction on the propensity evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[165]     Suzack argued that Trainor J. did not do enough to
protect him from the prejudicial effect of the propensity
evidence adduced by Pennett.  I have rejected that argument.
Pennett argues that Trainor J. misdirected the jury as to the
probative value of that propensity evidence thereby prejudicing
his defence.  I would also reject that argument.
[166]     Pennett argues that the trial judge should have told
the jury that the evidence of Pennett&#146;s disposition for violence
could be regarded &#147;as circumstantial evidence identifying Suzack
as the principal in the homicide.&#148;
[167]     I do not quarrel with the description of propensity
evidence as circumstantial evidence.  However, for the reasons
set out above, I cannot agree that the propensity evidence could
be used against Suzack in assessing his guilt.  It could,
however, be used in assessing Pennett&#146;s guilt and, in particular,
his claim that Suzack perpetrated the attack on Constable
MacDonald and fired the fatal shots.
[168]     Counsel referred to a number of authorities which hold
that evidence of a third party&#146;s propensity for violence tendered
by the defence can be circumstantial evidence that the third
party committed the crime with which the accused is charged.  For
example, in R. v. Arcangioli (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.)
the court held that evidence of a third party&#146;s (Semester)
propensity for violence was admissible as evidence that the third
party and not the appellant had stabbed the victim.  Major J.
said, at p. 298:
          </pre>
    <pre>   There is little doubt that the evidence was sufficiently
   probative to warrant its admission and use for the appellant&#146;s
   purpose of establishing that Semester had wielded a knife in the
   past and, therefore, was likely to have stabbed Heffern [the
   victim].  If believed by the jury, that evidence was capable of
   supporting the appellant&#146;s defence that it was Semester who
   stabbed Heffern &#133;</pre>
    <pre>[169]     Arcangioli was not, however, a case in which the third
party, against whom the propensity evidence was led, was a co-
accused in the joint trial.  In Arcangioli, the third party&#146;s
fair trial rights could not be undermined by the introduction of
the propensity evidence.  Major J. recognized this at p. 296:
          </pre>
    <pre>   However, the danger of a wrongful conviction does not arise
   where the character evidence pertains not to the accused, but to
   a third party witness.</pre>
    <pre>[170]     Where the target of the propensity evidence is not a co-
accused, it is entirely proper to refer to the propensity
evidence as circumstantial evidence that the third party and not
the accused committed the alleged crime.  Where, however, the
target of the propensity evidence is also an accused on trial
before the same jury, a more refined instruction is needed to
balance the competing interests of the accused.  In this case,
that balance required that the jury understand the use they could
make of the evidence on behalf of Pennett, and that they be
alerted against the misuse of the evidence in deciding Suzack&#146;s
case.  For the reasons set out above, I think the charge to the
jury properly balanced the competing interests.</pre>
    <pre>The consciousness of guilt instruction.</pre>
    <pre>[171]     Pennett fled the scene with Suzack after Constable
MacDonald was killed and he resisted arrest.  He was also
reported as saying &#147;shoot me.  shoot me&#148; when confronted by the
police.  Trainor J. instructed the jury that Pennett&#146;s actions:
          </pre>
    <pre>   &#133;may be evidence of a guilty conscience and be considered
   and weighed by you in the light of all the evidence in deciding
   guilt or innocence.</pre>
    <pre>[172]     Counsel for Pennett concedes that if Pennett&#146;s
explanation for his after-the-fact conduct was rejected, that
conduct could be used by the jury to infer that Pennett
participated in the assault on Constable MacDonald and was,
therefore, culpable in his death.  Counsel submits, however, that
Trainor J. erred in law in failing to tell the jury that
Pennett&#146;s after-the-fact conduct could not constitute evidence
that he was guilty of murder as opposed to manslaughter.
[173]     Crown counsel concedes that Pennett&#146;s after-the-fact
conduct could not be used as evidence that he was guilty of
murder as opposed to manslaughter:  R. v. Marinaro (1996), 105
C.C.C. (3d) 95 (S.C.C.), adopting the dissent of Dubin C.J.O.
(1994), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 74 at 81-82 (Ont. C.A.).  Crown counsel
submits, however, that the error occasioned no substantial wrong
or miscarriage of justice.
[174]     The instruction to be given regarding evidence formerly
referred to as evidence of consciousness of guilt and now
referred to as after-the-fact conduct has been the subject of
many appellate judgments since Trainor J. delivered his charge to
the jury.  The proper approach to that evidence was described by
Weiler J.A. in R. v. Peavoy, supra, at 237-38:
          </pre>
    <pre>   Evidence of after-the-fact conduct must be relevant to a
   fact in issue and it may be relevant to more than one fact in
   issue in a trial.  Like other circumstantial evidence, evidence
   of after-the-fact conduct must be reasonably capable of
   supporting an inference which tends to make the existence of a
   fact in issue more or less likely.  The primary question is, &#147;How
   is the after-the-fact conduct relevant?&#148;  This question cannot be
   determined in the abstract or by regard only to the evidence of
   the after-the-fact conduct.  It will depend on the nature of the
   conduct and the factual context of the case, particularly the
   context of the position advanced by the appellant at trial;
   [citation omitted].  Relevance is, of course, addressed when the
   evidence is tendered.  The relevance of after-the-fact conduct
   should be used to shape the instruction given to the jury in any
   particular case where that kind of evidence forms part of the
   case.  [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[175]     Trainor J. did not have the advantage of my colleague&#146;s
reasons in R. v. Peavoy, supra.  He did, however, properly
identify the potential relevance of Pennett&#146;s after-the-fact
conduct.  That evidence could assist the jury in determining
whether Pennett was an active participant in the assault on
Constable MacDonald, or, as he claimed, merely an innocent
bystander who tried to defuse the situation and sat &#147;frozen in
fear&#148; as Suzack murdered Constable MacDonald.  As a matter of
common sense and human experience, the jury could view Pennett&#146;s
after-the-fact conduct as consistent with him having been fully
involved in the attack on Constable MacDonald.  They could use
the evidence for that purpose only if they rejected Pennett&#146;s
explanation for his flight and his resisting arrest.  The trial
judge so instructed the jury.
[176]     Trainor J. could have told the jury that Pennett&#146;s
after-the-fact conduct was not evidence from which it could infer
directly that Pennett had the intent required for murder as
opposed to some lesser culpable intent.  It would, however, have
been wrong for him to suggest to the jury that the evidence had
no relevance to Pennett&#146;s potential liability for murder.  To the
extent that the evidence was used by the jury to infer the nature
and level of Pennett&#146;s involvement in the attack on Constable
MacDonald, that evidence was relevant to his liability for
murder.  The extent of his participation in the attack was an
important consideration in determining his level of his
culpability.
[177]     In any event, I am satisfied that the instruction did
not result in any prejudice to Pennett.  It was made clear to the
jury that they could only consider the after-the-fact conduct if
they were satisfied that Pennett fled because he was involved in
the attack on Constable MacDonald in more than a &#147;marginal&#148; way.
To reach that conclusion, the jury had to reject Pennett&#146;s
explanation for his conduct.  The conclusion that Pennett was
actively involved in the attack on Constable MacDonald, combined
with the powerful physical evidence pointing to Pennett as the
shooter, made the Crown&#146;s case against Pennett on the charge of
murder an overwhelming one.  A more detailed instruction
explaining to the jury the limited relevance of Pennett&#146;s after-
the-fact conduct to the level of his culpability would not have
made any difference in the verdict returned against Pennett.</pre>
    <pre>The admissibility of Pennett&#146;s exculpatory post-arrest statements
through Crown witnesses.</pre>
    <pre>[178]     Crown witnesses testified that while Pennett was being
pursued and subdued by the police, he said &#147;shoot me, shoot me.&#148;
That evidence was admitted as part of the Crown&#146;s case.  Counsel
for Pennett argues that the admission of that statement opened
the door to the admission during the case for the Crown of
certain exculpatory statements made by Pennett shortly after his
arrest.
[179]     About six minutes after Pennett was arrested, he said
to a police officer &#147;I didn&#146;t shoot him.&#148;  He was taken to the
police station where he was asked whether he knew why he was
under arrest.  He replied &#147;the guy I was with shot somebody.&#148;
[180]     Pennett attempted to adduce these statements through
cross-examination, contending that they were closely connected to
the pre-arrest statement (&#147;shoot me,&#133;shoot me&#148;).  He argued that
the post-arrest statements qualified the meaning to be given to
the earlier statement and should be regarded as part of that
statement.  He further argued that the jury could be misled by
hearing only the pre-arrest statement.4
[181]     The trial judge, after a review of the relevant
authorities, ruled that the post-arrest statements were not
closely connected to the pre-arrest utterance and did not qualify
or explain that utterance.  He held that the post-arrest
statement was subject to the general rule which prohibits an
accused from introducing self-serving exculpatory statements
through cross-examination of other witnesses.  Trainor J. also
rejected the submission that the statements had any potential non-
hearsay value as evidence of Pennett&#146;s state of mind.
[182]     I agree with his ruling.  The post-arrest comments were
not part of the same narrative as the pre-arrest utterances.  In
fact, there was no narrative at all.  Each statement was an
isolated comment made under very different circumstances by
Pennett.  The post-arrest statements were blatantly self-serving
and had no probative value unless accepted for the truth of their
contents.  That is the exact use which the general exclusionary
rule referable to self-serving evidence is designed to prevent:
R. v. Simpson (1988), 38 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 496 (S.C.C.); R. v.
Phillips (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 297 at 301 (Ont. C.A.).
[183]     Counsel for Pennett referred to authorities which
would, in some circumstances, permit an accused to testify as to
statements made by the accused after his arrest: e.g. R. v. Toten
(1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 5 at 47-48 (Ont. C.A.);  Ontario, Report
of the Commission on Proceedings Involving Guy Paul Morin, Vol.
II, by the Honourable F. Kaufman (Toronto, Ontario Ministry of
the Attorney General 1998) at pp. 1151-57;  R. v. Lucas, [1963] 1
C.C.C. 1 at 10-11 (S.C.C.).  The admissibility of exculpatory
post-arrest statements through the testimony of an accused raises
different concerns than does the admissibility of those same
statements through cross-examination of other witnesses.  If an
accused testifies, the dangers inherent in admitting a self-
serving exculpatory statement are considerably reduced.  The
accused can be cross-examined on that prior statement.  As I
understand the appellant&#146;s submission, it is directed at the
refusal of the trial judge to admit the post-arrest statements
through cross-examination during the case for the Crown.
Consequently, I need not explore the circumstances in which a
trial judge could allow an accused to give evidence of his
exculpatory statements made upon arrest during his testimony.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s instructions with respect to the evidence of
the defence witnesses Gibbs and Sweeney.</pre>
    <pre>[184]     The witnesses, Gibbs and Sweeney were called by
Pennett.  They gave evidence of statements made by Suzack which
supported Pennett&#146;s position that Suzack fired the fatal shots.
Both witnesses were friends of Pennett and had extensive criminal
records involving crimes of dishonesty.  Sweeney had lied in
court on a previous occasion.
[185]     As with the propensity evidence adduced by Pennett, the
trial judge had to treat the evidence of Gibbs and Sweeney in a
way that balanced the conflicting interests of Suzack and
Pennett.  He reviewed their evidence and the related evidence at
some length.  This review served the interests of Pennett and not
Suzack.  The trial judge also said:
          </pre>
    <pre>   This witness [Sweeney] and Gibbs have extensive records.
   This witness, the last witness Sweeney, record is particularly
   extensive, but both are records for offences of dishonesty as
   counsel brought out in cross-examination.  When you deal with the
   witness who has an extensive record for dishonesty you should
   scrutinize his evidence with care before you accept it.  You are
   entitled to accept his evidence but you should scrutinize it.</pre>
    <pre>[186]     It is submitted that this instruction amounted to a
&#147;Vetrovec&#148; warning and that several cases from this court make it
clear that such a warning cannot be given in respect of a defence
witness:  R. v. Vetrovec (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.);  R.
v. Tzimopoulos (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 304 at 340 (Ont. C.A.);  R.
v. Hoilett (1991), 4 C.R. (4th) 372 at 374 (Ont. C.A.).  None of
these cases involved a joint trial of accused who were advancing
&#147;cut-throat&#148; defences.
[187]     The Vetrovec warning has three components:</pre>
    <ul>
      <li><pre>  the evidence of certain witnesses is identified as requiring
  special scrutiny;</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the jury is cautioned that although it is entitled to act on
  the unconfirmed evidence of such a witness, it is dangerous to do
  so;  and</pre>
      </li>
      <li><pre>  the jury is cautioned to look for other independent evidence
  which tends to confirm material parts of the evidence of the
  witness with respect to whom the warning has been given.</pre>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <pre>[188]     Trainor J. did introduce the first component of the
&#147;Vetrovec&#148; warning into his instruction on the evidence of Gibbs
and Sweeney when he told the jury to &#147;scrutinize their evidence
with care.&#148;  Trainor J. said nothing which even approached the
other two components of the &#148;Vetrovec&#148; warning.  He did not
suggest that it was dangerous to act on the evidence of these
witnesses and he did not suggest that the jury should look for
confirmation of their evidence before acting on it.  These
factors distinguish Trainor J.&#146;s instruction from that considered
by this court in Tzimopoulos, supra.
[189]     I would not characterize the impugned instruction as a
&#147;Vetrovec&#148; warning but rather a caution that the credibility of
these two witnesses had to be carefully measured given their long
history of dishonesty.  A trial judge is entitled to alert the
jury to the factors which the trial judge thinks are important in
assessing the credibility of various witnesses.  There was ample
reason to be concerned about the honesty of these two witnesses.
I am sure the jury would have proceeded cautiously when
considering the evidence of these two witnesses without any
instruction from Trainor J.  No doubt he felt compelled to give
the instruction because of Suzack&#146;s position in the trial.  The
evidence of Gibbs and Sweeney was potentially very harmful to
Suzack and it was his position that they were thoroughly unworthy
of belief.  Trainor J. had to put Suzack&#146;s position to the jury
just as he had to be sure that the jury understood the thrust of
the evidence and its significance to Pennett&#146;s position.  As at
other points in the charge, Trainor J. had to balance two
conflicting interests.  I see nothing wrong with the balance he
struck.</pre>
    <pre>The trial judge&#146;s summary of the evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[190]     Pennett&#146;s final submission is a broad one.  He submits
that the charge to the jury read as a whole was so unbalanced
that it &#147;negated the appearance of judicial impartiality.&#148; The
merit of this argument is best tested by a global evaluation of
the charge.  Having read the charge several times I do not get
the impression that Trainor J. was attempting to put his thumb on
the scales of justice during his instructions to the jury. The
review of the evidence in his charge and recharge was thorough
and free of any significant factual error.  He related the
evidence  to the issues and to the positions of the parties on
those issues.  To the extent that his review of the evidence
worked against Pennett, that was the product of the nature of the
evidence and not the way he reviewed it.
[191]     As part of his broad submission that the trial judge&#146;s
charge was skewed in favour of the Crown, counsel for Pennett
refers to one extract from the charge in which he says the trial
judge &#147;censured counsel for Pennett.&#148;  This submission is based
on some ten lines in instructions which spanned well over 200
pages.  In the passage to which counsel takes exception, Trainor
J. was instructing the jury on the use that could be made of
prior inconsistent statements.  He told the jury that in his
opinion counsel had not established that an alleged prior
inconsistent statement given by one of the witnesses was
inconsistent with that witness&#146;s testimony at trial.  Trainor J.
made it clear to the jury that it was up to them to decide
whether there was any inconsistency.  Surely, trial judges can
take issue with a position advanced by counsel without being said
to have &#147;censured counsel so as to impair the appearance of
impartiality.&#148;
[192]     There is no merit to this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>				VI</pre>
    <pre>[193]     I would dismiss both appeals.



Released: January 19, 2000
_______________________________
1 In R. v. Rose, supra, the court also upheld, without separate
consideration, the constitutionality of s. 651(4) of the Criminal
Code.  That section requires that all accused address the jury
before the prosecution if any one of the accused calls a defence.
The section does not provide for the order in which counsel for
the accused must make their addresses.  In Ontario, the practice
is that counsel proceed in the order in which the accused are
named in the indictment unless they agree otherwise.
2 Paul Gibbs testified during Pennett&#146;s defence.  His evidence
was consistent with the suggestions put to Suzack by counsel for
Pennett.
3 I am assuming Suzack would have testified had he been tried
alone.  He had no defence absent his own evidence.
4 The defence sought to adduce two further statements made by
Pennett after he was advised of his Charter rights.  In my view,
neither had any possible probative value and were inadmissible
for that reason alone. They were also unconnected to the pre
arrest statement.</pre></td>
