    <pre><strong>On  appeal  from  the  conviction dated  November  24,  1997  and
sentence dated February 23, 1998 of Zimmerman J.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>GOUDGE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   On  November  24, 1997, His Honour Judge Zimmerman  of  the
Ontario  Court (Provincial Division) convicted the  appellant  of
conspiring to traffic in a narcotic and possession of a  narcotic
for  the  purpose of trafficking.  He subsequently sentenced  the
appellant  on each count to nine years imprisonment to be  served
concurrently.   The  appellant was  acquitted  of  conspiring  to
import a narcotic.
[2]  At the conclusion of his conviction appeal, this court
dismissed the appeal and indicated that its reasons would follow.
Several days later, the court, differently constituted, dismissed
his appeal from sentence.
[3]  The reasons for dismissing the conviction appeal are as
follows.
[4]  The appellant raised two issues.  First, he argued that the
two findings of guilt constitute unreasonable verdicts.  Second,
he argued that the wiretap evidence which was vital to the
Crown&#146;s case was admitted contrary to s.189(5)(a) of the Criminal
Code, R.S.C. 1986, c.C-46, because neither providing the accused
with a copy of the actual tapes nor with a transcribed
translation of the recorded conversations satisfies the
requirement of that paragraph.
[5]  The essence of the Crown&#146;s case was that the appellant had
participated in a scheme to import a shipment of heroin from
Thailand to Canada and to arrange its delivery to a destination
in Ontario for sale.  The appellant testified that he discovered
that the shipped package contained heroin only after it arrived
in Canada and thereafter sought to extricate himself from the
scheme but, fearing reprisal, did so in a way that would hide his
objective from the leader of the conspiracy.
[6]  The trial judge found that the evidence did not go far
enough to prove the appellant&#146;s knowledge of the contents of the
package prior to it entering Canada.  Thus he dismissed the
charge relating to importing.
[7]  The trial judge went on to conclude that, after learning
that the package contained heroin, the appellant went to view it
at the house where it was initially delivered and continued to
make arrangements for the onward forwarding of the package to its
ultimate recipient.  By doing so, he continued to participate in
the conspiracy.
[8]  Moreover, the trial judge found that in attending to view
the package and directing it onwards, the appellant exercised
control over it sufficient to constitute possession.
[9]  It is clear that the trial judge rejected the appellant&#146;s
assertions that he was only pretending to carry on with the
scheme to avoid reprisal and that he distanced himself from
physical contact with the package not to diminish the risk to
himself, but to escape the conspiracy.
[10] In my view, it was entirely open to the trial judge to
reject those parts of the appellant&#146;s evidence and to reach the
conclusions that he did.  Those conclusions are reasonably and
amply supported by the evidence.  They reflect no misapprehension
of that evidence.  This ground of appeal must fail.
[11] The appellant&#146;s second argument relates to s.189(5)(a) of
the Criminal Code.  It reads as follows:</pre>
    <pre>               The  contents of a private communication 
	  that is  obtained from an interception of the
	  private  communication   pursuant    to   any
	  provision of, or pursuant to an authorization
	  given under, this Part shall  not be received
	  in evidence  unless  the  party  intending to
	  adduce it has given to the accused reasonable
	  notice of the intention together with:</pre>
    <pre>                 (a)    a  transcript  of  the  private
          communication, where it will  be  adduced  in
          the  form  of  a  recording, or  a  statement
          setting  out  the  full  particulars  of  the
          private communication, where evidence of  the
          private  communication  will  be  given  viva
          voce&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[12]  In  this  case,  a  number of private  communications  were
intercepted   and  taped  pursuant  to  judicial   authorizations
provided to the police.  These communications were in the Chinese
language.   Prior  to trial, the Crown served  on  the  appellant
copies   of  the  audio  tapes  containing  the  actual   Chinese
communications and transcripts of the English translation of  the
intercepted  communications.  At trial,  the  Crown  proposed  to
prove the contents of these communications through the translator
giving   evidence   about   and   identifying   the   transcribed
translations which he had made.
[13] Following a voir dire, the trial judge ruled that the Crown
had satisfied the requirement of s.189(5)(a) by providing the
appellant with copies of the tapes.  He went on to hold that both
the tapes and the transcribed translations were admissible.
[14] On appeal, the appellant argued that s.189(5)(a) requires
provision of a written copy of the Chinese words used in the
conversation and that neither copies of the tapes themselves nor
a written translation of the conversations sufficed.
[15] In my view, the trial judge was correct to conclude that the
requirements of s.189(5)(a) were satisfied in this case.
[16] This section is not a penal provision of the Criminal Code.
Rather, it establishes a statutory rule of evidence that defines
a pre-condition for admissibility.  Thus, it must receive an
interpretation which best assures the attainment of its
objectives.  I agree with Bayda J.A. in R. v. Dunn et al. (1977)
36 C.C.C. (2d) 495 at 509 (Sask. C.A.) who said this when
speaking about the predecessor to this section:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>It was contended for the respondents that the 
enactment is penal in nature, thus warranting 
a strict interpretation.  In my respectful 
view, s.178.16(4)(a) is not a penal enactment.  
Its effect is simply to prescribe conditions 
which a party (either the prosecutor or the 
accused depending upon who desires the evidence 
adduced), must meet before an item of probative 
value may be received in evidence.  As such, it 
is an enactment which lays down a rule of 
evidence.  True, an application of it may lead 
to a penal consequence, but that is not 
sufficient to transform it into a penal 
enactment, justifying a strict interpretation.  
It seems to me that s.11 of the Interpretation 
Act, R.S.C. 1970, c.I-23, is relevant.  It 
directs that the enactment shall be given such 
fair, large, and liberal construction in 
interpretation as best insures the attachment 
of its objects.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[17]  The  purpose of s.189(5)(a) is to provide the accused  with
timely  disclosure of the evidence that may be  tendered  against
him to enable him to prepare his defence.
[18] The paragraph addresses two circumstances:  one, where the
evidence of the communication is to be adduced in the form of the
recording itself, in which case a transcript is to be served on
the accused; and the other where the evidence of the
communication is to be given viva voce, in which case the accused
must receive full particulars of the communication.
[19] In this case, where the evidence of the private
communication was to be given viva voce by the translator
identifying the transcribed translations he had made, service of
those translations satisfies the statutory requirement.  These
translations cover the entirety of the recorded communications.
They constitute &#147;a statement setting out full particulars of the
private communications&#148; as they are to be put in evidence.  The
legislative object is thus well met.
[20] While not necessary to meet the statutory pre-condition, it
can be said that where evidence of the private communications
will be given by means of a translation, the Crown&#146;s general
disclosure obligation would undoubtedly extend to the tapes
themselves that were in the Crown&#146;s possession.  This would allow
an accused to check the accuracy of the translation.
[21] In addition, it should be noted that an accused in these
circumstances who feels that the particulars supplied are
inadequate can move for further particulars pursuant to s.190 of
the Criminal Code.
[22] In argument, the court was referred to a number of cases
that have dealt with the issue of whether provision of a
transcribed translation of an intercepted communication in a
foreign language satisfies s.189(5)(a).  Some have said yes1 and
some have said no.2  The latter, however, all confine themselves
to a consideration of whether a translation can constitute a
&#147;transcript&#148; for the purposes of the subsection.  They therefore
do not speak to the case where, as here, the intercepted
communication is in a foreign language but evidence of it is to
be given viva voce by way of a translation.  In these
circumstances, as I have said, service of the transcribed
translation is sufficient.
[23] While not necessary to dispose of this appeal, one further
point perhaps deserves comment.  Much of the argument before us
addressed the meaning of &#147;transcript&#148; as it appears in
s.189(5)(a).  The case law is divided not only as to whether a
transcribed translation qualifies, but as to whether a copy of
the actual tape recording qualifies.
[24] This issue will arise where a private communication in a
foreign language has been intercepted and the Crown proposes to
adduce the tape recording itself.  In such a case where the
communication is reduced to written form in that foreign
language, this clearly constitutes a transcript service of which
satisfies the statutory pre-condition.
[25] In my view, service of a copy of the tape itself would also
constitute service of the transcript of the communications.  The
New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines &#147;transcript&#148; to
include a thing that has been transcribed, a written or printed
copy, and a copy or reproduction.  Indeed, given modern
technology, one can imagine communications consisting not of
words but solely of images.  Where there are no words to be
reduced to writing, provision of a copy would be essential.
Moreover, where the Crown intends to adduce the actual tape
recording, service of a copy of that tape best meets the
legislative objective of giving the accused full disclosure of
the case to be made against him.  Finally, while the case law is
divided, the preponderant view is that service of a copy of the
tape constitutes service of a transcript of the communication for
the purposes of the subsection.3
[26] However, I do not think the same is true where there is
service of a transcribed translation of the communications and
the evidence of the communication is to be given by adducing the
tape recording itself.  In those circumstances, I do not think
service of the transcribed translation alone would meet the
statutory pre-condition.  The definition of &#147;transcript&#148; cannot
be stretched to include &#147;translation&#148;.  Nor can service of the
translation meet the legislative objective of giving the accused
full disclosure of the evidence to be tendered against him where
that evidence consists of a foreign language tape recording.
[27] In this case, the Crown served the appellant with both a
copy of the actual tape recording and a transcribed translation.
Hence, pursuant to s.189(5)(a), the private communication could
have been proved either by adducing the recording or, as it was,
namely viva voce through the translator.  Since the statutory pre-
condition was clearly met here, this ground of appeal fails.
[28] For these reasons, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</pre>
