    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Rosenberg and

    <pre><strong>DOHERTY J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>				I</pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal is brought pursuant to leave granted by this
court on September 27, 1999.  The substantive issues raised in
the appeal have sparked divergent views in the courts below.  The
parties have, however, settled their dispute.  The appeal is
moot.  This is not a case in which the court should exercise its
discretion to hear the merits of the appeal despite the fact that
it is moot.</pre>
    <pre>				II</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The appellant, Tamil Co-operative Homes Inc. (the Co-
operative) is a non-profit housing co-operative founded in 1985
primarily to assist Tamil refugees in obtaining affordable
housing.  The Co-operative owns an apartment building and persons
residing in the building are members of the Co-operative.  The
relationship between the Co-operative and its members is governed
by the provisions of the Co-operative Corporations Act, R.S.O.
1990 c. C.35, as amended by S.O. 1992, c. 19 (the Act) and the by-
laws of the Co-operative.  The respondent, Ms. Arulappah, was a
member of the Co-operative and occupied a unit in the building
owned by the Co-operative from 1988 until the spring of 1994.
[3]  In April 1994, the Board of Directors voted to terminate the
membership and occupancy rights of Ms. Arulappah effective May
20, 1994.  In June 1994, the Co-operative obtained a default
judgment declaring that Ms. Arulappah&#146;s membership and occupancy
rights were terminated and directing that a writ of possession
issue.  On March 16, 1995, an order was made by Pitt J. setting
aside the default judgment and directing that the application be
heard on its merits.  The application was heard over 4 days by
Molloy J. in June and July of 1995.  In a judgment dated March 6,
1996, she ruled in favour of the Co-operative and declared Ms.
Arulappah&#146;s membership and occupancy rights terminated. She also
held that the Co-operative was entitled to possession of the unit
formerly occupied by Ms. Arulappah.
[4]  In so holding, Molloy J. found that s. 171.13(12) of the Act
contemplated a reasonableness standard of review of the Board of
Directors&#146; decision to terminate membership and occupancy rights.
In addition, Molloy J. refused to exercise her discretion under
s. 171.21(1)(a) of the Act which provides that the court may
refuse to grant an application for possession where it would &#147;be
unfair to grant it.&#148;
[5]  Ms. Arulappah appealed to the Divisional Court.  For some
unexplained reason, her appeal was not perfected until August
1998.  By the time the appeal came on for oral argument in the
Divisional Court in February 1999, the Co-operative and Ms.
Arulappah had settled their dispute.  In executed minutes of
settlement, Ms. Arulappah abandoned any claim to membership in
the Co-operative and any claim to occupy the unit in the
building.  In the minutes of settlement, both parties agreed that
the appeal should proceed &#147;in the discretion of the court&#148; and
that there would be no order as to costs.
[6]  The parties made full disclosure of the settlement to the
Divisional Court.  They submitted, however, that the court should
hear the merits of the appeal.  Counsel advised the court that
the standard of review called for by s. 171.13(12) of the Act and
the ambit of the discretion described in s. 171.21(1)(a) of the
Act were significant issues that had not been addressed at the
appellate level since the Act was amended in 1992.
[7]  Both the majority (per Rosenberg J.) and the dissent
(Cumming J.) in the Divisional Court acknowledged that the
dispute between the parties was moot.  Both proceeded to address
the merits of the appeal describing the issues as &#147;important&#148; and
&#147;unique.&#148;
[8]  The appeal in the Divisional Court proceeded on the basis
that the Co-operative had reasonable grounds for reaching the
decision it did, but that the facts on which the Board relied
were incorrect.  This was the conclusion reached by Molloy J.
While both parties indicated a willingness to have the appeal
heard in the Divisional Court on the basis of the two factual
assumptions outlined above, it is clear from the facta filed in
this court that neither party accepts either assumption as
accurate.
[9]  Ms. Arulappah&#146;s position prevailed with the majority in the
Divisional Court.  Rosenberg J. held that s. 178.13(12) of the
Act required that the court determine whether the grounds for
eviction were established.  In his view, it was inappropriate to
speak in terms of deference to the decision of the Board of
Directors.  Rosenberg J. further held that Molloy J. should have
exercised her discretion under s. 171.21(1)(a) of the Act and
refused to grant an order of possession.  In coming to that
conclusion, Rosenberg J. relied on facts which were in dispute.
[10] Cumming J., in dissent, agreed with the standard of review
applied by Molloy J.  He did not address the scope of the
discretion provided for in s. 171.21(1)(a) of the Act.
[11] The Co-operative sought leave to appeal.  In the leave
material, it was made clear that the dispute between the parties
had been settled.  Ms. Arulappah opposed leave, but did not rely
on the mootness of the appeal as a basis for that opposition.
[12] Neither party addressed the mootness issue in their facta
filed in this court.  At the outset of oral argument, the court
confirmed with counsel that there was no ongoing dispute between
the parties and advised counsel that it wished to hear
submissions on the propriety of addressing the merits of a moot
appeal.  Counsel were granted a two-day adjournment to prepare
their submissions.  Both argued that the court should hear the
appeal.  At the conclusion of oral argument, the court advised
counsel that it would not hear the merits of the appeal and that
reasons would follow.</pre>
    <pre>				III</pre>
    <pre>[13] Courts exist to resolve real disputes between parties and
not to provide opinions in response to hypothetical or academic
problems.  Courts will, however, on occasion address the merits
of an appeal even where the dispute giving rise to the appeal has
dissolved.  Where a question of mootness is raised, the court
must first decide whether the appeal is moot.  If the appeal is
moot, the court must then decide whether it should nonetheless
hear the merits of the appeal.  The discretion to hear a moot
appeal is intended to address those exceptional cases where the
circumstances are such that the general rule against hearing
appeals where there is no live controversy between the parties
should not be followed: Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General)
(1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 9 (S.C.C.);  New Brunswick (Minister
of Health and Community Services) v. G.(J.), [1999] 3 S.C.R. 46;
M. v. H., [1999] 2 S.C.R. 3 at 44-45.
[14] In Borowski, supra, at p. 9, Sopinka J. defined mootness in
these terms:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; Accordingly if, subsequent to the initiation of the 
action or proceeding, events occur which affect the 
relationship of the parties so that no present live 
controversy exists which affects the rights of the 
parties, the case is said to be moot. &#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[15] Counsel for the Co-operative argued that the dispute was not
entirely moot from his Co-operative&#146;s point of view in that a
pronouncement by the court would be relevant in any potential
future litigation in which the Co-operative sought an order under
the Act terminating membership and occupancy rights.  The mere
fact that a party may at some future time resort to the same
process which is the subject of the proceedings before the court
does not give that party a direct or indirect interest in the
litigation so as to give continued life to the controversy which
precipitated the litigation.1
[16] I do not think there could be a clearer example of mootness
than this case.  The dispute between the parties has been settled
by minutes of settlement.  Neither party now has anything to gain
or lose directly or indirectly from this litigation.  Counsel for
Ms. Arulappah frankly acknowledged that she had no greater or
lesser interest in the outcome of this appeal than would anyone
else who happened to have a interest in the operation of the Act.
The parties remain adversarial only in the sense that they take
different positions on the legal issues raised before the courts
below.  They are aptly described as opposing debaters taking
affirmative and negative positions on legal propositions and not
as litigants opposed in interest in an ongoing legal controversy.
The appeal is moot.</pre>
    <pre><strong>				</strong>IV</pre>
    <pre>[17] Having concluded, as did the Divisional Court, that the
appeal is moot, I turn to the second stage of the analysis &#150;
should the court nonetheless hear the appeal?  At this stage of
the analysis, the onus rests on the party or parties seeking a
determination on the merits to demonstrate why the court should
depart from its usual practice of refusing to hear moot appeals.
In Borowski, supra, Sopinka J. dealt at length with several of
the factors to be considered in determining whether to hear a
moot appeal.  He was, however, careful to observe that the
court&#146;s exercise of its discretion to hear moot appeals could not
be fettered by the rigid application of pre-established criteria.
He noted that the discretion had to be exercised with a view to
the circumstances of each case and with careful regard to the
&#147;usual&#148; practice of declining to decide the merits of moot
appeals.  He said, at p. 13:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>In formulating guidelines for the exercise of discretion 
in departing from a usual practice, it is instructive to 
examine its underlying rationalia.  To the extent that a 
particular foundation for the practice is either absent 
or its presence tenuous, the reason for its enforcement 
disappears or diminishes.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[18] The Divisional Court decided to hear the appeal for two
reasons. First, it viewed the appeal as presenting a &#147;unique
opportunity&#148; to address the standard of review issue.  Second, it
agreed with the parties&#146; that the issues raised were important
and warranted appellate consideration.
[19] The uniqueness referred to by the Divisional Court flowed
from the finding of Molloy J. that the Co-operative&#146;s decision
was reasonable but wrong on the facts as she found them to be.
That finding made the determination of the applicable standard of
review crucial to the outcome of the proceedings before Molloy J.
It did not, however, give the question of the applicable standard
of review any uniqueness.  The determination of the standard of
review to be applied on an application under s. 171.13(12) of the
Act must be made in every application brought under that section.
I see no reason to think that the standard of review issue would
not present itself for determination on appeal in a case in which
there was still a real dispute between the parties.
[20] The standard of review is not an issue which is &#147;evasive of
review&#148; in the sense that it is not amenable to judicial scrutiny
through the normal litigation process:  New Brunswick (Minister
of Health and Community Services) v. G.(J.), supra, at 71-72.
Where a legal issue raised in a moot appeal is one which will
recur in the normal flow of litigation involving live disputes
between parties, it is best to determine that issue in a genuine
adversarial context:  Borowski, supra, at 15;  St. Louis v.
Feleki (1993), 107 D.L.R. (4th) 767 (Ont. Div. Ct.).
[21] Nor can it be suggested that the scope of the discretion
granted to a court under s.171.21(1)(a) raises a unique question.
I do not understand the Divisional Court to have suggested
otherwise.
[22] With respect to the contrary view, I see nothing unique in
the legal issues raised before the Divisional Court which
justified hearing a moot appeal.
[23] The Divisional Court also decided to hear the appeal because
it regarded the standard of review issue as an important one.  I
agree that the issue is important in the sense that it must be
addressed on all applications brought under s. 171.13 of the Act.
In some situations, it will be determinative of the application.
[24] The importance of a legal issue raised in a proceeding is a
relevant consideration in determining whether a court should hear
a moot appeal.  It is not, however, determinative.  There are an
almost infinite number of important legal issues lurking in the
myriad of rules and regulations governing the citizenry upon
which those interested in the issue would appreciate the opinion
of an appellate court.  If the importance of a legal issue is
enough to overcome concerns associated with hearing moot appeals,
the doctrine has little value.  It means no more than that the
court should not waste its time and resources deciding
unimportant legal issues in cases where there is no longer a live
dispute between the parties.  This would seem self-evident.2
[25] The importance of the legal issue raised when considered in
the context of the exercise of the discretion to hear moot
appeals must be measured by reference to the public importance of
the legal issue.  As Sopinka J. said in Borowski, supra, at 15:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>There also exists a rather ill-defined basis for justifying
the deployment of judicial resources in cases which raise 
an issue of public importance of which a resolution is in 
the public interest.  The economics of judicial involvement 
are weighed against the social cost of continued uncertainty 
in the law [citations omitted]. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[26] A review of the cases in which the Supreme Court of Canada
has heard moot appeals demonstrates that there was a strong
public interest in the resolution of the issues raised in those
cases.  The issues involved questions of broad social and
constitutional importance.  Furthermore, the parties to the
appeals (including various levels of government and other
interveners) and the record before the court ensured that the
court was in a position to make a fully informed decision on the
broad issues raised in those appeals:  see M. v. H., supra.
[27] This appeal has none of the characteristics associated with
public interest litigation.  The only parties to the proceedings,
the Co-operative and Ms. Arulappah, are private litigants with no
claim to represent any interest beyond their own.  Nor does the
record go beyond the specifics of the dispute between the Co-
operative and Ms. Arulappah.  Stripped to its essentials, this is
a case that began as a routine piece of private litigation and,
like many pieces of private litigation, it was settled in the
course of the proceedings.  Subsequent to that settlement, at the
instigation of the parties, it took on the appearance of a
reference to the Divisional Court based on hypothetical facts.
The reference process is, of course, not available to private
litigants.
[28] There is nothing in this record to support the contention
that the standard of review issue raised broad questions of
significant social importance so as to warrant its resolution
despite the mootness of the appeal.  Nor can it be said that the
scope of the discretion granted under s. 171.21(1)(a) of the Act
raised a question of general public importance.
[29] Counsel submitted that this court should take a pragmatic
approach when determining whether to hear the merits of the
appeal.  They argued that considerations of judicial economy now
favour a hearing of the appeal on the merits even if those same
concerns spoke against hearing the appeal on the merits in the
Divisional Court.  Counsel observed that considerable time and
effort have been expended by the parties and by the judiciary to
bring the case to this stage.  They contend that those efforts
will be wasted, at least to some extent, if this court now
declines to hear the merits of the appeal.  It is their position
that a definitive resolution of the issues raised by this appeal
by the province&#146;s highest court is worth the modest additional
expenditure of judicial resources that would be required.
[30] A similar argument was made and rejected in Borowski, supra.
In that case, the appeal became moot after leave to appeal had
been granted by the Supreme Court of Canada.  It was argued that
the substantial efforts put into the case before it became moot
would be wasted if the Supreme Court of Canada did not hear the
merits of the appeal.  In rejecting this argument, Sopinka J.
said, at p. 17:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>&#133; To give effect to this argument would emasculate the
mootness doctrine which by definition applies if at any 
stage the foundation for the action disappears. &#133;</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[31] Like Sopinka J., I do not think that the need to promote the
efficient use of judicial resources can be approached on an ad
hoc basis.  It is not simply a question of the judicial resources
needed to dispose of the particular appeal.  The question must be
whether the case should have been permitted to continue to absorb
judicial resources once it became moot.  That question must be
answered having regard not only to the specific case, but also to
similar cases which would have an equal demand on the resources
of the court.  As this appeal was moot before the Divisional
Court heard the appeal, this court should hear the merits of the
appeal only if it is satisfied that the Divisional Court could,
in the proper exercise of its discretion, have heard the appeal.
If the Divisional Court should not have heard the appeal, its
failure to properly exercise its discretion cannot become an
argument in favour of this court hearing the merits of the
appeal.
[32] Nor does the fact that this court granted leave to appeal
speak in favour of hearing the merits of the appeal.  The
granting of leave by one panel cannot bind or limit the powers of
the panel hearing the actual appeal.  This is particularly true
here where the issue of mootness was not raised on the leave to
appeal application.
[33] The parties also argue that judicial economy would be
promoted by hearing the appeal on the merits in that it would
foreclose litigation on these legal issues in subsequent cases.
I cannot agree.  The question of the scope of the discretion
provided for in s. 171.21(1)(a) of the Act could not be addressed
effectively in a factual vacuum.  This is perhaps why Cumming J.
did not address the issue in dissent and why Ms. Arulappah in
this court takes the position that the majority should not have
considered that issue.  Judicial discretion must respond to
specific circumstances.  Any attempts to describe discretion in a
factual vacuum will provide little or no guidance to those
required to apply that discretion in subsequent cases.
[34] The Divisional Court&#146;s resolution of the standard of review
issue is similarly of limited value in resolving future cases.
Section 171.13(12) does not articulate a standard of review.  The
determination of the operative standard of review is as much an
exercise in judicial self-discipline as it is an exercise in
statutory interpretation.  As Campbell J. observed in Ryegate
(Tecumseh) Co-operative Homes Inc. v. Dale Stallard, supra, at
para. 36, the standard of review will vary depending upon the
issues raised.    It is impossible, in my view, to hold that s.
171.13(12) of the Act creates a single standard of review
applicable to each and every challenge made to a Board of
Directors&#146; decision to terminate membership and occupancy rights.
Far from avoiding further litigation, it seems to me that the
decision of the Divisional Court will inspire further litigation
in which the broad language of that decision will be parsed and
crafted to fit the specific circumstances of subsequent cases.
Ryegate (Tecumseh) Co-operatives Homes Inc. v. Dale Stallard,
supra, indicates that the case-by-case interpretative process is
already underway.</pre>
    <pre>				V</pre>
    <pre>[35] The factors relied on by the Divisional Court in its
determination to hear the appeal despite its mootness do not
provide a proper basis upon which it could exercise its
discretion in favour of hearing a moot appeal.  The factors
relevant to the exercise of that discretion do not warrant the
departure from the usual practice whereby courts will not hear
moot appeals.  The Divisional Court should have dismissed the
appeal as moot.  Section 134(1)(a) of the Courts of Justice Act,
R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 provides that this court may:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>make any order or decision that ought to or could have 
been made by the court or tribunal appealed from.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[36] Under that authority, I would set aside the order of the
Divisional Court and make an order dismissing the appeal as moot.
I would make no order as to costs.

* Reported at (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 120
1 Ryegate (Tecumseh) Co-operative Homes Inc. v. Dale Stallard,
released April 4, 2000 (Ont. Sup. Ct. (Div. Ct.)) provides an
example of a case where it could be said that the appeal was not
moot even though the specific issues of possession and membership
in the Co-operative were no longer an issue.  In that case, the
trial judge had held that certain by-laws of the Co-operative
were unreasonable.  The Co-operative had an interest in
challenging and reversing that ruling apart entirely from the
specific dispute between the Co-operative and Mr. Stallard.
2 There is a second reason, applicable to cases like this where
leave to appeal is needed, why the importance of a legal issue
cannot, standing alone, justify the hearing of a moot appeal.
This court will grant leave to appeal from decisions made by the
Divisional Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction
only in cases where the issues raised have importance beyond a
particular case:  Sault Dock Co. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City),
[1973] 2 O.R. 479 (C.A.).  If the importance of an issue alone is
enough to justify the hearing of a moot appeal, then moot appeals
which require leave are in no different position than other
appeals requiring leave:  Borowski, supra, at 16.</pre></td>
