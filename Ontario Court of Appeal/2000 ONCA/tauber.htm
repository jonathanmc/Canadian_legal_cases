</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice Jennings dated
February 17, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</strong>
[1]  This is an exceptional case.  The principal issue concerns
the child support to be paid by a support payer under the Federal
Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines). This case was tried
following the decision of this court in Francis v. Baker (1998),
38 O.R. (3d) 481, but before the Supreme Court of Canada decision
in Francis v. Baker, [1999]  3 S.C.R. 250.  As a result, the
trial judge, Jennings J., considered that he was bound to order
at least the amount set out in the Table, which he calculated to
be $17,000 per month.  As the law stood at the time of the trial,
the trial judge was not entitled to reduce the amount of child
support below the Table amount, although he clearly considered
that this amount was excessive.  The Supreme Court of Canada has
now interpreted the relevant provisions to permit a judge to
reduce the child support below the Table amount if the income of
the paying spouse is over $150,000 and if the Table amount is
inappropriate.  This court is now called upon to consider
whether, in light of the Supreme Court decision, the child
support in this case should be reduced below the Table amount.
We are also required to deal with the important question of costs
in cases where the wealthy support payer refuses to pay the Table
amount and seeks to litigate the issue.
[2]  I have said that this case is exceptional because it
concerns not simply a payer spouse whose income exceeds $150,000,
but a spouse whose income vastly exceeds that amount.  Depending
on the method of calculation, the husband&#146;s annual income falls
somewhere between $2.5 and $5 million.  Such cases raise their
own special concerns for child support, spousal support and
costs.  My reasons should be read in that light.  They will have
limited application to cases where the income of the payer spouse
is closer to the $150,000 mark.
[3]  The parties have also raised several other issues including
spousal support, joint custody and the disposition of a wedding
gift.
[4]  For the reasons that follow, I would allow the husband&#146;s
appeal and order a new trial on the issue of child support.  I
would allow the wife&#146;s cross-appeal with respect to spousal
support and order a new trial on that issue.  I would dismiss the
husband&#146;s appeal with respect to custody and the wedding gift.  I
would grant the wife leave to appeal the costs order, allow the
wife&#146;s cross-appeal and order that the husband pay 80% of the
wife&#146;s costs of the trial.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[5]  The wife and husband are 37 and 46 years of age
respectively.  They began living together in April 1996 and
married in May 1996.  This was the wife&#146;s first marriage and the
husband&#146;s second marriage.  They had no other dependants.  Prior
to the marriage, they entered into a marriage contract.  Their
only child, a son, was born in August 1997 and is therefore not
quite three years of age.  The parents separated in December
1997, when the child was less than five months old.  The mother
and child moved out of the matrimonial home in May 1998 and in
accordance with the marriage contract the husband paid the wife
$100,000.  During the marriage, the husband gave the wife a motor
vehicle, works of art and jewellery, which were worth about
$100,000 at the time and $60,000 at the time of the trial.  The
husband&#146;s parents also gave the couple a $36,000 cheque as a
wedding gift.  Unbeknownst to the wife, the husband never cashed
the cheque.
[6]  The husband is the sole owner of the shares of Ever-Reddy
Duplicating Service Inc.  The company is very successful,
grossing $10 million in 1998.  The husband has worked very hard
at establishing his business and he has become wealthy through
his ownership of the company.  While there was a dispute between
the parties as to the income he earned from the company, it was
somewhere between $2.5 and $5 million annually.
[7]  Prior to the marriage, the wife worked as a wardrobe and
photo stylist. In her best year, which was just prior to the
marriage, she earned somewhere between $45,000 and $50,000 from
her employment.  It had taken her many years to reach this level
of income.  This occupation is said to be highly competitive.
She is required to be available on short notice and to work long
and erratic hours.  It is a difficult occupation for a single
parent with custody of a small child, even with child care
assistance.  Following the marriage, the wife reduced her work
due to the demands of the relationship.  This seems to have been
in accordance with both their wishes.  After she became pregnant,
the mother took time off from work and only returned to part-time
work after the birth of her son.  While the record is not
entirely clear on this issue, the wife seems to have earned very
little from her occupation after the marriage.  She had hoped to
return to school to upgrade her training to become an interior
designer, but was unable to do so following the separation.
[8]  The husband presently lives alone in a home valued at
approximately $2.4 million, he owns several luxury cars and has
an art collection worth about $1.4 million.  At the time of
trial, he had money on deposit in the bank of approximately $2.5
million.  The wife lives in much more modest, albeit comfortable,
accommodations.  The child resides with her and the husband has
generous access.  Both parties employ nannies to assist in the
care of the child.  The wife also has access to babysitting
services.
[9]  The wife instituted her petition for divorce and collateral
relief in January 1998.  The trial took place over five days in
February 1999.  The trial judge reserved his judgment and
released his reasons (now reported at 43 O.R. (3d) 42) on
February 17, 1999, with supplementary reasons on costs released
on March 10, 1999.
[10] On March 8, 1999, the husband applied to Laskin J.A. for a
partial stay pending appeal of the order for child support.  In
reasons reported at 49 R.F.L. (4th) 429, Laskin J.A. ordered that
the husband continue to make monthly payments of $11,000 to the
wife for child support and that the balance of $6,000 be paid
monthly into an interest-bearing trust account.  Laskin J.A.
reserved the costs of the motion to the panel hearing the appeal.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE TRIAL JUDGE&#146;S REASONS</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>     Child Support</strong></pre>
    <pre>[11] The husband conceded that the child should continue to
reside with his wife.  She sought an order for child support
against her husband.  Since his income exceeds $150,000, child
support was to be determined in accordance with s. 4 of the
Guidelines.  That section provides as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>4. Where the income of the spouse against whom a 
child support order is sought is over $150,000, 
the amount of a child support order is</pre>
        <pre>  (a)  the amount determined under section 3; or
  (b)  if the courts considers that amount to be
inappropriate,</pre>
        <pre>       (i)  in respect of the first $150,000 of 
the spouse's income, the amount set out in the 
applicable table for the number of children under 
the age of majority to whom the order relates;</pre>
        <pre>       (ii) in respect of the balance of the 
spouse's income, the amount that the court 
considers appropriate, having regard to the 
condition, means, needs and other circumstances 
of the children who are entitled to support and 
the financial ability of each spouse to contribute 
to the support of the children; and</pre>
        <pre>       (iii) the amount, if any, determined under 
section 7.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12] The husband argued that the amount determined under section
3 (the Table amount) was &#147;inappropriate&#148; and that the judge
should therefore determine the amount of child support in
accordance with s. 4(b).  The trial judge found that the
husband&#146;s income was $2.5 million for the purposes of s. 3 and
that accordingly the Table amount would be $17,000.
[13] This case was tried in February 1999.  As I have indicated,
at the time the law in this province concerning the
interpretation of s. 4(b) was set out in this court&#146;s decision in
Francis v. Baker.  In that decision, the court held that the
Table amounts could only be reduced in narrow circumstances, none
of which applied in the Francis case nor in this case.1  The term
&#147;inappropriate&#148; in s. 4(b) was interpreted as meaning
&#147;inadequate&#148; and thus permitting an increase beyond the amounts
dictated by s. 3, but not a decrease.
[14] The trial judge rightly held that he was bound by this
decision although he considered that it produced a &quot;startling&quot;
result.  Based on the evidence presented, he found that the
wife&#146;s household would be entirely supported by the child support
payments.  The trial judge did not consider this a sensible
result, but, as I said, he was bound by this court&#146;s decision and
he ordered the husband to pay child support in the amount of
$17,000.  In view of this order, there were no s. 7 requirements
to be met.2<strong>     </strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>     Custody and Access</strong></pre>
    <pre>[15] While the husband agreed that the child should principally
reside with his mother, he sought joint custody.  The wife
opposed joint custody.  The trial judge held that this was not a
case for joint custody, giving these reasons:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Joint custody, which is rarely imposed without 
consent, requires a mutual commitment between 
parents to cooperate fully on all matters 
pertaining to the nurturing of their child, and an
ability for the parents to put their own interests 
behind those of the child.  It of necessity 
requires that each parent trust the other and be 
able to communicate fully, freely, and easily with 
the other.  Sadly, I have no confidence that at the 
present time these parents can deal with each other 
in the manner required of joint custodians.          
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[16] The appellant submits that the trial judge took an unduly
conservative approach to joint custody.  He pointed out that
courts have begun to impose joint custody on the parties in the
absence of consent.  He submits that much of the acrimony and
lack of communication was a product of the litigation.  He points
out that both parties are intelligent and should be able to
properly reach decisions in the best interests of the child.  At
the conclusion of oral argument the court indicated to counsel
for the wife that we did not need to hear submissions from her on
this aspect of the appeal.
[17] The experienced trial judge was in the best position to make
the determination about joint custody.  He had heard both parties
testify.  He recognized that in a proper case he could impose
joint custody although the wife was opposed to such an order.  We
have not been persuaded that the trial judge made any error.
[18] At the time of trial, the husband enjoyed generous access.
There was a dispute about access at trial, concerned primarily
with when overnight access should commence.  The trial judge
resolved that matter somewhat more in favour of the husband.
Access is not an issue on the appeal. </pre>
    <pre><strong>     Spousal Support</strong></pre>
    <pre>[19] In her petition, the wife sought spousal support for life.
At trial, she modified that claim and requested spousal support
until her child reached the age of six years.  The trial judge
found that she was an intelligent, articulate person and, on the
evidence, a person of considerable talent.  He found that prior
to the marriage she had earned approximately $50,000.  Under the
marriage contract she received $100,000 and during the marriage
received personal property of a value of $100,000.  She had
received spousal support from the husband for fifteen months
after the separation.  The trial judge concluded that this was
not a case for spousal support:</pre>
    <pre>
          I have no doubt that should she choose to do 
	  so she can move smoothly and quickly back 
	  into her chosen profession, from which she 
	  has been separated for only a very little 
	  while, on a full-time basis.

          I can find no economic disadvantage
          suffered by her as a result of this very
          brief marriage.  On the evidence, her capital
          position improved significantly because of it
          and her standard of living is clearly
          superior now, a year and a half post
          separation, than to what it was prior to
          marriage.</pre>
    <pre>[20] On appeal, the wife cross-appeals from this part of the
judgement only if the husband is successful in his appeal to
reduce the amount of child support.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     The Wedding Gift</strong></pre>
    <pre>[21] The parties received a wedding gift from the husband&#146;s
parents in the form of a cheque for $36,000 payable to their
joint order.  The husband put the cheque away for safekeeping and
forgot about it.  The wife assumed it had been cashed and that
the proceeds had been used to purchase a particular work of art.
The cheque could no longer be negotiated at the time of the
trial. The trial judge held that all of the requirements for a
valid gift had been fulfilled and the wife was therefore entitled
to her half of the proceeds.
[22] On the appeal, the husband repeated the arguments made to
the trial judge.  The wife was not called upon to respond to this
part of the appeal.  We agree with the reasons of the trial
judge.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     Costs</strong></pre>
    <pre>[23] After the trial, Jennings J. invited the parties to make
submissions on costs.  He reviewed the offers to settle that had
been submitted by the parties and concluded that none of them
fell within Rule 49.  In his view, a trial was inevitable because
of the husband&#146;s position on child support and the wife&#146;s claim
for lifetime support.  He then considered the relative degree of
success and the amounts of trial time taken on the issues in
dispute.  He concluded that success was, at best, divided and
that accordingly there be no costs.
[24] The wife cross-appeals against the order of costs.  She
submitted that the husband should be ordered to pay her costs of
the trial on a solicitor and client basis.  The husband supports
the trial judge&#146;s order and also indicated that he was not
seeking costs even if he should be successful in upsetting the
trial judgment on child support.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE ISSUES</strong></pre>
    <pre>[25] The remaining issues for determination on appeal are the
following:
     </pre>
    <pre>   <strong>  Child Support</strong>
          (i)   Is the Table amount of child support
          &#147;inappropriate&#148; within the meaning of s. 4(b)
	  of the Guidelines?

          (ii)  If so, should this court set the
          appropriate amount or order a new hearing in
          the trial court?

          (iii) If a new hearing is required should the
  	  court order a new trial or remit the matter
	  to Jennings J.?
     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     Spousal Support
</strong>          (i)  Did the trial judge err in failing to order
          spousal support?

          (ii) If so, should this court or the
          trial court determine the amount of spousal
          support?
     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     Costs
</strong>          (i)  Did the trial judge err in failing to order
	  that the husband pay the wife&#146;s costs of the trial?
</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES     </strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>     Child Support</strong></pre>
    <pre>[26] The husband submitted that the trial judge clearly
considered that the Table amount was &#147;inappropriate&#148; as that term
has been interpreted by the Supreme Court of Canada and, had he
been free to do so, the trial judge would have set an amount well
below $17,000.  He submitted that this court should therefore
allow the appeal and remit the matter of child support to
Jennings J.
[27] The wife submitted that the husband has not rebutted the
presumption that the Table amount is appropriate and the appeal
should be dismissed.  Alternatively, she submitted that this
court should set the amount of child support or the matter should
be sent for a new hearing before a different judge.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     Spousal Support</strong></pre>
    <pre>[28] As indicated, if this court allows the husband&#146;s appeal on
child support, the wife asked that this court make an award for
spousal support.  She submitted that the trial judge refused to
order spousal support because he already considered the award for
child support to be inordinately high.  She argued that, in any
event, the trial judge misapprehended the evidence concerning
spousal support and erred in only considering one of the
statutory factors set out in s. 15.2(6).  She submitted that the
combination of spousal and child support should total $18,000.
[29] The husband supported the trial judge&#146;s decision that there
should be no award for spousal support.  He pointed out that had
the trial judge reduced the amount of spousal support because of
the child support order he was required to give reasons for that
decision in accordance with s. 15.3(2) of the Divorce Act.3     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     Costs</strong></pre>
    <pre>[30] The wife submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to
require that the husband pay her costs.  She argued that even if
the offers to settle did not fall within Rule 49, her offer was
more realistic.  She also submitted that, contrary to the finding
of the trial judge, she achieved substantial success at the trial
and that the actions of the husband, particularly his insistence
on litigating the Francis v. Baker issue, prolonged the
litigation.  Finally, she relied on the fact that the husband
clearly has the ability to pay the costs of the litigation and
she does not, short of using the lump sum provided for in the
marriage contract.
[31] The husband supported the trial judge&#146;s decision on costs.
He submitted that the trial judge properly found that the offers
did not fall within Rule 49 and that success at trial was
divided.  As to ability to pay, he argued that the $100,000 lump
sum from the marriage contract was his wife&#146;s to use as she
pleased, including litigating.</pre>
    <pre><strong>ANALYSIS     </strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>     Child Support</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>          (i)  Was the Table amount inappropriate?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[32] It is apparent from his reasons that the trial judge was of
the view that the Table amount of child support  was
inappropriate.    However, I agree with  the respondent  that
this is not conclusive of the issue before this court.  The trial
judge did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court of Canada
decision in Francis v. Baker, nor this court&#146;s decision in Simon
v. Simon (1999),  46 O.R. (3d) 349.
[33] The scheme under s. 4, which applies where the income of the
payer spouse exceeds $150,000, is to give the court two ways of
calculating child support.  Under s. 4(a), the judge can order
the Table amount in accordance with s. 3.  In Ontario, for one
child, the monthly award is $1,108 plus 0.67% of the income of
the payer spouse that exceeds $150,000.  Assuming the husband&#146;s
income in this case to be $2.5 million annually, this formula
produces the monthly amount of approximately $17,000, which is
about 8% of the husband&#146;s income.
[34] If the judge considers the Table amount to be inappropriate,
the judge must make an award that is the total of</pre>
    <pre>          (i) at least the Table amount for the first 
	  $150,000, i.e.  $1,108, (s. 4(b)(i)),

          (ii) in respect of the balance of the
          spouse&#146;s income the amount the court
          considers appropriate (s. 4(b)(ii)), and
          
          (iii) the amount determined under s. 7
          (s. 4(b)(iii)).</pre>
    <pre>[35] While it is now clear from the Supreme Court of Canada
decision in Francis v. Baker that &#147;inappropriate&#148; in s. 4(b)
means &#147;unsuitable&#148;, rather than &#147;inadequate&#148;, there is still a
presumption in favour of the Table amount.  Bastarache J.
explained this presumption as follows at pp. 272-74:</pre>
    <pre>          For that portion of the paying parent's income 
	  over $150,000, the strict Guidelines amount is 
	  immediately open to review; under s. 4(b)(ii) 
	  any amount attributable to income above the 
	  $150,000 threshold can be reduced or increased 
	  by a court if it is of the opinion that the amount 
	  is inappropriate having regard to the condition, 
	  means, needs and other circumstances of the children, 
	  and the financial abilities of the spouses.
          Nevertheless, based on the ordinary meaning of the 
	  provision, its context in the overall child support 
	  scheme, and the purposes of the Guidelines, I find 
	  that in all cases Parliament intended that there be 
	  a presumption in favour of the Table amounts. I agree
          with Abella J.A. that the words &quot;Presumptive Rule&quot; 
	  found in the marginal note beside s. 3 of the 
	  Guidelines are relevant in this regard. Accordingly, 
	  the Guideline figures can only be increased
          or reduced under s. 4 if the party seeking such a 
	  deviation has rebutted the presumption that the 
	  applicable Table amount is appropriate. Counsel for 
	  the appellant conceded this point in oral argument.

          [43] The recognition of a presumption in
          favour of the Guideline figures does not
          compel a party seeking a deviation from this
          amount to testify or call evidence. No
          unfavourable conclusions should be drawn from
          this decision. Indeed, in some cases, such a
          party may not be able to provide relevant
          evidence. Parties seeking deviations from the
          Table amounts may simply choose to question
          the evidence of the opposing party. Whatever
          tactics are used, the evidence in its
          entirety must be sufficient to raise a
          concern that the applicable Table amount is
          inappropriate. To this end, I agree with
          Lysyk J. of the British Columbia Supreme
          Court in Shiels v. Shiels, [1997] B.C.J. No.
          1924 (QL), at para. 27, that there must be
          &quot;clear and compelling evidence&quot; for departing
          from the Guideline figures.

          [44] While there must be an &quot;articulable
          reason&quot; for displacing the Guideline figures
          (see, for example, Plester v. Plester (1998),
          56 B.C.L.R. (3d) 352 (S.C.), at para. 153),
          relevant factors will, of course, differ from
          case to case. I note, however, my agreement
          with MacKenzie J. in Plester, supra, as well
          as Cameron J.A. in Dergousoff, supra, that
          the factors relevant to determining
          appropriateness which Parliament expressly
          listed in s. 4(b)(ii), that is, the
          condition, means, needs and other
          circumstances of the children, and the
          financial abilities of both spouses, are
          likewise relevant to the initial
          determination of inappropriateness. Only
          after examining all of the circumstances of
          the case, including the factors expressly
          listed in s. 4(b)(ii), should courts find
          Table amounts to be inappropriate and craft
          more suitable child support awards.
          [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[36] Thus, in Francis v. Baker, although the Supreme Court held
that the court can reduce the award below the Table amount where
the income of the paying spouse exceeds $150,000, it nevertheless
held that the Table amount was appropriate.  The Table amount for
the two children of the marriage in Francis v. Baker was $10,034.
Similarly, in Simon v. Simon, this court held that the husband
had not rebutted the presumption, although the Table amount for
support of the single young child was $9,215.  In these cases
dealing with a wealthy paying spouse, each case will turn on its
facts and particularly whether the paying spouse has been able to
rebut the presumption.
[37] In my view, the husband has rebutted the presumption that
the Table amount was appropriate and he is entitled to an
assessment under s. 4(b)(ii).  The husband called a forensic
accountant to testify about a child expense budget.  That budget
of approximately $5,000 monthly was subject to a number of
shortcomings.  It was based upon limited information and on
certain assumptions about the attribution of some of the common
expenses, such as accommodation.  The accountant was subjected to
a vigorous cross-examination that led him to concede that, based
on fuller information and different assumptions, somewhat more
could be allocated for a child care budget.  In argument, counsel
for the wife suggested that on the evidence of the husband's own
accountant, $6,000 to $10,000 could be justified.  I have some
reservations about those figures.  Even taking the $10,000
figure, this is far less than the Table amount of $17,000.  That
testimony provided clear and compelling evidence that the Table
amount was inappropriate.  The evidence demonstrated that the
Table amount exceeded the needs of this healthy young child, even
accepting the imprecision of child expense budgets, that the
mother had only a limited financial ability to meet those needs
and that she was entitled to include a large element of
discretionary spending in view of the income of the husband.
[38] In Francis v. Baker, Bastarache J. recognized that child
support can involve some form of wealth transfer to the child and
will often produce an indirect benefit to the custodial parent.
It seems to me that this will particularly be the case with a
wealthy payer spouse because of the standard of living to which
the child is entitled even at the home of the custodial parent.
However, at some point, the court will find that this transfer
and indirect benefit no longer falls within the parameters of an
appropriate child support award.  As he said at pp. 271-72:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>&#133; [E]ven though the Guidelines have their own stated
objectives, they have not displaced the Divorce Act, 
which clearly dictates that maintenance of the 
children, rather than household equalization or 
spousal support, is the objective of child support 
payments. Section 26.1(2) of the Act states that
&quot;[t]he guidelines shall be based on the principle that 
spouses have a joint financial obligation to maintain 
the children of the marriage in accordance with their 
relative abilities to contribute to the performance of 
that obligation&quot; [emphasis added by Bastarache J.]. 
While standard of living may be a consideration in 
assessing need, at a certain point, support payments 
will meet even a wealthy child's reasonable needs. In
some cases, courts may conclude that the applicable 
Guideline figure is so in excess of the children's 
reasonable needs that it must be considered to be a 
functional wealth transfer to a parent or de facto 
spousal support. I wholly agree with the sentiment of
Abella J.A. that courts should not be too quick to 
find that the Guideline figures enter the realm of 
wealth transfers or spousal support. But courts cannot 
ignore the reasonable needs of the children in the 
particular context of the case as this is a factor 
Parliament chose to expressly include in s. 4(b)(ii) of
the Guidelines. Need, therefore, is but one of the 
factors courts must consider in assessing whether Table 
amounts are inappropriate under s. 4. In order to 
recognize that the objective of child support is the 
maintenance of children, as well as to implement the 
fairness and flexibility components of the Guidelines' 
objectives, courts must therefore have the discretion 
to remedy situations where Table amounts are so in
excess of the children's reasonable needs so as no longer 
to qualify as child support. This is only possible if the 
word &quot;inappropriate&quot; in s. 4 is interpreted to mean 
&quot;unsuitable&quot; rather than merely &quot;inadequate&quot;.  [Emphasis 
added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[39] In my view, the husband made out a prima facie case that the
Guidelines amount was inappropriate and exceeded the purpose of
child support.  This was sufficient to rebut the presumption.
[40] I should say that this does not mean that something
approaching the Table amount may not in the end be awarded.  It
does mean, however, that the court will have to make that
determination based on the factors set out in s. 4(b)(ii).  Those
factors are &#147;the condition, means, needs and other circumstances
of the children who are entitled to support and the financial
ability of each spouse to contribute to the support of the
children&#148;.  Moreover, in a case such as this, involving a very
wealthy support payer, the basic needs of the child are not the
sole or even dominant consideration.  Child support in such cases
will include reasonable discretionary expenses.  In Francis v.
Baker, Bastarache J. summarized the conclusion at the trial level
by Benotto J. as follows at p. 257:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>According to Benotto J., the assessment of 
children's &quot;needs&quot; is influenced by the financial 
position of their parents. The lifestyle the 
children enjoy with the wealthier parent and the 
lifestyle the children would have enjoyed with both 
parents had there been no separation are also 
relevant to the concept of need. What may be an 
extraordinary expense in a family of modest means 
may be a typical expense in a wealthier family.
Accordingly, the higher the level of wealth enjoyed 
by the parents, the more inappropriate the 
consideration of basic need becomes. The 
reasonableness of discretionary expenses replaces
the concept of need.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[41] Bastarache J. later approved of this approach at pp. 279-80
in rejecting the argument of the husband that the trial judge had
erred in awarding the wife discretionary expenses above the
amounts listed in her budget:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The appellant disputes the existence of a proper 
evidentiary foundation for such an award. I disagree. 
The trial judge noted that the respondent's budgets 
were prepared without the benefit of the appellant's 
financial information, and that they did not include 
the level of discretionary expenses that might be
appropriate for children whose father is in the 
financial category of the appellant. Also referred 
to in the trial judgment is the fact that the 
appellant himself leads a lavish lifestyle and spares 
no expense on the children when they are with him. In
my opinion, the trial judge properly considered all 
of the circumstances of the case in awarding the 
respondent additional discretionary expenses. 
Accordingly, the appellant has failed to show that 
the trial judge's decision to increase discretionary
expenses was an abuse of her discretion.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre><strong>        (ii) Should this court make the order for child support?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[42] The wife submits that if this court were to find that the
Table amount was inappropriate, it should make the order that it
considers appropriate under s. 4(b).  I disagree.  Because he was
bound by this court&#146;s decision in Francis v. Baker, the trial
judge made few findings of fact about the means, needs and other
circumstances of the child.  In effect, we are being asked to
make a de novo assessment without having seen the parties testify
nor having up-to-date financial information.  In Francis v. Baker
at p. 277, Bastarache J. discouraged such an exercise by an
appellate court:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Having clarified the principles which should inform
assessments of the appropriateness of child support 
awards under s. 4 of the Guidelines, this Court must 
still determine whether the appellant has met his 
burden of showing that the trial judge in the present 
case improperly exercised her discretion in holding 
that the Table amount was appropriate. This should 
not be confused with a de novo review of the fitness 
of the child support amount awarded by the trial 
judge, a review this Court will not undertake on its 
own initiative.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[43] In my view, this court is not in a position to undertake the
kind of de novo review required to do justice to the parties and
to the child.  Accordingly, there must be a new hearing.</pre>
    <pre>      <strong>    Spousal Support</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>          (i)  Did the trial judge err in failing to order 
	       spousal support?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[44] Section 15.2(4) of the Divorce Act  sets out the factors to
be taken into account in making an order for spousal support and
s. 15.2(6) sets out the objectives of such an order:</pre>
    <pre>
         (4)  In making an order under subsection (1) or an
	 interim order under subsection (2), the court shall
	 take into consideration the condition, means, needs
	 and other circumstances of each spouse, including

            (a)  the length of time the spouses cohabited;

            (b)  the functions performed by each spouse 
	         during cohabitation; and

            (c)  any order, agreement or arrangement
                 relating to support of either spouse.

             &#133;

         (6)  An order made under subsection (1)
         or an interim order under subsection (2) that
         provides for the support of a spouse should

         (a)  recognize any economic advantages
              or disadvantages to the spouses arising from
              the marriage or its breakdown;

         (b)  apportion between the spouses any
              financial consequences arising from the
              care of any child of the marriage over
              and above any obligation for the support
              of any child of the marriage;

         (c)  relieve any economic hardship of
              the spouses arising from the breakdown
              of the marriage; and

         (d)  in so far as practicable, promote
              the economic self-sufficiency of each
              spouse within a reasonable period of
              time.</pre>
    <pre>[45] I have set out above the trial judge&#146;s reasons for not
making an award of spousal support.  In summary, he found that
the wife suffered no economic disadvantage from the marriage and
could quickly become self-sufficient.  However, in Moge v. Moge
(1992), 43 R.F.L. (3d) 345 (S.C.C.) at 376, L&#146;Heureux-Dubé J.
held that all four of the objectives must be taken into account
when spousal support is claimed.  This required that the trial
judge consider the financial consequences arising from the care
of the child &#147;over and above any obligation for the support of
any child of the marriage&#148; (s. 15.2(6)(b)) and &#147;relieve any
economic hardship of the spouses arising from the breakdown of
the marriage&#148; (s. 15.2(6)(c)).  I can understand the trial
judge&#146;s failure to refer to the financial consequences arising
from the care of the child given his view that the amount of
child support was already inappropriately high.  However, given
my conclusion with respect to child support, it will now be
necessary for the judge on the new trial to consider all the
objectives of spousal support.  In doing so, the trial judge will
have to consider whether the wife&#146;s responsibilities for the
child prevent her from continuing her career at the same level as
prior to the marriage and the birth of the child.  Because of
those responsibilities she may be no longer free to take every
job offered on short notice nor work the kinds of hours that some
of the engagements require.
[46] In view of the relationship between spousal support and
child support in this case, both matters must be returned to the
trial court for a fresh determination.  In those circumstances, I
need not consider whether the trial judge erred in his
appreciation of the evidence and whether as alleged by the wife,
she has been uniquely disadvantaged in reestablishing her career,
notwithstanding the short duration of the marriage.  All of these
issues will be for the trial judge at the new trial.

<strong>     (ii) Should this court determine the amount of spousal support?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[47] This court is in no better position to set the level of
spousal support than the level of child support.  Moreover, while
the two amounts must be separately assessed and involve different
considerations, in a case like this the two issues are linked,
first through s. 15.2(6)(b) of the Divorce Act and second
because, as Bastarache J. recognized in Francis v. Baker, the
child support award inevitably will produce some indirect benefit
to the wife.</pre>
    <pre><strong>      (iii)     Should the matter be remitted to the trial judge?</strong></pre>
    <pre>[48] I have concluded that there must be a new hearing on the
questions of spousal and child support.  Obviously, those issues
must be determined by the same judge. In accordance with the
usual practice, there should be a new hearing before a judge
other than the original trial judge.
     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     Costs</strong></pre>
    <pre>[49] The objectives of the Guidelines are set out in s. 1 as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>
          1. The objectives of these Guidelines are

                    (a)  to establish a fair standard
          of support for children that ensures that
          they continue to benefit from the financial
          means of both spouses after separation;

                    (b)  to reduce conflict and tension
          between spouses by making the calculation of
          child support orders more objective;

                    (c)  to improve the efficiency of
          the legal process by giving courts and
          spouses guidance in setting the levels of
          child support orders and encouraging
          settlement; and

                    (d)  to ensure consistent treatment
          of spouses and children who are in similar
          circumstances. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    <pre>[50] Where the income of the paying spouse is less than $150,000
and, in light of the decision in Francis v. Baker at pp. 270-72,
where the income is close to $150,000, the Guidelines can be
expected to achieve these objectives.  Parents will hopefully not
have to waste scarce resources, which should be going to the
children, to pursue litigation.  However, where the income of the
paying spouse vastly exceeds $150,000, the effect of expensive
litigation to that spouse may be less important.
[51] One of the issues in this case is who is to pay the costs of
litigation to make that determination.  For the reasons that
follow, subject to Rule 49 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, it is
my view that absent unusual conduct, the payer spouse in such
cases being in the best position to fund the litigation should be
required to pay the costs attributable to the child support
issues.
[52] First, the rules with respect to costs in family matters
have tended to be somewhat different than in other civil
litigation.  This court has held that discretionary factors,
including the ability to pay, can play a more significant role.
In Andrews v. Andrews (1980), 32 O.R. (2d) 29 (Ont. C.A.) at 35-
6, Houlden J.A. set out a non-exhaustive list of factors the
court should consider in awarding costs in family law matters:</pre>
    <pre>
          (a)  The success of the parties: see Kalesky
	  v. Kalesky (1974), 5 O.R. (2d) 546, 51 D.L.R.
	  (3d) 30, 17 R.F.L. 321. In matrimonial causes
	  success is frequently divided; hence the
          success of the parties it not as important as
	  in ordinary civil litigation;

          (b)  The conduct of the parties prior to
          the commencement of the litigation. This will
          not involve an investigation of the &quot;fault&quot;
          or &quot;blame&quot; for the marriage breakdown; the
          days for this type of futile investigation,
          fortunately, are past. It will, however,
          include such matters as a father who has
          adamantly refused, without just cause, to
          support his children, or a mother who has,
          without just cause, refused access to the
          children: see, for example, Sepe v. Sepe
          (1978), 1 F.L.R.A.C. 220; Brock v. Brendon
          (1979), 1 F.L.R.A.C. 290;

          (c)  The conduct of the parties during
          the litigation. This will include such
          matters as unreasonable delay in prosecuting
          or defending the action, the neglect or
          refusal to admit something that ought to have
          been admitted (Rule 678), the use of wrong or
          defective procedures, the furnishing of wrong
          or misleading information, and the use of
          delaying or other improper tactics at trial:
          see Anderson v. Anderson (1973), 19 R.F.L.
          344, 9 N.B.R. (2d) 457; Brock v. Brendon,
          supra, and Firestone et al. v. Firestone and
          Boylen (No. 2) (1979), 11 R.F.L. (2d) 175. If
          a claim under the Family Law Reform Act,
          1978, is joined with a claim for divorce, the
          making of a reasonable and realistic offer of
          settlement pursuant to Rule 775i(1) [enacted
          O. Reg. 216/78, s. 19] will be an important
          consideration: see Cameron v. Cameron et al.
          (1978), 19 O.R. (2d) 18, 83 D.L.R. (3d) 765,
          2 R.F.L. (2d) 184 and 3 R.F.L. (2d) 277; Weir
          v. Weir (1978), 23 O.R. (2d) 765, 96 D.L.R.
          (3d) 725, 6 R.F.L. (2d) 189;

          (d)  The income and assets of each
          party, the relative means of each party to
          bear his or her own costs, and the effect of
          the award on the ability of a party to meet
          the obligations imposed on him or her by the
          judgment: see Dill v. Dill (1972), 9 R.F.L.
          119; Weir v. Weir, supra.  [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[53] Where, as in this case, there is a huge disparity in the
ability of the parties to pay the costs of the litigation, it is
reasonable to consider that factor to be of paramount importance.
[54] Second, I agree with the reasons of Himel J. in Schmuck v.
Reynolds-Schmuck, (2000), 46 O.R. (3d) 702 (S.C.J.) at 705 where
she points out that, &#147;Unlike other civil litigation, in family
cases, the ability to pay a costs order or the effect of a costs
award is taken into account as part of the financial arrangement
on judgment&#148;.
[55] Third, while a child support order will have some spill-over
to custodial spouses, the first objective of the Child Support
Guidelines is to establish &#147;a fair standard of support for
children that ensures that they continue to benefit from the
financial means of both spouses after separation&#148;.  Where, as
here, the custodial parent is required to pursue litigation to
vindicate that purpose, neither that parent nor the child should
be penalized. In light of the Supreme Court of Canada decision,
the husband is now entitled to challenge the Table amount, but,
ordinarily, the custodial parent should not bear the cost of
litigation that is for the benefit of the child.
[56] Fourth, it will almost always be in the interests of the
wealthy non-custodial parent with virtually unlimited resources
to litigate, or threaten to litigate, the issue in the hope of
rebutting the presumption and substantially reducing the child
support below the Guideline amount.  The custodial parent may
have very limited ability to successfully defend this claim on
her behalf and on behalf of her child.  A costs award may be used
to discourage litigation.
[57] Finally, and most importantly, even after the decision of
the Supreme Court of Canada in Francis v. Baker, the Table amount
is presumptively the amount that the court should order although
the paying spouse&#146;s income exceeds $150,000.  If the paying
spouse wishes to challenge that presumptive assessment,
ordinarily he or she should be required to pay for that exercise.
[58] I now apply those considerations to this case.  There is a
huge disparity between the ability of the parties to pay the
costs of the litigation.  Conservatively speaking the husband had
an annual income from his employment of $2.5 million in the
course of this litigation.  The wife had virtually no employment
income during the litigation.
[59] Further, the effect of the costs order by the trial judge is
to wipe out the wife&#146;s settlement from the marriage contract.
Counsel for the husband argued that the $100,000 the mother
received as a result of the marriage contract was hers to spend
as she liked, including on litigation.  This ignores the fact
that she was required to pursue the litigation primarily for
their son, so that she would be able to offer him a reasonable
standard of living as contemplated by the Guidelines.  It was
surely not contemplated by the parties that the $100,000 from the
marriage contract was to serve as a fund for litigation for the
wife.
[60] Finally, as the law stood prior to trial, the husband had no
legal basis for refusing to pay the Table amount.  Nevertheless,
he did not seek to adjourn the proceedings pending the decision
in the Supreme Court of Canada.  Instead, he has put the wife to
the considerable expense of complex litigation and now the
parties will have to spend further sums on the new trial.
[61] All of these considerations suggest that the husband should
be required to fund the child support litigation.
[62] Obviously, there will be unusual cases where the guideline I
have suggested here should not apply.  Where the conduct of the
custodial spouse has unreasonably lengthened the litigation or
that spouse has rejected a reasonable offer, the court will have
to consider whether the custodial spouse should bear her own
costs.  However, there was no such conduct here.  To the
contrary, it was the husband who exacerbated the dispute by
giving contradictory information about his income and subjected
the wife&#146;s budget to the kind of minute examination that the
Supreme Court disapproved in Francis v. Baker at p. 276 quoted
above.
[63] As for the costs of the trial, since there was more than one
issue, the principles I have set out above do not entirely
resolve the question of costs.  I start with the trial judge&#146;s
view.  He concluded his reasons for costs as follows:</pre>
    <pre>
        The Petitioner&#146;s claim for support was dismissed.  
	The Respondent failed to persuade me that I was 
	not bound by Francis v. Baker.  A subsidiary issue 
	taking much trial time was that of the quality, 
	quantity and conditions of access, resolved more
        nearly to the Respondent&#146;s position than that of 
	the Petitioner.</pre>
    <pre>	Under those circumstances, I am of the opinion 
	that success was, at best, divided.  The trial 
	time taken on the Guideline issue was minimal, 
	apart from a lengthy examination and restricted 
	mainly to legal argument.  Considering all of the 
	foregoing, I do not think this is a case for costs, 
	and there will be no Order in that regard.</pre>
    <pre>[64] In light of what I consider the governing principles, the
wife should have her costs of the trial attributable to the child
support.  Further, in view of her success in this court on those
issues, she is entitled to the costs attributable to spousal
support, joint custody and the gift.  She is not entitled to her
costs respecting the access issue.  Accordingly, in my view, the
wife should have 80% of her costs of the trial.
[65] As to the costs of the appeal, presumptively, the wife is
entitled to the costs of the appeal related to the child support
issue.  In addition, she has been successful on all of the other
issues of spousal support, the gift and joint custody.
Accordingly, in my view, the wife is entitled to her costs of the
appeal and the cross-appeal.
[66] I have considered whether the costs should be on a solicitor
and client basis.  There is much to be said for the custodial
parent receiving more complete compensation for the costs of that
part of the litigation attributable to the child support issue.
Nevertheless, it is important to attempt to strike the proper
balance.  While for the reasons that I have set out above it is
my view that the paying spouse in these unusual cases should bear
the costs of the litigation, the courts must also avoid making
rules that would encourage unnecessary litigation.  If custodial
spouses knew that they could pursue the litigation in these types
of cases with virtually no costs to themselves at all, they would
have no incentive to attempt a reasonable resolution of the s. 4
issues.  Accordingly, I think the better course is to apply the
general principle that an award of solicitor and client costs is
exceptional.  This case has not involved the kind of misconduct
that has led courts to award solicitor and client costs in family
matters.  Accordingly, I would award the costs on a party and
party scale.</pre>
    <pre><strong>DISPOSITION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[67] Accordingly, I would allow the husband&#146;s appeal and direct a
new trial on the issue of child support.  In all other respects,
I would dismiss his appeal.  I would allow the wife&#146;s cross-
appeal and order a new trial on the issue of spousal support.  I
would grant leave to appeal the costs order, allow the appeal and
order that the wife have 80% of her costs of the trial payable on
a party-and-party scale.  I would also order that the wife have
her costs of the motion before Laskin J.A. and of the appeal and
the cross-appeal payable on a party-and-party scale.
[68] I would direct that the wife&#146;s costs be paid out of the
funds held in trust pursuant to the order of Laskin J.A.  The
balance should be returned to the husband.  Pending the new
trial, I would order that the husband continue to pay $11,000
monthly as child support.
                              (signed) &quot;M. Rosenberg J.A.&quot;
                              (signed) &quot;I agree J. J. Carthy J.A.&quot;
                              (signed) &quot;I agree D. O'Connor J.A.&quot;</pre>

1    For example, where the Table amount would cause undue
hardship to the payer spouse (s. 10 of the Guidelines).
2    Section 7 provides that the court may make provision for
certain expenses such as child care expenses and so on, so-called
&#147;add ons&#148;, see Dergousoff v. Dergousoff (1999), 48 R.F.L. (4th) 1
(Sask. C.A.) at 10.  On consent, the wife was permitted to file
fresh evidence concerning certain nursery school expenses.  In
view of my conclusion that there must be a new trial, it is
unnecessary to consider whether the husband should have been
required to pay this expense under s. 7.
3    Section 15.3(2) provides as follows:
     Where, as a result of giving priority to child support, the
     court is unable to make a spousal support order or the court
     makes a spousal support order in an amount that is less than
     it otherwise would have been, the court shall record its
     reasons for having done so.
I doubt that this subsection applies in the circumstances of this
case.  The subsection is directed to a case where the paying
spouse does not have sufficient means to pay the full amount of
child and spousal support.  In such a case, s. 15.3(1) directs
the court to give priority to the child support.  This was not a
case where the court was &#147;unable&#148; to make a spousal support order
because it had to give priority to the child support.  However,
in view of my conclusion with respect to child and spousal
support in this case, I need not finally decide the issue.</pre></td>
