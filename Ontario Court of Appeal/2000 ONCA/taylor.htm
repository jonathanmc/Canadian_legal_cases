    <pre>On appeal from the judgment of Sutherland J. dated November 24, 1997
</pre>
    <pre>ROSENBERG J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]   The  only  real  issue at the trial of this  motor  vehicle
accident  was  whether the accident occurred on  the  plaintiff&#146;s
side of the road or the defendant&#146;s side.  The plaintiff and  the
individual defendant testified and the two parties each presented
an  expert  witness whom they had retained.  The  jury  found  in
favour of the plaintiff, finding that the defendant Sawh was 100%
responsible  for  the  collision.   The  defendants  advance  two
grounds of appeal.  They both concern the evidence of the  police
officer  who  investigated the accident.  The  appellants  submit
that  the  trial  judge erred in refusing to  permit  the  police
officer  to give his opinion as to the location of the  accident.
They  also submit that the trial judge misdirected the jury about
a  report that was prepared by the officer but never entered into
evidence.   In  my view, the trial judge erred in both  respects.
However,  it is also my view that these errors did not result  in
any   substantial  wrong  or  miscarriage  of  justice  and  that
accordingly the appeal should be dismissed pursuant to s.  134(6)
of the Courts of Justice Act, R.S.O. 1990, chap. C.43.</pre>
    <pre>THE FACTS
               The accident
          </pre>
    <pre>[2]  The accident occurred at approximately 6:00 a.m. on February
1, 1994 on Danforth Road, in the former City of Scarborough.  The
respondent Harold Taylor was 53 years of age.  He was on his  way
to  work.   There was no evidence to indicate that his  faculties
were  in  any  way impaired or that he was not keeping  a  proper
lookout prior to the accident.  The appellant Weirly Sawh was  an
employee  of the corporate appellant Burn Security Service.   Mr.
Sawh  was  working a midnight to 7:00 a.m. shift.  His  principal
duty  that night was writing parking tickets for private property
owners.   He was driving a car owned by his employer.  There  was
no  evidence  that  his  faculties  were  impaired.   There  was,
however, evidence to which I will return to indicate that he  was
not keeping a proper lookout just prior to the collision.
[3]  Mr. Sawh was proceeding southbound on Danforth Road and Mr.
Taylor was proceeding northbound.  There are two lanes northbound
and southbound.  Both men were in their respective passing lanes.
There were snowbanks on the curbs but the road itself was clear
of snow.  The weather was clear and very cold.  It was still dark
at 6:00 a.m.  As he was proceeding southbound, Mr. Sawh came upon
a pronounced curve.  The accident occurred just at the point
where a southbound car would be exiting the curve.  Mr. Taylor,
however, was still on a straight portion of the road.  If he did
not negotiate the curve properly and continued driving straight,
Mr. Sawh would have entered the northbound lanes.
[4]  Mr. Taylor was seriously injured in the accident and he had
no memory of the actual collision.  His last memory was that he
was in his own lane and then saw bright lights coming at him.
Mr. Sawh testified that the Taylor vehicle crossed into his lane
and collided with his vehicle.
[5]  Mr. Sawh&#146;s evidence was not very satisfactory.  The trial
judge commented adversely on his credibility in the charge to the
jury and in the course of objections to the charge, appellant&#146;s
counsel conceded that there were a number of inconsistencies in
Sawh&#146;s evidence.  Mr. Sawh gave conflicting versions of his speed
to the investigating officer, at discovery and at trial.  Mr.
Sawh testified that he was using the bank of snow in the middle
of the roadway as a marker for staying in his lane and not
crossing the centre of the roadway.  The investigating officer
testified that there was no snow in the centre of the road.
Finally, Mr. Sawh told the investigating officer and testified at
trial that he had his mind on his job and was not really paying
attention to the oncoming traffic.
[6]  Constable Thomas arrived at the scene about fifteen minutes
after the collision.  At the time, emergency personnel were
attempting to extricate Mr. Taylor from his vehicle.  Constable
Thomas made observations of the vehicles, the roadway and the
snowbank.  He testified that the snow at the curb on Mr. Taylor&#146;s
side of the road had been disturbed and scattered along the road.
He also observed tire marks in a kind of zigzag across the road
to a gouge in the pavement in the southbound lane, i.e. Mr.
Sawh&#146;s side of the road.
[7]  The appellants and respondent both called expert evidence.
The appellants&#146; expert gave the opinion, based in part on
Constable Thomas&#146; evidence, that the Taylor vehicle bounced off
the snowbank and veered into the oncoming traffic with the
collision occurring at the point where Constable Thomas noticed
the gouge.  If the jury had accepted this evidence, they would
have found that the respondent was partly if not wholly liable
for the accident.  The respondent&#146;s expert&#146;s opinion was based
primarily on the nature of the damage to the two vehicles and the
nature of the roadway.  It was his opinion that the Sawh vehicle
had failed to negotiate the curve and crossed into the northbound
lane where it collided with the Taylor vehicle.

               The voir dire
          </pre>
    <pre>[8]   The  trial  judge conducted a voir dire to  deal  with  two
aspects  of  Constable  Thomas' evidence.  The  appellants  first
sought  to  introduce the official report of  the  accident  that
Constable  Thomas had prepared.  The trial judge ruled  that  the
report was not admissible.  The appellants do not challenge  that
ruling.   Constable Thomas did not refer to the  official  police
report  at  any  time during his evidence.   He  was  not  cross-
examined on its contents.
[9]  In the course of his evidence, Constable Thomas did refer to
his  notes both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination.
He  used  the notes to refresh his memory.  Respondent&#146;s  counsel
also  made  good use of the notes in cross-examination.   He  was
able to demonstrate that Constable Thomas had not made a note  of
the  gouge in the road nor the zigzag pattern of the tire  marks.
These  parts of Constable Thomas' evidence were important to  the
opinion  of  the  appellants&#146; expert as to  where  the  collision
occurred and to explain the damage pattern.
[10] Second, the appellants sought to have Constable Thomas give
his opinion as an expert in accident reconstruction as to the
point of impact.  Constable Thomas has extensive credentials.  He
had been an officer for some twenty years at the time of this
investigation.  Much of his career has been spent in the Toronto
Police Department Traffic Unit.  He had investigated
approximately 6,100 motor vehicle accidents.  He has taught
courses in police accident investigation.  He has also taken a
number of courses including a two-week course in accident
reconstruction.  Constable Thomas does not, however, have a
university degree and is not an engineer.  He has given expert
evidence in accident reconstruction in criminal cases, but had
not done so in any civil case.
[11] The trial judge ruled that while Constable Thomas could give
evidence as to his observations at the scene, he could not give
his opinion as to the point of impact.  The trial judge based his
ruling on the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v.
Mohan, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9.  In that case, at p. 20  Sopinka J.
summarized the criteria for admission of expert evidence as
follows:

          (a) relevance;
          (b) necessity in assisting the trier of fact;
          (c) the absence of any exclusionary rule;
          (d) a properly qualified expert.
          </pre>
    <pre>[12]  The  trial judge found that Constable Thomas was a properly
qualified expert. The trial judge did not expressly refer to  any
exclusionary rule that might make his opinion inadmissible.   The
trial judge appears to have excluded the evidence on the basis of
necessity,  because  there  were  two  other  experts  who  would
testify,  and  perhaps  on the basis of  relevancy  in  that  the
prejudicial  effect of his evidence would outweigh its  probative
alue.  The key part of his ruling is as follows:

               In this  case,  I  find  that,  although 
	  P.C.  Thomas  knows  more than  this tribunal
	  about accident re-construction, there  is  no
          necessity for his evidence because  there are
	  highly  qualified  experts who have, or will,
	  testify and who have produced, for the use of
	  counsel,  expert  reports with respect to the
	  accident and particularly with respect to the
	  main issue in question.
                This  is  a jury case and, in  all  the
          circumstances,  I find it inappropriate  that
          the  police  constable be permitted  to  give
          opinion  evidence as to the point  of  impact
          between the two vehicles.
               Further, it is my finding that, although
          P.C.  Thomas  has given evidence in  criminal
          cases   as   an   expert   of   traffic   re-
          construction, he has not been permitted to do
          so  in a civil case before now.  This is  not
          an  appropriate  case to be  the  first  case
          because,  here  the element of  necessity  as
          referred to by Justice Sopinka is not present
          and  there is also, really, potential  danger
          of  a  prejudicial  effect that  exceeds  any
          possible benefit.  But I would also point out
          that   although  P.C.  Thomas  is   obviously
          experienced and has shown interest in working
          in  this  area,  he is not an  engineer.   He
          could  not  say, in this case, just  when  he
          submitted  his report but it would appear  to
          have  been  submitted  very  soon  after  the
          accident in question.
          It  came  out  in the evidence  that  he  had
          spoken to one of the drivers but that he  had
          not,  on  the  day  in  question  or  at  any
          subsequent time, spoken to the plaintiff  who
          was taken away from the scene of the accident
          in  an  unconscious state.   The  element  of
          necessity comes back in here, in that if this
          was  a  smaller case and there were no  other
          experts to assist the Court, the Court  might
          well  admit the constable's opinion evidence,
          on  the  basis of his expertise  and  on  the
          basis of necessity.
          Here,  however, the necessity element is  not
          present  and  the suggested opinion  evidence
          supports  a  risk of prejudice and  therefore
          there  is no good reason to allow the  police
          constable  to give the opinion evidence  here
          in question. [Emphasis added.]

[13]  Accordingly,  at the trial proper, while  Constable  Thomas
testified at length about his observations, he did not  give  his
opinion  as  to  the  point of impact.  That  opinion,  based  on
Constable Thomas&#146; evidence, was given by the defence expert,  Mr.
Raftery.  Mr. Raftery is a professional engineer specializing  in
accident reconstruction.

               The Charge to the Jury
          </pre>
    <pre>[14]  The  ground  of appeal concerning the charge  to  the  jury
centres  on  the  trial judge&#146;s references to the police  report.
Notwithstanding that he had ruled that the appellants  could  not
introduce  the  report and that no reference was made  to  it  in
Constable  Thomas&#146;  evidence,  the  trial  judge  discussed   its
contents with the jury on several occasions as follows:

          &#133; The plaintiff has mounted a serious attack
	  or question on P.C. Thomas's evidence and
	  points out that there was no reference to 
	  gouge marks in his notes, that there is no
	  explanation whatsoever in the public report
	  that was filed as it was required to be under
	  the statute for the usual police report.  It
	  included a conclusion by this officer that the
	  impact took place in the southbound lane but
	  it said very little about how.  There is a
          problem in this regard.  It has been suggested
	  to you that the Police Constable had no ax to
	  grind.  In this regard I want you to recall
	  what I said to you early on about not taking
	  positions too soon among yourselves because
	  it is hard to back down.  This police officer
	  had filed a police report and made his
	  measurements, and having talked to Mr. Sawh at
	  the Scarborough Hospital, and not ever having
	  talked to Taylor, his notes do not include
 	  some of the things that were in his evidence.
	  He knew that that report was out by way of a
	  document.  Anybody could get it.  He had
	  interviews with the plaintiff's investigator and
          discussions with the defendant's professional
	  engineer.  He had seen Mr. Prescott's first
	  report.  He knew before he came here and,
	  presumably, also in some of his discussions
	  subsequent to Mr. Prescott's report coming out,
	  that Mr. Prescott's report was quite critical
	  of his findings.  I leave it to you to question
          whether he would not have a tendency to try to
	  defend the conclusions in his first report which
	  was made on the day of the accident.  The way
	  some of this information seems to have come
          out later is awkward.  Now, it may just have
	  happened, but we hear about gouge marks when
	  it is not in the notes; we hear about tracks,
	  and then we know that there is a difficulty with
	  the angle of the impact, that Prescott has made
	  a lot about the angle.  You hear about zigzagging,
	  and the zigzagging does not seem to come up in
	  the early information.  It certainly was not
          in the police report.  That does not mean that
	  it is just ipso facto or by its own self wrong,
	  it does not necessarily mean that, but the
	  public report, I would have to say, is not a very
          good report for all the years that he had of
	  experience.  It said, the public one, that you
	  are not going to see, very, very little about how
	  he arrived at his conclusion.  Now, you have
          heard evidence &#150; he acknowledged that he would
	  need his notes.  He acknowledged that he took
	  the statement from Sawh that said he was going
	  from 55 to 60 miles an hour, quite different from
	  what Sawh was saying on his discovery.  He talked
	  about a fresh gouge mark at trial.  The word
	  &quot;gouge&quot; was not used in his notes.  He said the
	  tracks could be followed from the snowbank in a
	  zigzag course.  The notes say nothing of a zigzag
	  course. &#133;

                 &#133;The   police  report  of  Mr.  Sawh's
          statement  makes  no reference  to  a  zigzag
          pattern.  In regard to no ax to grind,  there
          is  certainly no suggestion that P.C.  Thomas
          had  any  monetary ax to grind.  All that  he
          would perhaps have is a desire to buttress  a
          position that he had already publicly  taken,
          and  he may not have done that.  He may  have
          the  memories that he said he had.  [Emphasis
          added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[15]  It  will  also  be  seen that the  trial  judge  disparaged
Constable  Thomas' evidence on the theory that he may  have  seen
the   report   of  the  respondent&#146;s  expert,  Prescott,   before
testifying.   There was no direct evidence that Constable  Thomas
had  seen  Prescott&#146;s report and he was not cross-examined  about
this.
[16] Defence counsel objected to the charge to the jury.  He
pointed out that the only evidence about the contents of the
police report had come out during the voir dire and was not
evidence before the jury.  Counsel submitted that it was unfair
to disparage Constable Thomas&#146; evidence about what was not in the
report when he had not been given an opportunity to explain.
Counsel also pointed out that there was no evidence that the
officer had seen the Prescott report.  The trial judge did not
recharge the jury.

               The Verdict
          </pre>
    <pre>[17]  The jury found Mr. Sawh to be entirely responsible for  the
accident.  The jury gave the following particulars of Mr.  Sawh&#146;s
negligence:

    Considering the damage to the vehicle, consistent portions
    of the statements by each side and the original police report, we
    believe the defendant&#146;s not paying attention to the road or
    oncoming traffic had collided with the plaintiff in the
    northbound lane.  [Emphasis added.]
          
</pre>
    <pre>ANAYSIS
               The Admissibility of Constable Thomas&#146; Opinion
          </pre>
    <pre>[18]  The  principal ground upon which the trial  judge  excluded
Constable  Thomas&#146;  opinion  as  to  the  point  of  impact   was
necessity.  In my view, the trial judge misdirected himself as to
the  meaning  of necessity.  In the context of the  admission  of
expert  evidence, necessity refers to information that is  likely
to  be  outside  the experience and knowledge of the  jury.   The
opinion of a qualified expert does not become unnecessary  simply
because  there  may be other, even other more qualified  experts,
who  will be testifying at the trial.  The same understanding  of
necessity  applies in both criminal and civil cases.   In  R.  v.
Mohan,  supra  at  pp. 23-24, Sopinka J. referred  to  civil  and
criminal  decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in  explaining
the necessity criterion:

               This pre-condition is often expressed in
	  terms as to whether the evidence would be helpful 
	  to the trier of fact. The word &quot;helpful&quot; is not
	  quite appropriate and sets too low a standard.
          However, I would not judge necessity by too strict
	  a standard. What is required is that the opinion
	  be necessary in the sense that it provide 
	  information &quot;which is likely to be outside the
          experience and knowledge of a judge or jury&quot;: as
	  quoted by Dickson J. in R. v. Abbey, supra. As
	  stated by Dickson J., the evidence must be
	  necessary to enable the trier of fact to
          appreciate the matters in issue due to their
	  technical nature. In Kelliher (Village of) v.
	  Smith, [1931] S.C.R. 672, at p. 684 this Court,
	  quoting from Beven on Negligence, (4th ed. 1928),
	  at p. 141, stated that in order for expert
	  evidence to be admissible, &quot;[t]he subject-matter
	  of the inquiry must be such that ordinary people
	  are unlikely to form a correct judgment about it,
	  if unassisted by persons with special knowledge&quot;. 
	  More recently, in R. v. Lavallee, supra, the
	  above passages from Kelliher and Abbey were
	  applied to admit expert evidence as to the state
	  of mind of a &quot;battered&quot; woman. The judgment
	  stressed that this was an area that is not 
	  understood by the average person.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[19]  The  trial  judge erred in excluding the officer&#146;s  opinion
because it did not meet the necessity criterion.
[20] In the course of his reasons, the trial judge also stated
that there was a potential danger of the prejudicial effect of
the opinion evidence exceeding any possible benefit.  In this
context, the trial judge referred to the fact that the officer
was not an engineer, that he had only spoken to Mr. Sawh after
the accident, and that he could not say precisely when he
submitted his report.  In my view, none of these factors were
grounds to exclude the opinion on the basis of prejudicial effect
outweighing probative value.  In R. v. Mohan at pp. 20-21,
Sopinka J. discussed this balancing exercise under the relevancy
criterion in the following terms:

               Relevance is a threshold requirement for
	  the admission of expert evidence as with all
	  other evidence. Relevance is a matter to be
	  decided by a judge as question of law. Although
	  prima facie admissible if so related to a fact
	  in issue that it tends to establish it, that does
	  not end the inquiry. This merely determines the
	  logical relevance of the evidence. Other
          considerations enter into the decision as to
	  admissibility. This further inquiry may be 
	  described as a cost benefit analysis, that is 
	  &quot;whether its value is worth what it costs&quot;: see
	  McCormick on Evidence (3rd ed. 1984), at p. 544.
	  Cost in this context is not used in its 
	  traditional economic sense but rather in terms
	  of its impact on the trial process. Evidence that
	  is otherwise logically relevant may be excluded
	  on this basis, if its probative value is overborne
	  by its prejudicial effect, if it involves an
	  inordinate amount of time which is not commensurate
	  with its value or if it is misleading in the sense
	  that its effect on the trier of fact, particularly
	  a jury, is out of proportion to its reliability.
	  While frequently considered as an aspect of legal
	  relevance, the exclusion of logically relevant
	  evidence on these grounds is more properly 
	  regarded as a general exclusionary rule (see
	  Morris v. The Queen, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190). Whether
	  it is treated as an aspect of relevance or an
	  exclusionary rule, the effect is the same. The
	  reliability versus effect factor has special
          significance in assessing the admissibility of
	  expert evidence.

                There  is a danger that expert evidence
          will  be  misused and will distort the  fact-
          finding  process.  Dressed up  in  scientific
          language  which  the  jury  does  not  easily
          understand and submitted through a witness of
          impressive antecedents, this evidence is  apt
          to be accepted by the jury as being virtually
          infallible and as having more weight than  it
          deserves.  [Emphasis added.]

    <pre>[21]  Constable Thomas&#146; evidence presented none of  the  concerns
referred   to   by   Sopinka  J.   His  opinion  was   relatively
straightforward.   There was no danger that  the  jury  would  be
misled  by  scientific language.  The trial judge's  decision  to
admit the opinion of two accident reconstructionists demonstrates
this.   The  fact that Constable Thomas was not an  engineer  was
also  not  a  basis  for excluding his evidence.   Witnesses  can
obtain  the  necessary expertise through training and experience.
See  R. v. Dugandzic (1981), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 517 (Ont. C.A.).   In
M.  J. Freiman &amp; M. L. Berenblut, The Litigator&#146;s Guide to Expert
Witnesses, (Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book, 1997), in the  chapter
entitled &#147;Motor Vehicle Accident Reconstruction&#148;, David Bender at
p.  303 makes these comments about the way in which a person  can
become an expert:

          There are generally two avenues to becoming an
	  experienced motor vehicle accident reconstructionist.
	  One way of becoming a reconstructionist is through
	  experience with the police force.  Police forces
	  or police-based training schools provide 
	  introductory courses in the reconstruction field.
	  Advanced courses in such facilities, combined
 	  with practical field experience and self-learning
	  programs, expand the experience base of police
	  reconstructionists.  Frequently, police 
	  reconstructionists are limited by the courts to
	  giving evidence only on the investigation and
	  documentation phases of the reconstruction.
	  Depending on the experience and training level
          achieved by the particular officer, he or she may
	  be qualified to give opinion evidence on some
	  forms of dynamic issues based on scientific 
	  formulae and the basic principles of motion.  For
          example, a police officer trained as a 
	  reconstructionist may be qualified to give 
	  evidence with respect to the speed of a vehicle
          based on the skid mark length on the road and the
	  friction values personally measured by the officer.
	  Unless trained as engineers, police investigators
	  are not qualified to give opinion evidence on 
	  vehicle speeds based on crush patterns or in cases
	  where complex dynamic motion has taken place.

          A second way to become a reconstructionist is by
	  obtaining an engineering degree from a recognized
	  college or university.&#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>[22] Finally, the fact that the officer had only spoken to one of
the  drivers  and was uncertain as to exactly when he  filed  his
report were not grounds for excluding his opinion.  These matters
went to weight not admissibility.
[23] An important concern when considering the admissibility of
expert evidence is that the evidence will be misused and distort
the fact-finding process.  Often, the risk of misuse or
distortion is because the jury may be unable to appreciate the
limits of the opinion and may give it undue weight.  However, all
of the matters to which the trial judge referred would be
apparent to the jury.  Constable Thomas could be cross-examined
on his qualifications, the fact that he did not get the
plaintiff&#146;s side of the story and even when he filed his report.1
[24] In oral argument, it was suggested that the trial judge&#146;s
ruling could be supported on a broad policy basis that public
officers such as Constable Thomas should not be asked to give
opinions in private litigation.  I do not agree. Constable Thomas
was at the scene within minutes of the accident and could observe
first-hand the aftermath of the collision. The defendant and the
triers of fact were entitled to his evidence.
[25] It seems to me that the respondent&#146;s real complaint about
the admission of this opinion is that it happened to favour the
appellant&#146;s position and the jury would be unduly impressed with
the fact that the witness was a state agent not paid by the
parties.  In my view, this is not a basis for excluding relevant
evidence that might be helpful to the jury in dealing with the
issues before it.  We were referred to no case that supports the
trial judge&#146;s ruling.  If the Legislature should consider that,
for policy reasons, police officers should not give their
opinions in civil cases it can legislate accordingly.
[26] I wish to make three final observations.  This decision
should not be taken as holding that investigating police officers
will always be permitted to give their opinions.  As the excerpt
from the Freiman and Berenblut text indicates, police officers
will have varying levels of expertise and some opinions may
simply be outside the expertise of even the most experienced
officer.  Second, in a different case there may be factors, not
present in this case, that would require exclusion of some of an
investigating officer&#146;s evidence.2  Finally, while I have held
that there is no legal basis for excluding the officer's opinion
in this case, I should also not be taken as encouraging counsel
to use this type of evidence.   It is  in  the  interest of the
parties and the administration of justice that
the  foundation facts for the expert opinions be presented in  as
objective a manner as possible.  The investigating officer who is
at  the  scene will have valuable information to provide  to  the
court  and to the experts retained by the parties.  The officer's
objectivity should not appear to have been compromised because he
or  she  has been enlisted by one of the parties to also  provide
expert evidence.  This will benefit no one in the long term.
[27]  It remains to consider the effect of the exclusion  of  the
officer&#146;s opinion. Constable Thomas did describe himself  as  &#147;an
accident    investigator,   accident   reconstructionist&#148;    when
testifying  before the jury.  He gave extensive evidence  of  his
observations,  including the disturbance of the  snow  bank,  the
zigzag  marks and the gouge mark in the southbound lane.   Having
heard  the evidence of the highly qualified defence expert  based
upon the officer&#146;s testimony, the jury could not have been in any
doubt as to the officer&#146;s opinion concerning the point of impact.
Indeed,  the trial judge took this for granted in the  charge  to
the  jury.   He  referred to the defence theory  as  the  &#147;police
theory&#148; and actually told the jury that the police report put the
point  of  impact  in  the  southbound  lane.  In  my  view,   no
substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice occurred  because  of
the exclusion of the officer&#146;s opinion.

               The Charge to the Jury
          </pre>
    <pre>[28]  The  trial  judge&#146;s references to the  police  report  were
unfortunate.   Having  ruled  that  the  appellants   could   not
introduce  the report, the trial judge should not have  discussed
its  contents  with the jury.  In the result, evidence  that  had
been ruled inadmissible was placed before the jury.  As well, the
trial  judge used the contents of the document, which he and  not
the  jury had seen, to deprecate the evidence of Constable Thomas
and  challenge  the defence assertion that he was an  independent
witness.   The officer had no chance to explain the  contents  of
the  report.   The evidence of Constable Thomas was important  to
the  defence.   That  evidence was largely the  basis  for  their
expert&#146;s  opinion that the collision occurred in  the  southbound
lane.  The appellants also point to the verdict in which the jury
referred  to  the &#147;original police report&#148; as evidence  that  the
improper  aspects of the charge obviously had an  impact  on  the
jury.
[29] I have nevertheless concluded that these errors did not
result in any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  The
defects that the trial judge pointed to in the police accident
report were the same defects in the police officer&#146;s notes upon
which the officer was vigorously cross-examined.  Some of the
explanation that the officer might have had for the defective
report was before the jury in his answers concerning the notes.
The reference to the police report was not entirely detrimental
to the defence.  As I have indicated above, the trial judge also
told the jury that the report contained the officer&#146;s opinion
that the point of impact was in the southbound land.  That may be
why trial counsel, while objecting to the charge, was somewhat
lukewarm on the question of a recharge.  As he said, the trial
judge might determine that it was best to &#147;let sleeping dogs
lie&#148;.
[30] I do not consider the reference to the officer having seen
Mr. Prescott&#146;s report to be reversible error.  The respondent
alleged that this was a reasonable inference, given the shift in
Constable Thomas&#146; evidence from what was in his notes.  The trial
judge had made it clear to the jury that they had a duty to
disregard his opinion if they disagreed with it and to come to
their own opinion in accordance with the facts.
[31] Finally, I do not believe that the reference to the police
report in the verdict shows that the jury was influenced by the
improper parts of the trial judge&#146;s charge.  For convenience I
will repeat their answer to the question of the particulars of
Mr. Sawh&#146;s negligence:

     Considering the damage to the vehicle, consistent portions
     of the statements by each side and the original police report,
     we believe the defendant&#146;s not paying attention to the road or
     oncoming traffic had collided with the plaintiff in the
     northbound lane.  [Emphasis added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[32]  I  have already referred to some of the problems  with  Mr.
Sawh&#146;s  evidence.   Fundamental was his  admission  to  Constable
Thomas  that  he was not paying attention.  In cross-examination,
counsel  for  the  respondent  had  Constable  Thomas  read   out
Mr. Sawh&#146;s entire statement as follows:

     A.  &quot;Then what happened it happened so fast.  I saw the
     other driver.  He was coming north.  He crossed the line.  I had
     my mind on the job.  I wasn't paying attention to traffic
     northbound.&quot;  Question: &quot;What time did your shift end?&quot;  Answer:
     &quot;7 a.m.&quot;  &quot;Where were you going?&quot;  Answer: &quot;I was going to 41
     division with the tags.&quot;  Question: &quot;Did you see the truck
     northbound before you were hit?&quot;  Answer: &quot;I saw headlights
     coming north.  I didn't pay attention to them,&quot; ... [Emphasis
     added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>[33]  The  jury picked up on this problem in their  verdict.   In
context, it seems likely that the jury&#146;s reference to the  police
report is to Mr. Sawh&#146;s statement to the police officer, not  the
official  accident report.  I would therefore not give effect  to
this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>DISPOSITION
          </pre>
    <pre>[34] Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal with costs.

1    While the trial judge ruled that the defence could not
introduce the report in chief, this did not preclude the
plaintiff&#146;s counsel from cross-examining Constable Thomas on it,
just as plaintiff&#146;s counsel cross-examined the officer on his
notes.
2    For example, the officer&#146;s opinion that one of the motorists
had committed a criminal offence would, in most cases, be
irrelevant.</pre></td>
