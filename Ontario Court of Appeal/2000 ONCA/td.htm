    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Juriansz J. dated July 30, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>FINLAYSON J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal involves the addition as plaintiffs by
counterclaim of a number of parties whose status in this action
raises some concern.  The parties are listed in the order of
Master Birnbaum, dated May 5, 1999, as John S. Cowan, Nawoc
Holdings Limited, Forsythe Family Trust, by its Trustee Robert
Forsythe, Simcoe Coach Lines Limited and Thomas Harold Lincoln
Gallagher, by his litigation guardian Thomas William Gallagher.
The appellants moved successfully before Master Birnbaum to have
the named parties added to this action on the basis that as
&#147;investors&#148; in corporate customers of the respondent, The Toronto
Dominion Bank (&#147;TD Bank&#148;), they were in a fiduciary relationship
with the TD Bank, and that TD Bank breached a duty owed to them.
A second basis for adding the parties was that they allege
damages by reason of the tort of negligent misrepresentation by
the TD Bank.
[2]  The pleadings in this case are lengthy but, on analysis, the
issues are narrow.  The TD Bank commenced an action against the
guarantors of three of its corporate customers who had defaulted
on their respective loans.  The first customer was Balmoral
Partners Limited (&#147;Balmoral Partners&#148;), which, according to the
TD Bank&#146;s pleadings, was in the business of providing financing
to early-stage high-technology companies.  The other two
customers were subsidiaries of Balmoral Partners named Balmoral
Trade Finance Corporation (&#147;Balmoral Trade&#148;) and AdvantEdge
Corporation (&#147;AdvantEdge&#148;).  Both Balmoral Partners and Balmoral
Trade are now bankrupt, and AdvantEdge, according to the
defendant&#146;s  pleadings, is no longer a going concern.  These
three corporate customers have been referred to by the defendants
as the &#147;principal debtors&#148; in this action, and I will do the same
for the purposes of this appeal.
[3]  There was a third subsidiary of Balmoral Partners that was
also a customer of TD Bank, named Sinkel North America Ltd.
(&#147;Sinkel&#148;), which was a computer software company.  There is no
claim on Sinkel&#146;s guarantors because all indebtedness of this
customer relevant to these proceedings has been repaid.
[4]  The defendants Robert G. Forsythe, Lawrence Herbert Enkin,
Thomas William Gallagher, Llewellyn Sifton Smith Family Holdings
Inc., and Gary N. Curtis were at all material times shareholders
of Balmoral Partners.  The added plaintiff by counterclaim, John
S. Cowan, was a shareholder as well.
[5]  In their statement of defence, the defendant guarantors
allege that the TD Bank knew or ought to have known that they
would rely on the bank&#146;s discretion, judgment and guidance in
dealing with the principal debtors&#146; accounts as a means of
protecting the guarantors from unnecessary exposure pursuant to
their guarantees.  Further, or in the alternative, the defendant
guarantors allege that the TD Bank owed a common law duty of care
and a fiduciary duty to the principal debtors, and to the
defendants as guarantors, to conduct itself in accordance with
these consequent obligations, and to act at all times in good
faith and with full and open disclosure.
[6]  The specific complaint of the defendant guarantors giving
rise to the alleged breach of fiduciary and common law duty of
care arose out of the dealings between the TD Bank and the
defendant Gary Curtis.  As indicated, Curtis was a shareholder of
Balmoral Partners.  He was also a guarantor of the various
corporate indebtednesses and, more importantly, the president of
Balmoral Trade.  In this capacity, he was the person who
communicated regularly with the TD Bank on behalf of the
principal debtors.  It is alleged that Curtis, without the
knowledge or consent of Balmoral Trade or the other guarantors,
arranged for a $12,000 cheque to be payable to a company called
Nadim Group Inc. (&#147;Nadim&#148;), a company with which Curtis was at
one time associated.  The guarantors allege that Curtis had
attempted to direct these funds to himself but that the cheque,
in error, went to Nadim.  The statement of defence goes on to
allege:
          </pre>
    <pre>          13. Upon receipt of this cheque a representative
	  of Nadim Group Inc. contacted the Bank and put
	  the Bank on notice that Curtis was not to be
	  trusted.
          </pre>
    <pre>          14. The Bank subsequently contacted the Defendant
	  Forsythe and advised him of the above incident.
	  Forsythe expressed concern and asked the Bank if
	  it could utilize the resources available to it
	  (which resources were unavailable to these
	  Defendants) to conduct a background check on Curtis.
          </pre>
    <pre>          15. The Bank declined Forsythe&#146;s request, advising
	  him that there was nothing to worry about.
          </pre>
    <pre>          16. Forsythe reasonably concluded that the Bank
	  had sufficient information to reach such a conclusion
	  respecting Curtis, and accepted and relied on the
	  Bank&#146;s advice in that regard.
          </pre>
    <pre>          17. Forsythe, in turn, relayed the Bank&#146;s advice to
	  the Principal Debtors and to the rest of these
	  Defendants who, to the Bank&#146;s actual or implied
	  knowledge, reasonably relied on such advice.
          </pre>
    <pre>          18. These Defendants state that as a result of the
	  particular circumstances described above respecting
	  Curtis, and/or in any event, the Bank owed them and the
          Principal Debtors an implied contractual, as well as a
	  common law and a fiduciary duty of care to ensure that
	  all necessary precautions and measures were taken
	  before advancing funds to the Principal Debtors, and
	  before allowing funds to be drawn on the accounts of
          the Principal Debtors.</pre>
    <pre>[7]  Further to the above, the statement of defence alleges acts
of negligence and certain misrepresentations on the part of the
TD Bank in other dealings with Curtis, with AdvantEdge, and with
Forsythe and other guarantors, in the face of the financial
difficulties of the principal debtors.  These include various
allegations that the TD Bank permitted Curtis to open bank
accounts in furtherance of his dishonest activities, that it
refused to honour payroll cheques to the employees of AdvantEdge,
leading to the demise of that company, and that it misled the
defendants in its efforts to secure additional guarantees from
them.  I do not think I am understating what is alleged in this
pleading when I say that the failure of the TD Bank to recognize
that Curtis was dishonest is the linchpin of the defence and
counterclaim so far as the new parties are concerned.  I note
that the above paragraphs numbered 13 to 18 are incorporated by
specific reference in the appellants&#146; amended counterclaim
respecting the parties they seek to add to this action.
[8]  It is pleaded that the TD Bank continued to advance more
funds to the now bankrupt Balmoral Partners and Balmoral Trade,
and to AdvantEdge, thus increasing the exposure of the defendants
on their guarantees.  Further, some of the defendants executed
additional guarantees or renewed existing ones, without knowledge
of Curtis&#146; alleged duplicity.  Additionally, some of the
guarantors continued to advance funds to Balmoral Trade and
Balmoral Partners, as  &#147;investors&#148; in these customers of the TD
Bank., and in so doing relied on what they perceived to be a
responsibility on the part of the TD Bank to oversee the
financial dealings of these customers, as well as their
guarantors.  In responding to the statement of claim as a whole,
the defendants allege:
          </pre>
    <pre>          90.    These defendants state that any and all
	  outstanding liability owed by the Principal
	  Debtors to the Bank, and which the Bank now
	  claims as against these Defendants, was caused
	  or contributed to by the Bank&#146;s own acts and
 	  omissions as hereinbefore described, such that
	  the Bank is in breach of its duties and
	  obligations to these Defendants.  The result is
	  that these Defendants are discharged from any
	  and all liabilities under their guarantees.</pre>
    <pre>[9]  The proposed plaintiffs by counterclaim, in their amended
counterclaim, state that the TD Bank owed them a common law and
fiduciary duty to exercise all reasonable care and skill in the
handling of the accounts and credit facilities of Balmoral Trade
and Balmoral Partners in accordance with its own internal
policies and the standards within the financial industry.
[10] In addition to their status as fiduciaries, the proposed
plaintiffs by counterclaim state that they invested and continued
to invest assets in Balmoral Trade and Balmoral Partners in
reliance upon the TD Bank&#146;s representations.  They state that
they would not have done so had they known the information
available to the TD Bank regarding the trustworthiness of Curtis
at the time the bank knew of such information.  Thus, according
to their counterclaim:  &#147;&#133;the Investors state that they relied
upon the representations of the Bank regarding Curtis, as
detailed in paragraphs 13-18 of this Statement of Defence, which
representations were made recklessly and/or negligently and
without regard to their accuracy&#148;.
[11] It is to be noted that there is no allegation pleaded that
is personal to these proposed parties other than the allegations
that the TD Bank, by reason of its ongoing contact with one of
the guarantors, Forsythe, should have known of their existence,
their relationship to the guarantors and to each other, and their
investments in two of the TD Bank&#146;s customers.</pre>
    <pre>Issues
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>1.   Is it plain and obvious that the pleadings disclose
a fiduciary relationship between the TD Bank and the parties
to be added?

2.   Is it plain and obvious that the amended statement of
defence and counterclaim disclose a basis for the tort of
negligent misrepresentation?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[12] The issues are framed to comply with the standards
enunciated in R. D. Belanger &amp; Associates Ltd. v. Stadium Corp.
Ltd. (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 778 (Ont. C.A.); Hunt v. Carey Canada
Inc., (1990), 74 D.L.R. (4th) 321 (S.C.C.).</pre>
    <pre>Analysis</pre>
    <pre>[13] The propriety of the original statement of defence and
counterclaim is not before us.  The TD Bank had set the matter
down for trial before the motion to add the parties as plaintiffs
by counter claim was made.  It was held below, and not challenged
in this appeal, that it was too late to attack the original
pleadings with respect to the original parties.  In any event,
there are facts pleaded respecting the circumstances that existed
at the time of the renewal and extension of existing guarantees
by the original defendants that would appear to require a trial.
Consequently, I am concerned only with the decision of Master
Birnbaum, reversed by Juriansz J., to permit the addition, as
plaintiffs by counterclaim, of certain parties who are not
guarantors and were not named in the original action.  These new
parties are referred to as &#147;investors&#148; in Balmoral Trade &#147;and/or&#148;
Balmoral Partners, although one of them, Cowan, is also a
shareholder of Balmoral Partners.  It was explained to us in
argument that these investors were lenders to the principal
debtors.  In the present circumstances, they are more accurately
described as unsecured creditors.
[14] There is ample authority for the proposition that the
relationship that exists between a bank and its customer is that
of debtor and creditor: see Foley v. Hill (1848), 2 H.L.C. 28, 9
E.R. 1002; Bertolo v. Bank of Montreal (1986), 57 O.R. (2d) 577
(C.A.).  Special facts would have to be pleaded before that
relationship could be transformed into a fiduciary one as in
Lloyd&#146;s Bank Ltd. v. Bundy [1975] 1Q.B. 326 (C.A.).  The
relationship between a bank and the guarantor of its customer&#146;s
loan is determined by the terms of the guarantee.  The conditions
under which the guarantor can be excused has most recently been
discussed by the Supreme Court of Canada in Manulife Bank of
Canada v. Conlin [1996] 3 S.C.R. 415.
[15] As indicated, we are restricted to an examination of the
relationship between the TD Bank and unsecured creditors of its
customers who are not guarantors and do not suggest that they
have any exposure to the TD Bank arising out of the default by
the principal debtors of the bank.  What they have in common with
the TD Bank is that they have all lent money to the same
corporate entities. The appellants could provide no authority for
the proposition that a bank owes some special duty of care to
other creditors of its customers, simply because they are
creditors, to disclose to them its information as to the
creditworthiness of their common debtors.  There is certainly no
suggestion that the plaintiffs by counterclaim had some
concomitant obligation to share with the TD Bank any information
that they might have on the subject.  They are all creditors, and
the submission that the TD Bank qua creditor has an unilateral
duty to other creditors to keep them abreast of the financial
status of its customers, is totally lacking in authority.  Apart
from certain provisions in our insolvency laws or special
circumstances that have not been pleaded, I know of no reason why
one creditor is not entitled to consider its own interest in
assessing the credit worthiness of its borrowers without alerting
other creditors of its customer as to matters of concern.
[16] I think that this disposes of the claim that the TD Bank is
in a fiduciary relationship with these particular creditors or
owes them a special duty to protect their investment in the
principal debtors.  However, it is said of them in the amended
counterclaim that they were known to the TD Bank or ought to have
been known to it as being controlled, closely related or
otherwise sufficiently proximal to the defendant guarantors, &#147;and
as such&#148;, that the proposed plaintiffs would rely on
communications and information given to any one of the defendant
guarantors by the TD Bank in making their investment decisions.
[17] This brings us to the second issue and the branch of the
pleadings in which it is alleged that the TD Bank is liable for
the tort of negligent misrepresentation.  From a reading of the
pleadings, it emerges that the corporate defendant Llewellyn
Sifton Smith Family Holdings Inc., the individual defendants
including Curtis and the added plaintiff by counterclaim, Cowan,
were effectively partners in Balmoral Partners, a corporation
that they controlled as shareholders and which in turn controlled
the other corporate entities that were customers of the TD Bank.
These shareholders had their own personal corporate vehicles that
acted as lenders to Balmoral Partners and its subsidiaries and
also as guarantor for their indebtedness to the TD Bank.  When
Nadim informed the TD Bank that the partner Curtis had arranged
for a Balmoral Trade cheque payable to Nadim, and thereby &#147;put
the Bank on notice that Curtis was not to be trusted&#148;, the TD
Bank drew this to the attention of another of the partners,
Forsythe.  Forsythe&#146;s response was to ask the bank to &#147;do a
background check&#148; on his partner Curtis.  The appellants
maintain, probably correctly, that in talking to Forsythe, the TD
Bank was in effect talking to all the partners.  As such, they
maintain that Forsythe would convey to the others that the TD
Bank had declined the request and had advised Forsythe that there
was nothing to worry about.  This is pleaded by those defendants
who are guarantors in their counterclaim.  The same position,
i.e. the allegations in paragraphs 13 to 18, is repeated with
respect to those added plaintiffs by counterclaim who are merely
investors.  It seems to be the specific factual basis for
alleging that the TD Bank &#147;owed them and the Principal Debtors an
implied contractual, as well as a common law and fiduciary duty
of care&#148;.
[18] In the recent case of Ingles v. Tutaluk Construction  Ltd.
2000 SCC 12, released March 2, 2000, Bastarache J. for the
Supreme Court of Canada (at para. 16) stated that the Court
affirmed in Ryan v. Victoria (City) (1999), 168 D.L.R. (4th) 513
that the two-part  Anns/Kamloops test (Anns v. Merton London
Borough Council [1978] A.C. 728 (C.A.); Kamloops (City of) v.
Neilsen [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2 is the appropriate test for determining
whether a private or public actor owes a duty of care such that
the law can impose on the actor a private law liability in a
civil suit for breach of that duty.
[19] In Ryan v. Victoria (City), the Court was dealing with the
effect of statutory authority on the civil liability of railways.
Major J., speaking for the Court stated (at p.524) that the duty
of care owed by a railway with respect to public crossings is
determined, as it is for other private and public actors, under
the two-step test in Anns as adopted by the Court in Kamloops
&#147;and numerous subsequent decisions&#148;.  He then stated that the
first step of the Anns/Kamloops test presented a relatively low
threshold, namely whether a relationship of &#147;proximity&#148; existed
between the parties such that it was reasonably foreseeable that
a careless act by the railway could result in injury to the
plaintiff.
[20] The second step is an analysis of the duty of care
established in the first step to determine if there are any
statutory or judicial impediments to imposing liability.  As
Major J. stated at p.525:
          </pre>
    <pre>         The existence of a duty of care must be considered
	 in light of all relevant circumstances, including
	 any applicable statutes or regulations.  Thus a
	 legislative exemption from liability can negate a
	 duty of care in circumstances where that duty would
         otherwise arise.  The same holds true for immunities
	 created by the courts.  A policy decision is made in
	 such cases to prevent the law of negligence from
	 regulating certain relationships or relieving certain
	 injuries, notwithstanding a finding of proximity
	 between the parties. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[21] Accordingly, the Anns/Kamloops analysis calls for two
findings: (1) proximity and (2) an absence of statutory or
judicial immunity.  However, there is a problem of application to
the case in appeal because almost all the reported cases that
apply the Anns/Kamloops analysis involve public actors.
Fortunately, one application to the private sector is almost
dispositive of this case.  It is Hercules Management Ltd. v.
Ernst &amp; Young [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165 and deals with the tort of
negligent misrepresentation.  Here, La Forest J., for the Court,
applied the two-part Anns/Kamloops test, i.e. whether the
respondents owe to the appellants a duty of care for their
alleged negligent acts depends on (a) whether a prima facie duty
of care is owed, and (b) whether that duty, if it exists, is
negated or limited by policy decisions.
[22] Hercules Management was an action against auditors of two
inter-related corporations by three shareholders.  One of the
shareholders was the sole shareholder of one of the corporations,
and the other two were the only shareholders of the second.  The
shareholders claimed that they had suffered investment losses in
the two corporations because of their reliance upon audit reports
of the financial statements of the corporations that the auditors
had been hired to perform and deliver to the corporations and to
their shareholders.
[23] To invert the analysis of La Forest J. and deal with the
last issue first, the Court applied Foss v. Harbottle to hold
that a shareholder&#146;s claim for losses incurred is a derivative
action because individual shareholders have no cause of action
for wrongs done to the corporation.  This takes care of the claim
of the added plaintiff by counterclaim, Cowan, in so far as he is
claiming as a shareholder.  However, the case is more valuable in
its application of the proximity part of the Anns/Kamloops test.
La Forest J. ruled that &#147;proximity&#148; in negligent
misrepresentation cases pertains to some aspect of the
relationship of reliance.  It inheres when (a) the defendant
ought reasonably to foresee that the plaintiff will rely on his
or her representation, and (b) reliance by the plaintiff would,
in the particular circumstances of the case, be reasonable.
[24] I doubt very much that a court would hold that the TD Bank
could foresee that the representations it made to one of the
guarantors of the loans in issue would be relied upon by other
lenders to the Balmoral group of companies, and much less that it
would be reasonable for them to do so.  As La Forest J. stated,
there must first be a finding that there was some aspect of
reliance in the relationship.  Since there is no governing
statute in this case to determine proximity as there is with
government actors, the legal basis for finding proximity in the
private sector must lie in the common law. I think I have already
established that such reliance does not arise out of the mere
fact that the TD Bank is one of a number of creditors of the
principal debtors.  It can only be created from facts peculiar to
the case.  The pleadings treat Forsythe as the recipient and the
disseminator of the representations in issue.  The statements to
him are relied upon by all the shareholder partners, all the
guarantors and all of the investors.   However, the pleadings
provide no support for a finding of reliance.  Quite the
contrary.  The pleadings allege that the TD Bank, after passing
along to Forsythe what the pleadings describe as notice of the
dishonesty of one his partner, declined Forsythe&#146;s request to
investigate the impugned partner further.  How can such
reluctance to assume further responsibility for the conduct of
Forsythe&#146;s partner create a relationship of reliance?  Clearly,
it can not.  There is no reliance, no proximity and no duty of
care.
[25] I am mindful that the investors seeking to be added as
parties insist that the statement &#147;there was nothing to worry
about&#148; is a representation that they could rely upon.  However,
that presupposes a relationship of reliance in the first place.
This latter statement is the alleged negligent representation,
but the court does not concern itself with negligent acts if
there is no duty of care. There are no facts pleaded that meet
the first step of the Anns/Kamloops analysis.
[26] Additionally, even if the analysis could survive the first
step of the test, it would most assuredly founder on the second.
In Hercules Management, La Forest J. enunciated the policy
consideration that centres on the possibility that the defendant
might be exposed to a &#147;liability of indeterminate amount for an
indeterminate time to an indeterminate class&#148;.  He applied this
policy consideration to negate the prima facie duty of care that
he had already found to exist in Hercules Management
notwithstanding that the class involved was very narrow: it
consisted of the three shareholders that commissioned the audits
and to whom they were delivered.  The duty of care in this case
was negated by the fact that the audit reports were prepared for
the shareholders in question to allow them to exercise their role
as a class to oversee the corporations&#146; affairs at their annual
general meetings.  It was not intended to assist the individual
shareholders to protect their own investments in the corporations
but to permit informed judgments on their part to make decisions
to safeguard the interests of the corporations. (p.210)
[27] Accordingly the mere use of the information for a use to
which it was not intended was enough to negate the duty of care
owed to those to whom the reports were delivered.  This is so
even where the uncontradicted evidence, and all common sense,
supports the insistence of the three individuals that they did
rely upon the audits for their decisions to invest further moneys
in the corporations.  Compare this to the case in appeal where
whatever was said to Forsythe about not worrying about the
honesty of his partner related at the highest to the state of the
accounts of the principal debtors and the contingent liability of
the guarantors.  On the analysis of Hercules Management, a court
would have to hold that it was not intended as an assurance that
Forsythe and any others he chose to speak to should invest
additional moneys in the corporations in issue.
[28] Of course, the real concern in the case in appeal is not the
use to which the information was put, but the policy
consideration that it could create an indeterminate liability to
virtually an unlimited class.  Who knows to whom Forsythe might
have spoken and to whom those he spoke to may have spoken and
what gloss could have been placed on the alleged assurances of
the TD Bank about Curtis.  This was certainly the concern of
Juriansz J. who quoted counsel for the appellants as agreeing
that the class could include a guarantor&#146;s barber.  These
pleadings will not satisfy the policy requirement of La Forest
J.&#146;s analysis.  In my opinion, there is no basis in these
pleadings for the tort of negligent misrepresentation.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[29] Juriansz J. gave full and careful reasons for allowing the
appeal and setting aside the order of Master Birnbaum.  In the
result, the motion to add the proposed plaintiffs by counter
claim is dismissed.  While the analysis of Juriansz J. does not
proceed precisely along the lines of my own, I agree with it.
