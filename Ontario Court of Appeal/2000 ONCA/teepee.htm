</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of the Divisional Court (Keenan, Cumming
and Swinton JJ.) dated May 20, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CARTHY J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This appeal raises a neat point which has vexed courts
dealing with construction liens for a decade. Those without a
devotion to lien esoterica need read no further.
[2]  If a lien action is not set down for trial within two years
of its institution, must the entire action be dismissed or is
there a discretion to permit a claim on the contract to continue?</pre>
    <pre>[3]   Section  46(1) of the Construction Lien Act,  R.S.O.  1990,
c.C.30 reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>46. &#150; (1) Where a perfected lien that attaches to 
the premises has expired under section 37, the court, 
upon the motion of any person, shall declare that the 
lien has expired and shall make an order dismissing 
the action to enforce that lien and vacating the 
registration of a claim for lien and the certificate
of action in respect of that action.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[4]  Section 47(1) reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>47. &#150; (1)  Upon motion, the court may,</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <pre>(a)  order the discharge of a lien;</pre>
          <pre>(b)  order that the registration of,</pre>
          <blockquote>
            <pre>(i)  a claim for lien, or</pre>
            <pre>(ii) a certificate of action,</pre>
            <pre>or both, be vacated;</pre>
          </blockquote>
          <pre>(c)  declare, where written notice of a 
lien has been given, that the lien has 
expired, or that the written notice of 
the lien shall no longer bind the person 
to whom it was given; or</pre>
          <pre>(d)  dismiss an action,</pre>
          <pre>(e)  upon any proper ground and subject 
to any terms and conditions that the court 
considers appropriate in the circumstances.</pre>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[5]  Those on one side of the debate say the whole action must be
dismissed under s.46. Those on the other side emphasize the words
&#147;action to enforce that lien&#148; in s. 46(1) and, comparing this to
the words &#147;dismiss an action&#148; in s. 47(1)(d), conclude that only
the lien claim must be dismissed under s.46 with a discretion to
dismiss the whole action under s.47.</pre>
    <pre><strong>THE FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[6]  The plaintiffs (respondents) issued a claim for a lien
combined with a claim for payment of $73,774.36. The defendant,
Niran (appellant), filed a defence and a counterclaim seeking,
inter alia, recovery of the costs of posting a bond to vacate the
liens and damages for breach of contract. The lien expired on
October 24, 1996, pursuant to s. 37 of the Act, because the
action had not been set down for trial prior to the expiry of two
years from commencement of the action. In May of 1998, Niran
brought a motion for an order declaring the lien had expired,
dismissing the action, and allowing summary judgment on the
portion of the counterclaim seeking recovery of bond premiums
paid. The plaintiffs filed no affidavit evidence on the motion.
[7]  The endorsement of Master Saunders reads:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Order to go dismissing action; for judgment to the
defendant Niran on its counterclaim in the sum of 
$9,626.00 plus prejudgment and postjudgment interest, 
plus costs to defendant Niran fixed at $6,750.00 for 
the action, the counterclaim and this motion, payable 
forthwith by the plaintiffs to the said defendant Niran.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[8]  Although there was some dispute before this court as to
whether the Master was acting under both s.46 and s.47 or solely
under s.46, I am satisfied from the factums filed in the Master&#146;s
court that the exercise of discretion was argued. Both the
factums of the plaintiffs and those of the defendant asserted
that he had such a discretion and both were presented in a form
suggesting that, to dismiss the action entirely, he must exercise
that discretion. I am therefore satisfied that the Master acted
under both s.46 and s.47(1)(d) and that his reasons are sparse
because, in the circumstance of there being no significant
activity in the proceeding for four years and no material filed
by the plaintiffs on the motion, it was obvious that there was no
basis for the exercise of discretion in favour of the plaintiffs.
[9]  An appeal was launched by the plaintiffs to the Divisional
Court and, along the way, Campbell J. ordered security for costs
covering the costs of $6,750 ordered by Master Saunders and
$5,000 for the appeal to the Divisional Court.
[10]  The  Divisional Court&#146;s reasons (Keenan,  Cumming,  Swinton
JJ.) on the merits read:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>The issue is whether the Master erred in dismissing 
the plaintiff&#146;s action. Pursuant to Section 46 of 
the Construction Lien Act, the Master had jurisdiction 
to dismiss the lien claim in an action to enforce the 
lien because the lien had expired.  Respondent&#146;s 
counsel conceded that the Master relied on Section
46(1) in dismissing the action.</pre>
        <pre>We are of the view that Mast Construction v. Appleton, 
Eurocor Ltd. v. Vernich and Golden City v. Iona 
Corporation correctly hold that an action under the
Construction Lien Act can include a contract claim as 
well as lien claim and that a dismissal of lien claim 
under Section 46(1) because the lien has expired does 
not dispose of the contract claim. Even if the claim 
for lien is dismissed, the Court has discretion
whether to dismiss a claim for breach of contract made 
in the same action pursuant to Section 47(1)(d).</pre>
        <pre>The Master gave no reasons for his decision. Therefore, 
we are unable to discern whether the Master realized  
that there was a claim in contract as well as a lien 
claim in the action; nor, if so whether he addressed
the issue of his discretion under Section 47(1)(d).</pre>
        <pre>The failure to give any reasons and to make any 
statement with respect to the exercise of his discretion 
deprives the reviewing court of a record to assess the
proper exercise of this discretion. This constitutes an 
error of law. Therefore, for those reasons, the Master&#146;s 
order is set aside. The order of Campbell J. for (security
for) costs is vacated and the funds paid out to 
plaintiffs.</pre>
        <pre>The issue of the costs of the lien claim and the issue 
of the bond premiums are matters to be disposed of by 
the trial judge.  We make no order as to the costs of the
motion for security for costs before Campbell J. We order 
costs of this appeal be fixed at $3,000 and paid to the 
appellant forthwith.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[11] Leave was granted to appeal to this court. Before dealing
with the legal issue, I would observe that the defendant denies
making the concession referred to in paragraph one of the reasons
and says that he stated the opposite to the court. This would be
consistent with the defendant&#146;s position throughout and I
conclude that there was a misunderstanding. That &#147;concession&#148; may
have been why the Divisional Court did not give its own reasoned
basis for the exercise of a discretion under s.47(1)(d) in place
of that of the Master. In my view, it should have done so if
s.47(1)(d) was presented as a basis for relief, as I have
heretofore concluded it was. It would only be if s.47 had never
been raised for consideration that the defendant&#146;s motion could
be appropriately dismissed without articulated reasons for
exercising a discretion.</pre>
    <pre><strong>ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[12] The Construction Lien Act serves a specialized purpose in a
narrow field. A lien claimant may commence an action, provide
shelter for other claimants, obtain a form of execution before
judgment, and proceed to trial in summary fashion without
production of documents, discovery or other interlocutory steps
except by leave. A plaintiff may join with a lien claim a claim
for breach of contract and a defendant may counterclaim in
respect of any claim against the plaintiff. There may also be
cross-claims and third party claims. There are no appeals from
interlocutory orders.
[13] This court pointed out in A.J. (Archie) Goodale Ltd. v.
Risidore Brothers Ltd. (1975), 8 O.R. (2d) 427 (C.A.) at 432
that, where it is apparent at any early stage that the plaintiff
has no basis for a lien claim, it would be an abuse of process to
allow the summary procedures to be used as a subterfuge for
processing a personal claim in summary fashion. However, in that
case, it was not discovered until after a hearing that there was
no lien claim and, to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings, a
personal judgment was granted. The present ss.46 and 47 were not
at issue in that case. The finding was that there was never a
valid lien claim; not that a lien had expired.
[14] In Bird Construction Co. v. C. S. Yachts Ltd., (1990) 46
C.L.R. 192 (O&#146;Leary, Southey and Sutherland JJ.), the Ontario
Divisional Court held, without elaboration, that, where s.46(1)
is applicable, the entire action, including claims beyond a lien
claim, must be dismissed. &#147;There is but one action &#133;. and the
section speaks of dismissing the action&#148; (at p.192).
[15] Four months later, in 1990, the Divisional Court,
differently constituted, came to the opposite conclusion in Mast
Construction v. Appleton, delivered November 5, 1990
(O&#146;Driscoll, Campbell and Granger JJ.).
[16] O&#146;Driscoll J. stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>Although there was jurisdiction under s.46 to dismiss 
the action to enforce the lien, there was no such 
jurisdiction under s.46 to make such an order with 
respect to the personal contract claim.</pre>
        <pre>It is clear from ss. 38, 57 and 65 that the personal 
contract action is separate from and, therefore, 
survives the dismissal of the lien claim.</pre>
        <pre>The personal contract action might properly have been 
the subject of a motion under s.47 with notice and with 
full disclosure. There was no notice and no disclosure 
of the kind required under s.47.  In the absence of 
such notice and disclosure, there was no proper basis 
to dismiss the personal contract action.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[17] In August of 1991, the Divisional Court, in Benjamin Schultz
&amp; Associates Ltd. v. Samet (1991), 83 D.L.R. (4th) 574, followed
Bird, without reference to Mast.
[18]  The  Divisional  Court in the instant case  followed  Mast,
again without elaboration.
[19] The issue was more fully canvassed by Kozak J. in 612354
Ontario Ltd. v. Tonecraft Corp. (1991), 5 O.R. (3d) 764 (Gen.
Div.). There, a counterclaim was filed against the plaintiff&#146;s
claim on the contract, full discovery and production were
completed on consent, and the lien claim was dismissed, as
expired under s.46(1). The defendant sought a dismissal of the
action. Kozak J. reviewed the earlier authorities, holding that,
where the lien expires before trial, the whole action must be
dismissed and concluded:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>To dismiss such an action because of the expiration 
of the lien prior to trial would result in unfairness 
and undue hardship for the plaintiff. It would require 
the plaintiff to commence a fresh action for personal 
judgment, and require that it proceed through the 
various interlocutory proceedings again in bringing
the matter on for trial. To some extent, the court could
alleviate some of the hardship, should the action be 
dismissed, by imposing terms and conditions that would 
make applicable the productions and discoveries 
conducted to the new action. However the dismissal of 
the personal action even upon such favourable terms 
would still result in a multiplicity of proceedings, and
would not be in keeping with the just, most expeditious,
and least expensive determination of every civil proceeding
on its merits as generally provided for in the Rules of 
Civil Procedure.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[20] This approach was adopted in Eurocor Ltd. v. Vernich (1992),
9 O.R. (3d) 631 (Gen. Div.) by Austin J. who concluded at p.639:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>As I understand those cases, Mast and Schultz are in
conflict with one another. As a result, I am in a 
position where I can choose between them. Section 46(1) 
does not refer to &#147;an order dismissing the action&#148;, but 
to &#147;an order dismissing the action to enforce that 
lien&#148; [emphasis added by Austin J.].  Neither s.1(1) 
nor s.50 of the Act confines an action commenced under 
the Act to lien claims. The reasoning of Kozak J. which 
has regard to the avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings 
appeals to me. The Vernichs have had full production and 
discovery; no complaint is made in that regard. I therefore 
conclude that, at least in the present case, the court has 
a discretion to split the action and that that discretion 
should be exercised in favour of splitting.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[21] The circle was completed in Golden City Ceramic &amp; Tile Co.
v. Iona Corp. (1993), 106 D.L.R. (4th) 532 where the Ontario
Divisional Court concurred with the reasoning of Austin J. in
Eurocor.</pre>
    <pre><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[22] It is not surprising that there have been opposing
interpretations of these provisions. The words in s.46(1)
&#147;dismissing the action to enforce that lien&#148; ostensibly means the
whole action and it is only when the words &#147;dismiss an action&#148;
are seen in s.47(1)(d) that the thought of a difference of
meaning between the two arises. Returning to s.46(1), the analyst
must question why the words &#147;to enforce that lien&#148; were added
when &#147;dismissing the action&#148; would suffice to embrace the whole
action.
[23] We have, in my view, a true ambiguity that must be resolved
by examining the purpose of the statute and the efficacy of
either interpretation to serve that purpose within the general
litigation framework.
[24] The broad purpose of the legislation is to provide an
efficient means of dealing with trade claimants that would
otherwise be left behind without security if unpaid on a building
project where payments typically flow from above and follow
performance. On a failing or failed project, there may be many
such claimants. In setting down the rules, the Act does not go so
far as to restrict claims thereunder to lien claims. Contract
claims by the plaintiff and counterclaims of any kind are
permitted, presumably to avoid duplication of proceedings. In my
view, avoidance of multiplicity of proceedings is the element of
the Act that provides the direction for the interpretation of
s.46(1) and s.47(1)(d). Howland J.A., in A.J. (Archie) Goodale
Ltd., set the tone for interpretation by observing that the Act
should not be available as a subterfuge for pursuing an ordinary
action by summary procedure; but where all of the steps have been
taken and a conclusion reached at a hearing, the court should not
dismiss the action for lack of a lien claim and thus compel a
further proceeding concerning the same issue. The same reasoning
suggests that the court has available the discretion to dismiss
or to permit the action to proceed without the lien claim, as the
circumstances dictate.
[25] All of the arguments against denying a defendant the
procedures and protections of the usual form of litigation can be
answered by the court&#146;s discretion under s.47(1)(d) to dismiss
the action because the defendant will be prejudiced or because
little has transpired in the action that would be duplicated or
by imposing conditions for continuance to assure protection of
the defendant. The legislature intended more than claims for
liens to be litigated in lien claim actions and that intention is
best served by an interpretation of s.46(1) and s.47(1)(d) that
leaves it to the court to monitor the interests of the parties
and the procedure to be followed.
[26] I, therefore, agree with the Divisional Court&#146;s
interpretation of the Act, but not with its disposition. My
conclusion, stated earlier, that the Master did exercise a
discretion under s.47(1)(d), albeit soundlessly, is buttressed
when I read the factums before him. The defendant asserted that
the court must dismiss the lien action and had a discretion to
continue the other claims if the state of the proceedings
justified continuance. The plaintiff&#146;s factum said that the court
could not dismiss the personal claim under s.46(1), but that
courts have allowed contract claims to continue where appropriate
to avoid multiplicity of proceedings. They were on common ground
before a very experienced Master. He exercised his discretion and
concluded that the entire action should be dismissed and I see no
arguable choice. Nothing of consequence had been done in the
proceeding for four years and to permit the claim to go forward
would be tantamount to instituting a personal contract claim in
the guise of a lien action. I would, therefore, uphold the
Master&#146;s order dismissing the claim.
[27] The summary judgment application for a portion of the
counterclaim was not answered by material or argument in the
factums here or below and the Master&#146;s order in that respect
should be upheld.
[28] An order should go for payment out to the defendant, Niran,
of the amounts paid in pursuant to the order of Campbell J.,
together with accrued interest to be applied against the costs
here and below.
[29] The order of the Divisional Court is set aside, the order of
the Master is reinstated, and payment is to be made on the terms
set out above. Costs in this court and in the Divisional Court to
the defendant, Niran, the costs before the Master to be as fixed
by him.</pre>
