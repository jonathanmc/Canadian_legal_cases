    <pre>On appeal from the conviction of Ewaschuk J. sitting with a jury
dated October 22, 1996.
</pre>
    <pre>SHARPE J.A.:
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant was convicted of second degree murder. The
Crown&#146;s case was entirely circumstantial. The appellant raises a
number of grounds of appeal against conviction. The primary
ground is that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the
jury on the difference between direct and circumstantial evidence
and in failing to explain the appropriate method of reasoning to
be applied to circumstantial evidence.</pre>
    <pre>Overview</pre>
    <pre>[2]  The body of  Mala Devi Lachman was found on the morning of
November 15, 1994 in the Old Mill River in Toronto. She had been
strangled and her body had several stab wounds, including
mutilation of her vagina.  Semen was found in her vagina.
[3]  In July 1994, Ms. Lachman and the appellant took out joint
policies of life insurance for $400,000 each. The appellant was
the sole beneficiary of the deceased&#146;s policy. The life insurance
policies aroused police suspicions. When questioned by the
police, the appellant denied any involvement in the death of the
deceased. He also denied any sexual relationship with her. He
agreed to provide the police with bodily samples. The appellant&#146;s
DNA matched that of the semen found in the vagina of the
deceased. The appellant then admitted a sexual relationship with
the deceased and said that he had had intercourse with her in his
car on the morning of her death. However, he denied any
involvement in her death.
[4]  The appellant was arrested and charged with first degree
murder. The Crown&#146;s theory was that the appellant was in
financial difficulty and that he murdered Ms. Lachman to secure
the insurance money. The appellant testified at trial and denied
any involvement in the death of Ms. Lachman. He testified that
the mutual life insurance had been purchased at the suggestion of
the deceased as they had planned to go into business together and
he was significantly older.
[5]  After a 14 day trial, the appellant was acquitted of first
degree murder but convicted of second degree murder and sentenced
to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 16 years.</pre>
    <pre>Issues
</pre>
    <pre>1.   Should the trial judge have explained to the jury the
     difference between direct and circumstantial evidence and 
     should he have instructed the jury as to the appropriate 
     method of reasoning to be applied to circumstantial evidence?
2.   Did the trial judge err in his direction on reasonable doubt?
3.   Was the appellant unfairly prejudiced by speculative
     positions taken by the Crown and by the failure of the trial
     judge to deal properly with those positions?
4.   Did manner in which the trial judge left manslaughter as a
     possible verdict unfairly prejudice the appellant?
5.   Did the trial judge fail to deal adequately with the
     evidence of Deonarine Ramrattan as to statements made by the
     deceased prior to her death?
6.   Did the trial judge misstate a material item of evidence by
     suggesting that the appellant had changed his story during cross-
     examination?</pre>
    <pre>Facts</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Mala Lachman was 26 years of age and lived with her parents.
Ms. Lachman and her family had immigrated from Guyana and, at the
time of her death, she was planning to return to Guyana to get
married.  She had booked an airplane ticket to leave Toronto
November 22, 1994 and, on the weekend prior to her death, she
moved luggage and other belongings to the residence of her
sister, Deonarine Ramrattan, in Mississauga.
[7]  The deceased&#146;s sister, Deonarine Ramrattan, gave evidence as
to certain conversations she had with the deceased which were
ruled admissible pursuant to R. v. Khan (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 92
(S.C.C.).  Ramrattan testified that her sister told her about a
business deal she had with a Guyanese man to run a grocery store
on Queen Street when she returned from her wedding trip to
Guyana.  The deceased had told her sister that she had co-signed
a $400,000 loan at the man&#146;s request.  Ramrattan further
testified that the deceased told her two weeks before her death
that she had lent the man $2,000 for new shelves for his store.
The deceased told her that she was having difficulty getting the
money back and that she needed the money to pay for her ticket to
Guyana.  When she left Ramrattan&#146;s apartment on the day of her
death, the deceased told Ramrattan that she was to go to his
store to pick up her money but that she was very scared and upset
and that she was afraid of meeting him because he had been asking
her many times to come to the store and she could not understand
why.  She told her sister that the man had explained to her that
he did not have the money and that it would be necessary to
travel to Mississauga to meet someone and to get the money.
[8]  Ms. Ramrattan&#146;s evidence was strongly challenged by the
appellant at trial.  Ms. Ramrattan had given several statements
to the police but it was not until July 23, 1996, nine weeks
before the commencement of the appellant&#146;s trial, that she told
the police of the conversations referred to above.  Several
statements made by Ms. Ramrattan as to what her sister had told
her were contradicted by earlier statements she had given to the
police.  She specifically told the police that her sister had
never spoken to her about going into business or about a bank
loan.  Ms. Ramrattan admitted that she had lied to the police in
certain respects.  Her explanation was that she felt guilty at
what had happened to her sister and started blaming herself as
her sister had asked her to accompany her to collect the $2,000
loan on the night of her death.
[9]  A cashier at the Dufferin Mall saw the deceased between 6:00
and 7:00 p.m. on November 14, 1994.  Ms. Lachman&#146;s body was found
on the morning of November 15, 1994 at about 7:30 a.m.  The body
was naked and lying in a small pool of water underneath a bridge.
The deceased&#146;s blood was found on the cement cap at the top of
the bridge railing.  The deceased died as a result of
strangulation.  She also had other injuries including blunt force
lacerations on her scalp, a fractured left ankle, knife wounds on
both her hands consistent with having defended herself against a
knife attack and a stab wound 7.5 cm long extending from her
vagina into her anal canal.  She also had abrasions on her
shoulder and leg consistent with having been dragged over a
concrete cap.  Semen was found in the deceased&#146;s vagina.  DNA
analysis indicated that the semen was that of the appellant.
[10] Deonauth Persaud, an insurance agent, gave evidence as to
the placement of the $400,000 life insurance policy.  He was
contacted by the appellant.  They later met at a public library.
The deceased was not with the appellant.  The appellant told
Persaud that he had been operating a business for 2 ½ years and
that the deceased was his partner.  Persaud met the appellant and
the deceased in June 1994 when arrangements for the life
insurance were made.  Both the appellant and the deceased filled
out applications.
[11] When Persaud learned of the death of Ms. Lachman from a
television news report, he called the appellant.  Persaud
explained that he had an obligation to report the death to the
insurance company.  Persaud testified that the appellant asked
him if he could hold off in the hope that the perpetrators of the
crime might be caught, so that he would avoid potential police
harassment or questions.  Persaud explained that he had a duty to
inform the insurer of the death and the appellant appeared to
understand.  On November 25, 1994, Persaud sent a proof of claim
to the appellant.  The appellant did not submit the proof of
claim nor did he make any claim under the policy.
[12] It was the appellant&#146;s evidence that the deceased had
approached him in early 1994 about going into business together.
He testified that she told him she was marrying a doctor in
Guyana who would supply her with some money and that she thought
that insurance should be obtained because of the appellant&#146;s
greater age.  He obtained both policies from Persaud in July
1994.  He kept the deceased&#146;s policy in his store at her request
and made payments on both policies pending the deceased&#146;s return
from her wedding trip to Guyana.
[13] The appellant testified that he had met the deceased when
she came to his store as a customer.  He stated that, after
discussing the projected business partnership and obtaining life
insurance, they became physically attracted to each other and a
sexual relationship began in September 1994.
[14] It was the appellant&#146;s evidence that on November 14, he took
his daughter to school, bought some merchandise from a
wholesaler, and then met the deceased at about 9:00 a.m.  He
testified that they had sex in his car and that he dropped her
off before returning to his store at 9:40 or 10:00 a.m.  He
testified that the deceased came to his store twice during the
afternoon.  She came first about 1:00 p.m. to buy some groceries.
She returned later between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. After making some
small purchases, she rushed out and told the appellant she was
going to the Dufferin Mall and then to her sister&#146;s apartment in
Mississauga.  The cash register tapes from the store indicated it
was closed at 8:33 p.m.   The appellant arrived home at about
10:00 p.m.  His wife noted no marks or stains on him or on his
clothing.
[15] Lee Richmond and Gerrald McCaffery lived in an apartment one
floor above ground level beside the appellant&#146;s store.  Ms.
Richmond testified that on the evening of November 14, 1994, she
saw a man placing a body in the trunk of a car at the rear of the
appellant&#146;s store.  She said she could see the whole body and
that the person was a woman.  She described the man as being not
white with dark hair, small to medium build, wearing neutral
coloured slacks and a light coloured suit.  She said that the
woman was middle aged with olive skin and dark, medium length
hair, wearing black slacks and a light coloured buttoned shirt.
Other witnesses, namely, the deceased&#146;s sisters and a friend,
described her as wearing cream-coloured clothing on that day.
[16] Ms. Richmond testified that the man appeared to have
difficulty putting the body into the trunk and that she reported
her observations to Mr. McCaffery.  McCaffery looked and saw a
man standing beside a car struggling to put a carpet into the
trunk.  McCaffery thought that this had occurred between 8:00
p.m. and midnight, perhaps 11:00 p.m.  Richmond estimated the
time to be 11:00 p.m.  McCaffery told Richmond he thought she was
mistaken and she returned to the verandah.  At that time she saw
a man putting a beige rug into his trunk.  Both describe the car
as being large and light-coloured, possibly white.  The appellant
owned several cars but none matched this description.  Richmond
was vigorously cross-examined.  She admitted that at the time she
was reading a book called The History of Surrealism and that she
had &#147;seen images&#148;.
[17] Considerable evidence was led concerning the financial
circumstances of the appellant.  In 1994, the appellant was
married with two children, an 11 year old daughter and a 25 year
old son.  He immigrated to Canada from Guyana in 1981 and
acquired the Jameson Market on Queen Street West in 1990.  His
wife was employed as a trust company mortgage renewal officer.
The appellant testified that he had substantial investments in
Guyana.  The matrimonial home was jointly owned and subject to
two mortgages which were current.  The appellant had acquired two
other properties jointly with his sister-in-law but mortgage
payments had been allowed to go into default.  A second rental
property was similarly abandoned when his sister-in-law decided
to cease making payments.
[18] The Jameson Market was acquired for $65,000.  The
appellant&#146;s brother lent him money to finance the purchase.  The
Jameson Market operated from rented premises and conducted a
combined retail and wholesale business.  The evidence suggested
that the business was a marginal one, but the appellant insisted
that the income was not accurately reflected by the books and
cash register tapes which were seized by the police and that
other records had been lost.  The appellant put the business up
for sale in September 1994 but he denied at trial that he was in
serious debt or in any kind of financial difficulty.


Analysis</pre>
    <pre>Issue 1:  Should the trial judge have explained to the jury the
difference between direct and circumstantial evidence and should
he have instructed the jury as to appropriate method of reasoning
to be applied to circumstantial evidence?</pre>
    <pre>[19] The trial judge did not explain to the jury the difference
between direct circumstantial evidence. After directing the jury
on the presumption of innocence and the burden on the Crown to
prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt (the
adequacy of which I will discuss below), the trial judge gave the
jury the three part instruction mandated by R. v. W.(D.) (1991),
63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) and then stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          In this case  the Crown&#146;s case  is completely
	  circumstantial.   There is no direct evidence
	  that the  accused killed Ms Lachman.   No one
	  saw the accused kill Ms Lachman, and he never
	  admitted  that  fact.    Thus,  you  must  be
	  satisfied   that   on   the   basis   of  the
          circumstantial evidence that you do accept as
	  credible and reliable, that the only rational
	  and logical conclusion is that the accused is
	  guilty.
          </pre>
    <pre>          In    other    words    the Crown  must  have
          proven   the   accused&#146;s   guilt   beyond   a
          reasonable doubt which, conversely put, means
          the   absence   of   any   reasonable   doubt
          whatsoever.   The  key words  of  course  are
          &#147;reasonable   doubt&#148;,  not   conjectural   or
          speculative doubt.</pre>
    <pre>[20] There is no other specific reference to the words
&#147;circumstantial evidence&#148; in the trial judge&#146;s charge. While he
cautioned the jury against making speculative findings, the trial
judge did not specifically instruct the jury on the reasoning
process it should follow in assessing circumstantial evidence.
The appellant&#146;s trial counsel objected to this aspect of the
charge and urged the trial judge to instruct the jury on the
distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence and the
drawing of inferences. The trial judge refused this request.
[21] While the trial judge did not go into the difference between
direct and circumstantial evidence, he did review the evidence in
detail.  He set out in very clear and precise terms the
respective positions of the Crown and the appellant as to the
conclusions the jury ought to draw.
[22] It is submitted by the appellant that as the Crown&#146;s case
was entirely circumstantial, the trial judge&#146;s treatment of
circumstantial evidence amounted to a reversible non-direction.
The appellant contends that the trial judge ought to have first
explained to the jury the difference between direct and
circumstantial evidence, and then to have directed the jury to
follow a two-step process of reasoning in relation to the
evidence. First, they should decide what evidence they believed
and, second, they should determine what inferences should be
drawn from that evidence.
[23] It is common ground that the modern starting point on the
law relating to circumstantial evidence is R. v. Cooper (1977),
34 C.C.C. (2d) 18 (S.C.C.).  In Cooper, Laskin C.J.C., referred
to the Court&#146;s earlier judgments in R. v. Mitchell, [1965] 1
C.C.C. 155 and R. v. John (1970), 2 C.C.C (2d) 157 as attenuating
adherence to the so-called &#147;rule in Hodge&#146;s Case&#148; and went on to
state (at p.22):
          </pre>
    <pre>          The time has come to reject the formula in
	  Hodge&#146;s Case as an inexorable rule of  law
	  in Canada.  Without being dogmatic against
	  any  use of the  formula of the charge  in
	  Hodge&#146;s Case I would leave  the  matter to
	  the good sense of the trial  Judge&#133;,  with
	  the reminder that a charge in terms of the
	  traditional  formula  of  required   proof
	  beyond a reasonable doubt is the safest as
	  well  as  the simplest  way to bring a lay
	  jury to the appreciation of the  burden of
	  proof resting on the Crown in  a  criminal
	  case.</pre>
    <pre>[24] While Laskin C.J.C. was dissenting in the result, the court
was unanimous on this point.  In his majority judgment, Ritchie
J. stated that in a case based upon circumstantial evidence (at
p.33):
          </pre>
    <pre>          It is  enough  if it  is  made plain  to the
	  members of  the  jury  that  before basing a
	  verdict of guilty on circumstantial evidence
          they must be satisfied beyond  a  reasonable
	  doubt that  the guilt  of the accused is the
	  only  reasonable  inference to be drawn from
          the proven facts.  In this regard it will be
	  seen that I agree with the Chief Justice  in
	  his rejection of the  Hodge  formula  as  an
	  inexorable rule of law in Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[25] In R. v. Fleet (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 457 at 464-465, this
court reviewed the jurisprudence on circumstantial evidence and
stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          We read the object of both judgments in Cooper
	  to be the eradication of any formulaic approach
	  to such cases so long as the jury is clearly 
	  made aware of the necessity to find the guilt
          of the accused to be established beyond a 
	  reasonable doubt.  This object may be achieved
	  in more ways than one.  Thus, the trial judge,
	  reviewing the evidence and setting out the 
   	  position of the defence and relating the 	
 	  substantial parts of the evidence to that
	  position, may frame the requisite instruction
	  in the manner he or she considers most 
	  appropriate in the circumstances, for example,
	  by:
          </pre>
    <pre>                (a)   charging  the jury in  accordance
          with the traditional language of proof beyond
          a  reasonable  doubt (per  Laskin  C.J.C.  in
          Cooper);
          </pre>
    <pre>                (b)   charging  the jury in  accordance
          with  that language and pointing out  to  the
          jury  the  other inferences that the  defence
          says  should  be drawn from the evidence  and
          the necessity to acquit the accused if any of
          those  inferences  raises a reasonable  doubt
          (as  the  trial  judge did in Cooper  in  the
          final portion of his recharge); or
          </pre>
    <pre>                (c)  charging the jury that it must  be
          satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that  the
          guilt  of  the accused is the only reasonable
          inference  to be drawn from the proven  facts
          (per  Ritchie J. in Cooper and Dubin J.A.  in
          Elmosri).
          </pre>
    <pre>                The essential requirement is to impress
          upon  the jury the need to find guilt  proven
          beyond  a reasonable doubt and to make  plain
          to  them the manner in which such a doubt can
          arise  in  the context of a case of proof  of
          identity by circumstantial evidence.</pre>
    <pre>[26] In my view, the trial judge&#146;s instruction to the jury in the
case at bar met the requirements of Cooper, supra,  and satisfied
the standard set out by this court in Fleet, supra.  Indeed, the
trial judge instructed the jury in each of the three ways
suggested in that case.  First, he charged the jury in accordance
with the traditional language of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
Second, he carefully charged the jury on the inferences it was
being asked to draw from the evidence and instructed them to
acquit the accused if any of those inferences gave rise to a
reasonable doubt. Third, he clearly instructed the jury that in
order to convict, it must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
that the guilt of the accused is the only reasonable inference to
be drawn from the facts.
[27] The appellant contends that despite Cooper, supra and Fleet,
supra, the appropriate instruction to be given to the jury in a
case based upon circumstantial evidence must now be reassessed in
the light of the Supreme Court of Canada&#146;s judgment in R. v.
Charemski (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 225. I disagree. In Charemski,
the court dealt with the test to be applied on a motion for a
directed verdict. The accused was charged with murder. The
Crown&#146;s case was entirely circumstantial. At the conclusion of
the Crown&#146;s case, the accused moved for a directed verdict on the
ground that there was no evidence on the issue of causation. The
trial judge granted the motion and directed a verdict of
acquittal. This court allowed the Crown&#146;s appeal and set aside
the directed verdict. That decision was upheld on appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada. The appellant submits that the effect of
the judgment is to resurrect the &#147;rule in Hodge&#146;s case&#148; and, by
implication, the need to explain the nature of circumstantial
evidence and the drawing of inferences from such evidence.
Particular reliance is placed on the following passages from the
majority judgment of Bastarache J. at 230 and 234-5:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Where the evidence is purely circumstantial,
	  this Court made it quite clear, [in R. v. 
	  Monteleone [1987] 2 S.C.R. 154] at p.161, 
	  that the issue of whether the standard set in
	  Hodge&#146;s Case has been met is a matter for the
	  jury, and not the judge:  &#147;The question of 
	  whether circumstantial evidence meets the
	  requirement of the so-called rule in Hodge&#146;s
	  Case&#133;is for the jury to determine.  This was
	  settled in Mezzo [Mezzo v. The Queen, [1986]
          1 S.C.R. 802, 27 C.C.C. (3d) 97, 30 D.L.R. 
	  (4th) 161]&#148; (emphasis added).  In other words,
	  whether or not there is a rational explanation
	  for that evidence other than the guilt of the
          accused, is a question for the jury.  To my mind,
	  this view is dispositive of this case and the
	  Court need go no further than to rely on this
	  authority.
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>          In  my  view,  the  trial  judge  should have
          directed   the   jury   according   to    the
          requirement  that a finding  of  guilt  could
          only   be  made  where  there  was  no  other
          rational  explanation for the  circumstantial
          evidence but that the defendant committed the
          crime  (John v. The Queen, [1971] S.C.R.  781

          161).   Making that finding is essentially  a
          factual matter arising from an evaluation  of
          the  evidence.  That assessment  is  properly
          left to the jury.  Judges should not be hasty
          to  encroach on that time-honoured  function,
          particularly      where      well-established
          principles articulated in this Court  provide
          clear  guidance on the circumstances in which
          a question may be withheld from the jury.</pre>
    <pre>[28] These passages should not be taken out of context. The issue
before the court was the respective roles of judge and jury in
relation to circumstantial evidence and whether the trial judge
was entitled to take the case away from the jury.  The entire
thrust of the decision is that it is the jury&#146;s preserve to draw
the appropriate inferences, not the trial judge. The issue
presented in the case at bar, namely, the appropriate instruction
in law to be given the jury in a case resting upon circumstantial
evidence, was not before the court in Charemski, supra. It is
true that in the second passage quoted above, Bastarache J.
referred to the appropriate direction, but in doing so, he
specifically cited R. v. Cooper, supra, as a governing authority.
In light of that reference, and in light of the actual issue
presented in the case, I cannot read Charemski, supra, as
reversing or disturbing what was decided in Cooper, supra.  Nor
do I read the decision as requiring trial judges to deliver
abstract lectures to juries on the differences between direct and
circumstantial evidence.  Moreover, as I have already noted, in
the present case, the trial judge did instruct the jury in
language very similar to that suggested by Bastarache J.  In my
view, Charemski, supra, does not assist the appellant.
[29] The submission advanced by the appellant on this point runs
counter to the steady and unrelenting stream of jurisprudence on
circumstantial evidence over the past thirty years. The modern
approach to the problem of circumstantial evidence, enunciated
clearly in Cooper, supra, and reiterated and reinforced by Fleet,
supra, is to reject a formulaic approach and to deal with all the
evidence in terms of the general principles of reasonable doubt.
Trial judges are given a degree of latitude to formulate the
appropriate instruction as befits the circumstances of the case.
Trial judges are not required to adopt any specific language or
wording, provided the charge conveys to the jury in a clear
fashion the central point, namely, the necessity to find the
guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. In particular,
trial judges are not required to deliver to the jury a general,
abstract lecture on the nature of circumstantial evidence or on
the steps of logic to be followed in assessing circumstantial as
distinct from direct evidence. An academic exercise along those
lines may well confuse rather than assist the jury.  Trial judges
are entitled to conclude that the essential message of the need
to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt can be better
conveyed in other ways.
[30] The trial judge&#146;s instruction in the case at bar conveyed to
the jury in clear and unambiguous terms the respective positions
of the Crown and the defence as to the possible inferences to be
drawn from the evidence.  In his review of the evidence and the
possible inferences to be drawn, the trial judge repeatedly
conveyed to the jury the need to find that the evidence proved
the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.
Accordingly, I would dismiss this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 2:  Did the trial judge err in his direction on reasonable
doubt?</pre>
    <pre>[31] The trial took place before the Supreme Court of Canada
handed down its decision in R. v. Lifchus (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d)
1 in which the Court clarified how trial judges should explain to
juries proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The appellant contends
that by using the following language, commonly found in pre-
Lifchus charges, the trial judge fell into reversible error:
          </pre>
    <pre>    When I speak of reasonable doubt, I use the words in their
    ordinary natural meaning, not as a legal term having some special
    connotation.  Reasonable doubt is essentially self-defining.
    Thus, reasonable doubt is an honest and fair doubt, based upon
    reason and common sense after having considered all of the
    evidence as a whole.  It is a real doubt.  Not an imaginary or
    frivolous doubt born out of sympathy or prejudice.  Reasonable
    doubt must not be based upon conjecture or speculation. (emphasis
    added)</pre>
    <pre>[32] In Lifchus, supra, at p. 9 Cory J. disapproved of explaining
reasonable doubt as an &#147;ordinary concept&#148;. The appellant also
objects to the trial judge&#146;s use of the words &#147;honest&#148;, &#147;fair&#148;
and &#147;real&#148; as synonyms for &#147;reasonable&#148;.
[33] The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in
failing to distinguish between the civil burden of proof on a
balance of probabilities and the criminal burden of proof beyond
a reasonable doubt and in failing to instruct the jury that a
finding that the appellant probably killed the deceased did not
amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In Lifchus, supra, at
p. 12, Cory J. stated that as jurors may have heard of the civil
&#147;balance of probabilities&#148; standard, they should be told not to
apply that standard in a criminal case.
[34] In my view, these departures from what the Supreme Court
held to be appropriate in Lifchus do not warrant a new trial.  As
this court and other courts have repeatedly stated, a jury charge
has to be read as a whole.  In reviewing the evidence and the
elements that the Crown must establish, the trial judge
instructed the jury several times in terms of the three-part R .v
(W.)D, supra, formulation.  He cautioned the jury against
engaging in an &#147;either or&#148; analysis and also cautioned against
engaging in speculation. As already indicated, he instructed the
jury that they should only convict if &#147;the only rational and
logical conclusion is that the accused is guilty&#148;.
[35] While trial judges are now expected to follow the Lifchus
model charge, failure to do so in cases tried before Lifchus,
supra, does not constitute reversible error if the charge conveys
to the jury the special meaning attached to reasonable doubt: R.
v. Arsenault, [1997] O.J. 3977; R. v. Russell, [1999] 1 W.W.R.
684 (Alta. C.A.).  It has been specifically held by this court
that the use of the phrase &#147;ordinary natural meaning&#148; is not
necessarily fatal: R. v. Boyer, [1998] O.J. 1501 (C.A.); R. v.
Atkinson, [1997] O.J. No. 4788 (C.A.).  Similarly, failure to
direct the jury on the difference between the civil balance of
probability standard and the criminal standard of proof beyond a
reasonable doubt is not necessarily fatal: R. v. Barnes (1999)
117 O.A.C. 371, 39 M.V.R. (3d) 256.
[36] In my view, reading the charge as a whole, this jury could
not have been left with any doubt that the burden was on the
Crown to prove every element of the offence beyond a reasonable
doubt rather than on a mere balance of probabilities. Nor do I
think it possible, reading this charge as a whole, to find any
basis for saying that the jury was not given an adequate
explanation of the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 3:  Was the appellant unfairly prejudiced by speculative
positions taken by the Crown and by the failure of the trial
judge to deal properly with those positions?</pre>
    <pre>[37] Mr. Lockyer argues that on a number of occasions the Crown
put purely speculative suggestions to the appellant cross-
examination and to the jury in his closing address. It is further
submitted that the trial judge failed to give adequate direction
to the jury with respect to these speculative positions.
[38] Certain of the deceased&#146;s injuries appeared to be more
consistent with a sexual assault than with a murder for gain.
This aspect of the evidence was inconsistent with the Crown&#146;s
theory that the accused had murdered the deceased to collect on
the insurance policy. Evidence was led of discussions the police
had with the appellant relating to the murders of several
prostitutes in the Parkdale area of Toronto at around the same
time as the death of Ms. Lachman. On cross-examination, the
appellant admitted that he had heard of these murders. Crown
counsel then suggested that the appellant had mutilated the body
of the deceased to make it look like she was another victim of
the same sex killer who had murdered the prostitutes. The accused
denied the suggestion. Neither counsel referred to this in
closing argument.  Nonetheless, the trial judge related in his
charge to the jury that it was the Crown&#146;s position that the
accused had mutilated the deceased&#146;s sexual organs and dumped her
nude body into the river in an attempt to simulate a copycat
killing of a Parkdale prostitute.
[39] The appellant submits that this theory was entirely
speculative and unsupported by the evidence, and that it was used
as a device by the Crown to explain away a weakness in the case,
namely, that the circumstances of the death of Ms. Lachman did
not fit the Crown&#146;s overall theory of the case.
[40] Another point along the same lines relates to the
appellant&#146;s car. Lee Richmond and Gerald McCaffery, the nearby
tenants who testified that they saw a man putting either a body
or a rug into a car behind the appellant&#146;s store, described the
car. The appellant did not own a car that matched their
description. Again, in the submission of the appellant, the Crown
employed the tactic of making an entirely speculative suggestion
in an attempt to explain away the difficulty this evidence posed.
In cross-examining the appellant, Crown counsel suggested that
the appellant extended credit to some needy customers and that
they would have returned the favour by lending him their car.
The appellant denied that he had borrowed a car.
[41] Further instances of the Crown&#146;s speculative propositions
include the suggestion that the accused had made up a story that
the deceased had been robbed prior to her murder.  During his
charge to the jury, the trial judge referred to the Crown&#146;s
position that the appellant had spread a false story of the
deceased having been robbed.  The Crown suggested that the
deceased was murdered in the appellant&#146;s store.  Crown counsel
reiterated this point in his closing address, as did the trial
judge in his charge to the jury.  The appellant contends that
there was no evidence to support that proposition either.
[42] I agree with the proposition advanced by Mr. Lockyer that it
is wrong for the Crown to present speculative propositions,
unsupported by the evidence, in an attempt to explain away gaps
in the Crown&#146;s case or inconsistencies in the evidence: see R. v.
Nugent (1995), 100 C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.) at 94; R. v. Walker
(1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 144 (C.A.) at 154.  I am not satisfied
that anything done by Crown counsel in this regard was sufficient
to vitiate the trial.
[43] With regard to the sexual mutilation, the suggestion that
the murder was linked to the murders of the Parkdale prostitutes
was presented by the defence. The body of the deceased had been
sexually mutilated and given the defence position that the death
could be one of a series of sex-related killings, it was open to
the Crown to test the accused&#146;s denial of guilt with the
proposition that there was a possible reason for him to have
mutilated the body. In my view, on this point Crown counsel did
not cross the line of fairness by testing the defence being
advanced.
[44] I view the suggestion that the accused had borrowed a car on
the night of the murder to dispose of the body as being very
close to, if not over, the line. There was no evidence to support
the proposition and despite the appellant&#146;s denials, Crown
counsel persisted with the proposition at some length.  However,
I am not persuaded that this vitiates the trial. The Crown did
present evidence, however tenuous, that a man was seen putting a
body in the trunk of a car at the rear of the appellant&#146;s store.
The Crown was certainly entitled to put it to the appellant that
he was the man disposing of the body. The jury would be fully
aware that the accused had several vehicles, none of which
matched the description of the car offered by Richmond and
McCaffery. Given the adamant denials of the appellant that he
borrowed cars from his customers, the fact that this proposition
was not pursued by Crown counsel in his closing address and, in
view of the overall context of the trial, I am not satisfied that
the conduct of the Crown was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant
a new trial.
[45] In my view, there is no merit in the final two points raised
by the appellant.  The robbery story was introduced by the
defence and the Crown was entitled to test the truth of the
story.  As for the suggestion that the murder occurred in the
appellant&#146;s store, there was some foundation in the evidence,
namely, the evidence that the deceased had been in the store
during the evening, and the evidence that the accused had asked
her to come to the store on that day.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 4.   Did the manner in which the trial judge left
manslaughter as a possible verdict unfairly prejudice the
appellant?</pre>
    <pre>[46] The appellant submits that his primary defence that he had
nothing to do with Ms. Lachman&#146;s death was unfairly undermined by
the manner in which the trial judge instructed the jury with
respect to a possible verdict of manslaughter.
[47] In his charge to the jury, the trial judge introduced
manslaughter as an included offence and possible verdict with
these words:
          </pre>
    <pre>    The accused also asks that you consider the following
    scenario on the question of murderous intent.  It is reasonably
    possible that the killer was having sexual intercourse with Ms.
    Lachman when he began to strangle her and in that excited state
    of mind there may be a reasonable doubt whether the killer meant
    to cause Ms. Lachman&#146;s death or meant to cause her bodily harm
    that he knew was likely to cause her death and was reckless
    whether death ensued or not.  Thus the killer would not be guilty
    of second degree murder, but only of manslaughter. (emphasis
    added)</pre>
    <pre>[48] At trial, the appellant did not resist manslaughter being
left with the jury.  Before this court, the appellant more or
less concedes that it was open to the trial judge to conclude
that he was required to put manslaughter to the jury as a
possible verdict. However, the appellant&#146;s trial counsel did not
present the scenario described by the trial judge in the above
quoted passage. The appellant submits that the trial judge was in
effect telling the jury that the appellant was putting forth an
alternative defence by suggesting that he was presenting
manslaughter at the request of the accused.  Accordingly, the
appellant contends that this was damaging as it unfairly
undermined the defence he did present, namely, that he had
nothing to do with the killer.
[49] Mr. Lockyer urges this court to consider this submission in
the context of the charge as a whole. The trial judge structured
the charge by dealing first with the legal elements of second
degree murder, then with the elements of first degree murder on
the basis of planned and deliberate murder, followed by the
elements of first degree murder committed in the course of sexual
assault and, finally, the trial judge dealt with manslaughter. At
each stage, and on each issue, the trial judge presented the
respective positions of the Crown and the defence.  The result
was that the jury was told first: &#147;The accused &#133; respectfully
submits the Crown has failed to prove that the murder was planned
and deliberate&#148;; then that &#147;the accused respectfully submits that
the Crown has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the
sexual assault took place during the murder&#148;; and finally, as
quoted above, that it was the accused who asked the jury to
consider a possible manslaughter verdict.  The appellant posits
that by making it appear to the jury that he was presenting a
series of alternative defences, the jury was lead to doubt the
credibility of the case the appellant actually presented and
wanted the jury to consider, that he had nothing to do with the
death of Ms. Lachman.
[50] Mr. Lockyer relies on R. v. Peavoy (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d)
226 (Ont. C.A.) where the accused advanced self-defence to a
charge of murder and, over the objection of the accused, the
trial judge left provocation with the jury. This court stated at
242:
          </pre>
    <pre>    A trial judge is required to leave every defence to the jury
    for which there is an air of reality on the evidence.  In his
    instructions, it would have been highly preferable for the trial
    judge to explain to the jury that provocation was not a position
    being advanced by the defence but one about which he felt he was
    required to charge them.</pre>
    <pre>[51] These comments must be read in context. In Peavoy supra,
defence counsel did not want the trial judge to put forth the
defence of provocation.  Although this court stated that the
trial judge ought to have explained to the jury that the issue of
provocation was not presented by the defence but that it was a
defence the judge was obliged to put to the jury as a matter of
law, his failure to do so did not constitute a reversible error.
[52] In the present case, defence counsel argued in his closing
address to the jury that the Crown had failed to prove that the
murder was planned and deliberate or that the murder was
committed during the course of a sexual assault.  As counsel for
the appellant did not advance the &#147;scenario&#148; that the trial judge
used to explain a lack of murderous intent, the trial judge
should not have attributed it to the appellant.  In my view,
however, this slip was relatively innocuous. In the suggested
scenario, the reference is to &#147;the killer&#148;, not the appellant and
I do not think that the jury would understand the trial judge to
be suggesting that the appellant was backing away from his
central and basic position that he was not the killer.
[53] Defence counsel at trial agreed during a pre-charge hearing
that manslaughter should be left with the jury.  In view of these
submissions, and in light of the innocuous nature of the trial
judge&#146;s reference to &#147;the killer&#148;, it is my view that the trial
judge did not err in the manner in which he presented the
possible verdict of manslaughter to the jury.  The trial judge
carefully explained each element of each offence.  He articulated
in clear language the respective positions of the Crown and the
accused.  Reading the charge as a whole in light of the way the
trial proceeded and in view of counsels&#146; closing arguments, it is
my view that the jury could not have had any doubt that the
position of the appellant was that he had nothing to do with the
killing. The trial judge was obliged to explain the elements of
the various offences and the evidence pertaining to each element.
In my view he did so without detracting from or undermining the
appellant&#146;s essential defence.
[54] I note as well that the appellant&#146;s trial counsel did not
raise an objection to this aspect of the charge.  While this is
not fatal to a submission advanced on appeal, failure to object
may be considered in assessing an argument that the manner in
which the case was left with the jury created an unfair
impression.  In the present case, trial counsel&#146;s failure to
object in conjunction with his submissions to the trial judge and
his closing address to the jury, supports the respondent&#146;s
argument that the trial judge essentially repeated to the jury
the arguments advanced by counsel.  Accordingly, I would reject
this ground of appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 5:  Did the trial judge fail to deal adequately with the
evidence of Deonarine Ramrattan as to statements made by the
deceased prior to her death?</pre>
    <pre>[55] The deceased&#146;s sister, Deonarine Ramrattan, gave evidence as
to statements made by the deceased prior to her death. This
evidence was admitted on the authority of R. v. Khan, supra. The
statements were damaging to the appellant. In particular,
Ramrattan testified that the deceased told her she had lent money
to the appellant and that she was having difficulty getting paid,
that the appellant had telephoned her several times on the day of
her disappearance and that she was afraid to meet with him. The
appellant submits that the trial judge failed to warn the jury
adequately of the danger of accepting the evidence of Ramrattan
because her trial evidence was seriously at odds with several
statements she had made to the police.
[56] I do not accept this submission. The trial judge clearly
instructed the jury that they had to assess Ramrattan&#146;s
credibility &#147;in light of her admitted bias against the accused
and in light of her failure to tell the police about the
statements until 19 months after her sister&#146;s death. The defence
alleges she fabricated statements out of whole cloth.&#148; Later in
his charge, the trial judge returned to this aspect of
Ramrattan&#146;s evidence:
          </pre>
    <pre>               You will recall that Ms. Ramrattan spoke
	  to  the  police on  many  occasions about her
	  sister&#146;s   homicide,  but  did  not   mention
          anything about her sister&#146;s relationship with
	  Mr. Tombran until July 23, 1996. Specifically
	  the police  had  repeatedly  asked her if her 
	  sister  had  any  problems  with anyone.  Ms. 
	  Ramrattan said nothing  about  her   sister&#146;s
	  relationship  with  Mr. Tombran  until   July 
	  23rd, 1996, despite numerous opportunities to
	  do so.
          </pre>
    <pre>                Please carefully assess the credibility
          and  reliability of Ms. Ramrattan&#146;s  evidence
          in  light  of  her admitted bias against  the
          accused  Tombran, in light  of  her  repeated
          statements that she knew no one with whom her
          sister  was  having problems.  It is  clearly
          open  to you to find her evidence not  to  be
          credible and reliable because of her repeated
          prior inconsistent statements.</pre>
    <pre>[57] In my view, these warnings were adequate.
[58] The appellant also complains that the trial judge failed to
warn the jury of the danger of accepting the truth of the
statements of the deceased as she could not be cross-examined and
as the jury did not have the opportunity to observe her
demeanour: see R. v. A.(S.) (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 522 (Ont.
C.A.) at 527-8. The trial judge did make brief reference to this
point:
          </pre>
    <pre>    In the end, it is open to you to act on the deceased&#146;s
    alleged statements despite her unavailability to testify at trial
    under oath and be cross-examined, only if you find that from the
    deceased&#146;s perspective the statements were both credible and
    reliable, and only if you find the evidence of Ms. Ramrattan as
    to the statements is also credible and reliable.</pre>
    <pre>[59] As R. v. A.(S.), supra, makes clear, it will often be
necessary to give a stronger caution with respect to an out-of-
court statement. However, in the present case the real issue for
the jury to consider was whether Ramrattan was a reliable witness
and whether or not the deceased made the statements, rather than
whether the statements were true if made.  I am not persuaded
that the charge was significantly deficient on this point.</pre>
    <pre>Issue 6.  Did the trial judge misstate a material item of
evidence by suggesting that the appellant had changed his story
during cross-examination?</pre>
    <pre>[60] In the course of his directions to the jury, the trial judge
stated as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>    As for the accused&#146;s identity as the murderer, the Crown
    relies on the following.  The accused had motive to kill Ms.
    Lachman.  He needed money to cover his failing financial
    endeavours.  He was not making money.  And that stung his
    arrogant pride.  He even agreed initially in cross-examination
    that he was badly in debt, although he resiled from that later.
    (emphasis in original)</pre>
    <pre>[61] The appellant claims that he did not resile from an
admission that he was badly in debt and there was no basis in the
evidence for the reference to &#147;arrogant pride&#148;.
[62] In my view, the trial judge did not misstate the evidence
which includes the following exchange during the appellant&#146;s
cross-examination:
          </pre>
    <pre>    Q.  There&#146;s no question that you were badly in
	debt by the fall of 1994, is there?
          </pre>
    <pre>    A.  No, sir.</pre>
    <pre>[63] While perhaps this question was ambiguous, the questions
that follow go on to explore the appellant&#146;s various bad
investments that were declining in value.  Later on, the
appellant denied that he was in financial difficulty. In my view,
the trial judge did not misstate the evidence on this point. The
reference to &#147;arrogant pride&#148; was unfortunate, but it was clearly
put as the position of the Crown, not the opinion of the judge,
and it falls well short of reversible error.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[64] For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
