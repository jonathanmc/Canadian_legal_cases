</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Klowak J., dated September 23, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CARTHY J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   The appellants appeal from two judgments of Klowak J. dated
September  23, 1998, one dismissing an application for  an  order
quashing  By-law  321-96 of the respondent and ancillary  relief;
the  other,  granting  a  permanent  injunction  restraining  the
appellants  from using premises on Yonge Street in Richmond  Hill
as an adult entertainment parlour.
[2]  In the background of the present proceedings were some years
of skirmishing and litigation between the Town and Treesann over
the latter&#146;s operation of an adult entertainment parlour (as it
is termed in the by-law) known as the Major Mack Hotel. By my
observation of the evidence, as the entertainment became more and
more erotic, the political opposition became more and more
resolute. Finally, in 1996 the Town passed By-law 321-96 amending
its adult entertainment licensing by-law by deleting the Yonge
Street, frontage, where the Major Mack Hotel was located. The by-
law creates a new area for the operation of adult entertainment
parlours known as the Enford Road Industrial Area.
[3]  Treesann, the operator, and 593288 Ontario Ltd., the owner
brought proceedings alleging bias, bad faith and illegality and
the Town countered with an application for a permanent injunction
enjoining further operation. Klowak J. upheld the by-law and
granted the injunction.
[4]  Thereafter, Treesann ceased operations and this appeal was
pursued, as explained by counsel, to establish the owner&#146;s rights
to the use of this property. Further, the issues on appeal were
refined to focus on the legality of the by-law. Bad faith was
only pressed as associated with the alleged excess of authority
in passing the by-law. In effect, this court is only asked to
determine if the by-law was one the municipality was empowered to
enact.
[5]  The reasons of Klowak J. are cited as Treesann Management
Inc. v. Richmond Hill (Town)  (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 625 (Gen.
Div.). Before analyzing those reasons I will set forth the
relevant legislation. S. 225 of the Municipal Act, R.S.O. 1990,
c.M.45 reads in part:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    225.(1)  Licensing, regulating, etc.,
	  adult entertainment parlours. &#150; By-laws may be
	  passed by the councils of local municipalities
	  for licensing, regulating, governing, classifying
	  and inspecting adult entertainment parlours or
	  any class or classes thereof and for revoking
	  or suspending any such licence and for limiting
          the number of such licences to be
          granted, in accordance with subsection (3).
          </pre>
    <pre>               &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                     (3)  Defined areas, limitation  on
          numbers. &#150; Despite  subsection 257.2(4), a by-
          law  passed under this section may define the
          area  or  areas of the municipality in  which
          adult entertainment parlours or any class  or
          classes  thereof may or may not  operate  and
          may  limit  the  number  of  licences  to  be
          granted  in  respect  of adult  entertainment
          parlours  or any class or classes thereof  in
          any  such  area  or areas in which  they  are
          permitted.</pre>
    <pre>Section 257.2(4) (referred to in s. 225.(3)) reads:
          </pre>
    <pre>          257.2(4)  Limitation. &#150; A council shall not
	  refuse to grant a licence to carry on or engage
	  in any business by reason only of the location
          of the business if the business was being
          carried on or engaged in at that location at
	  the time the by-law requiring the licence came
	  into force.</pre>
    <pre>[6]   By-law  321-96 effectively amended earlier  by-laws  passed
pursuant  to  s.225  by  deleting  the  designated  Yonge  Street
frontage  and replacing it with the Enford Road Industrial  Area.
The balance of the licensing regime in the by-law as amended sets
out  comprehensive  regulatory provisions as  authorized  by  the
legislation and as one might expect in a licensing by-law.
[7]  Klowak J. first found that the Town had the power to amend
the by-law so as to abrogate existing rights which had been
created by that very by-law. She cites strong authority for that
conclusion and this was not challenged on appeal. The motions
judge then deals with the alleged bias of the members of council
and the imputed lack of planning rationale for the amendment. She
found in favour of the municipality and that conclusion was not
contested on the appeal.
[8]  The appeal issue was whether the by-law amendment was
illegal as effectively prohibiting adult entertainment parlours
in the Town. The zoning category of &#147;places of entertainment&#148; was
not included in the industrial zoning of the substituted
district.
[9]  The Town&#146;s position was, and is, that adult entertainment is
an accessory use to restaurant use, which is permitted in the
industrial zoning. Further, it is the Town&#146;s position that it has
committed itself to that position as evidenced by the planning
reports leading to By-law 321-96, and has demonstrated its good
faith by permitting a rezoning of a Legion Hall in the industrial
district to include tavern and entertainment uses.
[10] Klowak J. relied on the reasons of Craig J. in Toronto v.
Merit Corp. (1983), 23 M.P.L.R. 125 (Ont. H.C.J.) to find that
adult entertainment could not be considered an accessory use to a
restaurant. She then concluded:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Had  the  Town  before me  taken  no
	  other  action  with  respect  to  allowing  an
	  adult  entertainment   parlour  in   the   new
          industrial  area,   other  than   stating   it
	  interpreted   restaurant   to   include  adult
	  entertainment  parlour,  I  would  not  accept
	  their good faith in passing the re-designating
	  by-law. Such interpretation could   be readily
	  challenged, and the by-law would in  effect be
	  prohibitory.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     In  this  case,  however,   another
          applicant has been successful in  obtaining  a
          licence  in the new industrial area   and  the
          Town  has  already re-zoned that   applicant&#146;s
          property    from    specific   zoning    which
          accommodated   a  Legion  Hall  to  one  which
          includes  a   tavern  and entertainment.  This
          supports  the  Town&#146;s contention  that  it  is
          prepared    to     accommodate    an     adult
          entertainment   parlour in  the  re-designated
          area,  and   also shows they will  re-zone  if
          necessary,   even though they have  maintained
          to date it is not necessary to do so.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      Although   the  intention  of  the
          legislature  was  to give  municipalities  the
          choice   and  flexibility   afforded  by   the
          licensing  regime  with   respect   to   adult
          entertainment parlours,  thereby dealing  with
          adult  entertainment as   an  activity  rather
          than  as a land use requiring  re-zoning,  the
          Town  may have put itself in the  position  in
          this case of having to re-zone  because of the
          existing zoning in the re-designated  area  it
          has  selected.  The by-law  does  not   become
          prohibitive, however, just because   re-zoning
          may  be  required: Soo Mill &amp; Lumber   Co.  v.
          Sault Ste.  Marie (City), [1975] 2 S.C.R.  78,
          47 D.L.R. (3d) 1.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     For  the  purposes of the issue  of
          good faith before me,  in taking the whole  of
          the  Town&#146;s  actions  into account,  including
          those  preceding the by-law, surrounding  the
          enactment  of the  by-law, and its  subsequent
          actions  in   accommodating  and  facilitating
          another  adult  entertainment parlour  in  the
          new  industrial   area, all support  that  the
          Town acted in good  faith in enacting the  by-
          law  re-designating   the  location  of  adult
          entertainment parlours in Richmond Hill.</pre>
    <pre>[11] I will deal first with the argument that adult entertainment
is an accessory use to a restaurant. The definition of &#147;accessory
use&#148;  in  the  Town&#146;s zoning by-law is that it be &#147;naturally  and
normally  incidental, subordinate and exclusively  devoted  to  a
principal  use.&#148;   I agree with Klowak J.&#146;s conclusion.  One  can
only  offer  a  patronizing  smile  to  the  argument  that  such
activities as towel dancing, touching of breasts and masturbation
are   naturally  and  ordinarily  incidental  to  a  dining   out
experience.  Yet,  the  fundamental  rationale  of  the  planning
department in recommending the area designation was that it would
be a permitted accessory use. See, also on this subject, Bayfield
(Village)  v. MacDonald (1997), 39 M.P.L.R. (2d) 63, and  1121472
Ontario Inc. v. Toronto (City) (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 535.
[12] Moving forward, I respectfully disagree with the remaining
conclusions of Klowak J. The fact that a rezoning is available or
that another property was rezoned does not bear upon the issue of
whether existing zoning is prohibitory. It may indicate a sense
of fairness, but it is at best ad hoc fairness. The best
intentions of council members are subject to future planning
processes and appropriate decisions in respect thereof.
Furthermore, even if council chose to ignore its present zoning
and grant a licence, any ratepayer would be entitled to bring
action to enforce the present industrial zoning. See Municipal
Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.M.45, s.328 which reads:</pre>
    <pre>          Where any by-law of a municipality or of a
	  local board thereof, passed under the authority
	  of this or any other general or special Act, is
          contravened, in addition to any other remedy
          and to any penalty imposed by the by-law, such
	  contravention may be restrained by action at the
	  instance of a ratepayer or the corporation or
	  local board. R.S.O. 1990, c. M.45, s.328.</pre>
    <pre>[13] A comparison between two cases makes the point.
[14]  In Pro Catering Ltd. et al. v. Town of Vaughan (1986), 17
O.A.C. 238 (Ont. Div. Ct.) at 238 the Divisional Court held such
a by-law invalid, saying at p. 239:
          </pre>
    <pre>          [3]  The present general zoning bylaw No. 2523
	  and bylaw 2961, which deals specifically with
	  the regulation of lands and buildings for
	  industrial purposes in the Township of Vaughan,
	  do not list that use as a permitted use. As the
	  town has interpreted its zoning bylaw and as it
	  reads; the bylaw prohibits the operation of such
	  Adult Entertainment Parlours in the said
          industrially zoned areas. Therefore, the bylaw
	  is prohibitory and invalid.</pre>
    <pre>[15]  This  court  upheld such a by-law in 538745  Ont.  Inc.  v.
Windsor  (City)  (1988),  64  O.R.  (2d)  38  (C.A.)  where   the
municipality  passed zoning by-laws to permit adult entertainment
in the newly designated areas.
[16] I disagree with the motion judge&#146;s interpretation of Soo
Mill &amp; Lumber Co. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie, [1975] 2 S.C.R.
78. In that case certain of the land uses ostensibly permitted in
the zoning by-law were in a &#147;hold&#148; category indicating proposed
future uses in accordance with the long range planning envisaged
in the Official Plan. It was argued that this &#147;hold&#148; category was
a prohibition rendering the by-law illegal. Laskin C.J. concluded
at p. 84:
          </pre>
    <pre>          The fact of a freeze on development, in
	  accordance with the precepts of the Official
	  Plan as implemented by the zoning by-law,
	  does not amount to a violation of s. 35(1)
	  when agriculture and related uses (and pre-
	  existing uses) are permitted. Nor can the
	  appellant complain of discrimination merely
	  because the result of the freeze is to
	  sterilize its land in respect of development
	  when this has been done in the context of an
	  overall Official Plan and a general zoning
	  by-law in furtherance thereof.  There was no
	  suggestion of bad faith on the part of the
          respondent in bringing the appellant&#146;s land
	  within the holding category. That was a
	  discretion which was reposed in the
          municipality under the zoning scheme.</pre>
    <pre>[17]  The Court was considering whether land uses were prohibited
and  held  that  they were not &#150; some were permitted  and  others
postponed   to  Official  Plan  considerations.  Here,   we   are
considering whether adult entertainment uses are prohibited,  and
clearly  they  are.  If  all  land uses  had  required  a  zoning
application in Soo Mills the result would, in my view, have  been
very different.
[18] Thus, it is my conclusion that By-law 321-96 of the Town of
Richmond Hill was illegal to the extent that it changed the area
designations where adult entertainment licences might be issued,
in a way which prohibited adult entertainment uses and is void to
that extent. The injunction should therefore be set aside and the
judgment below varied to allow the appellants&#146; application and
grant a declaration in the terms of these reasons.
[19] In setting aside the injunction I am mindful of the fact
that the operator, Treesann, is no longer in possession of the
premises and there appears to be no immediate threat of a
resumption of operations without a licence. In respect of costs,
I note that this facility continued in business without a licence
from 1992 through to 1998 when an injunction was granted. The
municipality patiently awaited the outcome of various proceedings
before seeking a restraining order and in the meantime the
business apparently thrived. I think it a fair observation that
the appellant Treesann was in the game of litigation so long as
profits continued and lost interest in the merits when they could
not continue. The owner appellant has been successful, but it is
probably only a moral victory. It is still faced with the
prospect that the Town will process proper by-laws, with due
process, and directed to its original purpose of eliminating
adult entertainment from the Yonge corridor. In all the
circumstances, I would order no costs here or below.</pre>
