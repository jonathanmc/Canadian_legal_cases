</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Howden J. dated March 3, 1997,
dismissing an appeal from the decision of His Honour Judge Minard
dated May 1, 1995.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>GOUDGE J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The issue on this appeal is whether, on the facts of this
case, s.48 of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.H.8 (Act)
authorized the detention of the appellant by the police.
[2]  The appellant argues that the police exceeded their
authority under this section, thereby arbitrarily detaining him
contrary to s.9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
As a consequence, he says, the results of the roadside screening
test and the breathalyzer test which flowed from his detention
ought not to have been admitted at his trial and his conviction
for contravening s.253(b) of the Criminal Code should be set
aside.
[3]  On May 1, 1995, the appellant was convicted of driving with
an excessive blood alcohol level by Judge Minard in the Ontario
Court of Justice. His appeal was dismissed by Howden J. in a full
and thoughtful judgment, dated March 3, 1997. The appellant comes
to this court with leave granted on May 22, 1997.
[4]  The facts of this matter are straightforward. Early in the
morning of March 4, 1994, the police observed the appellant&#146;s car
travelling some 20 km per hour over the speed limit and drifting
back and forth over the centre line of the highway. They stopped
the car and P.C. O&#146;Brien spoke through the open window with the
appellant who was seated in the driver&#146;s seat. While she noticed
that the driver&#146;s eyes were slightly glassy, she was most struck
by the overwhelming smell of cologne emanating from the car.
This, together with the slight cold from which she was suffering,
left her uncertain about whether she could smell alcohol apart
from the cologne and, if so, whether it was coming from the
driver or his passenger.
[5]  The appellant was therefore directed to get out of his
vehicle, walk a short distance to the police cruiser, and sit in
the back seat. P.C. O&#146;Brien then immediately became aware of the
odour of alcohol on the appellant&#146;s breath and demanded a breath
sample for the roadside screening test. Only two minutes had
elapsed since the vehicle was stopped.
[6]  When the appellant registered a &#147;fail&#148; he was arrested and
charged with operating a motor vehicle having consumed alcohol in
such a quantity that the concentration thereof in his blood
exceeded 80 mg of alcohol in 100 ml of blood. His subsequent
breathalyzer readings were .160 and .170 respectively. The
certificate of analysis showing these readings was admitted at
his trial and the conviction resulted.
[7]  Subsection 48(1) of the Act reads as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>   48(1) A  police officer, readily identifiable as 
such, may  require the driver of a motor vehicle to 
stop for the  purpose of determining whether or not 
there is evidence to justify  making a demand under 
section 254 of the Criminal Code (Canada).</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[8]  In R. v. Smith (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 58 (Ont. C.A.)
Doherty J.A. provides a very useful analysis of the scope of the
power given to the police by that section. At p.69 he makes clear
that the section authorizes the police not only to stop a
motorist, but also to take reasonable steps to determine whether
there is evidence to justify making either a demand for a breath
sample for a roadside screening test or a breathalyzer demand. He
went on to say this at p.73:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>   Section 48 does not set out the specific procedures 
that an officer may use  under the authority  of  that 
section, and it does not place any numerical  limit on 
the  procedures  that  may  be employed.  Instead,  as  
interpreted  in  Saunders,  [R. v. Saunders (1988), 41 
C.C.C. (3d) 532 (Ont. C.A.)]  the  section  authorizes 
any  procedure  or procedures that are both reasonable 
and done for the purpose of  determining  whether  the 
officer has grounds for  making either or  both of the 
demands referred to in s.254 of  the Criminal Code. It 
is  impossible  to  provide  an  exhaustive  list   of 
procedures that will meet these criteria in all cases. 
It is, however, safe to say that  a  procedure  cannot 
be reasonable within the meaning of s.48 unless it can 
be  performed  at  the  site  of  the  detention, with 
dispatch, with no danger to the safety of the detainee  
and  with  minimal  inconvenience  to the detainee.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[9]  In my view, the steps taken by the officer in this case were
within the authority given to her by s.48(1) of the Act. In the
circumstances, they were reasonable steps taken for the purpose
of determining whether the officer had grounds to demand a breath
sample for a roadside screening test.
[10] The appellant was detained for a very short time. The police
cruiser was close to the appellant&#146;s vehicle, so that the
appellant remained at the site of the stop throughout his
detention. His move to the back seat of the cruiser was for a
good reason, given the powerful smell of cologne in his own
vehicle, the presence of the passenger in the car, and the
officer&#146;s cold. Nor could this move be said to subject the
appellant to more than minimal inconvenience. In all the
circumstances, it was a minimally intrusive detention followed
immediately by the demand for a breath sample.
[11] In the result, the breathalyzer readings consequent upon
failing the roadside screening test were not obtained as a result
of an arbitrary detention. This detention was authorized by law
and the resulting evidence was properly admitted at the
appellant&#146;s trial.
[12]
The appeal must therefore be dismissed.
