    <pre><strong>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Mercier J. dated February 5,
1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CATZMAN J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>The appeal</pre>
    <pre>[1]       Robert Turcotte took his mother&#146;s life.  He was tried
for second degree murder.  The jury returned a verdict of
manslaughter.  He was sentenced to two years less a day, to be
served as a conditional sentence.  The Crown appeals from that
sentence.</pre>
    <pre>The circumstances of Olive Turcotte&#146;s death</pre>
    <pre>[2]       At the time of Olive Turcotte&#146;s death, she was 71 years
old.  Robert, her son, was 47.   His father had died some three
years before.  Robert had moved into his parents&#146; apartment to
assist in his ailing father&#146;s care.  He had promised his father
that he would look after his mother, and continued to live with
her in the apartment after his father died.  He was unmarried,
although engaged to be married, and had two younger sisters.
[3]       Both Olive and Robert Turcotte had problems with
alcohol.  When Olive drank, she sometimes became verbally
aggressive.  Robert consumed beer almost every day and attended,
with his mother, at the Royal Canadian Legion at least five times
a week.
[4]       Robert had not worked in the three years before his
mother&#146;s death.  He was on a disability pension for work-related
injuries that caused him chronic pain.  He regularly took five
prescription medicines:  an anti-inflammatory; two protective
agents for the stomach; a pain medication; and a sleeping
medication.
[5]       After having lunch together on August 30th, 1996, Robert
and his mother went to the Royal Canadian Legion to drink.  They
were there from 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon until about 11:00
p.m.  Robert estimated that he drank 16 to 18 pints of beer
throughout the day.  He took his prescribed medication.  Blood
alcohol readings taken from him later that night were 230
milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.
[6]       Robert drove himself and his mother from the Legion back
to their apartment.  His mother had difficulty walking from the
car to the apartment, and fell several times.  It took fifteen or
twenty minutes for them to get into the building.
[7]       Once inside the apartment, Robert took some medication
and prepared for bed.  Shortly afterward, according to his
evidence, his mother confronted him with a knife.  He removed the
knife and put it away.  His mother went into her bedroom and began
moaning.  He went in to see her, and she confronted him with the
knife again.  He left briefly and, when he returned, she went
after him with her bare hands.  He did not recall anything that
happened after that until he saw his mother on the floor with
blood coming from her nose.
[8]       From other witnesses, the jury heard that Olive Turcotte
had been strangled with two cords:  a television cable cord and a
telephone cord.  Neighbours in the building testified that,
between midnight and 12:20 a.m.,  they heard cries for help and a
woman pleading &#147;Bobby, stop.  Don&#146;t Bobby, please&#148;.
[9]       When Robert saw his mother on the floor, apparently
dead, he phoned his sister.  At 12:34 a.m., having received no
answer at his sister&#146;s home, he phoned his fiancée and told her he
thought he had killed his mother.  She told him to call 911.  He
again called his sister, and left a message for her to call right
away.  He then phoned his fiancée again and asked her to come and
pick him up.  At 12:41 a.m., he called 911 and the police were
dispatched.  He was still talking to the 911 operator when the
police arrived and placed him under arrest.  He was fully co-
operative with the arresting officers, who noted that he was
visibly intoxicated and that his knuckles were bloodied and
scraped.
[10] The police arrived at 12:47 a.m.  The cords were still
wrapped tightly about Olive&#146;s throat.  The telephone cord had half-
knots in two places.  With difficulty, a policewoman removed the
cords and commenced CPR.  At 1:09 a.m., ambulance attendants
arrived and managed to get a faint pulse.  Olive was transported
to hospital.  She remained on life support until she died, four
days later.  A post-mortem examination confirmed that she died as
a result of ligature strangulation.  Her blood readings were also
230 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.
[11] Dr. Tessier, a forensic psychiatrist, was called as a witness
by the defence.  He was treating Robert for severe depression.  In
Dr. Tessier&#146;s opinion, at the time of the offence, Robert was
acting under a psychotic condition due to an organic cause, and
suffered a total amnesia of the actual incident.  The most
significant organic contributors were a combination of alcohol and
benzodiazepine, the sleeping medication he was taking.
[12] One of Robert Turcotte&#146;s sisters also testified.  She said
that Robert loved their mother and that mother and son generally
got along very well.  She described them as &#147;best friends&#148;.  She
testified that, in her view, Robert was not capable of
intentionally killing their mother.</pre>
    <pre>The trial and the sentencing</pre>
    <pre>[13] On his arraignment, Robert entered a plea of not guilty to
the charge of second degree murder but guilty to the offence of
manslaughter.  The Crown refused to consent to the acceptance of
his plea, and the trial proceeded.  After a seven-day trial,
Robert was acquitted of second degree murder and convicted of
manslaughter.
[14] At the sentencing hearing, the Crown suggested a sentence
between 10 and 12 years.  The defence sought the imposition of a
conditional sentence.   After hearing evidence from both of
Robert&#146;s sisters, his fiancée, his fiancée&#146;s mother and Dr.
Tessier, and considering a pre-sentence report and the submissions
of counsel, Mercier J. reserved his decision.  He subsequently
rendered oral reasons in which he imposed a sentence of two years
less a day, to be served in the community.</pre>
    <pre>Evidence filed on the appeal</pre>
    <pre>[15] On consent, evidence was filed before us to indicate Robert&#146;s
present circumstances.  He is living with his fiancée, now his
common-law wife.  He  has served over half of his conditional
sentence.  A post-sentence report indicates that he has been
abiding by all of the conditions.  He continues to see Dr. Tessier
for treatment and is showing steady progress.  His history of
alcohol and drug abuse is behind him.</pre>
    <pre>The limitations on appellate courts on sentence appeals</pre>
    <pre>[16] The limitations on an appellate court in considering an
appeal against sentence have been stated and recently restated by
the Supreme Court of Canada.  The sentencing judge&#146;s disposition
must be &#147;not fit&#148; or &#147;clearly unreasonable&#148;:  R. v. Shropshire,
[1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193, at para. 46.  It must
fall &#147;outside the acceptable range&#148;: Shropshire, at para. 50.  In
the absence of  &#147;an error in principle, failure to consider a
relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors, a
court of appeal should only intervene to vary a sentence imposed
at trial if the sentence is demonstrably unfit&#148;:  R. v. M. (C.A.),
[1996] 1 S.C.R. 500, 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327,  at para. 90.  The
sentence must be &#147;in substantial and marked departure from the
sentences customarily imposed for similar offenders committing
similar crimes&#148;:  M. (C.A.), at para. 92.  The sentence imposed at
trial &#147;is entitled to considerable deference from appellate
courts&#148;:  R. v. Proulx (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, at para. 123.
&#147;Although an appellate court might entertain a different opinion
as to what objectives should be pursued and the best way to do
so&#148;, appellate courts should not &#147;second-guess sentencing judges
unless the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit&#148;: Proulx, at
para.125.
[17] Ms. Fairburn urged us to find that this is one of those cases
in which this court should intervene.  She advanced two
submissions on behalf of the Crown.  She argued, first, that only
a penitentiary sentence was appropriate and, second that a
conditional sentence was demonstrably unfit.  In her submission, a
fit sentence in this case would have been in the range of five to
seven years (although she acknowledged that, having regard to the
passage of time, a somewhat lesser sentence of three to five years
should be imposed by this court if it were now minded to
substitute a penitentiary term).  Alternatively, she submitted
that, if we were not disposed to interfere with the sentence of
two years less a day, we should require that the sentence be
served in a custodial setting rather than by way of conditional
sentence.
[18] I am unable to accept either of Ms. Fairburn&#146;s submissions.
[19] While many, if not most, sentences for manslaughter are in
the penitentiary range, maximum reformatory sentences are not
unknown and are clearly within the acceptable range:  Clewley &amp;
McDermott, Sentencing: The Practitioner&#146;s Guide (Aurora, ON:
Canada Law Book Inc., 1999), at sec. 8.150.  Conditional sentences
of that duration and, indeed, of shorter duration, have been
passed against persons found guilty of manslaughter both in this
province and elsewhere:  R. v. Ferguson, [1997] O.J. No. 2488
(Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)); R. v. Mananghaya, [1997] M.J. No. 267, 118
Man. R. (2d) 30 (Man. C.A.); R. v. Emard, [1999] B.C.J. No. 463
(B.C.S.C.); R. v. Oster, [1997] B.C.J. No. 3099 (B.C. Prov. Ct.);
R. v. Hariczuk, [1999] O.J. No. 3110 (Ont. Ct. of Justice).  The
Supreme Court of Canada has recently rejected the suggestion that
conditional sentences are inappropriate for serious offences,
including manslaughter:  R. v. Proulx (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449,
at paras. 80-81.  The imposition of a conditional sentence upon a
person convicted of manslaughter is not, in and of itself, an
error in principle.
[20] Nor, in my view, is the imposition of such a sentence
erroneous in the present case. It is evident from a reading of
Mercier J.&#146;s comprehensive, sensitive reasons for sentence that he
put much thought and care into their preparation.  Because I find
them compelling, I consider it useful to indicate the manner in
which Mercier J. addressed the task of sentencing and the
conclusions he reached in performing that task.
[21] After reviewing the facts, he set out and considered,
individually, each of the objectives of sentencing set out in
s.718 of the Criminal Code:  denunciation of unlawful conduct;
specific and general deterrence; separation of offenders from
society, where necessary; rehabilitation; reparations for harm
done to victims or to the community;  and promotion of a sense of
responsibility in offenders and an acknowledgement of the harm
done to victims and to the community.  He then adverted to the
further sentencing principle set out in s.718.2(b) (&#147;a sentence
should be similar to sentences imposed on similar offenders for
similar offences committed in similar circumstances&#148;).  He
considered, and distinguished, a number of the cases cited to him
by the Crown, determined that &#147;a non-penitentiary term of
imprisonment [would] satisfy the principles of sentencing as set
out in the Criminal Code&#148;, and decided to impose a sentence of
imprisonment of two years less a day, the maximum reformatory
term.
[22] Mercier J. then turned to s.742.1 of the Code and the
question whether a conditional sentence should be imposed.  He
referred to some of the cases, noted above, where conditional
sentences were imposed on persons convicted of manslaughter.  He
quoted passages from the decision of this court in R. v. Wismayer
(1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 18, at  36 and at 44-45, and rejected the
submission of Crown counsel that a conditional sentence would be
&#147;outrageous&#148; and would render &#147;a disservice to the community&#148;.
With specific reference to the Crown&#146;s suggestion of 10 to 12
years&#146; imprisonment, he asked himself these cogent questions:</pre>
    <pre>
          What does society stand to gain by such a sentence?  
	  Who benefits from this type of sentence?  The
	  daughters of the victim do not benefit; they have
	  made that clear.  The offender would not benefit.
	  His rehabilitation would be greatly hindered, if not
          totally destroyed, by such a sentence.  Society or
	  the community gains nothing.  It will end up
	  supporting the offender while in prison and may well
	  be faced with a person whose rehabilitation will
	  have been seriously negatively affected when he is
	  eventually released.
          </pre>
    <pre>[23] Reflecting on the nature of a conditional sentence and on the
passages from Wismayer quoted above, Mercier J. concluded that, in
his view:</pre>
    <pre>
          &#133; this is a proper case for a conditional sentence.</pre>
    <pre>          This offence was committed under very
          specific difficult conditions unlikely to ever
          reoccur.  This offender has expressed sincere
          remorse for his actions.  This offender has
          taken very extensive and positive steps
          towards his rehabilitation and it is most
          important that his treatment and counselling
          be continued without interruption.  This
          offender&#146;s siblings, the surviving victims of
          the offence, understand the circumstances
          under which the offence occurred and wish him
          to be allowed to continue his rehabilitation.
          This offender presents no risk to the
          community.</pre>
    <pre>          Robert Turcotte will then be permitted to
          serve his sentence in the community.
          </pre>
    <pre>[24] He then imposed, in addition to the compulsory conditions set
forth in s.742.3(1) of the Code, a number of conditions relating
to residence, abstention from alcohol, counselling, treatment and
community service.
[25] In my view, the sentence imposed by Mercier J. reflects none
of the errors that would warrant interference by an appellate
court, and I therefore defer to his assessment of the particular
circumstances of the offence and the offender:  R. v. Wells
(2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 368, at para. 48.</pre>
    <pre>Disposition</pre>
    <pre>[26] I would grant the Crown leave to appeal against the sentence
passed upon the respondent, but I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>Released: APR 19 2000              Signed: &#147;M.A. Catzman J.A.&#148;
   MAC                             &#147;I agree R.S. Abella J.A.&#148;
<strong></strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MacPherson J.A. (dissenting)</strong>
</pre>
    <pre>[27] I have had the opportunity to read the reasons prepared by my
colleague, Catzman J.A., in this appeal.  I regret that I  do  not
reach  the  same  conclusion as my colleague.  I would  allow  the
appeal  from  the  sentence imposed by Mercier  J.  and  impose  a
sentence  on Mr. Turcotte of two years less a day to be served  in
custody.   I  will attempt to state, in brief fashion, my  reasons
for this conclusion.
[28]  I  begin with a brief recitation of the points  on  which  I
agree with my colleague&#146;s analysis.
[29]  First, the sentence imposed by a trial judge is entitled  to
considerable  deference by appellate courts: see R. v.  Shropshire
(1995), 102  C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.); R. v. M. (C.A.) (1996), 105
C.C.C.  (3d) 327 (S.C.C.); and R. v. McDonnell (1997), 114  C.C.C.
(3d) 436 (S.C.C.).
[30]  Second,  judicial deference to sentences  imposed  by  trial
judges  extends  to all types of sentences, including  conditional
sentences: see R. v. Proulx (2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.).
[31]  Third, a conditional sentence can be an appropriate sentence
for   some   offenders   who   have  committed   violent   crimes.
Specifically, a conditional sentence can be imposed  on  a  person
who has been convicted of manslaughter: see Proulx, at pp. 484-86;
and R. v. Wismayer (1997), 114 C.C.C. (3d) 23 at 31 (Ont. C.A.).
[32]  Fourth,  an  appeal court should interfere with  a  sentence
imposed  by  a  trial judge only if it is &#147;not  fit&#148;  or  &#147;clearly
unreasonable&#148;:  see Shropshire, at p. 210.  Or,  as  expressed  by
Lamer C.J. in M. (C.A.), at p. 374:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure to 
consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the 
appropriate factors, a court of appeal should only 
intervene to vary a sentence imposed at trial if the 
sentence is demonstrably unfit.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[27]  Against  the backdrop of these points of agreement  with  my
colleague&#146;s  reasons, I turn to a consideration  of  the  sentence
imposed by the trial judge.  The respondent, Robert Turcotte,  was
found guilty of the crime of manslaughter following a trial before
a  judge  and  jury.   The victim was Mr. Turcotte&#146;s  71-year  old
mother,  Olive Turcotte.  The circumstances surrounding the  crime
are  well-described  in  the reasons of the  trial  judge  and  of
Catzman   J.A.   on  this  appeal.   I  need  not   repeat   their
descriptions.   The question is: was the sentence imposed  by  the
trial  judge, namely, a conditional sentence of two years  less  a
day, &#147;demonstrably unfit&#148;?
[28] I do not think that the duration of the sentence was
demonstrably unfit.  As the trial judge pointed out, there is no
minimum sentence for manslaughter and &#147;sentences imposed on
persons convicted of manslaughter have varied from suspended
sentences to life imprisonment and all points in between.&#148;
Although a sentence of two years less a day for Mr. Turcotte
strikes me as being at the very low end of the range, I cannot say
that it is so low as to attract the label &#147;demonstrably unfit&#148;.
[29] With great respect to the trial judge, who wrote full and
careful reasons for sentence, I have reached the reluctant
conclusion that the conditional component of the sentence he
imposed was demonstrably unfit.  I reach this conclusion for
several reasons.
[30] First, this was a violent and terrible crime.  The victim was
a thoroughly drunk 71-year old woman.  The offender was her adult
son.  Mrs. Turcotte was completely defenseless.  The son used not
one, but two, cords (a telephone cord and a television cable cord)
to strangle his mother.  He tied half-knots in one of the cords.
He wrapped them so tightly around his mother&#146;s neck that the
police officers had trouble removing them when they arrived at the
scene.  The strangulation went on for several minutes and was
accompanied by the mother&#146;s screams.  Neighbours testified that
between midnight and 12:20 a.m. they heard banging noises and a
woman&#146;s cries: &#147;help&#148;, &#147;help me, please help me&#148;,  &#147;Bobby stop.
Don&#146;t Bobby, please.&#148;
[31] The trial judge recognized that denunciation was one of the
objectives of sentencing.  Early in his reasons he stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>This is a factor which I must consider.  A charge and any
sentence are denunciations in themselves.  In these 
circumstances, a penitentiary term of imprisonment is not 
required to achieve that denunciation.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Later,  when he turned to considering whether he should  impose  a
conditional   sentence,  the  trial  judge  said   nothing   about
denunciation.   The  focus of this later part of  his  reasons  is
almost entirely on the rehabilitation of Mr. Turcotte.
[32] In my view, the circumstances of Mrs. Turcotte&#146;s death called
out  for  more than the statement that a &#147;charge and any  sentence
are  denunciations in themselves.&#148;  In R. v. Brooks,  [1993]  O.J.
No. 1396 (Ont. Gen. Div.), Moldaver J. (as he then was) imposed  a
six-year  sentence in a manslaughter case where  the  accused  had
experienced  a  difficult  and sad life.   In  imposing  sentence,
Moldaver  J.  drew attention to the circumstances of the  offence,
stating at paragraph 10:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>As well, I cannot ignore the manner by which he caused Ms.
DeRosie&#146;s death.  Death by ligature strangulation can only 
be described as grotesque.  Mr. Brooks undoubtedly applied
significant force to the person of Ms. DeRosie for a 
significant period of time.  During that time, it would seem 
that Ms. DeRosie was conscious, and she begged Mr. Brooks 
to desist.  Unfortunately, her pleas went unheeded.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>In my view, almost every word of this passage applies to Mr.
Turcotte and his mother.  The trial judge should have recognized
that the terrible circumstances surrounding Mrs. Turcotte&#146;s death
required a stronger condemnation of the person who caused it.
[33] Second, the trial judge relied on other cases in which
conditional sentences were imposed following manslaughter
convictions: R. v. Manangheyo, [1997] M.J. No. 267 (C.A.); R. v.
Oster, [1997] B.C.J. No. 3099 (Prov. Ct.); R. v. Ferguson, [1997]
O.J. No. 2488 (Gen. Div.); and R. v. Getkate (Unreported, Ont.
Gen. Div., 10 November 1998).
[34]  In  my  view,  in  all of these cases  there  were  profound
mitigating   circumstances  in  favour  of   the   offender.    In
Manangheyo, Mrs. Manangheyo killed her niece who was living in the
family home and openly carrying on an affair with her husband.  In
Oster,  Mr.  Oster used a chair to beat to death  a  man  who  had
sexually  abused Oster&#146;s wife and was taunting him about  it.   In
Ferguson  and  Getlake,  Mrs. Ferguson  and  Mrs.  Getlake  killed
husbands  who  had  engaged  in  years  of  physical,  sexual  and
emotional abuse.
[35] Nothing close to these factors exists in the present appeal.
By all accounts, mother and son were extremely close.  They lived
together and cared for each other.  On the night in question, Mrs.
Turcotte was seriously drunk and had difficulty walking from the
car to the house.  Inside the house, she was truly defenseless &#150;
elderly and drunk and capable only of pleading for mercy.  In
short, there was nothing in Mrs. Turcotte&#146;s behaviour, in the
years before or on the night of the attack, to provide even a
slight reason for Mr. Turcotte&#146;s assault.
[36] Third, the trial judge was clearly influenced by what he
regarded as the uniqueness of this case.  He said: &#147;This offence
was committed under very specific difficult conditions unlikely to
ever reoccur.&#148;  From this sentence, the trial judge moved directly
to a consideration of Mr. Turcotte&#146;s remorse and rehabilitation.
[37] With respect, I think the trial judge erred in his
description of the uniqueness of this case. Fortunately, there are
few cases in which a parent is killed by a son or daughter.
However, domestic violence, especially violence that takes place
in the context of serious alcohol and drug abuse, is, sadly, very
prevalent in Canadian society.  The essential features of the
events in the Turcotte home are all too familiar.  To take but one
example, I return to the strangulation manslaughter in Brooks.
Here is Moldaver J.&#146;s description:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>Mr. Brooks took the life of another human being absent 
any lawful excuse or justification.  He did so absent 
any provocation on the part of Ms. DeRosie and at a 
time when she was completely vulnerable, helpless and 
incapable of defending or even attempting to defend 
herself.  At the time of the killing, Mr. Brooks had
severely compromised his thought processes due to 
self-induced intoxication.  But for this, I am 
confident that Ms. DeRosie would not have perished 
that night at his hands.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[38]  In  my  view,  if  &#147;Mr. Turcotte&#148; and &#147;Olive  Turcotte&#148;  are
substituted  for &#147;Mr. Brooks&#148; and &#147;Ms. DeRosie&#148;, this  description
fits perfectly to the present appeal.  In short, the events giving
rise  to  this  case  are not unique; they  are  all  too  common.
Accordingly,  although  I  do  not  criticize  the  trial  judge&#146;s
attention  to  rehabilitation, I do find fault  with  his  silence
about the principles of denunciation and general deterrence in the
conditional sentence component of his reasons.
[39] Fourth, in my view, the trial judge paid insufficient
attention to the moral blameworthiness or responsibility of the
respondent.  In the first paragraph of his reasons, the trial
judge said that Mr. Turcotte admitted that he had killed his
mother but that &#147;he did not really recall what had occurred.&#148;
Later he relied on the evidence of Dr. Pierre Tessier, a
psychiatrist, that Mr. Turcotte &#147;suffered a total amnesia of the
actual incident.&#148;
[40] Whether Mr. Turcotte was in a state of partial or total
amnesia while he was strangling his mother, the fact remains that
it was his own conduct that placed him in that condition.  He
drank copiously throughout the afternoon and evening and mixed the
alcohol with several prescription drugs.  He could remember the
events inside the house up to the moment he snapped.  During the
strangulation, he had enough presence of mind to use two different
cords and to tie knots in one of them.  He also ignored his
mother&#146;s pleading which was loud enough for neighbours to hear.
Very soon after the strangulation stopped, Mr. Turcotte called
911.  The operator said he sounded intoxicated but calm.  He
provided accurate information.  When the police arrived at 12:47
a.m., they described him as co-operative, coherent, nonchalant and
emotionless.  In my view, this description of Mr. Turcotte&#146;s
behaviour before, during and immediately after the strangulation
of his mother suggests that he must bear a high degree of moral
responsibility for his conduct.
[41] For these reasons, my conclusion is that &#147;[w]hile the
circumstances call for some compassion and mitigation, they do not
bear the full burden of converting a homicide sentence into a
community sentence&#148;: see D.M. Paciocco, Getting Away with Murder:
The Canadian Criminal Justice System (Toronto: Irwin Law, 1999) at
63.
[42] Some years ago, this court addressed the question of
sentencing in the context of family violence in R. v. Inwood
(1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 174.  Howland C.J., speaking for a five
judge panel, stated, at p. 181:</pre>
    <pre>
          This court has acted on the principle that where
	  there is a serious offence involving violence to
	  the person, then general and individual
	  deterrence must be paramount considerations in
          sentencing in order to protect the public.  In
	  my opinion, this principle is applicable not
          only to violence between strangers but also to
	  domestic violence.</pre>
    <pre>
          Domestic      assaults      are  not   private
          matters,   and   spouses   are   entitled   to
          protection  from  violence just  as  strangers
          are.    This  does  not  mean  that  in  every
          instance of domestic violence a custodial term
          should  be  imposed, but  that  it  should  be
          normal where significant bodily harm has  been
          inflicted, in order to repudiate and  denounce
          such conduct. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[43] The present appeal differs factually from Inwood in that  the
domestic  violence  occurred  in a child-parent,  not  a  spousal,
context.   And  it differs legally in that specific deterrence  is
not  a  factor.  However, in my view, the general rule set out  in
the  italicized  passage is as valid today  as  it  was  in  1989.
Crimes   involving  significant  bodily  harm,  especially  crimes
involving  violent  death,  need to be repudiated  and  denounced.
Absent   significant  mitigating  circumstances,   a   conditional
sentence is inappropriate for such crimes.
[44] I would allow the appeal and convert Mr. Turcotte&#146;s sentence
to a custodial sentence of two years less a day.  I would give him
credit for the portion of the conditional sentence he has already
served since it was imposed.</pre>
