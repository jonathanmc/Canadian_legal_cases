    <pre><strong>HEARD:         May 16, 2000</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Spence J. dated October 29, 1998.

[1]  We are not persuaded that the trial judge made any of the
errors in his findings of fact relied upon by the appellant.  In
our view, there was evidence to support each of the impugned
findings.  Although the trial judge, in his reasons, did not
specifically mention some of the evidence referred to by the
appellant, his findings are nevertheless reasonable even when
viewed in light of that evidence.  The appeal against the
judgment is therefore dismissed.
[2]  In our view, the trial judge erred in principle in awarding
solicitor-client costs to the respondent.  Solicitor-client costs
may be ordered in cases where allegations of fraud are shown to
be totally unfounded:  131843 Canada Inc. v. Double &#147;R&#148; (Toronto)
Ltd. (1992), 7 C.P.C. (3d) 15 at p. 17 (Ont. Ct. Gen. Div.).
This same principle has also been expressed as follows:
Solicitor-client costs may be justified where a defendant
unjustly accuses a plaintiff of fraudulent and dishonest conduct
and persists in the assertion through the trial without being
able to establish it:  Procor Ltd. v. U.S.W.A. (1990), 71 O.R.
(2d) 410 at p. 437 (H.C.J.).
[3]  In this case, the trial judge found that the appellant made
allegations that were tantamount to fraud and dishonest conduct.
He found that the allegations &#147;had not been made out&#148; and &#147;were
without foundation.&#148;
[4]  In our view, the allegations in the statement of claim
relied upon by the trial judge did not constitute allegations of
fraud or dishonest conduct that warrant an order for solicitor-
client costs.  In his statement of claim, the appellant alleged
that the respondent &#147;artificially depressed&#148; the consideration
for the shares of RKA &#147;in order to defeat or avoid the
obligations to the plaintiff&#148; under the minutes of settlement.
The plaintiff also alleged that the respondent had made an oral
representation &#147;falsely or recklessly, not caring whether it was
true or false.&#148;
[5]  These allegations, while strong in tone, stop short of
necessarily attributing to the respondent a fraudulent or
dishonest intention in doing the things that were alleged in the
statement of claim.
[6]  Moreover, while these allegations were not established at
trial, they were not made without some justification.  On the
uncontested evidence, there was a basis for a legitimate concern
on the part of the appellant that the shares provided to the
respondent personally were in fact consideration for the sale of
the shares of RKA.  We do not view the appellant&#146;s pursuit of
this claim through trial to be unreasonable.
[7]  In the result, we grant leave to appeal the order as to
costs, allow the appeal, set aside the order for solicitor-client
costs, and substitute an award of party-party costs.
[8]  The costs issue formed a very small portion of this appeal.
We order that the respondent recover 90 percent of his costs of
the appeal.</pre>
