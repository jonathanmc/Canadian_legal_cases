</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the judgment of Sharpe J. dated March 1, 1999.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>WEILER J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  Laurentian Bank of Canada (&#147;Laurentian&#148;) and Unisource
Canada Inc. (&#147;Unisource&#148;) disagree as to which of them has
priority to realize on a security interest under the Personal
Property Security Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.P.10 (the &#147;Act&#148;).  The
issue in this appeal is whether the motions judge erred in
holding that the general security agreement held by Unisource had
priority.  Laurentian appeals on the basis that it had a purchase
money security interest (&#147;PMSI&#148;) and that the motions judge erred
in holding that it did not.  The reasons of the motions judge are
reported at (1999) 14 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 206 (Gen. Div.).
[2]  Section 1 of the Act defines a &#147;purchase money security
interest&#148; in part as &#147;a security interest taken by a person who
gives value for the purpose of enabling the debtor to acquire
rights in or to collateral to the extent that the value is
applied to acquire the rights.&#148; (Emphasis added.)
[3]  Pursuant to s.33(2) of the Act, &#147;a purchase-money security
interest in collateral or its proceeds has priority over any
other security interest in the same collateral given by the same
debtor&#148; provided that certain conditions are met.  There is no
dispute that, if the security interest held by Laurentian meets
the definition of being a PMSI, the conditions of s.33(2) were
fulfilled and Laurentian&#146;s security interest has priority over
that of Unisource.
[4]  The background facts to the appeal are not in dispute.
Printer&#146;s Group acquired a Mitsubishi printing press, sold it to
the Royal Bank, and then entered into a lease of the printing
press from the Royal Bank for a period of five years with an
option to buy the press at the end of the term.1 The Royal Bank
registered and perfected a security interest in the printing
press on August 30, 1995.  Printer&#146;s Group also owed money to
Unisource for the supply of paper.  Printer&#146;s Group gave
Unisource a general security agreement over its assets that was
perfected by registration on February 7, 1996.  The Royal Bank&#146;s
security interest, registered first in time, was first in
priority while that of Unisource was second.
[5]  Laurentian subsequently agreed with Printer&#146;s Group to
refinance the printing press.  If, as part of the refinancing,
Laurentian had taken an assignment of the Royal Bank&#146;s first
security interest, there would be no dispute that Laurentian&#146;s
interest would have priority over that of Unisource.  Instead,
Laurentian paid to the Royal Bank the amount outstanding on the
printing press and registered a general security agreement.
After receiving the money from Laurentian, the Royal Bank&#146;s
security interest was discharged on April 15, 1997 and legal
title of the press passed to Printer&#146;s Group.  Printer&#146;s Group
went bankrupt in May 1997.  Laurentian claimed a priority
interest in the printing press on the basis that it held a PMSI.
[6]  Unisource brought a motion for a summary judgment that its
security interest had priority over Laurentian&#146;s.  The position
of Unisource was that the security interest of Laurentian was not
a PMSI because, in paying the Royal Bank, Laurentian did not
enable &#147;the debtor to acquire rights in or to collateral.&#148;
(Emphasis added.)
[7]  The motions judge held:

     	The Laurentian refinancing did not alter or
	improve the debtor&#146;s [Unisource] position with
	respect to the press in any material way.  The 
	debtor did not add to its pool of assets or
        otherwise enhance its financial position by 
	acquiring something it did not have previously.  
	The effect of the Laurentian refinancing was 
	merely to substitute one financing technique or
        vehicle for another.  As a result of the 
	refinancing, it is true that the debtor did, for 
	a brief time, acquire legal title to the press, 
	but it quickly reconveyed that title to Laurentian 
	under the terms of its general security agreement 
	which provided that the debtor:</pre>
    <pre>        &#133;grants, sells, assigns, conveys, transfers, 
	mortgages, pledges and charges as in by way of 
	fixed and specific mortgage and charge to and in 
	favour of the bank and grants to the bank a
        security interest in all personal property of 
	every nature and kind whatsoever and wheresoever 
	situate.</pre>
    <pre>        The debtor&#146;s right to retain possession and use 
	of the press was still contingent upon it making 
	the payments required under its loan, now to 
	Laurentian, for an amount that included the price 
	of the press.  In my view, neither the acquisition 
	of legal title, nor the change in the arrangements 
	for the financing of the press, satisfy the 
	statutory definition for a PMSI.  Laurentian&#146;s 
	financing merely altered the manner in which the
        debtor financed the acquisition or retention of 
	the press and did not result in any new assets 
	being added to the debtor&#146;s pool of assets.  It 
	follows that the purpose of the PMSI exception has
        not been met.</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellant asks that the judgment be set aside and
replaced with a judgment declaring that Laurentian has a PMSI in
the printing press.
[9]  For the reasons that follow I would respectfully disagree
with the conclusion of the motions judge that the acquisition of
legal title by Printer&#146;s Group did not satisfy the statutory
definition of a PMSI. Laurentian&#146;s financing did not merely alter
the manner in which the debtor financed the press.  It enabled
Printer&#146;s Group to acquire further rights in the press that it
previously did not have. In so doing, Laurentian met the
statutory definition for a PMSI.
[10] The purpose of giving priority to a PMSI is to enable the
person who has advanced funds for the acquisition of a particular
asset to have the first priority over creditors who hold general
security over all of the assets.  See Re 1151162 Ontario Ltd.
(1997), 13  P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 16 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) at 18;
Royal Bank v. Tisdale Credit Union (1992), 4 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 44
(Sask. Q.B.).  In this case, Laurentian advanced the funds that
enabled Printer&#146;s Group to acquire title to the press. The
motions judge was of the opinion that, given the existing
lease/option to purchase arrangement with the Royal Bank, the
acquisition of title by Printer&#146;s Group amounted to a distinction
without a difference.  Under the Royal Bank lease/option to
purchase financing, however, the equitable interest of Printer&#146;s
Group was a contingent one, the contingency being the election by
the debtor to exercise the option to purchase.  Printer&#146;s Group
might never acquire title.2  Notably, the definition of a PMSI
excludes &#147;a transaction of sale by and lease back to the seller.&#148;
Under the Laurentian financing, the interest of Printer&#146;s Group
was not contingent. There was certainty of title.
[11] The motions judge appears to have been of the opinion that
where the debtor has already taken possession of an asset a
refinancing does nothing to improve the debtor&#146;s position and 
a PMSI cannot be created.  In support of his opinion, the motions 
judge cited the following extract from the reasons of Gotlib J. 
in Greyvest Leasing Inc. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
(1991), 1 P.P.S.A.C. (2d) 264 at 269:
          </pre>
    <pre>          If a creditor could obtain a PMSI merely by
          helping a debtor to pay for something of
          which the debtor had already taken possession
          then all lenders to debtors who had not fully
          paid for all property in their possession
          could obtain PMSI&#146;s and take priority over
          earlier general creditors.  That cannot have
          been the legislator&#146;s intention.
          </pre>
    <pre>In her reasons, however, Gotlib J. recognized that the mere
possession of equipment by a debtor prior to entering into a
security agreement did not exclude it from a PMSI provided that
further legal rights were acquired. At p. 269 she stated:

	Because a debtor has some rights in an item of 
	collateral does not mean that it cannot obtain 
	further rights.  By giving value to the debtor 
	after the debtor has acquired rights in the
        collateral the creditor has not enabled the 
	debtor to acquire those rights but the creditor 
	may have enabled the debtor to acquire other 
	subsequent rights in the collateral.  Only where
        the debtor has acquired &#147; all possible rights&#148; in 
	the collateral (North Platte State Bank..(sic.) 
	v. Production Credit Association of N. Platte, 
	200 N.W. 2d 1 S.Ctr. Nebraska. (1972)) does it
        follow that a subsequent giving of value by the 
	creditor could not have enabled the debtor to 
	acquire rights in the collateral.</pre>
    <pre>[12] On the facts of the case before her, Gotlib J. concluded
that the giving of value did not enable the debtor to acquire
further rights.  As I have indicated, that is not the situation
here because title to the printing press was acquired.
[13] The interpretation I propose is consonant with sound
commercial policy.  If a difference between a lease/option
arrangement and the acquisition of title is recognized, it will
be easier for the debtor to enter into a new financing
arrangement to acquire further rights in collateral without the
cooperation of the original lender being required.  The debtor
and its business will benefit.  The proposed interpretation also
accords with the original expectations of the parties in this
case that the security interest granted to Unisource would rank
second in priority. It would be unfair for Unisource to have
added to the pool of its security the printing press purchased
with funds from Laurentian.  To hold as the motions judge did
results in Unisource receiving a windfall.
[14]  I would therefore hold that the motions judge erred in his
conclusion that there was no significant difference between the
two types of transactions.  By enabling Printer&#146;s Group to
acquire title, the transaction with Laurentian did enable
Printer&#146;s Group &#147;to acquire rights in or to collateral.&#148;
[15] An additional issue raised by the respondent on this appeal
is that the definition of a PMSI does not give Laurentian
priority with respect to all of the money advanced.  The
respondent submitted in its factum that in the event this court
finds that the motions judge erred in his interpretation of the
definition of a PMSI, the court must determine how much of the
money advanced was used to acquire the rights to the printing
press. This issue was not raised or argued on the original motion
and we did not have the figures  before us to make a
determination of this issue.  The submission was abandoned at the
hearing of this appeal.  Consequently, I need not deal with it.
[16] I would accordingly allow the appeal, set aside the order of
the motions judge, declare that Laurentian has a PMSI to the
Mitsubishi press and that it is entitled to priority over
Unisource.  Costs of the appeal and of the motion below are to
the appellant.
