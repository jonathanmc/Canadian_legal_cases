    <pre>[1]  This is a motion for special leave to appeal under s. 131 of
the  Provincial  Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33.   The  issue
concerns  the  interpretation of the exemption in s.  34  of  the
Public  Accountancy  Act, R.S.O. 1990,  c.  P.37  for  management
accountants.
[2]  Leclerc J.P. found that the statements prepared by the
respondent in 1993 and 1994, though on their face directed to
management in accordance with the respondent's contractual
relationship with the company, were intended for other uses.
These uses included disclosure to the company&#146;s banker and to a
prospective purchaser of the Coach House.  The justice of the
peace held that the respondent knew or in effect was wilfully
blind to the fact that the statements would be used for reasons
other than those identified on the statements.  The justice of
the peace therefore applied the decisions of this court in R. v.
Manuel (1982), 38 O.R. (2d) 321 and R. v. Rayner (1982), 38 O.R.
(2d) 336 and found the respondent guilty.
[3]  In his reasons on appeal, Fitzgerald J. held that &#147;even if
Mr. Venn were aware that the statements he had either prepared,
or was preparing for the Coach House, would come to the attention
of the bank and, or the purchaser, the nature of the statements
had not been changed, nor had the relationship between Mr. Venn
and the Coach House changed&#148;.  He went on to hold that in the
result, the respondent was not purporting to act as an
&#147;independent accountant, or auditor&#148;.  Later, Fitzgerald J. held
that the fact that the respondent knew certain persons outside
management would use the statement &#147;does not change the nature of
the statements nor the practice in which Mr. Venn was engaged&#148;.
He then purported to apply the reasons of Blair J.A. in Manuel
and allowed the appeal.
[4]  Mr. Wires argues that this case is nothing more than an
application of settled law to a particular set of facts and
therefore this is not a proper case for granting special leave.
[5]  I do not agree.  In my view, this case raises a question of
law alone concerning the interpretation of s. 34 of the Public
Accountancy Act.  More importantly, it raises an issue that Blair
J.A. seems to have left open in R. v. Manuel.  In that case he
held as follows at p. 331:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The evidence as to the use or intended use of the
accountant's statements is clear and uncomplicated 
in this case and the Rayner case.  It is not difficult 
to envisage cases where it may not be.  More searching 
questioning of clients might reveal that they used or 
intended to use such financial statements in the 
ordinary course of business in dealing with banks, 
creditors or others.  Where such use was possible it 
would be difficult for accountants to establish that 
they did not know or ought not to have known that their 
statements would be used by third parties. [Emphasis added]
          </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>And at p. 332:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It should be emphasized that third party use is
not the same as third party reliance, which the
appellant maintained was the distinctive characteristic
of public accountancy.  Third party reliance is related
to the function of the auditor who independently
investigates and certifies accounts.  But the use to be
made of statements is a narrower concept and does not
include the requirement of certification upon which
reliance may be placed.  Accountants preparing
statements for use by management are exempt from the
licensing requirement, but the disclosure or the
reasonable prospect of disclosure of such statements to
third parties for their use in dealing with management
may disentitle the accountant to the exemption.  I have
used the words &quot;may disentitle&quot; advisedly so as not to
preclude full consideration of this issue in future.
However, my view is that if certified general
accountants were to act outside the narrowly defined
role of the management accountant, they would be
trespassing in the field of public accounting for which
they are not licensed. [Emphasis added]</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[6]   Blair J.A. contemplated that the very issue raised in  this
case  might arise in the future.  In my view, it is essential  in
the  public  interest and for the due administration  of  justice
that the issue be resolved.  As matters presently stand there  is
considerable  uncertainty as to the scope of the s. 34  exemption
in light of the caveat in Manuel and the reasons of Fitzgerald J.
It also seems to me that this is a matter that is bound to recur,
especially in light of the reasons of Fitzgerald J.
[7]  Accordingly, special leave to appeal is granted.
