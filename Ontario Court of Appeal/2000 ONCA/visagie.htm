    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Madam Justice K. Feldman dated
October 14, 1998
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CHARRON J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  This is an appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment of
Feldman J. in an action for breach of a confidentiality
agreement, breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty
arising out of a joint venture between the parties for the
acquisition and operation of certain gold mines in Greece. The
appellant also brings a motion to introduce fresh evidence on the
appeal. Further, the proposed fresh evidence forms the basis of a
motion brought before this court  by 1235866 Ontario Inc., a
stranger to this litigation, seeking to set aside Feldman J.&#146;s
judgment and to be added as a necessary party to the action at a
new trial. I will deal with this latter motion as part of these
reasons.</pre>
    <pre><strong>A.   OVERVIEW OF THE FACTS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[2]  The trial judge made an extensive and thorough review of the
facts in her reasons for decision, indexed as Visagie v. TVX Gold
Inc. and reported at (1998), 42 B.L.R. (2d) 53. I propose to give
just a brief outline of those facts that are necessary to put
these reasons in context.
[3]  In October 1993, the respondents, Hendrik M. Visagie, David
Lean and James Stephenson, collectively referred to as the Alpha
Group (&#147;Alpha&#148;), approached the appellant TVX Gold Inc. (&#147;TVX&#148;)
to propose that it become Alpha&#146;s joint venture partner for the
purpose of acquiring certain mines in Greece known as the
Kassandra mines (&#147;Kassandra&#148;).
[4]  Alpha had gained much of its knowledge of Kassandra through
the employment of two of its members, Visagie and Lean, with
Curragh Resources Inc. (&#147;Curragh&#148;), a Canadian mining company.
Visagie and Lean had both worked on attempts by Curragh to
purchase the Kassandra properties until sometime in the summer of
1993. During the course of his employment with Curragh, Visagie
had signed two agreements concerning the general protection of
confidential information gained while in the employ of Curragh.
Eventually Curragh&#146;s efforts to acquire Kassandra failed and
Curragh went into receivership. (Curragh&#146;s residual assets were
subsequently acquired by 1235866 Ontario Inc., the moving party
on the motion to set aside Feldman J.&#146;s judgment.)
[5]  Alpha took the position that it was entitled to pursue the
matter on its own account since Curragh was no longer interested
in acquiring Kassandra. At trial, Alpha took the position that
Curragh&#146;s interest in acquiring Kassandra had ceased by the end
of July 1993. Lean, who was an officer of Curragh at the time,
testified that, following July 30, 1993, he had taken no more
steps with respect to Kassandra on behalf of Curragh. Visagie,
who, at different times, had been employed by and had acted as a
consultant for Curragh, testified that he came to the conclusion
that Kassandra was valuable as a gold mine as a result of further
work that he did in August 1993, at a time when Curragh was no
longer pursuing its interest in Kassandra. (TVX seeks to
introduce fresh evidence to establish that, contrary to Alpha&#146;s
position, Curragh was still interested in acquiring Kassandra in
August 1993.)
[6]  In the summer of 1993, Alpha was actively seeking financing,
which it needed to acquire the mines. Eventually, it approached
TVX. Before revealing any if its information, Alpha insisted that
TVX sign a confidentiality agreement, which it did on October 26,
1993. Alpha then gave TVX its information about Kassandra. After
some further inquiries, TVX entered into a joint venture funding
agreement with Alpha on November 25, 1993. Under the terms of the
agreement, Alpha was to bring to the joint venture what was
referred to as &#147;Proprietary Information&#148; and an &#147;exclusive right
to negotiate the acquisition of all of the mining assets&#148; of
Kassandra for a price of US$32,000,000. TVX was to bring the
ability to fund the acquisition and the expertise to develop
Kassandra. The agreement further provided that Alpha was to
receive a 12% carried interest and the option to take up a
further 12% participating interest in the operation once acquired
by TVX.
[7]  Once the joint venture funding agreement was in place, as
agreed between the parties, TVX took control of the negotiations
with the Greek government and attempted to make an acceptable bid
for the mines.  However, it became clear over the next few months
that the Greek government was not prepared to allow the mines to
be sold privately but only through a public tender process. TVX
was eventually officially advised of this.  On July 22, 1994, TVX
terminated its obligations under the joint venture funding
agreement with Alpha, as it was entitled to do under its terms.
TVX bid for the mines on its own in the tender process and was
successful, ultimately paying U.S. $47 million.
[8]  In April 1995, after it was announced that TVX was the
successful bidder, Alpha claimed its 12% carried interest and the
right to purchase a further 12% participating interest.  TVX
denied that Alpha had any interest in the mines.  Alpha brought
this action later in 1995 for a) a declaration that TVX holds the
whole of Kassandra in trust for Alpha as a result of breach of
fiduciary duty and misuse of confidential information; or
alternatively, b) a 12% carried interest plus a further right to
purchase a 12% interest in Kassandra; and c) damages.</pre>
    <pre><strong>B.   THE FINDINGS AT TRIAL</strong></pre>
    <pre>[9]  At trial, TVX advanced four defences to Alpha&#146;s claim:</pre>
    <pre>     a)   TVX was entitled to terminate the joint venture funding
          agreement and acquire the mine on its own account as it
          did.
     </pre>
    <pre>     b)   the information provided to it by Alpha was available
          in the public domain and was not confidential;
     </pre>
    <pre>     c)   even if the information was confidential, TVX did not
          use the information in acquiring Kassandra; and
     </pre>
    <pre>     d)   in any event, the information did not belong to Alpha
          but to Curragh and, consequently, Alpha did not have
          standing to claim any relief.
</pre>
    <pre>[10] The trial judge disposed of these four defences as follows.
     </pre>
    <pre>     a)   The trial judge held that TVX was entitled to terminate
          the joint venture funding agreement according to its
          terms. The trial judge, however, held that, as a result
          of the relationship between the parties as joint
          venturers and the nature of their agreement, TVX owed a
          fiduciary duty to Alpha not to acquire Kassandra except
          for their joint benefit, which duty survived the
          termination of the joint venture funding agreement.
          Consequently, she held that TVX breached its fiduciary
          duty when it acquired Kassandra for its own account.
     </pre>
    <pre>     b)   The trial judge found that the information provided to
          TVX by Alpha was not readily available in the public
          domain as contended by TVX. She held further that
          Alpha&#146;s information had the necessary quality of
          confidentiality to be worthy of protection in law.
     </pre>
    <pre>     c)   The trial judge found that TVX used this confidential
          information in acquiring Kassandra in breach of the
          terms of the confidentiality agreement and in breach of
          its common law duty of confidence.
     </pre>
    <pre>     d)   The trial judge rejected TVX&#146;s argument that Alpha had
          no standing to sue because the information belonged to
          Curragh and held that Alpha clearly had standing based
          on the agreements between the parties. The trial judge
          noted that no argument was advanced by TVX that it had
          entered into an illegal contract with Alpha with
          respect to someone else&#146;s information. She queried
          however whether the court, on its own motion, had an
          obligation not to enforce the contract for public
          policy reasons. She concluded that, without a complaint
          by Curragh and an action involving Curragh where the
          issues could be properly litigated, the court had
          insufficient facts upon which to conclude that the
          confidentiality agreement, to the extent that it
          concerned Curragh information, was an illegal contract.
     
</pre>
    <pre>[11] By way of remedy, the trial judge held that Alpha is not
entitled to a constructive trust over all of Kassandra but is
entitled to a 12% carried interest and, having purported to
exercise its option to purchase, a further 12% participating
interest in Kassandra upon payment of the costs associated with
that interest.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>C.   THE ISSUES ON THE APPEAL AND THE CROSS-APPEAL</strong></pre>
    <pre>[12] On its appeal, TVX asks that the judgment be set aside and
that Alpha&#146;s action be dismissed, or alternatively, that any
damages found properly payable to Alpha be directed to be
quantified by way of reference. TVX also seeks leave to introduce
fresh evidence and, on the basis of this fresh evidence, seeks,
as a further alternative, an order for a new trial.
[13] Alpha cross-appeals, seeking a constructive trust over 100%
of Kassandra, or alternatively damages for the full value of
Kassandra in the amount of US $800,000,000 or in the further
alternative, damages in the amount of US $96,000,000 for the 12%
carried interest and a further US $96,000,000 for the 12%
participating interest (less certain developmental costs).
[14] The issues raised by TVX on the appeal are essentially
parallel to the defences it advanced at trial.  They can be
determined by answering the following questions.
     </pre>
    <pre>1.   Was the trial judge correct in holding that TVX owed a
     fiduciary duty to Alpha that survived the termination of the
     joint venture funding agreement?</pre>
    <pre>2.   Was the trial judge correct in finding that the information
     provided to TVX by Alpha was worthy of the court&#146;s
     protection?</pre>
    <pre>     a)   did the information have the necessary quality of
          confidentiality?
     </pre>
    <pre>     b)   should Alpha be precluded from benefiting from its own
          wrongful misappropriation of the information from
          Curragh? (The proposed fresh evidence is directed
          mostly at this inquiry.)</pre>
    <pre>3.   Was the trial judge correct in finding that TVX used
     confidential information belonging to Alpha in its
     acquisition of Kassandra?</pre>
    <pre>4.   Was the confidential information sufficiently valuable to
     warrant the remedy awarded?
</pre>
    <pre>[15] Alpha&#146;s cross-appeal is entirely focussed on the
appropriateness of the remedy granted by the trial judge. In
large part, the cross-appeal hinges on the correctness of the
trial judge&#146;s conclusion that TVX owed a fiduciary duty to Alpha
that survived the termination of the joint venture funding
agreement and is therefore related to question 1. The issues
raised by the cross-appeal are otherwise answered under question
4 in the main appeal.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>D.   ANALYSIS</strong></pre>
    <pre>[16] It is my view that the trial judge erred in finding that
there was a fiduciary relationship between TVX and Alpha and that
this fiduciary relationship survived the termination of the joint
venture funding agreement. This conclusion rests mainly on a
consideration of the facts, as found by the trial judge, but in
the light of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd., [1999] 1 S.C.R. 142
which was released after the trial of this matter. Consequently,
I am of the view that nothing precluded TVX from acquiring
Kassandra for its own account after terminating the joint venture
funding agreement.
[17] TVX remained bound, however, by the terms of the
confidentiality agreement and by its common law duty of
confidence not to use confidential information obtained from
Alpha, except for the joint benefit of the parties. The trial
judge&#146;s findings that Alpha provided TVX with information that
had the necessary quality of confidentiality to be worthy of
protection at law and that TVX used this information as a
springboard in its acquisition of Kassandra are based on correct
legal principles, are entirely reasonable and supported by the
evidence. Hence I see no reason to interfere with these findings.
I also agree with the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that there were
insufficient facts before her to conclude that the
confidentiality agreement was illegal and unenforceable.
Consequently, I would not interfere with the trial judge&#146;s
conclusion that TVX breached the terms of the confidentiality
agreement and its common law duty of confidence.
[18] The remedy awarded by the trial judge was available not only
for breach of fiduciary duty but also for breach of
confidentiality and, in the circumstances of this case, was
appropriate.  I see no reason to interfere with the award or with
the trial judge&#146;s refusal to quantify it in dollar amounts.
[19] It is further my view that the fresh evidence should not be
admitted. It does not meet the test set out in R. v. Palmer,
[1980] 1 S.C.R. 759. I would therefore dismiss TVX&#146;s motion to
introduce fresh evidence and dismiss the appeal. Finally, I would
also dismiss the motion brought by Curragh&#146;s successor, 1235866
Ontario Inc. The issues raised by 1235866 Ontario Inc. can be
properly adjudicated in the new action brought by 1235866 Ontario
Inc. against TVX, Alpha and others and, in my view, it is not
necessary to set aside this judgment to achieve a just result.
[20] As indicated earlier, the arguments on the cross-appeal, in
large part, are dependent on the existence of a fiduciary
relationship between the parties. In view of my conclusions on
this point and on the overall appropriateness of the remedy, I
would also dismiss the cross-appeal.
[21] I now propose to answer the questions set out earlier.
     </pre>
    <pre>     <strong>1.   <em>Did TVX owe a fiduciary duty to Alpha that survived
          the termination of their agreement?</em></strong></pre>
    <pre>[22] TVX argues that the trial judge erred in finding that it had
a continuing duty not to acquire Kassandra, except for the joint
benefit of the parties, after the termination of the joint
venture funding agreement. This ground of appeal hinges on the
correctness of the trial judge&#146;s conclusion that TVX owed a
fiduciary duty to Alpha as a result of their relationship as
joint venturers and that this duty survived the termination of
the joint venture funding agreement.
[23] At pp. 78-96 of her judgment, the trial judge reviews in
detail the dealings between Alpha and TVX from the time the
parties first came together, through the course of their joint
venture agreement, to the termination of the relationship.  It is
therefore not necessary to review this evidence here. Later in
her judgment, the trial judge deals with the issue of fiduciary
duty. Relying on Wonsch Construction Co. v. National Bank of
Canada  (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 382 (C.A.), she concluded, at p.122,
that the parties owed fiduciary duties to one another because
they were joint venturers. She described the mutual obligations
arising from the agreement succinctly as follows (at p.123):</pre>
    <pre>	  The joint venture funding agreement of 
	  November 25, 1993 clearly made the parties 
	  joint venturers in relation to the acquisition 
	  and ongoing ownership and operation (sharing 
	  of profits) of the Kassandra mines. Therefore, 
	  neither Alpha nor TVX could seek to acquire 
	  the Kassandra mines for its own account during 
	  the currency of that agreement. That would  be 
	  a breach of the duty of good faith and loyalty 
	  each owed to the other.

          However, before the mines were acquired
          TVX had the right to terminate its obligation
          to fund the acquisition. Alpha had no express
          right to terminate its obligations under the
          agreement. The agreement does provide for
          what happens to the joint venture company,
          Aegean, if TVX exercises its right to
          terminate. First the Alpha Group must
          purchase from TVX its interest in Aegean if
          either Alpha or Aegean buys the mines. Second
          the Aegean Board of Directors&#146; representation
          reverses, with TVX having only one Board
          member and Alpha three. Therefore the joint
          venture funding agreement contemplates that
          if TVX terminates its obligations, either
          Aegean or Alpha may proceed to purchase the
          mines. There is no provision that
          contemplates TVX proceeding to buy the mines.

          Therefore the agreement by its terms
          contemplates that Alpha&#146;s fiduciary
          obligation not to acquire the mines does not
          survive the termination of the agreement by
          TVX. The question for the court is whether in
          all the circumstances, the fiduciary
          obligation of TVX not to compete with the
          business did survive its termination of the
          joint venture.</pre>
    <pre>[24] The trial judge held that TVX had a continuing fiduciary
obligation not to compete in respect of the subject of the joint
venture beyond its termination. She based her conclusion on the
following factors: a) the duty of confidence owed by TVX to
Alpha; b) the fact that the maturing business opportunity (the
acquisition of Kassandra) was the same as that contemplated under
the joint venture agreement, albeit in the form of a public
tender process rather than a private sale; c) Alpha&#146;s
vulnerability to TVX under the terms of the joint venture
agreement; and d) the industry practice that upon the termination
of a funding agreement between a senior and a junior company, the
senior does not for a period of time pursue the acquisition of
the mining property for its own account.
[25] In my view, the trial judge erred in concluding that there
was a fiduciary relationship between the parties. The duties owed
by each party to the other during the currency of the agreement
and after its termination, as described by the trial judge, arose
from the terms of the agreement itself rather than from any
fiduciary obligation imposed by law. The Supreme Court of Canada
in Cadbury Schweppes, supra, makes it clear that fiduciary
obligations are seldom present in a commercial context between
parties acting at arm&#146;s length. Binnie J., in writing for the
Court, quoted at pp.163-4 the following from Frame v. Smith,
[1987] 2 S.C.R. 99:</pre>
    <pre>
          Because of the requirement of vulnerability 
	  of the beneficiary at the hands of the fiduciary, 
	  fiduciary obligations are seldom present in the 
	  dealings of experienced businessmen of similar 
	  bargaining strength acting at arm&#146;s length: see, 
	  for example, Jirna Ltd. v. Mister Donut of Canada 
	  Ltd. (1971), 22 D.L.R. (3d) 639 (Ont. C.A. ), 
	  aff&#146;d [1975] 1 S.C.R. 2. The law takes the
	  position that such individuals are perfectly
	  capable of agreeing as to the scope of the
	  discretion or power to be exercised, i.e., any
	  &#147;vulnerability&#148; could have been prevented
          through the more prudent exercise of their
	  bargaining power and the remedies for the
	  wrongful exercise or abuse of that discretion
  	  or power, namely damages, are adequate in such
	  a case.</pre>
    <pre>[26] Binnie J. added at p.164:

          To the same effect, see Lac Minerals per Sopinka
	  J. at p.595, Hodgkinson v. Simms, [1994] 3 S.C.R.
	  377 , at p.414, per La Forest J., and the comment
	  of Professor Davies that &#147;[s]trong evidence should
	  be required before a breach of confidential
          information situation is metamorphosed into one of
	  fiduciary relationship&#148; [Davies, J.D. &#147;Duties of
	  Confidence and Loyalty&#148;, [1990] Lloyd&#146;s Mar. &amp; Com
	  L.Q. 4 at p.7)]. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[27] Binnie J. further stated, however, that &#147;where the
ingredients giving rise to a fiduciary duty are otherwise
present, its existence will not be denied simply because of the
commercial context.&#148; He noted for example the case of Hodgkinson
v. Simms, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377, where a majority of the Supreme
Court held that the vulnerability of clients to their
professional advisors invoked traditional fiduciary principles.
In Cadbury Schweppes, Binnie J. found &#147;nothing in the
relationship between a juice manufacturer and its licensee to
suggest that the former surrendered its self-interest or rendered
itself &#145;vulnerable&#146; to a discretion conferred on the latter.&#148; On
the question of vulnerability, he stated  further at p.165:</pre>
    <pre>
          In some sense, disclosure of almost any 
	  confidential information places the confider
	  in a position of vulnerability to its misuse.
	  Such vulnerability, if exploited by the
	  confidee in a commercial context, can generally
	  be remedied by an action for breach of
	  confidence or breach of a contractual term,
	  express or implied [reference omitted]. In this
	  case, the licensing arrangement expressly
	  contemplated open competition upon termination,
	  subject for a period of five years to avoidance
	  of what came to be recognized as a useless
	  limitation, namely mixing clam broth with tomato
	  juice. While the law will supplement the
          contractual relationship by importing a duty not
 	  to misuse confidential information, there is
	  nothing special in this case to elevate the
	  breached duty to one of a fiduciary character. The
          respondents&#146; demand to have the appellants&#146; sales
	  treated as an asset &#145;pirated&#146; from the respondents
 	  by analogy with a trust estate goes too far.</pre>
    <pre>[28] In my view, the same reasoning should apply to this case.
The trial judge held that the dependency or vulnerability that is
&#147;indispensable to a fiduciary relationship&#148; existed in the
following way (at p.125):</pre>
    <pre>
          It is clear that once the joint venture
	  relationship was entered into, Alpha gave up all
	  active involvement in the project of acquiring
	  the mines and relied solely on TVX to pursue the
          transaction for the benefit of both. Alpha was
	  totally at the mercy of TVX&#146;s discretion before
	  termination, but perhaps more significantly, became
	  vulnerable to the advantage which TVX had gained
	  over Alpha because of its exclusive involvement
 	  over the period of the joint venture.</pre>
    <pre>[29] The vulnerability described by the trial judge simply flows
from the terms of the agreement freely entered into by the
parties. This is not the kind of vulnerability that will serve to
elevate the relationship between the parties to one that is
fiduciary in nature. There is no suggestion that Alpha was not in
an equal bargaining position vis-à-vis TVX. It would have been
open to Alpha, if it had chosen to do so, to negotiate greater or
different protection for itself than that provided by the
confidentiality agreement and the common law duty of confidence
in the event of a termination of the agreement and a subsequent
purchase by TVX. It did not do so. Presumably, Alpha was content
to give its confidential information to TVX, under the protection
of the confidentiality agreement, and to let TVX take over the
acquisition process, including all costs associated with it, in
return for an eventual 2 x 12% interest in Kassandra in the event
of a successful acquisition, on terms set out in the agreement.
There is no reason why equity should intervene to rewrite the
bargain. As found in Cadbury Schweppes, any resulting
vulnerability, if exploited by TVX, can be remedied in the action
for breach of confidence or for breach of the confidentiality
agreement.
[30] The incongruity of fiduciary principles in this context, in
my view, comes into focus when one considers Alpha&#146;s arguments on
the cross-appeal where it claims an entitlement to the whole of
Kassandra as a result of TVX&#146;s wrongful conduct. The principles
relied upon by Alpha in support of its claim are sound in a
fiduciary context. As noted by La Forest J. in Lac Minerals Ltd.
v. Int. Corona Resources, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574 at p. 657,
&#147;[f]iduciary law, being concerned with the exaction of a duty of
loyalty, does not require that harm in the particular case be
shown to have resulted.&#148;  Hence the remedy for breach of
fiduciary duty is not necessarily commensurate to the loss to the
beneficiary. It is a question rather of not allowing the
fiduciary to profit from its misconduct. It is essentially on
this basis that Alpha claims an entitlement to the entire gold
mines, a result that was never contemplated by the parties. Just
as Binnie J. held in Cadbury Schweppes, I too find that Alpha&#146;s
claim to the entire asset, by analogy with a trust estate, simply
&#147;goes too far.&#148;
[31] Another factor relied on by the trial judge in support of
her conclusion that TVX owed a fiduciary duty not to acquire
Kassandra mines on its own account after the termination of the
agreement was the existence of an industry practice to that
effect. She described the practice as follows (at p. 109):</pre>
    <pre>          I conclude that there is a mining industry
	  practice or understanding that after a senior
	  mining company terminates a funding arrangement
	  with a junior, the senior mining company does
          not compete with the junior for the property.
	  The prohibition may be expected to be time-limited.
</pre>
    <pre>[32] The Supreme Court in Lac Minerals (at p. 661) adopted the
following definition of &#147;usage&#148; from Halsbury&#146;s Laws of England,
vol. 12, 4th ed., para.445, at p.28:</pre>
    <pre>          Usage may be broadly defined as a particular
	  course of dealing or line of conduct generally
	  adopted by persons engaged in a particular
 	  department of business life, or more fully as a
          particular course of dealing or line of conduct
	  which has acquired such  notoriety, that, where
	  persons enter into contractual relationships in
	  matters respecting the particular branch of
 	  business life where the usage is alleged to exist,
          those persons must be taken to have intended to
	  follow that course of dealing or line of conduct,
	  unless they have expressly or impliedly stipulated
	  to the contrary&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[33] Reference can also be made to the principle in Cunliffe-Owen
v. Teather &amp; Greenwood, [1967] 1 W.L.R. 1421 (Ch.) at 1438:</pre>
    <pre>          &#147;Usage&#148; may be admitted to explain the language
	  used in a written contract or to add an implied
	  incident to it, provided that if expressed in
	  the written contract it would not make its
          terms or its tenor insensible or inconsistent
	  [references omitted].

          &#147;Usage&#148; is apt to be used confusingly in
          the authorities, in two senses, (1) a
          practice, and (2) a practice which the court
          will recognise. &#147;Usage&#148; as a practice which
          the court will recognise is a mixed question
          of fact and law. For the practice to amount
          to such a recognized usage, it must be
          certain, in the sense that the practice is
          clearly established; it must be notorious, in
          the sense that it is so well known, in the
          market in which it is alleged to exist, that
          those who conduct business in that market
          contract with the usage as an implied term;
          and it must be reasonable.

          The burden  lies on those alleging &#147;usage&#148; to
	  establish it&#133;</pre>
    <pre>[34] With respect, it is my view that the evidence, which was
accepted by the trial judge and reviewed by her in her reasons
for judgment (at p. 109), does not meet the required test.
[35] At the outset, it is particularly noteworthy that the
experts disagreed on this issue. While I am not prepared to
accept the appellant&#146;s contention that disagreement amongst the
experts is necessarily fatal to a finding of usage or industry
practice, it certainly raises a serious issue whether the
practice in question is sufficiently certain and notorious to be
recognized by the court as having a binding effect on the
parties.
[36] The trial judge relied mainly on the opinions of the
plaintiffs&#146; experts, Mr. McOuat and Mr. Lattanzi. She reviewed
their evidence as follows (at p. 109):</pre>
    <pre>          Mr. McOuat testified positively that there
	  is a practice in the mining industry that a
	  senior mining company which has withdrawn
	  from a funding arrangement with a geologist
	  or junior mining company gives up all rights
	  to the project and will not go after the
 	  project for itself without the other party.
	  In cross-examination he acknowledged that he
	  knew of no written articles on the subject
	  and that it was his personal view but that the
          opposite approach flies in the face of both
	  mining and common business practice.

          Mr. Lattanzi also expressed the view
          that there is a practice within the mining
          industry that a provider of funds for a
          project who has terminated the funding is
          prevented from pursuing the opportunity on
          its own.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Mr. Lattanzi indeed provided this opinion in answer to a
single question on the issue during the course of his examination-
in-chief but did not elaborate further or state the basis for his
opinion. As noted by the trial judge, Mr. McOuat acknowledged in
cross-examination that he was expressing a personal opinion only.
It is important to note as well that Mr. McOuat also acknowledged
in cross-examination that &#147;a confidentiality agreement can be a
stand-alone agreement.&#148; He stated that where the parties have an
agreement &#147;they&#146;ve gone past an exchange of information on a
confidential basis or an introduction of concept, and now they&#146;ve
reached a business arrangement.&#148; He also agreed with the
suggestion that the practice he was describing applied &#147;where
parties haven&#146;t otherwise explicitly written something out in a
legal contract.&#148;
[38] Hence it would appear that Mr. McOuat was describing a
practice which, in his personal opinion, would govern the conduct
of parties who have not gone further and made a &#147;business
arrangement.&#148; Of course, an established industry practice can
still have a binding effect on parties who have entered into a
written agreement. As noted above, the industry practice may
assist in the interpretation of the agreement or supplement it
with an implied term. However, it seems to me that Mr. McOuat&#146;s
testimony is more consistent with the opinions expressed by the
two defence experts, Mr. Anthony and Mr. Farquharson, that, in
the end result, the parties are governed by the agreement that
they negotiated. While it may be common to find some kind of non-
competition clause in the parties&#146; agreement, a fact acknowledged
by both Mr. Anthony and Mr. Farquharson, this does not mean that
the courts will imply such a term when there is none, on the
basis of &#147;usage&#148;.
[39] The following words of La Forest J. in Lac Minerals (at p.
661) are perhaps particularly apposite:</pre>
    <pre>          I should mention that I have the greatest
	  hesitation in saying that the only circumstances
	  in which a legal obligation can arise out of a
	  notorious business practice is when a contract
          results. The cases cited against implying terms
	  in a contract have no relevance to negotiating
	  practices. When the parties have reduced their
	  understandings to writing, it is obviously the
          proper course for courts to be extremely
	  circumspect in adding to the bargain they have
	  set down (see, for example, Burns v. Kelly
          Peters &amp; Associates Ltd. (1987), 41 D.L.R. (4th)
	  577, per Lambert J.A. at p.601; Nelson v. Dahl
 	  (1879), 12 Ch. D. 568 (C.A.); Norwich Winterthur
  	  Insurance (Australia) Ltd. v. Con-Stan Industries
 	  of Australia Pty. Ltd.,  [1983] 1 N.S.W.L.R. 461
          (C.A.).</pre>
    <pre>[40] The parties in this case have reduced their agreement to
writing. It was open to them to include a non-competition clause
that would prevent TVX from competing with Alpha for Kassandra.
They have not done so. As stated above, the court &#147;should be
extremely circumspect in adding to the bargain they have set
down.&#148;
[41] I would therefore answer the first question in the negative
and find that the trial judge was not correct in holding that TVX
owed a fiduciary duty to Alpha that survived the termination of
the joint venture funding agreement, which duty prevented TVX
from acquiring the gold mine on its own account. Of course, as
stated earlier, TVX was still bound by the terms of its
confidentiality agreement. This leads to the next issue.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     2.   <em>Was Alpha&#146;s information worthy of protection?</em></strong></pre>
    <pre>[42] TVX argues that the trial judge erred in finding that
Alpha&#146;s information was worthy of the court&#146;s protection. This
argument is twofold.
[43] First, TVX reiterates its position at trial that the
commercially useful information about Kassandra was readily
available in the public domain and that Alpha&#146;s additional
contribution to this information, if any, did not have the
necessary quality of confidentiality to be worthy of protection
in law.
[44] Second, TVX takes the position that Curragh, not Alpha, was
the owner of the confidential information, if any, and that Alpha
cannot be rewarded for its own wrongful act in disclosing this
information.
[45] On the first point, the trial judge rejected TVX&#146;s position.
After an extensive review of the relevant evidence on this point,
she concluded  as follows (at p. 105):</pre>
    <pre>          I conclude that the balance of the expert
	  opinion which I accept is to a greater or
	  lesser extent that Mr. Visagie did have
          some new and novel contribution to make to
	  the existing information and perspective on
	  Kassandra and that it had some value. I
	  conclude based on the evidence as well as the
	  expert opinions that Mr. Visagie developed
 	  new information, new theories and new
	  presentations of existing data so that he
	  created new information which was confidential
	  information to him until he disclosed it to others.</pre>
    <pre>[46] The appellant has not demonstrated that the trial judge&#146;s
conclusions on this point are in any way unreasonable or
unsupported by the evidence. I fail to see any merit to the
argument advanced by TVX on this point. In its factum, TVX takes
no issue with these findings other than to say that &#147;[i]t is
apparent from the Reasons for Judgment that neither the trial
judge nor the experts appropriately differentiated between
Curragh&#146;s information that had been misappropriated by Alpha and
information that was not thereby tainted.&#148; Hence, in the factum
at least, this first argument is simply collapsed into the second
argument. In oral argument, counsel made reference to some items
of documentary evidence in support of his client&#146;s position but,
in my view, has not shown any basis for interfering with the
trial judge&#146;s finding that the information provided by Alpha had
the necessary quality of  confidentiality to be worthy of
protection in law.
[47] This leaves the argument that Curragh, not Alpha, is the
rightful owner of the information. The argument advanced on
appeal appears to be different from that advanced at trial. At
trial, TVX argued that Alpha did not have standing to sue. This
argument was rejected by the trial judge and it is not renewed on
this appeal. Rather, TVX submits that the trial judge should have
acted on her own motion and dismissed the action on grounds of
public policy. It is argued that the trial court and this court
should not reward Alpha for its own wrongful act in appropriating
and disclosing confidential information belonging to Curragh.
[48] After dealing with the question of standing, the trial judge
addressed this issue at p. 112 of her reasons for judgment as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>          In this case the plaintiffs do not lack
	  standing to sue. However, the fact that
	  they appear to have made use of
          confidential information and proprietary
	  documents belonging to Curragh without
 	  authority to do so is prima facie
	  troublesome to the court when they seek
	  to enforce rights based on that very
          information. Of course, for TVX to resist
	  the enforcement based on the fact that the
	  information was Curragh&#146;s when there is
          nothing in the evidence to suggest any
	  contemporaneous concern or question about
	  any rights of Curragh when TVX received the
          information and dealt with the plaintiffs,
	  is somewhat disingenuous.

          No argument was advanced by the defendant
	  that it had entered into an illegal
          contract with the plaintiffs in respect of
          someone else&#146;s information and therefore
          their contract was unenforceable by the
          court. Although the court of its own motion
          may be obliged for public policy reasons not
          to enforce an illegal contract: Menard v.
          Genereux (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 55 (Ont. H.C.),
          this is not a situation where the parties
          were seeking to perpetrate a fraud on a third
          party.  There has been nothing secret about
          Alpha&#146;s existence nor about its attempts to
          purchase the mine both alone and with TVX,
          nor about this lawsuit. Furthermore, the
          express written intentions of the plaintiffs
          were not to compete with Curragh for the
          mines.

          The disclosure by Alpha and the use by
          both parties of Curragh&#146;s confidential
          information may be a breach of contract or
          even a tort if Curragh could show damage, but
          without a complaint by Curragh and an action
          with Curragh where the issues are tried and
          the facts found, I am not satisfied that this
          court has sufficient facts to make a finding
          that the Confidentiality Agreement to the
          extent it covers Curragh information is an
          illegal contract or one which the court
          should not enforce between Alpha and TVX.
          Counsel for the plaintiffs confirmed in
          argument that if Curragh wished to make a
          claim against either party for use of its
          confidential information, it could seek to do
          so.</pre>
    <pre>[49] TVX submits in its factum that &#147;the trial judge ought to
have been more than merely troubled&#148; and that &#147;the claims both in
law and in equity ought to have been dismissed on the strength of
the maxim that no court will lend its aid to a man who founds his
cause of action upon an immoral or illegal act.&#148; TVX submits
further that &#147;[t]he rights of Curragh or its successor vis-à-vis
TVX ought to be determined if and when those claims are advanced&#148;
and that Alpha &#147;should not be unjustly enriched merely because
those claims have not yet been advanced.&#148;
[50] I entirely agree with the trial judge&#146;s comment that for TVX
to resist the enforcement of its contract with Alpha on the basis
that the information was Curragh&#146;s when there was no concern
raised at the time is somewhat disingenuous. Further, I see no
basis for interfering with her conclusion that, on the facts
before her, there was an insufficient basis to conclude that the
confidentiality agreement was an illegal contract.  Hence I am of
the view that the trial judge was correct in refusing to dismiss
the action on her own motion on this basis.
[51] The question remains whether the proposed fresh evidence
should be received and if so, what impact it would have on this
issue.
[52] TVX seeks to rely on ten documents described in and attached
to an affidavit by Yanos Gramatidis sworn on November 5, 1999.
Mr. Gramatidis was Curragh&#146;s lawyer in Greece who, starting in
September 1992, acted for the corporation in its attempts to
acquire Kassandra. TVX submits that these documents were not in
evidence at trial and only came its attention in January 2000
when it was served with 1235866 Ontario Inc.&#146;s motion. TVX seeks
to rely on this fresh evidence to show that Curragh was still
pursuing its interest in acquiring Kassandra during the course of
August 1993, at a time when Alpha had commenced its own pursuit
for the acquisition of Kassandra. TVX argues that this is
contrary to the position advanced by Alpha at trial that, by the
end of July 1993, Curragh was no longer interested in acquiring
the mines. TVX argues that Alpha, in taking this position at
trial, &#147;obviously intended to cleanse their pursuit of Kassandra
from any taint of their fiduciary obligations to Curragh.&#148; It is
argued that, given the manner in which Alpha presented its case
at trial and the trial judge&#146;s concern over this issue, there is
good reason to believe that the fresh evidence would have
affected the outcome at trial. TVX argues further that Alpha, in
failing to disclose these documents, deliberately misled the
court and that, for this reason alone, a new trial should be
ordered.
[53] The Supreme Court of Canada set out a four part test for the
admission of fresh evidence on appeal in R. v. Palmer, supra at
775:</pre>
    <pre>          (a) the evidence should generally not be
	  admitted if, by due diligence, it could
	  have been adduced at trial&#133;

          (b) the evidence must be relevant in the
          sense that it bears upon a decisive or
          potentially decisive issue in the trial;
          
          (c) the evidence must be credible in the
          sense that it is reasonably capable of
          belief; and,
     
          (d) it must be such that if believed it
          could reasonably, when taken with the other
          evidence adduced at trial, be expected to
          have affected the result.</pre>
    <pre>[54] Before determining whether TVX can meet this test, it would
be useful to consider  how the fresh evidence compares with the
evidence at trial.
[55] The crucial pieces of &#147;fresh evidence&#148;, as relied on by TVX,
are a series of letters involving Lean, Gramatidis, and the
National Bank of Greece (&#147;NBG&#148;).  The first letter, dated July 6,
1993, is from Gramatidis to the NBG enclosing the final draft of
Curragh&#146;s Asset Purchase Agreement of Kassandra Mines with the
condition that the agreement should only be effected upon the
conclusion of the U.S.$60 million loan facility for Curragh by
NBG.  An almost identical letter (dated July 2, 1993) was in
evidence at trial, and therefore it is hard to see what this
letter would have added.
[56] There is a further letter from Gramatidis to NBG dated July
22, 1993, which informs NBG that if it fails to respond to the
Curragh offer by July 29, 1993, the Curragh proposal &#147;should be
deemed to be withdrawn&#148;.  This letter was not in evidence at
trial, but Feldman J. did have before her a letter from Lean to
Gramatidis dated July 19, 1993 instructing Gramatidis to write
the letter dated July 22 and instructing him as to what the
contents of that letter should be.
[57] A third letter sought to be introduced is from Lean to
Gramatidis dated July 29, 1993, and was written in response to a
letter from NBG to Gramatidis dated July 28, 1993 (which was in
evidence at trial) explaining that NBG could not proceed with
Curragh&#146;s proposal to purchase Kassandra until financing was in
place.  The July 29 letter instructs Gramatidis to respond to NBG
that Curragh is &#147;willing to enter into final negotiations&#148;.  This
letter follows a letter dated July 28, 1993, which was before
Feldman J., in which Lean requests comments from Frame on
Gramatidis&#146; advice that Curragh go ahead with negotiations.
[58] Gramatidis&#146; letter (dated July 30, 1993) in which he carries
out Lean&#146;s instructions is also sought to be introduced as fresh
evidence, but it merely reiterates the points set out in the July
29 letter.  Gramatidis then sends a follow-up letter to NBG on
August 16, 1993 again requesting a response.  Finally, NBG
responds on August 19, 1993 with a letter that, while not before
the trial judge, merely restates NBG&#146;s unchanged concern as to
financing that was stated in the letter dated July 28, 1993 that
was before the trial judge.
[59] In addition to these letters (and accompanying fax cover
sheets), the appellants seek to introduce a Draft Asset Purchase
Agreement and a Draft Facility Agreement.  The former was in
evidence before the trial judge, and the existence and terms of
the latter were set out in documents in evidence at trial.
[60] In my view, TVX&#146;s motion fails particularly with respect to
the first and fourth Palmer criteria.
[61] Clearly these documents existed at the time of trial. There
is nothing to indicate that they could not have been obtained
from the files of Curragh or from Curragh&#146;s Greek counsel, Mr.
Gramatidis, had any inquiries been made. Mr. Gregory Laing, Vice-
President and Legal and Corporate Secretary for TVX, deposes in
his affidavit filed in support of this motion that, in January
2000 when he was preparing to meet with Mr. Gramatidis over this
documentation, he &#147;mistakenly believed that representatives of
TVX Gold had approached Mr. Gramatidis in August or September of
1997 to obtain information on Curragh&#146;s involvement in
Kassandra.&#148; In fact no approach had been made by TVX, and it is
quite reasonable to wonder why this was not done.
[62] Two reasons are advanced to explain TVX&#146;s lack of due
diligence. First, Mr. Laing states in his affidavit that Mr.
Gramatidis confirmed that he would have been duty bound not to
discuss this matter by virtue of his obligations of
confidentiality to his client Curragh. Second, TVX argues the
evidence was not made available at trial due to Alpha&#146;s failure
to disclose this documentation in an attempt to deliberately
mislead the court.
[63] I find no merit to these arguments. Surely, had Curragh been
brought into the proceedings as an interested party, or one of
its representatives as a witness, Mr. Gramatidis&#146; duty of
confidentiality would not have prevented disclosure of this
evidence. Further, as noted by Alpha in its factum, TVX had &#147;full
access to Curragh&#146;s officers and directors, not the least through
Walter Bowen, a senior partner of TVX&#146;s counsel, Cassels, Brock &amp;
Blackwell, and who was also a director of and counsel to
Curragh.&#148; Curragh&#146;s existence or its pursuit of Kassandra was not
a secret. TVX was fully aware of Curragh&#146;s existence long before
trial and, indeed, in its Statement of Defence, pled that the
confidential information was Curragh&#146;s.
[64] Further, it is my view that TVX cannot simply rely on
Alpha&#146;s disclosure obligations in answer to its own lack of due
diligence. It is not at all clear to me from the material that
there was any deliberate failure to disclose or any misleading of
the court as alleged. Given the voluminous amount of material and
the fact that it was located in various places, it is hardly
surprising that some of it did not come forth. More importantly,
as noted above, on their face, the new documents do not appear to
add anything significantly different from the evidence that was
before the court.
[65] In his affidavit in support of the motion, Laing deposes
that the fresh evidence shows that Curragh&#146;s interest continued
through to at least August 10, 1993 and that NBG only responded
negatively on August 19, 1993, at a time after Alpha had sent in
an offer for Kassandra on August 15, 1993.  However, it is clear
from the August 19 letter that nothing had changed from the time
when NBG indicated in its July 28 letter that the Curragh offer
was unsatisfactory since that offer made no reference to the
lenders of Curragh and their commitment to finance the $60
million facility related to the project.  The Bank makes it clear
that it will require &quot;a bank guarantee to be provided by banks
acceptable to us&quot;.  It was also clear at trial that Curragh did
not have that financing in July and did not have it in August and
shortly thereafter, Curragh went into receivership.  There is
nothing obvious from this documentation that Lean was not
speaking the truth when he said that Curragh realized by the end
of July that they would no longer be pursuing Kassandra.  The
fact that there were some further attempts to have the Bank
change its position into August is of not much moment when taken
with all the evidence at trial and what actually transpired.
[66] The trial judge also had before her a memo dated July 30,
1993 from Lean to Gramatidis which instructs Gramatidis to &#147;take
no further action on this transaction other than to send the
letter to the NBG in accordance with our earlier instruction of
yesterday and to forward the amended draft agreements to us once
you have received them from the NBG.&#148;  Thus, it was clear at
trial that there was at least some activity into August and
therefore the &quot;fresh&quot; evidence count not have affected the
result.
[67] It is also worth noting that TVX has not offered affidavit
evidence from any former officer or senior employee of Curragh to
show that Curragh was actively pursuing the acquisition of the
Kassandra mines in August 1993.  Indeed, as stated above, upon
careful reading the evidence is to the contrary.
[68] For these reasons, I would dismiss TVX&#146;s motion to introduce
fresh evidence and would answer the second question in the
affirmative. The trial judge was correct in finding that the
information provided to TVX by Alpha was worthy of the court&#146;s
protection.</pre>
    <pre><strong>     3.   <em>Did TVX use confidential information belonging to Alpha
          in its acquisition of Kassandra?</em></strong></pre>
    <pre>[69] TVX submits that the trial judge erred in finding that it
had used confidential information belonging to Alpha in its
acquisition of Kassandra. This argument is also twofold.
[70] First, TVX argues that the trial judge placed the onus on
TVX to prove that it did not use confidential information that
belonged to Alpha and, in doing so, erred in law.
[71] Second, TVX argues that the evidence cannot reasonably
support the trial judge&#146;s finding that TVX used Alpha&#146;s
proprietary information as a &#147;springboard&#148; that led to the
acquisition of Kassandra.
[72] In support of its first argument, TVX relies on the
following excerpt from the trial judge&#146;s reasons for judgment (at
pp. 119-120):</pre>
    <pre>
          In Lac Minerals Ltd. LaForest J. set out the burden
	  put on the recipient of confidential information at
	  24-25:

            When information is provided in confidence,
	    the obligation is on the confidee to show
	    that the use to which he put the information
	    is not a prohibited use.  In Coco v. A.N.
	    Clark (Engineers) Ltd. [ [1969] R.P.C. 41
            (Eng. Ch. Div.)], at p.48, Megarry J. said
	    this in regard to the burden on the
            confidee to repeal a suggestion of
            confidence: &#147;In particular, where information
            of commercial or industrial value is given on
            a business-like basis and with some avowed
            common object in mind, such as a joint
            venture or the manufacture of articles by any
            one party for the other, I would regard the
            recipient as carrying a heavy burden if he
            seeks to repel a contention that he was bound
            by an obligation of confidence.&#148;  In my view,
            the same burden applies where it is shown
            that confidential information has been used
            and the user is called upon to show that such
            use was permitted.  Lac has not discharged
            that burden in this case.

          In my view, it is only logical to impose the same
	  heavy burden on the confidee who denies any
	  use of the information, to show that it did not use
	  that confidential information when it made the very
	  acquisition which was the purpose of the disclosure
	  of the information in the first place. [Emphasis
          added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>               There was no evidence from TVX that it did not
	  use in its bid any information provided to it by
	  Alpha originally or information gathered during the
	  period from November 25, 1993 to July 22, 1994 while
	  they were partners in the venture.  Significantly,
          Mr. Hick did not so testify, and Mr. Batista did not
	  testify at all.</pre>
    <pre>[73] TVX argues that the trial judge failed to give due
consideration to the fact that, in Lac Minerals,  it was admitted
by the defence that the information acquired from the plaintiff
was of value and that it had made use of this information. Hence
the inquiry in that case was not focussed on whether the
defendant had used the information but on whether the use in fact
made by the defendant was considered a permitted use. In this
case, it is argued that the trial judge misplaced the burden on
TVX to prove that it did not use the information.
[74] In my view, when the above-noted excerpt is read in the
context of the entire reasons on this point at pp. 118-122 it is
apparent that the trial judge did not reverse the onus as
alleged. She made an affirmative finding, based on the evidence
before her, that TVX used the information provided to it by
Alpha. In particular, immediately after stating at p. 120 that
there was no evidence from TVX that it did not use the
information, the trial judge states that &#147;[i]n fact the evidence
was to the contrary.&#148; She then reviews the evidence of use by
TVX. Given this finding of use, the trial judge was correct in
stating that it was then up to TVX to show that this use was
permitted. The impugned statement in her reasons at p. 120 simply
indicates that she sees no reason why the principle in Lac
Minerals should be different for a defendant who, rather than
admitting a use of the information and alleging that it was
permitted, denies using it at all. In either case, once use is
proven, the onus falls on the defendant to show that the use was
permitted.
[75] I also fail to see any merit in the second argument. In my
view, the evidence set out in the judgment, coupled with the
negative inference drawn against TVX by reason of Mr. Battista&#146;s
failure to testify, provides ample support for the trial judge&#146;s
findings. I see no reason to interfere and consequently, I would
answer the third question in the affirmative. The trial judge was
correct in finding that TVX used confidential information
belonging to Alpha in its acquisition of Kassandra.     </pre>
    <pre><strong>     4. <em>  Was the remedy appropriate? </em>    
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[76] TVX argues that, even if the information provided by Alpha
was confidential and worthy of the court&#146;s protection, it was not
sufficiently valuable to warrant the remedy awarded. It argues
that damages in the nature of a consultant&#146;s fee would be
adequate.
[77] The trial judge made a number of findings of fact in support
of her conclusion that Alpha brought a new and novel approach to
the mine, that this information was not public, it was
confidential and it was valuable. She also held that TVX first
became interested in acquiring Kassandra because of the
information provided to it by Alpha and that it used this
information as a springboard in the ultimate acquisition. Her
findings need not be repeated here. The appellant has not
succeeded in attacking any of them. Further, no basis is provided
to support its contention that a consultant&#146;s fee would be an
appropriate remedy.
[78] In my view, the remedy is reasonable and entirely
appropriate. It is the best remedy available to restore Alpha to
the position in which it would have been if no wrong had been
committed. Even in the absence of a breach of fiduciary duty, the
remedy awarded is still available: see Lac Minerals, supra, at
643. There is no reason to interfere.</pre>
    <pre><strong>E.   THE CROSS-APPEAL</strong></pre>
    <pre>[79] On its cross-appeal, Alpha seeks a determination that they
are entitled to a constructive trust over the entire Kassandra
lands and project.  This claim is based on fiduciary principles
and Alpha argued in its factum that TVX has been unjustly
enriched to the full extent of its interest in Kassandra and that
the principles adopted in Lac Minerals, supra, require that Alpha
receive the entire Kassandra project subject only to repayment to
TVX of reasonable monies it has expended.  For the reasons set
out above, however, I do not believe that it is appropriate to
apply fiduciary principles to this case.  As such, there is no
basis in law for the remedy sought by Alpha.
[80] In the alternative, Alpha seeks a monetary quantification of
the 2 x 12% award granted at trial. This request was made to the
trial judge and was refused by her largely on the basis that
there was no evidence on which she could confidently quantify the
damages with any degree of certainty (at pp. 129-130).  This
court is certainly in no better position to do so than was
Feldman J.  Alpha submits that further litigation will be
required to determine the monetary value of the award below if
quantification is not made. That may well be the case, but this
court is not the proper forum to determine a quantification of
this award. The cross-appeal is therefore dismissed.</pre>
    <pre><strong>F.   MOTION BY 1235866 ONTARIO INC.</strong></pre>
    <pre>[81] As indicated earlier, 1235866 Ontario Inc. is a successor to
Curragh in so far as it has acquired from the receiver of Curragh
all of Curragh&#146;s residual assets. After the trial and after the
judgment, 1235866 Ontario Inc. notified TVX that it was claiming
the 12% undivided carried interest and the 12% undivided
participating interest in Kassandra awarded to Alpha in this
action. 1235866 Ontario Inc. also commenced an action against
Alpha, TVX and others.
[82] Subsequently, on July 28, 1999, TVX and 1235866 Ontario Inc.
settled the action as between them and entered into an agreement.
TVX issued a press release announcing that, if TVX succeeded in
its appeal against Alpha, it was nevertheless agreeing to
recognize the award made in this action in the hands of 1235866.
The press release read in part as follows:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>  On July 28, 1999 TVX entered into an agreement
  with 1235866 that will ensure that these new
  claims will not result in any additional
  diminution of TVX&#146;s interest in the Kassandra
  Mines.   1235866 has agreed not to pursue any
  claim against TVX for an interest in the
  Kassandra Mines beyond the interest which has
  been awarded to Alpha. In the event that TVX
  succeeds in its appeal of the October 1998
  decision, or 1235866 is successful in its claim
  against Alpha, 1235866 will be entitled to 12%
  carried interest as defined in the agreement
  and the right to acquire a 12% participating
  interest upon payment of 12% of the aggregate
  amounts expended by TVX and its subsidiaries in
  connection with the acquisition, exploration,
  development and operation of the Kassandra Mines
  up to the date of exercise.
</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[83] At the commencement of the hearing of the appeal, a motion
was brought by 1235866 Ontario Inc. for an order setting aside
the judgment in this matter on the basis that Curragh was a
necessary party for the proper adjudication of the issues in this
action.  1235866 Ontario Inc. relies on Rules 5.03(1), (4) and
5.04(2) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. These rules read as
follows:</pre>
    <pre>          5.03(1) Every person whose presence is
	  necessary to enable the court to adjudicate
	  effectively and completely on the issues
          in a proceeding shall be joined as a party
	  to the proceeding.

          &#133;
          
          5.03(4) The court may order that any
          person who ought to have been joined as a
          party or whose presence as a party is
          necessary to enable the court to adjudicate
          effectively and completely on the issues in
          the proceeding shall be added as a party.</pre>
    <pre>          &#133;</pre>
    <pre>          5.04(2) At any stage of a proceeding the
          court may by order add, delete or substitute
          a party or correct the name of a party
          incorrectly named, on such terms as are just,
          unless prejudice would result that could not
          be compensated for by costs or an
          adjournment.</pre>
    <pre>[84] Rule 5.04(1) is also relevant to this motion. It provides
that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>  5.04(1) No proceeding shall be defeated by reason
  of the misjoinder or non-joinder of any party and
  the court may, in a proceeding, determine the
  issues in dispute in so far as they affect the
  rights of the parties to the proceeding and
  pronounce judgment without prejudice to the rights
  of all persons who are not parties.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[85] The only significance of the evidence presented in support
of 1235866 Ontario Inc.&#146;s motion relates to the ownership of the
confidential information as between Curragh, now represented by
1235866 Ontario Inc., and Alpha. That issue can be fully
litigated in the new action. No purpose would be served in
setting aside the judgment in this action and ordering a new
trial. A new trial of this action would undoubtedly be joined
with the trial of the new action. Given TVX&#146;s settlement with
1235866 Ontario Inc. in the new action for the same 2 x 12%
interest in Kassandra that was awarded in this action, the only
remaining lis in the joint trial would be as between 1235866
Ontario Inc. and Alpha. I would therefore dismiss the motion.</pre>
    <pre><strong>F.   DISPOSITION</strong></pre>
    <pre>[86] For these reasons, I would dismiss TVX&#146;s motion to introduce
fresh evidence and its appeal with costs to Alpha. I would
dismiss Alpha&#146;s cross-appeal with costs to TVX. Finally, I would
dismiss the motion brought by 1235866 Ontario Inc. with costs to
Alpha.
