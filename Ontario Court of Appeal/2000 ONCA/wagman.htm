    <pre><strong>On appeal from the ruling of Mr. Justice Reilly on a motion heard

</strong>[1]   The appellant is charged with second degree murder.   After
the  preliminary inquiry that is the subject of this appeal,  the
appellant was committed for trial.  She then sought habeas corpus
with  certiorari in aid on the basis that there had been a denial
of  natural justice.  Her application was dismissed by Reilly  J.
(the  motions  judge).   The appellant was unrepresented  at  the
preliminary  inquiry but she was represented before  the  motions
judge.   Counsel  has been appointed  by this  court,  as  amicus
curiae, to assist in presenting argument on this appeal.
[2]  Four grounds of appeal are advanced on behalf of the
appellant: (1) the preliminary inquiry judge prevented her from
cross-examining witnesses; (2) the preliminary inquiry improperly
continued after she absented herself from the proceedings;
(3) the court ought to have done more to assist the appellant,
given that she was unrepresented; and (4) the court lost
jurisdiction when the preliminary inquiry judge failed to conduct
a fitness hearing during the preliminary inquiry.
[3]  The motions judge found that the conduct of the preliminary
inquiry judge had been &quot;discourteous and arguably unjudicial on
occasion&quot;.  However, he concluded that there was no denial of
natural justice and no loss of jurisdiction.
[4]  The motions judge noted that most of the questions that the
appellant was not permitted to ask were irrelevant.  While other
questions may have had some relevance, they involved matters of
such slight significance that the interference with cross-
examination did not amount to a denial of natural justice.
[5]  The preliminary inquiry judge found that the appellant
absented herself for the purpose of avoiding or frustrating the
process of the court.  The motions judge concluded that the
preliminary hearing judge did not lose jurisdiction when he
proceeded in her absence for a brief period of time.  We note
that the witnesses heard in her absence were later recalled, that
the appellant was provided with a transcript of their evidence
and permitted to cross-examine the witnesses.
[6]  The appellant twice discharged counsel before the
preliminary inquiry. The motions judge noted that the appellant
again discharged counsel during the preliminary hearing.
However, she was assigned counsel (by Legal Aid) to assist her
during the preliminary inquiry.  Although she was unrepresented,
she had counsel to assist her and was given the opportunity to
consult with them.
[7]  The appellant was found fit to stand trial at a fitness
hearing held prior to the preliminary inquiry.  At the instance
of the Crown and over the objections of the appellant, a fitness
hearing was held following the preliminary inquiry.  It was held
that there were no reasonable grounds to try this issue at that
time.  The preliminary hearing judge also considered the issue of
fitness but concluded that there were no reasonable grounds to
find that the appellant was not fit to stand trial.  The making
of this ruling was within his jurisdiction. This court was asked
to order a fitness hearing under s. 672.23(1) of the Criminal
Code.  Nothing is to be gained by this request.  This matter can
be raised at any time before or during trial. This issue was not
raised before the applications judge.
[8]  In our view, the applications judge did not err in the
exercise of his discretion in concluding that there had been no
denial of natural justice and no loss of jurisdiction by the
preliminary inquiry judge.
[9]  Finally, we note that the amicus curiae acknowledges that
sufficient evidence was adduced at the preliminary inquiry to
justify the appellant's committal on the offence as charged.  We
see no purpose in granting the request to remit this matter for
further cross-examination or inquiry into the fitness of the
appellant.
[10] The appeal is dismissed.
