<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>E N D O R S E M E N T</h2>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant was convicted of abduction contrary to
s.&nbsp;281 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>
following which he was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to an
indeterminate period of incarceration. He appeals against the conviction, the
finding of dangerous offender  and the
sentence. </p>

<h3><i>Appeal against conviction</i></h3>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appeal against conviction raises two grounds. The first
ground relates to the necessary <i>mens rea</i>
for the offence of abduction and the second to the <i>actus reus</i>.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding
that he had the requisite intent under s.&nbsp;281. He submits that the trial
judge applied the wrong test and that the evidence did not support his finding
on the question of intent. We do not agree. It is clear from his reasons that
the trial judge instructed himself in accordance with the correct principles of
law as set out in <i>R. v. Chartrand </i>(1994),
31 C.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.). Further, there was ample evidence upon which the
trial judge could conclude that the appellant enticed the young girl with the
intent to deprive her mother of the possession of her child within the meaning
of s.&nbsp;281.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the <i>actus
reus </i>of the offence, the appellant argues that the full offence was not
made out because the appellant had not yet succeeded in bringing the child to a
location where he would have had control over the possession of the child. He
therefore submits that he could only be found guilty of an attempt to commit
the offence of abduction. We see no merit to this argument. Once the appellant
enticed the child away from the possession of her mother, the offence was
complete. </p>

<h3><i>Appeal against the finding of
dangerous offender</i></h3>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in dismissing
his application for a stay of the dangerous offender proceedings on the ground
that they constituted an abuse of process. We see no merit to this ground of
appeal. The trial judge was correct in dismissing the appellant’s application
for a stay for the reasons that he gave. We would not give effect to this
ground of appeal.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><i>The sentence appeal</i></h3>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With respect to the sentence appeal, we do not think that the
trial judge erred in his determination that the appellant is a dangerous
offender.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellant submits that the evidence did not support the
trial judge’s finding that the offence in this case was a “serious personal
injury offence” within the meaning of s.&nbsp;752(a)(ii) because, from an
objective standpoint, the conduct in question was not “likely to inflict severe
psychological damage upon another person”. We do not agree.  The trial judge reviewed the evidence
extensively and concluded that the predicate offence involved “conduct likely
to and which in fact did cause severe psychological damage” to the parents of
the child. In our view, the record amply supports this finding.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the sheer volume of actual and attempted sexual
incidents with young girls over a long period of years coupled with the strong
medical evidence that it is doubtful that the appellant could be treated
effectively so as to remove the risk to other young girls amply supported the
trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant came within the statutory
definition of dangerous offender.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Nor can we find fault with the trial judge’s decision to
impose an indeterminate, as opposed to a determinate, sentence on the
appellant.  On the record before him,
there was almost nothing to support a conclusion that the appellant would not
pose a serious danger to young girls if released into the community at a fixed
date.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, because the record so amply demonstrated that the
appellant would continue to pose a serious risk to the community if released at
a fixed date, we do not agree with the appellant’s alternative submission to
the effect that this court should apply the new long-term offender regime to
the appellant at this juncture.  This
regime came into effect after the sentencing in this case. Even if this court
has the jurisdiction to consider the retroactive application of this
alternative disposition (a matter on which we do not express an opinion), we
are not persuaded that this would be an appropriate case in which to make such
a disposition.  The safety of the
community supports today, as it did when the trial judge considered the matter,
the designation of the appellant as a dangerous offender and the continuation
of his indeterminate sentence.  It
should be recalled that an indeterminate sentence is not a perpetual
sentence.  If the appellant receives
proper treatment, a supervised release in the future is a possibility.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted and the
appeal from sentence is dismissed.</p>
