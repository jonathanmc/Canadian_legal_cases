    <pre>RE:            HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. ERNEST JOHN
               WARD (Appellant)</pre>

    <pre>COUNSEL:       Paula Beard
               for the appellant</pre>
    <pre>               Jamie Klukach
               for the respondent</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         February 3, 2000</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Hogg J. on July 16, 1999</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT</pre>
    <pre>[1]  While it would have been preferable had the trial judge
given more extensive reasons for imposing the sentence of one
year, we are not persuaded that the sentence was unfit.
[2]  The appellant has a horrendous criminal record dating back
to 1972. Notably, it includes numerous offences involving
violence.  The appellant suffers from a long-standing alcohol
problem and untreated, he poses a continuing threat to society.
The instant offences were serious and committed while the
appellant was on probation for a prior offence involving violence
towards the same victim, his ex-spouse.
[3]  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted but the
appeal is dismissed.</pre></td>
