COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</pre>
    <pre>RE:            KRISTINA WARZECHA and 571108 SASKATCHEWAN LTD.
               (Respondents) and GRAFTON OLVERE PHILLIPS and
               MARIA LORETTA MILLINGTON (Appellants)</pre>
    <pre>BEFORE:        FINLAYSON, MOLDAVER AND GOUDGE JJ.A.</pre>
    <pre>COUNSEL:       Mohammed Muslin
               For the appellant Phillips</pre>
    <pre>               Nirmala Persaud

               For the respondents</pre>
    <pre>HEARD:         January 28, 2000
</pre>
    <pre>On appeal from the order of Sharpe J. dated September 1, 1998.
</pre>
    <pre>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</pre>
    <pre>[1]  We see no basis for interfering with the order of Sharpe J.
[2]  His determination that in all the circumstances Ms.
Millington had not moved promptly enough to set aside the default
judgment is, in our view, reasonable.
[3]  Equally, his finding of fact that Mr. Phillips received
notice both of the sale and the proceedings before Mr. Justice
Cullity is supportable on this record.
[4]  Finally, we agree with his interpretation of the
Conveyancing and Law of Property Act. The judgment creditor is,
in these circumstances, not the seller.
[5]  The appeal must therefore be dismissed with costs.</pre>
