    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Madam Justice Wilson dated June 15, 1999.
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>ABELLA J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  In Ontario, except in cases of libel and slander, a person
wronged by someone who subsequently dies, can bring an action
against the deceased person&#146;s executor or administrator.  The
action, however, must be brought no later than two years from the
death of the alleged wrongdoer.  The issue in this appeal is
whether that two-year limitation can be extended if the injured
person did not discover that there was a basis for an action
until after the two years had elapsed.
[2]  At common law, no action in negligence could be brought on
behalf of or against someone who had died.  This prohibition was
lifted in most jurisdictions by statute.  In Ontario, the
legislative entitlement to maintain an action in tort by or
against the estate of a deceased person is found in s. 38 of the
Trustee Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. T. 23, which states:
                </pre>
    <pre>                RIGHTS AND LIABILITIES OF PERSONAL
                REPRESENTATIVES
                </pre>
    <pre>                38(1)   Except in cases of libel and slander,
Actions by      the executor or administrator of any deceased
executors and   person may maintain an action for all torts or
administrators  injuries to the person or to the property of the
for torts       deceased in the same manner and with the same
                rights and remedies as the deceased would, if
                living, have been entitled to do, and the
                damages when recovered shall form part of the
                personal estate of the deceased but if death
                results from such injuries no damages shall be
                allowed for the death or for the loss of the
                expectation of life, but this proviso is not in
                derogation of any rights conferred by Part V of
                the Family Law Act.
Actions         
against         (2)Except in cases of libel and slander, if a
executors and   deceased person committed or is by law liable
administrators  for a wrong to another in respect of his or her
for torts       person or to another person&#146;s property, the
                person wronged may maintain an action against
                the executor or administrator of the person who
                committed or is by law liable for the wrong.

                (3)An action under this section shall not be
                brought after the expiration of two years from
                the death of the deceased.  R.S.O. 1980, c. 512,
                s. 38(7).</pre>
    <pre>[3]  In recent years, courts have followed the lead of the
Supreme Court of Canada in Kamloops v. Nielson, [1984] 2 S.C.R.
2, by relieving injured persons from the strict application of
limitation periods in cases where they did not know that a cause
of action existed until after the expiration of the limitation
period.  In such cases, the limitation period was deemed to start
running only after the plaintiff could be said reasonably to have
known that the factual underpinning of a claim had crystallized.
This was known as the discoverability rule.
[4]  Until the later decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in
Peixeiro v. Haberman, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549, it was not clear
whether the discoverability rule applied to all limitation
provisions, or whether its application depended on the actual
wording of the statutory limitation.  (See, for example, Corkhill
v. Public Trustee (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 30 (Gen. Div.))
[5]  At issue in Peixeiro was whether the limitation period in s.
206(1) of the Highway Traffic Act, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8 was
subject to the discoverability rule.  This section states that:
          </pre>
    <pre>          &#133; no proceeding shall be brought against a
	  person for the recovery of damages occasioned
	  by a motor vehicle after the expiration of two
          years from the time when the damages were
          sustained. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[6]  Major J. concluded that based on the language of this
particular provision, the discoverability rule applied, but,
citing Fehr v. Jacob (1993), 14 C.C.L.T. (2d) 200 at 206 (Man.
C.A.), he adopted the following boundary line beyond which the
discoverability rule could not extend:
          </pre>
    <pre>          [T]he judge-made discoverability rule is nothing
   	  more than a rule of construction.  Whenever a
	  statute requires an action to be commenced within
	  a specified time from the happening of a
          specific event, the statutory language must be
	  construed.  When time runs from &#147;the accrual of
	  the cause of action&#148; or from some other event
	  which can be construed as occurring only when the
          injured party has knowledge of the injury sustained,
	  the judge-made discoverability rule applies.  But,
	  when time runs from an event which clearly occurs
	  without regard to the injured party&#146;s knowledge,
	  the judge-made discoverability rule may not extend the
          period the legislature has prescribed. [Emphasis added.]</pre>
    <pre>[7]  The primary interpretative conclusion of Major J.&#146;s analysis
is that the application of the discoverability rule depends on
the wording of the limitation provision.  The ancillary
conclusion is that the discoverability rule does not apply when,
based on that wording, the limiting time runs from a fixed event
unrelated to the injured party&#146;s knowledge or the basis of the
cause of action (see Grenier v. Canadian General Insurance Co.
(1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 715 (Ont. C.A.), per Morden A.C.J.O.).
[8]  In s. 38(3) of the Trustee Act, the limitation period runs
from a death.  Unlike cases where the wording of the limitation
period permits the time to run, for example, from &#147;when the
damage was sustained&#148; (Peixeiro) or when the cause of action
arose (Kamloops), there is no temporal elasticity possible when
the pivotal event is the date of a death.  Regardless of when the
injuries occurred or matured into an actionable wrong, s. 38(3)
of the Trustee Act prevents their transformation into a legal
claim unless that claim is brought within two years of the death
of the wrongdoer or the person wronged.
[9]  The underlying policy considerations of this clear time
limit are not difficult to understand.  The draconian legal
impact of the common law was that death terminated any possible
redress for negligent conduct.  On the other hand, there was a
benefit to disposing of estate matters with finality.  The
legislative compromise in s. 38 of the Trustee Act was to open a
two-year window, making access to a remedy available for a
limited time without crating indefinite fiscal vulnerability for
an estate.
[10] In the case before us, a motion was brought under Rule
21.01(1)(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure for a determination
before trial of a potentially determinative question of law.  The
question before the motions judge was whether the plaintiff&#146;s
claim was subject to the limitation period created by s. 38(3) of
the Trustee Act and, if the limitation period applied, whether
this period was subject to the discoverability principle.
[11] The plaintiff&#146;s negligence action arose out of a motor
vehicle accident which occurred on November 20, 1993.  Rosalie
Hopkinson, whose estate is the defendant in this action, died in
the accident.
[12] The plaintiff, Coralie Waschkowski, commended an action
almost 5 years after the accident, on September 23, 1998.  The
plaintiff&#146;s position is that she did not know until September 24,
1996 that the accident resulted in injuries sufficiently serious
to meet the threshold in s. 266(1) of the Insurance Act, R.S.O.
1990, c. I. 8.  This section states:
          </pre>
    <pre>          266.(1)  In respect of loss or damage arising
	  directly or indirectly from the use or operation,
	  after the 21st day of June, 1990, of an automobile
	  and despite any other Act, none of the owner of an
	  automobile, the occupant of an automobile or any
          person present at the incident are liable in an 
	  action in Ontario for loss or damage from bodily
          injury arising from such use or operation in
	  Canada, the United States of America or any other
          jurisdiction designated in the No-Fault Benefits
  	  Schedule involving the automobile unless, as a
	  result of such use or operation, the injured person
          has died or has sustained,
          </pre>
    <pre>          (a)  permanent serious disfigurement; or
          </pre>
    <pre>          (b)  permanent serious impairment of an important
          bodily function caused by continuing injury which
	  is physical in nature.</pre>
    <pre>[13] The parties acknowledged that based on Peixeiro, the two-
year limitation period in s. 206(1) of the Highway Traffic Act is
subject to the discoverability rule.  Since Ms. Waschkowski
brought her claim within two years of discovering that her
injuries met the threshold in s. 266(1) of the Insurance Act,
there was agreement that the plaintiff&#146;s claim is not defeated by
the two-year limitation period in s. 206(1) of the Highway
Traffic Act.
[14] The issue before the motions judge was whether the principle
of discoverability also applied to save the plaintiff&#146;s claim
from the two-year limitation period set out in s. 38(3) of the
Trustee Act.
[15] The motions judge held that although the plaintiff&#146;s claim
was subject to the limitation period created by s. 38(3) of the
Trustee Act, that limitation period was subject to the
discoverability rule.  The estate of Rosalie Hopkinson appealed
from the determination that the discoverability rule applied to
s. 38(3) of the Trustee Act.  The plaintiff, Ms. Waschkowski
cross-appealed the order of costs made against her because of her
delay in &#147;initiating proceedings.&#148;
[16] As indicated earlier in these reasons, based on the language
of the limitation provision, the discoverability principle does
not apply to s. 38(3) of the Trustee Act.  The effect of s. 38(3)
is, in my view, that the state of actual or attributed knowledge
of an injured person in a tort claim is not germane when a death
has occurred.  The only applicable limitation period is the two-
year period found in s. 38(3) of the Trustee Act.
[17] The appeal is allowed with costs throughout.  In the
circumstances, leave to cross-appeal is granted but the cross-
appeal is dismissed.
