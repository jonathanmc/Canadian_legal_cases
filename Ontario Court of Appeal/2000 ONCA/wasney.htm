    <pre><strong>HEARD:         April 27, 2000
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the order of Mr. Justice Langdon dated September
2, 1999
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
                                
</strong>[1]   The  issue  in  this  case  is  the  appropriate  date  for
termination of child support.
[2]  The material is less than satisfactory.  However, there is
no dispute that the child was a dependent until she completed
secondary school in June 1995.  There is no evidence that
thereafter the child planned to continue her schooling.  We do
know that she earned $12,163 in 1996 and $11,345 in 1997.
[3]  In these circumstances, the reasonable inference is that she
was no longer dependent as of the end of December 1995 and the
arrears of principal are fixed at $25,759.  Using the same ratio
between principal and interest as was used by the motions judge,
we calculate an appropriate amount of interest owing to be
$20,000.  The total arrears are therefore fixed at $45,759.
[4]  Paragraph 1 of the judgment below is varied accordingly.  In
all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.
[5]  We make no order as to costs of the appeal.</pre>
