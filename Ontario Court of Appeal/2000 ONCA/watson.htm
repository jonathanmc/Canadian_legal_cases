    <pre><strong>On appeal from a judgment of Low J. dated December 16, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>MORDEN J.A. (orally)
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]  The defendants, respondents in this appeal, move for an
order quashing the appeal.  The following is an outline of the
circumstances.
[2]   In the action the plaintiff sought over $200,000 in
damages.  The trial judge dismissed the action but in her reasons
she assessed the plaintiff&#146;s damages at $3,124.30.  She ordered
that the costs be payable to the defendants on a solicitor and
client basis and then fixed these costs at $84,000.
[3]   By reason of the $3,124.30 assessment and s. 19 (1) (a)
(iv) of the Courts of Justice Act, it is clear that the appeal
from the judgment dismissing the action lies to the Divisional
Court.  This is the main appeal in this proceeding.  The costs
order is appended to the judgment dismissing the action and the
appeal from it should, therefore, also be taken to the Divisional
Court.
[4]    From the foregoing, it can be seen that we do not accept
the appellant&#146;s submission that this court has jurisdiction to
hear the appeals under s. 6 (2) of the Courts of Justice Act by
reason of the appeal from the dismissal of the action &#147;piggy-
backing&#148; onto the appeal from the costs order which is for a
payment exceeding $25,000.
[5]  It is clear that the costs appeal, which is a contingent
appeal that requires leave should the main appeal be dismissed
(Murano v. Bank of Montreal (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 222 (C.A.) at
pp. 241-243), must follow the main appeal.  This must be so even
though the costs appeal, by virtue of the fixing of costs, is
from an order for payment of more than $25,000.  This is
recognized in rule 61.03.1 (17) which sets forth the procedure to
govern a case in which it is sought to join a costs appeal, which
requires leave to appeal, with an appeal as of right.
[6]  The appeals are transferred to the Divisional Court under s.
110 of the Courts of Justice Act.  Costs of this motion are
awarded to the responding parties in the amount of $2,000 payable
forthwith.
