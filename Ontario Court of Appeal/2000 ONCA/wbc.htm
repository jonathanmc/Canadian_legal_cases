    <pre><strong>On appeal from his conviction by Noble J. on December 5, 1997.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>WEILER J.A.:</strong></pre>
    <pre>I.   Overview and Issues</pre>
    <pre>[1]  The appellant, aged sixty, was convicted in December 1997 of
one count of sexual assault against his niece&#146;s daughter.  She
was ten years old at the time of the alleged offence.  In
convicting the appellant, the trial judge relied on an admission
of guilt made by the appellant in 1991 on a charge of sexual
assault and evidence that indicated the circumstances of
commission of the prior assault were strikingly similar to the
assault alleged in this case.  The method by which the evidence
of similar facts or prior discreditable conduct was placed before
the court gives rise to the first major issue on this appeal.
[2]  During the appellant&#146;s trial, the Crown tendered the
original 1991 indictment.  It contained the prior charge of
sexual assault of one K.B.  On the back of the indictment, the
appellant&#146;s plea of guilty and sentence were recorded.  No
objection was taken to the admissibility of this document.  The
evidence of the prior conviction could only be used by the trial
judge to assist him in assessing the appellant&#146;s credibility.
However, if evidence of the circumstances surrounding the
commission of the prior assault was properly admitted, that
evidence amounted to similar fact evidence and was available as
circumstantial evidence of guilt. The Crown tendered two
documents that, if admitted, contained this evidence.
[3]  The first document was a transcript of the circumstances
surrounding the commission of the offence that were read into the
record in support of the appellant&#146;s 1991 plea of guilty which,
it was submitted, he had accepted as true.  The court reporter
had not signed the transcript.  However, defence counsel told the
trial judge that it was unnecessary for the Crown to call the
reporter to give evidence as to the authenticity of the
transcript (the &#147;1991 transcript&#148;).  Given this concession, the
question was whether the transcript could be admitted under s.23
of the Canada Evidence Act (CEA) which provides for the admission
of prior judicial proceedings.  Defence counsel opposed the
admission of the transcript pursuant to s.23 on the basis that,
among other things, the requisite seven days notice had not been
given as required by s.28 of that Act.  The trial judge appears
to have accepted the submission of the defence.  The trial judge
then considered whether the transcript could be admitted pursuant
to s.715 of the Criminal Code.  That section provides for the
admissibility at trial of the transcript of the evidence given at
a previous trial where the witness refuses to be sworn, is dead,
insane, unable due to illness to attend or is absent from Canada.
The trial judge properly concluded that the transcript could not
be admitted under this section.
[4]   The Crown also tendered a statement given by K.B. to the
investigating officer after the sexual assault took place
(&#147;K.B.&#146;s statement&#148;).  K.B. had signed and initialled the
statement on each page.  Defence counsel conceded at trial that
the content of both the transcript and K.B.&#146;s statement were, in
substance, the same.  The defence submitted that the Crown had
not established that K.B.&#146;s statement should be admitted as an
exception to the hearsay rule pursuant to R. v. Khan (1990), 59
C.C.C. (3d) 92 (S.C.C.).  Pursuant to this decision, out-of-court
statements not made in the presence of an accused person can be
admitted if the requirements of necessity and reliability are
met.  The position of the defence was that the requirement of
necessity had not been met because the Crown had not shown that
K.B. was unavailable to give viva voce evidence.  After hearing
submissions, the trial judge ruled that the officer could read
K.B.&#146;s statement into the record at the appellant&#146;s trial as
evidence for the truth of its contents.  In view of his ruling
admitting K.B.&#146;s statement as part of the officer&#146;s testimony,
the trial judge excluded the 1991 transcript on the basis that it
had become unnecessary.
[5]  On this appeal, the Crown conceded that the requirement of
necessity had not been established.  This concession was based on
the fact that, during the voir dire, the Crown did not ask the
investigating officer any questions about why K.B. could not
testify in person.   The court&#146;s examination of the transcript
subsequent to this appeal indicates that the issue of K.B.&#146;s
unavailability was raised by the defence in cross-examination.
The investigating officer testified that he did not know where
K.B. was.  He also did not know what efforts had been made to
contact her.  The trial judge commented during the defence
submissions that the reason why K.B. was not present to testify
had been cleared up in cross-examination.  He also commented that
the police officer does not work in a vacuum.  The defence
continued with its submissions.  Eventually, the trial judge
ruled that K.B.&#146;s statement was admissible for the truth of its
contents and that, in view of this, it had become unnecessary to
admit the 1991 transcript containing the appellant&#146;s admission of
the underlying facts to his plea of guilty.  In view of the
Crown&#146;s concession, which was accepted when the appeal was heard,
I do not propose to comment further on the admissibility of
K.B.&#146;s statement and will deal only with the question of whether
the 1991 transcript was wrongly excluded.  For the reasons that
follow, I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred in
excluding the 1991 transcript.
[6]  The second major issue on this appeal is whether the
curative proviso can be applied when the trial judge, faced with
two options as to how to receive evidence of the circumstances
surrounding the prior sexual assault to which the appellant plead
guilty, chose the wrong one.
[7]  Before turning to the two major issues raised on this
appeal, there are two other issues which can be readily disposed
of.</pre>
    <pre>     The submission that the verdict is unsafe</pre>
    <pre>[8]  The appellant submits that the trial judge failed to
adequately scrutinize the complainant's evidence and that the
verdict is unsafe.
[9]  This ground of appeal is readily dismissed.  In his reasons
for judgment, the trial judge carefully reviewed the evidence.
He acknowledged the contradictions in the complainant&#146;s evidence
at trial, her evidence at the preliminary inquiry, and her
videotaped statement.  The inconsistencies regarding the number
of times the sexual assaults occurred over the period alleged and
whether anal or vaginal interference had taken place, for
example, were resolved to the satisfaction of the trial judge.
He was alive to the discrepancies and characterized them as
&#147;incidental and collateral to the heart of the evidence offered
in support of the charges before the court.&#148;  When the trial
judge&#146;s reasons are considered as a whole, it is my view that the
trial judge, in saying this, did not unduly minimize the
importance of the contradictions in the complainant&#146;s evidence.
The trial judge&#146;s decision is one that a properly-instructed
jury, acting judicially, could reasonably have reached.</pre>
    <pre>     The motion for mistrial</pre>
    <pre>[10] The appellant also requests a new trial on the basis that
the trial judge erred in refusing to grant a defence motion for a
mistrial.
[11] Following the appellant&#146;s conviction on December 5, 1997,
the Crown provided a consultation report prepared by Dr. J.K.
Madden, dated September 3, 1996.  The Crown advised the court
that Dr. Madden&#146;s report had been received by the Crown on or
about December 24, 1997.  Dr. Madden&#146;s report indicated that the
complainant alleged that the incidents that occurred in March,
July and August were complaints of vaginal penetration, but made
no reference to a complaint of attempted or actual anal
penetration.  At trial, however, the complainant testified that
the appellant put his penis in her &#147;bum&#148; in March and August
1996.  The defence brought a motion for a mistrial or to allow
the defence to reopen its case.  The trial judge declined to do
either.
[12] The trial judge held that, even if the evidence of Dr.
Madden had been before him at trial, it would not have affected
the result.  Accordingly, he dismissed the application for the
mistrial.  The appellant concedes that, in ruling on the motion
for the mistrial, the trial judge applied the correct legal test,
but contends that he erred in his application of it.  Whether a
mistrial ought to be declared or a trial reopened requires the
exercise of discretion by the trial judge.  In addition to
considering the correct legal principles, the trial judge
exercised his discretion judicially.  I have not been persuaded
that the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion on
this point.
[13] I would dismiss these other grounds of appeal.  In the
result, I am of the opinion that no substantial wrong or
miscarriage of justice occurred and that this is one of those
cases in which it is appropriate to apply the curative proviso
pursuant to s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code.  Accordingly,
I would dismiss the appeal.</pre>
    <pre>II.  The Documentation in Issue</pre>
    <pre>[14] Before discussing the main issues on this appeal, it is
important to briefly outline the state of the documentation that
was before the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>1.   The original 1991 indictment</pre>
    <pre>[15] The trial judge admitted the original 1991 indictment to
establish that the appellant plead guilty to the previous sexual
assault conviction.  The indictment contained three counts
stating the charges against the accused.  Count 2 alleged a
sexual assault on or about February 17, 1990.  On the back of the
indictment, under the date March 7, 1991, the presiding judge
wrote:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Accused arraigned and pleads guilty as
          to Count no. 2.  Count no. 1 and Count no. 3
          are withdrawn by the Crown.  Conviction on
          Count no. 2.  Sentence adjourned to April 12/
          91 4:00 p.m.  P.S.R. requested.
          </pre>
    <pre>A further entry is contained under the heading April 12, 1991, as
follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>          Accused is sentenced to 12 months in custody.
          I recommend that he receive treatment at
          O.C.I. Brampton for child sexual abuse
          problem.  Plus Probation for three years.
          Terms: Keep the peace and be of good
          behavior; report to a probation officer as
          required; attend for any counseling as
          directed by the Probation Officer.
          </pre>
    <pre>Both entries were signed by the trial judge.</pre>
    <pre>[16] The trial judge ascertained that the defence had received a
copy of the original 1991 indictment, and referred to it as a
public record.  As I have indicated, defence counsel did not
object to the admission of the original indictment.</pre>
    <pre>2.   The 1991 transcript</pre>
    <pre>[17] The Crown attempted to introduce the transcript of the 1991
guilty plea proceedings to establish the factual circumstances
surrounding the conviction for sexual assault.  The transcript
reveals the following progression of the proceedings.  First, at
the request of the Crown, the appellant was arraigned only on
Count 2 of a three-count indictment.  Next, the clerk of the
court read Count 2 into the record as follows:

          W.B.C. stands charged: that he on or about
	  the 17th day of February 1990, at the Township
	  of Hawley, in the said Region, did commit a
	  sexual assault on [K.B.], contrary to the Criminal
	  Code of Canada.</pre>
    <pre>[18] The appellant was then asked by the clerk how he wished to
plead and he personally replied: &#147;Guilty.&#148;  The clerk confirmed
the appellant&#146;s plea and he was then asked if he was ready to
proceed; defence counsel replied that he was.  The Crown sought
and obtained an order under s.486(3) of the Criminal Code that
the complainant&#146;s identity not be revealed publicly.  Then the
Crown read the summary of the facts in support of the plea.
[19] Those facts, as set out in the transcript, are as follows:

                At about 8 p.m. that evening, the
	  complainant was in the accused&#146;s bedroom on
	  the accused&#146;s waterbed. The accused showed
          up and he began by kissing her on the mouth
	  and sticking his tongue in her mouth.  She
	  closed her mouth as tight as she could.
          He then took her hand and put it on his penis
	  over his underwear. She pulled her hand away.

               He then pulled down her underwear and
          stuck his finger in her vagina.  She said
          that he pushed really hard and it hurt. He
          then took his finger out. She said that he
          then took off his underwear and her panties,
          and they were both lying on the bed on their
          sides.  He then lifted up her top leg and put
          his penis in her vagina and pushed really
          hard. There was an indication, your honour,
          of partial penetration. Medical examination
          later indicated that the hymen was intact.
          He then pulled his penis out, pulled up his
          underwear and pulled up her panties.  He then
          put her hand on his penis over his underwear,
          she pulled her hand away.  She indicated Your
          Honour, that the accused who she refers to as
          uncle W. then pulled down his underwear again
          and put her hand on his penis and made her
          squeeze on top.  That was the end of the
          incident.

               The police became involved about three
          days after the incident.  An examination was
          conducted at the emergency department of the
          hospital.  No semen was detected on vaginal
          swabs from the complainant, but semen was
          identified on a bed sheet on the bed.</pre>
    <pre>[20] After these facts were read-in by the Crown, the court asked
defence counsel: &#147;Are there any comments with regard to the
facts?&#148;  Defence counsel replied as follows:
          
          In relationship to the facts, I simply point
	  out to you that we examined the forensic evidence
	  for grouping stain types, as well as the medical
	  report, Dr. Thorsteinson.  I ask you to note
          &#151; that her hymen was intact.  The vaginal swabs
	  did not reveal presence of semen in the vagina.
	  And that the staining referred to was diagnosed
	  as relating to Mr. C., was that on the underwear
          that the young lady was wearing.  There is no
	  grouping in relationship to the stain on the bed&#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>          The Court: All right.</pre>
    <pre>[21] The following is typed on the next page of the transcript:
          
          I HEREBY CERTIFY that the foregoing is a true and
	  correct transcription of the evidence recorded by
	  me, to the best of my skill ability.</pre>

[22] The transcript did not bear the signature of the court
reporter above the certification line.</pre>
    <pre>3.   The officer&#146;s testimony regarding K.B.&#146;s statement</pre>
    <pre>[23] The officer who investigated the sexual assault against K.B.
testified at the appellant&#146;s trial with respect to the 1991
conviction.  On the voir dire into whether the officer&#146;s evidence
should be admitted, the officer read-in the following statement
from K.B. as part of his testimony:

          On Saturday night, the 17th of February, 1990,
	  at about 8:00 p.m., I was in Markstay at my
	  Uncle W.C.'s house.  I was in his bedroom on
	  his waterbed.  Uncle W. &#133; lifted the blankets
	  up and I got under them with him.  Then Uncle
	  W. tried to French kiss me by sticking his
	  tongue in my mouth, but I closed my mouth as
          tight as I could.  Then he took my hand and
	  put it on his penis over his underwear and
	  I pulled my hand away.  Then Uncle W. pulled
	  down my panties and stuck his finger in my
	  vagina and pushed really hard and it hurt.
	  Then he took his finger out. Then he took off
	  his underwear and my panties and we were both
          lying on our sides.  Then he lifted up my top
	  leg&#133; and he put his penis in my vagina and he
	  pushed really hard.  Then he pulled his
          penis out, he pulled up his underwear, and
	  pulled up my panties, and then he put my hand
	  on his penis over his underwear and I pulled
	  my hand away.
         
          Uncle W. then pulled down his underwear
          and he put my hand on his penis and he made
          me squeeze it on the top.  Then he took my
          hand off and told me he had to go to the
          washroom.  I went into the washroom after he
          finished and I then went into the livingroom
          and told my mom I was laying down with Uncle
          W. to keep him company and my mom said,
          &#145;That&#146;s okay to keep him company.&#146;  Then I
          went back into the bedroom and lay down on
          top of the blankets on my mom&#146;s side of the
          bed.  Then Uncle W. told me to hug him, so I
          hugged him, then I rested.  I looked at the
          time and it was 8:50 p.m.  Then I got up,
          went into the livingroom to give my mom a hug
          and kiss and then I went to bed in S.A.&#146;s
          room.
          
[24] In his ruling on the voir dire, the trial judge admitted
this statement as evidence of prior discreditable conduct on the
trial proper.</pre>
    <pre>III.  Discussion</pre>
    <pre>A.  Did the trial judge err in not admitting the 1991 transcript?</pre>
    <pre>Admissibility of the 1991 transcript under the Canada Evidence
Act, s.23</pre>
    <pre>[25] The trial judge considered whether the 1991 transcript was
admissible under s.23 of the Canada Evidence Act, R.S.C. 1985,
c.C-5, as amended by S.C. 1997, c.18, s.117 (the CEA).  The
relevant portion of s. 23(1) reads:

          Evidence of any proceeding or record whatever
	  of, in or before&#133; any court in any province&#133; may
	  be given in any action or proceeding by an
	  exemplification or certified copy of the
          proceeding or record, purporting to be&#133; under
	  the hand or seal of the&#133; court stenographer,
	  as the case may be, without any proof or
          the authenticity of the seal or of the signature
	  of the&#133; court stenographer or other proof whatever.</pre>
    <pre>[26] When the Crown tendered the 1991 transcript at the 1997
proceedings, the trial judge observed:

          &#133; If it was a certified copy of the transcript,
	  I&#146;d accept it.  Now frankly all we&#146;re saying
	  here is that the reporter has sent a copy, put
	  the certificate on, typed her name at the
          bottom, and hasn&#146;t signed it.  Now if we need
	  to get her to sign it and send another one,
	  we&#146;ll do that, but do you really think that&#146;s
	  necessary?</pre>
    <pre>Defence counsel replied:  &#147;No it&#146;s not necessary, Your Honour.&#148;</pre>
    <pre>Later the Court ruled:</pre>
    <pre>          &#133; [W]e&#146;ve already had our discussion about
	  the Canada Evidence Act and I am satisfied
	  that the Canada Evidence Act, because it&#146;s
	  not court certified, doesn&#146;t apply.  But the
	  other concern I would add would be that this
	  is a partial transcript, in my view, and without
	  having looked carefully at Section 24 &#151; or 23 &#151; I
	  wonder if that doesn&#146;t deal with the totality of the
          evidence of the proceeding and not a partial
	  transcript, because a transcript of part of the
	  proceedings may be misleading and so I have some
	  concerns about that.  I frankly don&#146;t think Section
          23 is going to help you.</pre>
    <pre>[27] Defence counsel stated that, even if s.23 applied, the Crown
had not given the defence seven days advance notice of its plans
to introduce the transcript, as required by s.28 of the CEA.
Section 28 reads:

          1) No copy of any book or other document shall
	  be admitted in evidence, under the authority of
	  section 23, 24, 25, 26 or 27, on any trial,
	  unless the party intending to produce the copy has
          before the trial given to the party against whom
	  it is intended to be produced reasonable notice
	  of that intention.</pre>
    <pre>          2) The reasonableness of the notice referred to in
          subsection (1) shall be determined by the court,
	  judge or other person presiding, but the notice
	  shall not in any case be less than seven days.</pre>
    <pre>[28] The Crown had given the defence a copy of the 1991
transcript the day before asking the trial judge to admit it.
The transcript was therefore inadmissible under s.23, and defence
counsel did not waive the notice requirement.</pre>
    <pre>Admissibility of the 1991 transcript at common law</pre>
    <pre>[29] Section 36 of the CEA provides that Part I, which includes
ss. 23 and 28, is in addition to, and not in derogation of, any
powers to prove documents &#147;existing at law&#148;.  This includes the
power to prove documents at common law: R. v. Tatomir (1989), 51
C.C.C. (3d) 321 at 327 (Alta C.A.), leave to appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada refused February 15, 1990.  Thus the CEA
is not an exclusive code with respect to proof of documents.
[30] Before us, the Crown maintained that the transcript was
admissible at common law on two bases.  The first is under the
Khan exception to the hearsay rule which requires that the
necessity and reliability of the proposed evidence be
established. The second is that the transcript is a public
document at common law.  I prefer to call the transcript a record
of a judicial proceeding.  The criteria for admissibility at
common law of a public document and a judicial proceeding are the
same and legal writers, such as Wigmore, make no distinction
between them.1  The principles of necessity and reliability also
underlie the public document or judicial proceeding exception.
As stated by Laskin J.A. in R. v. P.(A.) (1996), 109 C.C.C. (3d)
385 at 389-390:

          &#133; This exception is &#145;founded upon the belief
	  that public officers will perform their tasks
	  properly, carefully, and honestly.&#146;  Sopinka
	  et al, The Law of Evidence in Canada&#133;
          (Toronto: Butterworths, 1992), p. 231.  Public
	  documents are admissible without proof because
	  of their inherent reliability or trustworthiness
	  and because of the inconvenience of requiring
          public officials to be present in court to prove
	  them. (emphasis mine).</pre>
    <pre>[31] The inconvenience of requiring a public official to attend
in court to prove a public document or of requiring a court
reporter to prove a prior judicial proceeding makes it necessary
to admit the document or transcript. In addition the transcript
is the best source to answer the question of what was said in
court about the circumstances surrounding the commission of the
sexual assault on K.B.  Evidence of the same value from any other
source does not exist.  Even if the court reporter were
physically present in court to testify as to what transpired in
1991, her recollection would not be as good as the transcript.
Necessity of this nature falls into the second category of
evidence articulated by Wigmore at paragraph 1421 and approved by
Lamer J. in R. v. Smith (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 271:
          
          (2) The assertion may be such that we cannot
	  expect, again or at this time, to get evidence
	  of the same value from the same or other sources &#133;
	  The necessity is not so great; perhaps hardly a 
	  necessity, only an expediency or convenience, can be
          predicated.  But the principle is the same.  The
          requirement of necessity has been met.</pre>
    <pre>[32] In R. v. P. (A.), supra, at 390, Laskin J.A. articulated
four criteria for the admissibility of a public document or, in
this case, a judicial record.  These criteria which all relate to
the reliability of the record are:

         (i)   the document must have been made by a public
               official, that is a person on whom a duty has
               been imposed by the public;
         (ii)  the public official must have made the document
               in the discharge of a public duty or function;
         (iii) the document must have been made with the
               intention that it serve as a permanent record, and
         (iv)  the document must be available for public inspection.</pre>
    <pre>[33] The appellant has admitted that the transcript here in
question meets the first two criteria articulated above.
Nonetheless, I believe that some expansion of these criteria will
be helpful.  Like a public document, the admissibility of a
judicial proceeding is limited to the precise scope of the
recorder&#146;s duty.  Ewart, in Documentary Evidence in Canada,
Carswell, 1984, at 153 terms this a strict requirement.  He says:

          In all cases, it will be necessary to determine
	  the precise scope of the recorder&#146;s duty, since
	  that will delimit the admissibility of the contents
	  of the document he prepared.  For example, since
	  duty determines admissibility, baptismal records
          are admissible to prove the fact, date, and place
	  of the baptism, but any statements therein concerning
	  the age of the child will not be admissible.
	  Similarly death certificates are admissible to prove
	  the fact, time, and place, but not the cause, of the
          death.</pre>
    <pre>[34] The issue at this stage is: &#147;What was said about the
circumstances of the commission of the sexual assault on KB at
the time that the appellant pled guilty in 1991?&#148;  The court
reporter had a duty to transcribe what was said.  That is the
extent of the admissibility of the transcript.  The transcript
would not answer the question of whether what was said was true.
If, however, the transcript on its face indicated that the
appellant admitted the circumstances of the commission of the
sexual assault on K.B., that admission would be evidence of the
truth of the facts stated.  Those facts would then be available
for use as similar fact evidence.  It is most important that the
two concepts be kept separate.
[35] Regarding the third criterion, I am satisfied that the
transcript was made with the intention that it serve as a
permanent record.  The fact that the reporter was able to produce
the transcript more than five years after the guilty plea
proceedings gives it the necessary degree of permanency to serve
as a record of what happened in a public courtroom.
[36] There is some uncertainty as to whether the fourth
requirement must still be met. Laskin J.A. commented, at 390 in
R. v. P.(A.), supra, that the fourth part of the test is
controversial, and referred favourably to the following
observation in McCormack on Evidence, 4th ed. (1992), at 288-89:
          </pre>
    <pre>          This limitation has been criticized, and
          the American courts reasonably have not
          adopted it.  Although public inspection
          might provide a modest additional
          assurance of reliability, strictly
          limiting admissibility to records that
          are open to public inspection would be
          unwise because many documents with
          sufficient reliability to justify
          admission would be excluded.</pre>
    <pre>[37] Assuming that the fourth criterion is still an aspect of the
requirement of reliability, the transcript in this case was
available for public inspection once it was typed. Had the
appellant chosen to appeal his 1991 conviction, the entire
transcript, including the portion at issue, would have been filed
and made available for public inspection as part of the appeal
record.  The appellant submits that the fourth criterion was not
met because the transcript was not typed until Crown counsel
requested it for these proceedings.  This does not, in my view,
undermine its public quality.  Once access to the transcript was
sought, it was forthcoming.
[38] A further requirement at common law that relates to
reliability is the principle that the &#147;whole document&#148; must be
submitted to the court.  Wigmore says that this is a relative
term dependent on the matters in issue.  What must be produced is
the entire record affecting the subject matter of the litigation.
(See Wigmore on Evidence, volume 7 p.647 para. 2109 and 2110).
Here, the subject matter of the litigation is what was said in
court in 1991 with respect to the circumstances surrounding the
commission of the sexual assault on K.B.  The transcript is a
full and complete recording of those circumstances.  The
transcript does not contain the discussion pertaining to the date
to which the sentencing proceedings were adjourned nor the
sentencing proceedings.  These proceedings are not the subject
matter of the litigation nor do they affect it.  The whole of the
transcript affecting the subject matter of the litigation is
before the court.
[39] Another aspect of reliability is the need to establish the
authenticity of the document.  To be admissible at common law,
the judicial document in question must be either (1) the original
record; or (2) an exemplification of that record under the seal
of the court:  Tatomir, supra, at 327, citing Ewart, Documentary
Evidence in Canada (1984), at 183, and Archbold Pleading,
Evidence and Practice in Criminal Cases, 43rd ed. (1988), at
1055.  What is meant by &#147;the original record&#148;?  Wigmore states
that it has nothing to do with whether the writing in question
was the &#147;original&#148; or &#147;a copy&#148;.  Rather, what is meant is that
the written text itself must be offered as opposed to testimony
about it.  Wigmore concludes at vol. 4, pp. 547-9, para. 1232 of
his treatise on Evidence:

          Thus the terms &#147;copy&#148; and &#147;original&#148; being
	  purely relative to each other, have no inherent
	  relation to the present rule, and the term
	  &#147;original&#148; has no real significance in indicating
	  which paper it is (of all possible papers) whose
	  production is required by the rule.  In order to
	  state the rule, then, in terms which will
	  indicate in the rule itself what documents are
	  included in its scope, it must be noted that the
	  production required is the production of the
	  document whose contents are to be proved in the
	  state of the issues.  Whether or not that document
	  was written before or after another, was copied from
          another, or was itself used to copy from, is
          immaterial.  (Emphasis in original.)</pre>
    <pre>[40] The most common way of ensuring that the transcript is the
document or record of what was said in court is to have the court
reporter sign and certify the transcript.  In this case that was
not done.  The defence clearly waived the requirement that the
reporter sign the transcript in order for it to be admitted as an
original document, however, in response to a question by the
trial judge.
[41] The waiver by defence counsel of a common law requirement
relating to admissibility is a valid waiver.  In R. v. Park
(1981), 122 D.L.R. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), for example, the Court held
that an accused or her counsel may waive the requirement to hold
a voir dire to determine the voluntariness of a statement.
According to Dickson J. at 8:

          No particular words or formula need be uttered
	  by defence counsel to express the waiver and
	  admission.  All that is necessary is that the
	  trial Judge be satisfied that counsel understands
	  the matter and has made an informed decision&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[42] In R. v. Dietrich (1970), 1 C.C.C. (2d) 49 at 59 (Ont.
C.A.), Gale C.J.O. dealt with the problem of whether or not an
accused might waive a voir dire respecting the voluntary quality
of a statement and said:

          ... I endorse the concept that a trial should
          be capable of being expedited when the
          accused consents to the waiving of a voir
          dire and that his right to do so exists apart
          from any provision of the Code and
          consequently apart from any consideration of
          questions of fact and law.
               </pre>
    <pre>The remarks of the Chief Justice are apt here.</pre>
    <pre>[43] When the trial judge, in the case at hand, asked defence
counsel whether it was necessary to have the reporter sign and
produce another copy of the 1991 transcript, defence counsel
replied: &#147;No it&#146;s not necessary.&#148;  This represented a valid
waiver of the requirement that the 1991 transcript be signed by
the court reporter.
[44]  I am satisfied that the requirement of reliability has been
met.</pre>
    <pre>Would the admission of the transcript render the trial unfair?</pre>
    <pre>[45] Although both necessity and reliability of the transcript
are present, a court would still have a discretion to exclude the
transcript if its admission would render the trial unfair.
[46] No notice is required if the proffered judicial document
meets the requirements for admissibility at common law:  Tatomir,
supra, at 327.  However, the court still had a discretion to
exclude hearsay evidence as a matter of trial fairness:  R. v.
Hawkins, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1043 at 1089.
[47] In this case the defence appears to have been given
overnight notice by the Crown of its intention to introduce the
1991 transcript.  The transcript itself is only 7 pages long.
Defence counsel had an opportunity to discuss the transcript with
the appellant and to cross-examine the investigating officer on
the voir dire into the admissibility of the transcript and K.B.&#146;s
statement.  In the circumstances, lack of notice would not have
resulted in any unfairness if the transcript had been admitted.
[48] The transcript is admissible at common law as a judicial
record of the 1991 proceedings.  It is proof of what was said in
court at that time.  An additional basis must be found for the
transcript to serve as evidence of the prior discreditable
conduct.  To that issue I now turn.</pre>
    <pre>The Admissions contained in the 1991 transcript</pre>
    <pre>[49] An admission may be defined as an oral or written statement,
or conduct, made directly by or on behalf of a party.  See The
Law of Evidence in Canada,  Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, in
Canada, 2nd ed. (1999), at 291.
[50] The 1991 transcript contains two admissions: the plea of
guilty and an admission of the facts supporting the plea.
[51] A concise description of the nature and effect of a plea of
guilty is found in the dissenting reasons of Laskin J. (as he
then was) in Adgey v. R. (1974), 13 C.C.C. (2d) 177 at 182-183,
cited with approval by Martin J.A. in R. v. Lucas (1983), 9
C.C.C. (3d) 71 at 76-77:

        A plea of guilty carries an admission that the 
	accused so pleading has committed the crime 
	charged and a consent to a conviction being 
	entered without any trial.  The accused by such
        a plea relieves the Crown of the burden to prove 
	guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, abandons his 
	non-compellability as a witness and his right 
	to remain silent and surrenders his right to offer
        full answer and defence to a charge.</pre>
    <pre>[52] When a plea of guilty is entered, the judge has a duty to
satisfy himself that the plea is supported by the facts: R. v.
Lucas, supra.  This can be done in an informal manner through
statements read into the record by Crown counsel.  Provided the
statement as read in is not disputed, it will form the
evidentiary foundation for the passing of sentence.  An
allegation read into the record that is not admitted by the
defence is not evidence:  Report of the Attorney General&#146;s
Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure and Resolution
Discussions, The Hon. G. Arthur Martin, Chair, Queen&#146;s Printer
for Ontario 1993 at 324-5.  Where the alleged facts are disputed,
they must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in the traditional
manner: Gardiner v. R. (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 477.  After the
statement has been read in, if the accused disputes any of the
aggravating facts the Crown must prove the alleged facts beyond a
reasonable doubt.  Before passing sentence, the judge must be
satisfied that the facts underpinning the plea sustain the
charge: Adgey, supra, at 185-186.</pre>
    <pre>Admission of the allegations by the defence</pre>
    <pre>[53] The appellant submits that the comments of defence counsel
following the reading into the record of the circumstances
regarding the sexual assault on K.B. did not constitute an
admission of those circumstances.
[54] The transcript indicates that, after the facts were read-in
by the Crown, the court asked defence counsel: &#147;Are there any
comments with regard to the facts?&#148;  Defence counsel replied as
follows:

          In relationship to the facts, I simply point
	  out to you that we examined the forensic evidence
	  for grouping stain types, as well as the medical
	  report, Dr. Thorsteinson.  I ask you to note
          &#151; that her hymen was intact.  The vaginal swabs
	  did not reveal presence of semen in the vagina.
	  And that the staining referred to was diagnosed
	  as relating to Mr. C., was that on the underwear
          that the young lady was wearing.  There is no
	  grouping in relationship to the stain on the bed&#133;
     </pre>
    <pre>          The Court: All right.</pre>
    <pre>[55] In response to the trial judge&#146;s question, the defence did
not contest any of the facts read in by the Crown.  The comments
of defence counsel, that K.B.&#146;s hymen was still intact and that
the accused&#146;s semen was only on her underwear, were put forward
as mitigating factors to the offence.  There was no issue as to
the manner in which the sexual assault took place.  Counsel&#146;s
comments on behalf of the accused and in his presence amount to
an admission by the accused:  Attorney General (Canada) v.
Korponay, [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41 at 53.
[56] As a result of counsel&#146;s comments, there was no need to call
extrinsic evidence, such as witnesses to give viva voce evidence,
in order to prove the facts.  The necessary evidence was the
statement read in by the Crown.</pre>
    <pre>The effect of the admissions</pre>
    <pre>[57] The appellant submits that it is unfair to admit the 1991
transcript on the appellant&#146;s 1997 trial because there was no
opportunity to cross-examine K.B., either in 1991 or in 1997.
Admissions are proof of the truth of their contents.  They are an
exception to the hearsay rule but are admissible on a different
basis than other exceptions to the hearsay rule.  In R. v. Evans
(1994), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 104, Sopinka J. stated:

          2.  Admissions

          The rationale for admitting admissions
          has a different basis than other exceptions
          to the hearsay rule.  Indeed, it is open to
          dispute whether the evidence is hearsay at
          all.  The practical effect of this doctrinal
          distinction is that in lieu of seeking
          independent circumstantial guarantees of
          trustworthiness, it is sufficient that the
          evidence is tendered against a party.  Its
          admissibility rests on the theory of the
          adversary system that what a party has
          previously stated can be admitted against the
          party in whose mouth it does not lie to
          complain of the unreliability of his or her
          own statements.  As stated by Morgan, &#147;[a]
          party can hardly object that he had no
          opportunity to cross-examine himself or that
          he is unworthy of credence save when speaking
          under sanction of oath&#148; (Morgan, &#147;Basic
          Problems of Evidence&#148; (1963), pp. 265-6,
          quoted in McCormick on Evidence, ibid.,
          p. 140).  The rule is the same for both
          criminal and civil cases subject to the
          special rules governing confessions which
          apply in criminal cases.</pre>
    <pre>[58] The decision in Evans, supra, at 104, also indicates that
preliminary questions that are a condition of admissibility are
to be resolved by the trial judge in his or her capacity as the
judge of the law rather than as the trier of fact.
[59] Because a plea of guilty and the facts in support of it are
admissions, they may be introduced against an accused person as
an admission in certain situations at a subsequent judicial
proceeding:  Ewaschuk, Criminal Pleadings and Practice in Canada,
2nd ed. (1999), at 14:2180.2  The decision in  R. v. Dietrich,
supra, at 53-60 is an example.  There, the accused was being
tried on a charge of non-capital murder.  At the close of the
Crown&#146;s case, the Crown read in portions of the transcript from
the accused&#146;s previous trial.  The transcript disclosed that,
when the indictment for capital murder was read to the accused,
his counsel entered a plea of guilty to non-capital murder on his
behalf.  The Court of Appeal for Ontario held that the accused&#146;s
admission of guilt to non-capital murder was properly admissible
on his subsequent trial.  Gale C.J.O. said, at 56, that &#147;the plea
and the remarks of the accused&#146;s counsel&#148; were an integral part
of the Crown&#146;s case, showing conduct on the part of the accused
that was consistent with confessions he had made on previous
occasions.
[60] Although an admission can be admitted in evidence against a
party in a subsequent criminal or civil case, it is always open
to the party who has made the admission to testify that he or she
never made the admission, or to qualify it in some other way:
The Law of Evidence, supra, at 287 and 291.
[61] The appellant chose to testify at his 1997 trial and,
therefore, had an opportunity to explain and to qualify his
guilty plea.  He testified that the admission of guilt in 1991
was untrue.  He testified that he did not sexually assault K.B.
and that he pleaded guilty to the charge because his lawyer and
the Crown had made a deal.  The deal was made, according to the
appellant, &#147;because my lawyer didn&#146;t want to cross examine K.B.&#148;
In effect, the appellant&#146;s recantation of his 1991 plea was akin
to a recantation of a confession.  This recantation went to the
weight to be accorded to his prior admission, not to its
admissibility.</pre>
    <pre>B.   The applicability of s.686(1)(b)(iii)</pre>
    <pre>[62] The appellant&#146;s admission that he had committed a sexual
assault on K.B., a minor, for which he was convicted in 1991, was
properly before the court because the original indictment was
properly admitted.  The Crown sought to introduce into evidence
the circumstances under which the sexual assault was committed as
similar fact evidence.  The same evidence was proffered in two
forms:  K.B.&#146;s statement and the transcript containing the
admissions in support of the guilty plea.  At the conclusion of
the voir dire, the trial judge erred in admitting the evidence of
K.B.&#146;s hearsay statement and in excluding the 1991 transcript
containing the admissions.  The trial judge chose the wrong form
by which to admit the evidence of prior discreditable conduct.
This was a trial by judge alone.  The trial judge&#146;s error as to
the form in which the evidence should have been admitted is minor
and of no consequence.  The improperly admitted statement
contained the same proof as the admissions that were excluded.
Consequently, I am of the opinion that this is an appropriate
case in which to apply the curative proviso contained in
s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code.  Because the appellant strenuously
opposed the application of the curative proviso, I will elaborate
on my conclusion.
[63] The test for the application of the proviso is laid out in
R. v. Wildman, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 311, where the Court held that the
trial judge erred in refusing to admit exculpatory evidence and
the curative proviso could not apply to uphold the verdict.
Lamer J. stated at 328:

         As regards resort by a Court of Appeal to 
	the proviso of s. 613(1)(b)(iii) [now s.686(1)
	(b)(iii)] the law has been clearly laid down
	by this Court in Colpitts v. The Queen, [1965] 
	S.C.R. 739.  Cartwright J.&#146;s formulation of 
	the test was as follows, at p. 744:
     
               &#133; once error in law has been found
               to have occurred at the trial, the
               onus resting upon the Crown is to
               satisfy the Court that the verdict
               would necessarily have been the
               same if such error had not
               occurred.  The satisfaction of this
               onus is a condition precedent to
               the right of the Appellate Court to
               apply the terms of the subsection
               at all&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[64] In R. v. Haughton, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 516 at 516, Sopinka J.
stated that &#147;[t]he application of s.686 (1)(b)(iii)&#133; requires the
Court to consider whether a jury properly instructed could,
acting reasonably, have come to a different conclusion absent the
error.&#148;
[65] In R. v. L.K.W. (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 449, Moldaver J.A.
had occasion to consider the applicability of the curative
proviso in the context of a case alleging several counts of
sexual assault that had been tried before a judge and jury.  He
stated the following at 472:

          In R. v. B.(F.F.), supra, the Supreme Court
	  of Canada observed that s. 686(1)(b)(iii) is
	  only to be used in rare and exceptional
	  circumstances.  As Lamer C.J. pointed out at p. 117,
          the curative proviso must be used with &#145;great
	  circumspection&#146; lest accused persons be deprived
	  &#145;of the right to have their guilt or innocence
	  determined by a properly instructed jury of
          their peers&#146;.  Similarly, at p. 140 of that
	  decision, Iacobucci J. commented that &#145;[s]ection
	  686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code is for use
	  in exceptional cases only&#133;&#146;.
          </pre>
    <pre>          Where the Crown invites an appellate
          court to apply the curative proviso in a case
          such as this, where the jury has not received
          proper legal instruction, to succeed, the
          Crown must establish (i) that the error was
          minor and inconsequential and could not
          possibly have affected the verdict; or (ii)
          that although the error was potentially
          serious, the evidence is so overwhelming that
          the verdict would inevitably have been the
          same had the jury been properly instructed.</pre>
    <pre>[66] The application of the curative proviso entails a review of
the properly admissible evidence.  The purpose of this review is
to determine the effect of the trial judge&#146;s error on the result
at trial and to assess the ways in which the error may have
unfairly prejudiced the accused&#146;s ability to have a fair trial.
As Doherty J.A. stated in R. v. Jackson (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d)
385 at 413-14 (Ont. C.A.):

        Where potentially incriminating evidence has 
	been improperly admitted, an appellate court, 
	in determining whether to apply the proviso, 
	must consider the direct impact of the evidence
        improperly admitted; its effect on the other 
	properly admitted evidence, particularly 
	evidence given by an accused, and the cumulative 
	probative force of the properly admitted evidence: 
	see Mewett, &#147;No Substantial Miscarriage of Justice&#148;, 
	Dobb and Greenspan (eds.), Perspectives in Criminal 
	Justice (1985), 81 at pp. 94-102.

               &#133;

        In addressing the potential application of the 
	curative proviso, one must also consider the force 
	of the case against an accused apart from the 
	improperly admitted evidence&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[67] As can be seen from the above quotation, the usual situation
facing the court is one where the evidence itself is not
admissible as opposed to admissible evidence not having been
admitted in the proper form.  The trial judge did not commit two
separate compartmentalized errors.  He committed one global error
respecting the form as to which to admit similar fact evidence or
evidence of prior discreditable conduct.  In light of these
exceptional circumstances, it is appropriate to consider this
double-edged error in its totality to determine whether to apply
the curative proviso.  In other words, in having regard to the
evidence against the appellant to determine the effect of the
trial judge&#146;s error, it is appropriate to consider the similar
act evidence or evidence of prior discreditable conduct.
[68] By no means does this represent a wholesale license to re-
examine, on appeal, any evidence that may have been excluded in
error at a trial in order to determine whether a conviction may
be upheld.  This is not the purpose of the curative proviso.
Sopinka J. endorsed the relevant limiting principle in R. v.
P.L.S., [1991] 1 S.C.R. 909 at 917, based on Spence J.&#146;s decision
in Colpitts, supra, as follows:

          Spence J. expressed this limitation on the
	  role of an appeal court in the following 
	  language, at p. 756:
     </pre>
    <pre>               I am of the opinion that this Court
               cannot place itself in the position
               of a jury and weigh these various
               pieces of evidence.  If there is
               any possibility that twelve
               reasonable men, properly charged,
               would have a reasonable doubt as to
               the guilt of the accused, then this
               Court should not apply the
               provisions of s. 592(1)(b)(iii)
               [now s.686(1)(b)(iii)] to affirm a
               conviction.
     </pre>
    <pre>Furthermore, Estey and Lamer JJ. stated in R. v. John, [1985] 2
S.C.R. 476 at 481-2:
     
	&#133; The reviewing tribunal cannot, with anything
        approaching reality, retry the case to assess 
	the worth of the residual evidence after the 
	improperly adduced evidence has been extracted 
	from the record.  The appellate tribunal does 
	not have the advantage of seeing the witnesses, 
	and in any case, was never intended in the 
	criminal process to replace the jury&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[69] In the case at hand, the determination of the effect of the
trial judge&#146;s error turns on a comparison between the proof
provided by the officer&#146;s reading-in of K.B.&#146;s statement and the
proof provided by the admissions contained in the 1991
transcript.  Defence counsel at trial conceded that the substance
of the two pieces of evidence was so similar as to be considered
essentially identical.  I note, in particular:</pre>
    <pre>      The 1991 transcript contained all of the critical elements
     of the evidence that was established by the reading-in of K.B.&#146;s
     statement.  These critical elements, regarding the facts
     surrounding the appellant&#146;s previous conviction for sexual
     assault, included:  the age of the complainant, the location of
     the offence, the way in which the offence was carried out, and
     other circumstances surrounding the offence.
     </pre>
    <pre>      Although K.B.&#146;s statement contained information about the
     circumstances of the previous offence that was not contained in
     the 1991 transcript, this additional information was peripheral
     and insignificant in relation to the main thrust of the evidence.
     </pre>
    <pre>      Neither the 1991 transcript nor K.B.&#146;s statement contained
     evidence that was exculpatory to the accused.</pre>
    <pre>[70] The admissibility of the evidence that is essentially
identical to the wrongly admitted evidence allows this court to
avoid the potential error of retrying the case on appeal.
[71] Here, the trial judge was aware of the admissions and,
although he was obliged to put them out of his mind following the
voir dire, he kept the same facts in his mind because he had
admitted K.B.&#146;s statement.  The admissions in the 1991 transcript
would necessarily have been relied upon by the trial judge in the
same way as K.B.&#146;s statement; that is, as similar fact evidence
to assist him in concluding that the complainant&#146;s version of
events was more likely to be true.  It would not be retrying the
case on appeal to say that the verdict would undoubtedly have
been the same in this case.
[72] Finally, in order to apply the curative proviso, the
appellant submits that I must conclude that the admissions in the
1991 transcript, in place of K.B.&#146;s statement, would not have
provided the accused with an opportunity to conduct a different
strategy at trial.  As Lamer J. stated in Korponay v. Canada
(Attorney General), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 41 at 57:

        &#133; The question therefore, as regards the 
	application of s. 613(1)(b)(iii), is whether 
	the Crown has discharged the burden of satisfying 
	the court that even if the accused had known that
        the finding would be adverse to him his defence 
	would have been necessarily the same&#133;.</pre>
    <pre>[73] If the admission of the transcript provided an opportunity
for a different defence strategy, then the appellant must receive
a new trial in order to exercise that opportunity.  If the
accused had been denied the opportunity at trial to testify and
to offer an explanation as to why, in his opinion, the 1991
transcript did not accurately establish the facts surrounding his
previous conviction, then the curative proviso could not be
applied. At his 1997 trial, the appellant testified and offered
the explanation that his lawyer had made a deal for him to plead
guilty in 1991 so that he would not have to cross-examine K.B.
This explanation was explicitly rejected by the trial judge, who
stated during Crown counsel&#146;s closing submissions:  &#147;The fact
that an accused person comes forward at a later date and makes a
denial of the factual situation which was present at the time a
plea of guilty was entered is not really impressive evidence to
me.&#148;  Thus, the appellant exercised his opportunity to respond to
the evidence of the circumstances surrounding his guilty plea.
[74] In this case, the appellant testified and denied that he had
committed any sexual assault on K.B. in 1991.  The evidence with
which we are now dealing concerns the manner of commission of
that sexual assault.  Given the denial of the appellant that he
committed any offence, the suggestion that the defence might have
been different if the form in which the details of his
discreditable conduct was put before the court was different,
does not have any air of reality.  In this regard, it must be
borne in mind that the only defence open to this appellant for
this particular offence is a denial that the act occurred.
[75] Lastly, as indicated in Evans, supra, the error committed by
the trial judge was in regard to a preliminary question
concerning a condition of admissibility. The error was committed
by the trial judge in his capacity as a judge of the law.  The
trial judge should have admitted the evidence contained in the
1991 transcript but found it unnecessary to do so because he had
already admitted the evidence in a different form.  In a sense,
he did not decide the issue.  In that regard, the remarks of
Sopinka J., with Lamer C.J.C., La Forest, L&#146;Heureux-Dub and
Gonthier JJ. concurring, in R. v. Rockey (1997), 110 C.C.C. (3d)
481 at 485 are instructive:
	
        Where that [error of law] occurs, s. 686(1)
	(b)(iii) requires the court to trace the 
	effect of the error through the process of
        the trial and to determine its effect on the
	ultimate verdict. If the preliminary matter 
	is purely a question of law which the trial 
	judge failed to decide, the Court of Appeal 
	decides what was the right conclusion in law.  
	If that conclusion leads to the admissibility 
	of the evidence which was in fact admitted, then
        the error had no effect on the verdict.  The 
	appellate court will not entertain an argument 
	that different judges might decide differently.  
	There is only one answer which is that given by the
        appellant court.</pre>
    <pre>[76] Thus, with the exclusion of the statement and the
admissibility of the transcript, the appellant faced the same
choices in terms of his defence.  No injustice is done in
refusing to order a new trial.
[77] The Crown has succeeded in establishing that the error was
minor or inconsequential and that it could not possibly have
affected the verdict.  I would, therefore, apply the curative
proviso and dismiss the appeal.

    <pre>Released:  FEB 16 2000          Signed: &#147;Karen M. Weiler J.A.&#148;
KMW                                     &#147;I agree R.S. Abella J.A.&#148;
</pre>
    <pre><strong>GOUDGE J.A.: (Dissenting)</strong></pre>
    <pre>[78] I have had the benefit of reading the thorough and
comprehensive reasons for judgment of Weiler J.A.  I agree with
her conclusions on all issues save one. I do not agree that
s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Criminal Code should be applied in this
case.  I would therefore allow the appeal and direct a new trial.
[79] The facts of this matter are fully set out in the reasons of
my colleague.  For my purposes it is necessary to highlight only
a few.
[80] In making its case at trial, the Crown sought to rely on an
episode of prior discreditable conduct by the appellant, namely,
a separate incident of sexual assault on K.B.
[81] At trial the Crown sought to tender two pieces of evidence
to prove this episode: the transcript of the appellant&#146;s
admission of the facts read in on his guilty plea in 1991 and the
out-of-court statement by the complainant K.B. to the
investigating officer in those proceedings.
[82] The trial judge first dealt with the transcript, which he
excluded for two reasons.
[83] First, having concluded that s.715 of the Criminal Code was
the only basis upon which it could be admitted, he concluded
that, as the Crown had not given notice as required by this
section together with the Canada Evidence Act, there was no basis
upon which the transcript could be admitted.  Second, he found
the transcript unnecessary, given that the investigating officer
was able to provide the court with the complainant&#146;s out-of-court
statement.
[84] After further argument the trial judge then dealt with the
out-of-court statement which he admitted as evidence of the prior
discreditable conduct.
[85] The appellant gave evidence in his own defence.  In chief he
addressed neither the events discussed in the out-of-court
statement, nor his admission on his guilty plea.  The Crown cross-
examined him on the statement of K.B. and then turned briefly to
the circumstances of the admission.  This was the entirety of the
exchange:

          Q.   Why did you plead guilty?

          A.   Due to the fact that uh the &#150; the
          crown and my lawyer made uh made &#150; made us uh
          whaddya call it?

          Q.   Deal?

          A.   A deal.

          Q.   So you served &#133;

          A.   And my lawyer didn&#146;t want to cross-
          examine the little girl on the stand.  That&#146;s
          what he told me.

          Q.   So how many of the 12 months did
          you serve?

          A.   Nine months.

          Q.   So you went to jail for nine months
          for something you didn&#146;t do.

          A.   That&#146;s right.

          Q.   Voluntarily.

          A.   Voluntarily.

          Q.   And you served every day of that
          three years of probation voluntarily.

          A.   Voluntarily.

          Q.   And you weren&#146;t guilty.

          A.   I wasn&#146;t guilty.</pre>
    <pre>[86] In re-examination the appellant addressed his admission only
to say that the pre-sentence report in 1991 recited his assertion
of innocence and that when this was raised by the trial judge his
lawyer told him &#147;you&#146;re making me look like hell&#148; and instructed
that he reiterate his plea of guilty.
[87] In convicting the appellant the trial judge clearly relied
on the evidence of prior discreditable conduct provided by the
out-of-court statement of K.B.  As my colleague has indicated, it
was a significant factor in the decision.
[88] The Crown acknowledges that it failed to establish that K.B.
was unavailable to give viva voce evidence and that therefore it
did not satisfy the requirement of necessity for the admission of
this statement as an exception to the hearsay rule.  This error
of law warrants the setting aside of the conviction.
[89] However, the Crown argues that the trial judge also erred in
excluding the 1991 transcript of the appellant&#146;s admission. The
transcript is argued to be admissible as a public document
(neither counsel raises s.13 of the Canadian Charter of Rights
and Freedoms).  The Crown says that because the facts described
in the admission are essentially the same as those in the
statement and are therefore equally inculpatory, this court
should take account of the admission and apply s.686(1)(b)(iii)
to dismiss the appeal from conviction.
[90] I cannot agree with this submission.  I do agree with my
colleague, that the facts described in the 1991 transcript are
essentially the same as those addressed in the out-of-court
statement by K.B. I also accept that the trial judge erred in not
admitting the 1991 transcript.
[91] I cannot agree that this error together with the error in
admitting the out of court statement of K.B. should properly be
considered as one global error respecting the form of the similar
fact evidence.  The trial judge made two different decisions for
different reasons about two different pieces of evidence &#150; one, a
statement from a prior complainant and the other, an admission
from the appellant.  As I will indicate, I think these pieces of
evidence raise potentially different tactical concerns for the
defence and cannot be viewed as identical in every respect.
[92] At the level of principle, I have real doubt that the
proviso permits repair of the Crown&#146;s case by replacing
improperly admitted evidence with improperly excluded evidence in
order to find no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
But even if the proviso can be used in this way, I do not think
that the Crown can demonstrate in these circumstances that the
result would necessarily have been the same.
[93] The wording of the proviso is well known:

         s.686(1)   On the hearing of an appeal against
	 a conviction or against a verdict that the
	 appellant is unfit to stand trial or not
	 criminally responsible on account of mental
	 disorder, the court of appeal
          
         (a)  may allow the opinion where it is of
	 the opinion that

                    &#133;

              (ii)  the judgment of the trial court
	      should be set aside on the ground of a
              wrong decision on a question of law

                    &#133;

         (b)  may dismiss the appeal where

                    &#133;

              (iii) notwithstanding that the court
              is of the opinion that on any ground
              mentioned in subparagraph (a)(ii)  the appeal
              might be decided in favour of the appellant,
              it is of the opinion that no substantial
              wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred.</pre>
    <pre>[94] As my colleague has pointed out, the application of the
proviso is informed by a number of fundamental principles.  It is
to be used only in exceptional cases and with great
circumspection to ensure that accused persons are not deprived of
the right to have their fate determined by a properly instructed
jury of their peers.
[95] Moreover, when asked to apply the proviso an appellate court
must be conscious that it cannot, with anything approaching
reality, attempt to retry a case to assess the worth of the
evidence that remains after the erroneously admitted evidence is
excised from the record.
[96] In addition, the proviso is concerned with the fairness of
the trial of the accused person.  It allows the conviction to be
sustained despite the error where to do so does not undermine the
right of the accused to be tried fairly.  In R. v. Tran, [1994] 2
S.C.R. 951, Chief Justice Lamer put it this way at p.1008-1009:

          Section 686(1)(b)(iii) is designed to avoid
	  the necessity of setting aside a conviction 
	  for minor or &#147;harmless&#148; errors of law where
	  the Crown can establish that no substantial
	  wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred
	  &#133; In other words, where the fairness of the
	  proceedings has not been detrimentally affected,
          the Code effectively permits the error in
	  question to be &#147;cured&#148;, thereby allowing the
	  appeal from conviction to be dismissed.</pre>
    <pre>[97] Viewing the proviso against this backdrop of principle, I
doubt that it can be applied as urged by the Crown.
[98] Mr. Schwartz fairly acknowledged that he could find no case
where an appellate court, in applying this section, had replaced
erroneously admitted Crown evidence with erroneously excluded
Crown evidence to the same effect.
[99] Moreover, the use of the proviso proposed by the Crown would
put significant and perhaps unbearable pressure on the principles
of application I have referred to.  The appellate tribunal would
be required to make its assessment on the basis of inculpatory
evidence, part of which was not before the trial court.  This
enhances the risk of the appellate court becoming to some degree
an original trier of fact, a role for which it is not well
suited.
[100]     In addition, to dismiss the appeal on this basis would
be to sustain the conviction of the accused on evidence part of
which he never faced at trial.  This does not seem to accord with
the principle of fairness that underpins our criminal law.
[101]     However I do not need to reach a final conclusion on
this question, for even if the proviso can be so applied, I do
not think in the circumstances of this case that the Crown can
meet the onus cast upon it.
[102]     As my colleague has set out, that onus is to show that
the verdict would necessarily have been the same if the errors
below had not occurred, namely, had the out-of-court statement
been excluded, but the 1991 transcript admitted. The Crown must
show that had the accused known he was facing the transcript of
his admission, his defence would have been necessarily the same.
[103]     In my view, the Crown cannot demonstrate this.  At his
trial the appellant was confronted with the direct evidence of
K.B. given through her out-of-court statement as to what happened
on the prior occasion of alleged discreditable conduct.  The
issue thus raised was whether the events which she described
happened or not.
[104]     The appellant was not confronted at trial with his
admission of what happened as recorded in the 1991 transcript. As
a result, he gave no evidence in chief about the circumstances of
the making of that admission.  He was subjected to only a brief
cross-examination about it and gave even briefer reply evidence.
He called no other evidence to explain why he made the admission.
Given that the admission had been excluded, none of this is
surprising.
[105]     Had the appellant been faced at trial with his
admission, but not with the out-of-court statement of K.B., it is
entirely possible that the defence strategy would have been
different.  The circumstances of the making of his admission
would have displaced the conflict between K.B.&#146;s version of
events and his own as the central issue.  The appellant&#146;s
objective would have been to diminish the weight accorded to his
admission.  This would have raised the real prospect of more
detailed evidence from the appellant about why he made the
admission and evidence from other witnesses on the same issue,
perhaps even from the lawyer who represented the appellant in
1991.
[106]     Given this, the Crown cannot show that had the
appellant been confronted at trial with the 1991 transcript of
his admission rather than the out-of-court statement of K.B., his
defence would have been necessarily the same.  Indeed, I think it
is entirely possible it would have been different.
[107]     I would therefore conclude that this is not a case
where s.686(1)(b)(iii) of the Code should be applied.  Given the
error of law below in admitting the out-of-court statement of
K.B., I would set aside the conviction and order a new trial.
