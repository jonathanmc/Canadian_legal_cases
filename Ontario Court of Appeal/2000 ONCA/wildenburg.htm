    <pre><strong>Appeal from the judgment of Pitt J. dated May 27, 1998</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is an appeal by Wildenburg Holdings Limited from  the
judgment   of   the   Honourable  Mr.  Justice  Pitt   dismissing
Wildenburg&#146;s  appeal from the reassessments of corporation&#146;s  tax
assessed  by  the  respondent  Minister  of  Revenue  under   the
Corporations Tax Act, R.S.O. 1980, c. 97.
[2]  The facts are not in any real dispute.  For the most part
they have been agreed upon and need not be set out for our
purposes in any detail.  It will be sufficient to note that the
appellant and Orlando, another Canadian resident corporation,
bought real property purporting to be partners.  Title to the
real property was held by the two corporations which carried on
business under a partnership name.  $1.2 million was borrowed
from Hatzfeldt, the appellant&#146;s sole shareholder in order to
generate business and property income.  The appellant and Orlando
secured the loan with a mortgage to Hatzfeldt who was a non-
resident of Canada.  It is accepted that the liability of each of
Wildenburg and Orlando was limited to 50% of the mortgage debt.
Thus the partners&#146; liability was several, not joint.
[3]  Section 18(4) of the Income Tax Act of Canada, which is
incorporated by reference in s. 12 of the Corporations Tax Act
for provincial purposes, restricts the amount of interest expense
paid to a non-resident lender that a corporation may deduct in
computing its income.  Section 18(4) provides:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>18. (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Act, in computing the income for a taxation year of 
a corporation resident in Canada from a business or 
property,  no deduction shall be made in respect of 
that proportion  of any amount otherwise deductible 
in computing its  income for the year in respect of 
interest paid or payable by it on outstanding debts 
to specified non-residents that</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(a) the amount, if any, by which               </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>               (i)   the   greater  amount   that   the
               corporation&#146;s   outstanding   debts   to
               specified non-residents was at any  time
               in the year,
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>exceeds
               </pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>               (ii) 3 times the aggregate of
               </pre>
    <pre>               (A)   the  retained  earnings   of   the
               corporation at the commencement  of  the
               year,  except to the extent  that  those
               earnings  include retained  earnings  of
               any other corporation,
               </pre>
    <pre>               (B)    the   corporation&#146;s   contributed
               surplus at the commencement of the year,
               and
               </pre>
    <pre>               (C)  the  greater  of the  corporation&#146;s
               paid-up capital at the commencement   of
               the  year and the corporation&#146;s  paid-up
               capital at the end of the year,
          </pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>(b) the amount determined under subparagraph (a)(i)
in respect of the corporation for the year.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[4]   The principal issue before us is whether the appellant  was
immune  from the application of s. 18(4) of the Income  Tax  Act.
The  resolution  of this issue raises two further  issues.   They
are:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
a)   was the mortgage debt assumed by the partners through 
     the partnership or separately  on their own accounts;  
     and</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>b)   if  we  find  that  the debt was assumed  through the
     partnership, does the finding of partnership property 
     insulate the appellant from the application of s. 18(4) 
     of the Income Tax Act?</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[5]   We  accept  the respondent&#146;s position on issue  (a)  above.
Thus it is not necessary to deal with the other issues.  Pitt  J.
found that:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>In the circumstances outlined in the facts agreed upon 
by the parties, it seems clear that the mortgage loan 
was a debt of the appellant and Orlando with the 
latter&#146;s responsibility being limited to one-half, and 
not a debt of the partnership.</pre>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[6]   In our view, there was sufficient evidence to support  this
finding,  a critical part of which is that the debt in issue,  as
secured  by the mortgage, was not a debt of the partnership,  but
rather  a debt of the partners.  Since this finding was supported
by  the evidence, our interference with it is not warranted.   It
follows  that  the thin capitalization rules of s. 18(4)  of  the
Income  Tax  Act  apply  and  it is not  therefore  necessary  or
desirable  for  us to deal with the other issues  raised  in  Mr.
Fiorenza&#146;s able argument.
[7]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at
$1,500.
