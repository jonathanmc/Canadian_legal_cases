    <pre><strong>On appeal from an Order Staying Proceedings of Hawke J., dated
September 9, 1998.</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>CARTHY J.A.:
</strong></pre>
    <pre>[1]   This  is  a Crown appeal from an order staying  proceedings
against  the respondent on the ground that he had not been  tried
within  a reasonable time.  The incident out of which the charges
arose  occurred on June 23, 1996 and the stay order was  made  on
September  9, 1998 &#150; a period of 26 months.  This is a long  time
to  await  trial  but, on the other hand, the charges  were  very
serious  &#150; impaired driving causing death, driving with excessive
alcohol in his blood and possession of marijuana.
[2]  On June 23, 1996, the respondent was driving his motor
vehicle southbound on Mississauga Rd. when a northbound motor
vehicle being driven by Ryan Bowie made a U turn in front of the
respondent and a violent collision occurred.  A passenger in the
Bowie vehicle was thrown to the road and died of her injuries. It
was alleged that both drivers were impaired and that the
respondent was driving without his headlights on.
[3]  In a 61-page ruling Hawke J. made the following general
observations by way of conclusion:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    But  for  the  allegation  that  the 
 	  defendant&#146;s  actions  were  one  of the events
	  that  caused  a  death, it  is  a  clear  case
          where  the matter would be stayed, as there is 
	  nothing else  that  is  remarkable  about  the
	  case.  As impaired driving matters go the rest
	  of the allegations are toward the lower end of
	  seriousness.    Reflecting    back  on   those
	  allegations  there  is   no  evidence  of  bad
          driving. It is alleged that  his  lights  were
	  off. The blood alcohol readings and indicia of
	  impairment alleged were both relatively modest.
          </pre>
    <pre>                      This  case  comes  down  to   the
          following issue.  When the societal  interest
          component  of 11(b) is put into  the  balance
          with  all  of the circumstances of the  case,
          does  it  warrant the denial  of  a  stay  of
          proceedings?
          </pre>
    <pre>                      Society   always  has  a   strong
          interest  in  any death that did  not  result
          from  natural  causes.   This  is  true  even
          outside   of  the  criminal  justice  system.
          Society&#146;s  strong interest in this charge  is
          reflected in the seriousness given to  it  in
          the   Criminal   Code.   It  is   clearly   a
          consequence    driven   offence.     It    is
          interesting,  for example, to compare  it  to
          impaired operation causing bodily harm.  This
          is  a  more serious charge than that and  the
          only  required  difference  between  the  two
          offenses is the consequence.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     I  am sure that for the family and
          friends of Ms. Rodrigues it is very difficult
          to hear of the death of their loved one being
          put into an academic exercise of balancing of
          interests when her passing means so  much  to
          them.   However,  it  is my  view,  that  the
          societal interest in having the accused,  who
          is charged with a serious offence, brought to
          trial,   does   not   outweigh   the    other
          circumstances   justifying    a    stay    of
          proceedings.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    To rule otherwise would make a sham
          of the guidelines set by the Supreme Court of
          Canada.   If  over twice the upper  guideline
          for  acceptable institutional  delay  becomes
          tolerable   then   the  guideline   and   the
          principles   involved  in  formulating   them
          become meaningless.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     To  rule otherwise would allow the
          secondary  interest, i.e., societal  interest
          to completely overrule the primary purpose of
          section 11(b), which is the protection of the
          individual rights of the accused.</pre>
    <pre>Factors Relating to time</pre>
    <pre>[4]   The  approach of the motions judge in her extensive reasons
was  to  examine each stage of the proceedings and determine  the
reasons  for the delay. She found two periods assignable  to  the
respondent&#146;s conduct &#150; a 4 month intake period while he  obtained
legal representation and the 2 months it took to hear the s.11(b)
motion and deliver reasons.  This left 21 months attributable  to
the  Crown,  institutional lack of resources and  the  inheritant
time  requirements  of the case. Using the upper  level  of  what
should  be  a  reasonable range for the latter, she  assigned  10
months   and   concluded  that  the  remaining  11   months   was
unreasonable institutional delay.
[5]  The Crown raised a list of concerns as to the motions
judge&#146;s approach to the evidence relating to the cause of
individual periods of delay.   I see only one period that is
significant enough to weigh appreciably in the balance of s.11(b)
concerns &#150; the 10 month period between September 27, 1997, a
proposed trial date, and July 20, 1998, the actual start of a
trial (leading to a mistrial).
[6]  Some background information is needed to explain how this
delay came about.  The respondent was charged with the three
offences immediately after the accident.  In September 1996 a new
information was issued charging him jointly with the driver of
the other vehicle, Bowie.  This joint charge and the desire of
both accused to obtain a severance lay behind much of the ensuing
delay. In October of 1996 the court fixed June 6, 1997 to hear
the severance motion and set aside ten days in September 1997 as
a target date to deal with either a preliminary or a trial.
Neither accused wanted to elect before knowing the outcome of the
severance motion.  Both of these dates were found by Judge Hawke
to be the earliest available.  She so concluded from the absence
of any note on the indictment that counsel had turned down an
earlier date. Apparently, that is reflective of the practice in
the Brampton court.
[7]  The June 6, 1997 date was lost largely because the defence
was deficient in filing materials. However, no time was really
lost because a new date of July 25th was set for the severance
motion with fixed dates for each side to serve materials.  This
was well before the tentative trial date in September.
[8]  On July 25th the parties appeared before Judge Budzinski.
The defence material had been handed in on time but, through an
administrative error in the Crown Law Office, had not reached the
assigned Assistant Crown Attorney until the last moment.  Thus
she had not filed material and was only able to hand counsel for
the defence the 13 cases she relied on.  Bowie&#146;s defence counsel
indicated he would need time to study the case law.
[9]  Judge Budzinski observed that the accused were entitled to
an adjournment, that there might be a delay argument down the
road and that it would be in everyone&#146;s interest to have the
judge presiding over the September dates hear the severance
motions, if possible prior to September.  If not, then he could
either direct that some of the trial time be used for the
severance motions, or, because it would not be known in advance
whether a trial or trials or a preliminary hearing might follow,
he might simply strike the September date as a prospective trial
date.  The latter option would avoid the necessity of the defence
calling witnesses for a trial that might not occur.
[10] Defence counsel suggested that it made sense to strike the
trial date. The Crown stated that she was prepared to argue
today, but would not object to an adjournment and then stated:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>An 11(b) issue arising as a result of the motion, perhaps
ultimately being put off to the first date scheduled for 
trial, is what concerns me. If there isn&#146;t going to be 
an 11(b) issue as a result of counsel&#146;s suggestion that 
the motion be dealt with on that date and striking the 
trial date, then so be it, but I have grave concerns 
about striking the trial date.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>Neither defence counsel offered any comment on these remarks.</pre>
    <pre>[11] At this point, counsel went to the trial co-ordinator to see
if  Judge  Atwood, who was to preside on the September dates  was
available for a half-day motion at some earlier time.  He was not
and  Judge  Budzinski  thereupon fixed  September  30th  for  the
arraignment  and  severance motion and left the  setting  of  new
trial dates to await the result of the severance motions.
[12] For reasons that are not significant to this appeal, but
referred to in para. 17 hereof, the severance motion was not
argued in September.  It was a given once September was lost as a
trial date that a new one had to be fixed and the earliest date
available as of the beginning of October, 1997, when a date was
first sought, was July 20, 1998.
[13] The argument of the Crown that I now wish to deal with is
that the events of July 25, 1997 caused the 10 month delay from
September 1997 to July 1998 and that this should be ascribed to
the fault of the respondent.
[14] The appellant argues that the respondent waived the loss of
time by indicating support for striking the trial date and for
remaining silent in the face of the reference by the Crown to
s.11(b) concerns.
[15] Judge Hawke did not accept that argument saying:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>It is my finding that the Crown has not shown, on a
balance of probabilities, that Mr. Lent waived Mr. 
Williamson&#146;s 11(b) rights by what he said on July 25th. 
There was no advertence to the act of release and as 
outlined above, I believe that to infer a release from 
the comments is to take the comments out of context.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[16]  The motions judge then criticized the Crown for failure  to
recognize on July 25th that substantial time was being  lost  and
for  failing  to  approach one of the judges to  give  this  case
special  attention, rather than waiting until October to approach
the trial co-ordinator for a trial date.
[17] Another complicating factor referred to by Judge Hawke was
that the defence wanted the severance motion before election,
while the Crown was arguing that only the trial judge had
jurisdiction.  The Crown was apparently surprised to find that
Judge Budzinski was not the scheduled trial judge, thus
presenting another reason that the motion could not proceed on
July 25th .  In fact, the reason the severance motion was not
dealt with in September was that Judge Atwood ruled that only the
trial judge had jurisdiction to do so.
[18] I defer to Judge Hawke&#146;s reasoning and conclusion on this
issue. Silence in the face of a passing observation by the Crown
should not be taken out of the context of an extensive colloquy
and raised to the level of advertant waiver.  Moreover, Judge
Hawke has apparent familiarity with the  administration of the
court and counsel who appear before it and is in the best
position to recognize tactical steps directed at creating a
s.11(b) defence.  She observes in closing:</pre>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>The record does not show actions by the defendant that
in any way indicate that he is asserting his Charter 
right as a sword rather than a shield.</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <pre>[19]  The  severance  issue  was of obvious  importance  to  each
accused  in  circumstances where each is blamed for a  death  for
quite  independent, if similar, conduct.  The stances  they  were
taking  were legitimate and there is no obligation on the defence
to  trim the sails in the direction of expedition if that is  not
the  direction of the best defence.  They wanted to  elect  after
knowing the result of the severance motion and much of the  delay
in  this prosecution flowed from the outstanding argument of  the
Crown that only the trial judge could deal with severance yet the
trial  court  could  not be determined prior to  election.   This
circumstance  could invite manipulation by defence  counsel,  but
here  Judge Hawke found respondent&#146;s counsel to be acting without
guile  and  it  must  be  remembered  that  the  co-accused   was
effectively dictating defence tactics to the extent that  he  was
raising procedural concerns.
[20] There were a few other incidental points of appeal
concerning the time allocations. I am satisfied that each lacks
merit.  The motions court judge was justified in criticizing the
Crown for not taking special steps to expedite proceedings. The
precharge time was short but does not appreciably affect the 11
months excess. The application for a mistrial in July of 1998 (to
be discussed below) was entirely justified.  Further, the time
following the mistrial was not counted by Judge Hawke against the
Crown and she might well have done so in that the trial had not
yet begun.
[21] In conclusion, I am satisfied that Judge Hawke properly
assessed and allocated the time between charge and trial and now
move to the issue of prejudice.</pre>
    <pre>Prejudice</pre>
    <pre>[22]  The  appellant makes the point that Judge  Hawke  erred  in
finding that there was a general presumption of prejudice from  a
long  delay  and that this error infected her entire analysis.  I
agree  that  the reasons of Sopinka J. in R. v. Morin (1992),  71
C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) make it clear that the onus is always upon
the  defence to establish prejudice and that lengthy  delay  only
permits  an  inference, not a presumption. Having  misstated  the
initial approach Judge Hawke reviewed the evidence and then found
actual  prejudice &#147;in addition to an inference of prejudice  from
this unreasonable delay.&#148; It is an open question whether she left
behind  her  initial  use  of  &#147;presumption&#148;  and  converted   to
&#147;inference&#148; in the course of her reasons.
[23] That being said, in order to respond to other matters raised
by the Crown, it is necessary to review the evidence and,
particularly, the events of July 1998.  On July 20th , the date
set for trial, the co-accused Bowie pled guilty and the severance
issue disappeared.  The respondent was arraigned, elected trial
in Provincial Court and the trial opened.  The respondent moved
for a stay for delay in reaching the trial and Judge Budzinski
heard argument and then reserved his ruling pending completion of
the trial.  On the 5th day of trial the Crown wanted to call
evidence of inculpatory statements made at the time of arrest and
a voir dire was commenced to determine whether the statement was
voluntary.  The first witness was an officer who had taken
custody of the respondent at the scene of the accident.  She
mentioned that a security guard had handcuffed the respondent
prior to her arrival and delivered him to her.  There was no
mention of this in her notes and it was a revelation to the Crown
and the respondent. The defence then wished to argue that
statements and evidence gathered after this &#147;arrest&#148; should be
excluded.  This led to the police finding the security guard,
Kenneth Willett, and bringing him forward to give evidence on the
voir dire.  His testimony was that he was securing nearby
premises when he heard the collision, ran with his partner to the
scene, identified the respondent as the driver of one of the
vehicles, smelled alcohol on his breath, ran after him when he
ran away, handcuffed him and told him he was under arrest for
impaired driving. He then handed him over to the arriving
officers.  He gave his name and phone number to one officer but
no one contacted him until the weekend prior to giving evidence.
This led to knowledge that Willett&#146;s father, who owned the
security firm, had seen the collision and would state that the
respondent&#146;s headlights were not on.
[24] The Crown indicated its intention to call this new evidence
at the trial proper, whereupon the respondent moved for a stay
pursuant to s.7 and s.24 of the Charter. In the alternative he
sought exclusion of the new evidence and in the further
alternative a new trial.  Judge Budzinski found that the problem
arose from an oversight on the part of the police and that a stay
was not justified. He refused to exclude the new evidence,
favouring the community interest in a trial on the full merits.
He felt it to be unfair to the defence to recall witnesses and
seek to mould a different defence around this very significant
new evidence.  He therefore declared a mistrial, having arranged
that the new trial commence the next day before Judge Hawke.
[25] At the opening of the new trial the s.11(b) motion was made
and argued on days that were available through to August 27.  No
evidence was called, Judge Hawke reserved judgment and delivered
reasons on September 9, 1998.
[26] All of this narrative is background to a consideration of
prejudice arising from the delay of trial.
[27] The appellant concedes some prejudice arising from the bail
restrictions, but suggests these are minimal.  In fact the
restrictions were quite severe, no doubt because of the
seriousness of the offences and perhaps because of the
respondent&#146;s background. He reported once a week to the police
(100 times). Other conditions included abstinence from alcohol,
prohibition from being on licensed premises; curfew from 11:00
p.m. to 6:00 a.m.; and prohibition from driving or possessing a
key to or even sitting in the front seat of a motor vehicle.  The
respondent did not give evidence and apparently managed to live
with these restrictions, but they remain as evidencing not
inconsequential prejudice.
[28] The Crown contends that Judge Hawke not only reversed the
onus of proof by speaking of a presumption of prejudice, but also
that she erred in considering the late discovery of the two eye
witnesses as related to prejudice.  It is contended that s.11(b)
is not concerned with prejudice of this type which did not arise
from the delay.  Rather it is a factor to consider under s.7 and
was dealt with by Judge Budzinski.
[29] I disagree.  The fair trial interests of the accused is an
object of both s.7 and s.11(b).  Once trial delay is sufficient
to require scrutiny fair trial concerns could not be adequately
assessed if prejudice of any type related to the passage of time
is excluded from consideration. All relevant factors must be
brought together and form the basis of the ultimate decision as
to breach and remedy.  A fact relevant to s.7 concerns may also
be a fact for consideration under s.11(b).
[30] The s.11(b) time concern in this case, using the allocations
of Judge Hawke, is framed by an expectancy of a trial 14 months
after the charge (4 months input time plus the guideline of 10
months for institutional delay).  This means that the two new
witnesses would have been discovered 1 year before they actually
came to light.  We need not make assumptions as to time wearing
down memory, particularly when unaided by contemporaneous notes
or memoranda, because in this case we have the actual evidence of
Kenneth Willett. He is very clear on certain matters but
interspersed in his evidence are comments such as:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Q.   When you arrived can you describe
	  the, the vehicles that you saw that you believed
	  were in the accident?
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A.   Again I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t really
          recall.  I know that &#133; I believe one  of  the
          cars was a blue vehicle, a smaller vehicle. I
          believe  it was maybe a Chevette.  It  was  a
          hatchback of some kind, I recall, I  believe.
          And  &#133;  And a white larger vehicle.  The make
          I, I don&#146;t, I don&#146;t recall.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Q.    And  how would you  describe
          their distance relative to each other?  Okay.
          I&#146;m not asking you to guess anything sir.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A.    No.   I&#146;m  just  trying  to
          recall.  It&#146;s been a long time, and I haven&#146;t
          read any notes to refresh my memory.  So &#133;
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Q.   Okay.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A.   &#133;I don&#146;t have anything to go by.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     Q.    Well,  what we&#146;re aware  of,
          sir,  is  a statement you gave to the  police
          yesterday.   Is  that what you  meant,  meant
          when you said notes.
          </pre>
    <pre>                     A.   No. It wasn&#146;t yesterday.   It
          was Friday.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Q.   Well, Friday, sir.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A.    And  as  I  said,  I&#146;m  not
          guessing.   I&#146;m only hesitating to  give  you
          the right answer.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Q.    Okay.  Well I don&#146;t want you
          to guess, sir.  If you don&#146;t know the answer,
          say you don&#146;t know it, but don&#146;t guess.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A.    Well  as  I  said,  I&#146;m  not
          guessing.  I&#146;m just trying to recall.   Yeah,
          I&#146;d probably say I don&#146;t recall.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Q.   Okay.
          </pre>
    <pre>                    A.   It&#146;s been too long.</pre>
    <pre>[31] We cannot know to what extent his memory was altered by  the
passage of 12 months, but it can safely be inferred that it would
have been better. Authorities such as R. v. Morin (supra) and  R.
v.  Rahey   (1987),  33  C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.)  speak  to  the
importance of holding a criminal trial while memories  are  fresh
and the inference that may be drawn that time will dull memories.
The evidence quoted above offers reality, if that was needed,  to
the inference.
[32] Judge Hawke also considered as a third point the submission
that the respondent always wanted a trial in Provincial Court and
was effectively dragged along by the co-accused.  She concluded
that there was no conduct by the defendant after October 1996 to
negative prejudice.
[33] Her Honour concluded her reasons on prejudice as follows:
          </pre>
    <pre>                    Looking at all of the above, collectively,
	  the inferred prejudice and the actual prejudice
	  suggested in points one and two, and the lack of
	  responsibility of the defendant outlined in point
	  three, it is my view that it is appropriate to find
	  that there is prejudice in this case and that it was
	  incurred because of delay.  The degree of prejudice
	  is neither de minimis nor gross.  It lies somewhere
	  close to the middle of these two extremes. [Emphasis
	  added.]
          </pre>
    <pre>                       The    presence   of   prejudice
          reinforces  the application of the guidelines
          established for institutional delay.</pre>
    <pre>[34]  While Judge Hawke started off speaking of a presumption  of
prejudice  arising  from  the  passage of time,  she ends in this 
passage  inferring  that prejudice and finding actual  prejudice. 
Her points one and two coincide with the issues I have dealt with 
and her findings are roughly coincident with my observations.</pre>
    <pre>Conclusion</pre>
    <pre>[35] Overall, Judge Hawke appears to me in her lengthy reasons to
be  conscientiously examining the conduct of  her  court  through
careful  analysis of what the Supreme Court has said  it  expects
and a meticulous examination of each step in this proceeding. She
has  concluded that the system didn&#146;t do its job, the  respondent
was   prejudiced  and  that  society&#146;s  interest   in   the   due
administration  of justice through prosecution  of  offenders  is
offset by the respondent&#146;s interest, and through him society as a
whole, in a fair trial in a reasonable time.
[36] That balance is always a difficult one and I empathize with
the array of family members of the victim who attended the
hearing of this appeal.  In so observing, I am also impressed
with the care and concern expressed by Judge Hawke in balancing
the factors.  This was not a case of arriving at a decision and
then justifying it.  She looked at every facet of concern,
including the seriousness of the offence, the victim&#146;s family,
the conduct of the defence lawyer, the actions of the Crown and
the administration of the Brampton court.  Her reasons reflect a
sincere and thorough balancing of societal interests.
[37] Notwithstanding what I view as a passing error that did not
impact on the conclusion, I would defer to Judge Hawke&#146;s
conclusion and, on my own analysis of the record, agree with her.
The appeal should be dismissed.
