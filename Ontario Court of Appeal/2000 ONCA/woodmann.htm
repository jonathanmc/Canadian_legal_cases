</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>On appeal from the decision of Mr. Justice G. G. Nicholls dated
April 28, 1998
</strong></pre>
    <pre><strong>                      ENDORSEMENT
</strong>                                
[1]    The   appellant&#146;s   first  two  points   depend   on   the
interpretation of the authority to sell.  As to the first  point,
in  our  view  the term &#147;introduce&#148; could not refer  to  a  prior
introduction  and,  therefore, could not apply  to  the  sale  to
Moore.   As  to  the  second point, the  phrase  &#147;show  the  said
property&#148;,  in the circumstances of this case, cannot  reasonably
refer to merely showing financial statements to Moore.  The trial
judge  found that the authority to sell was not intended to apply
to  a  sale  to  Moore  who had already  been  dealing  with  the
respondents  for  a  considerable period of  time  prior  to  the
signing  of the authority to sell.  That finding is supported  by
the evidence.
[2]  As to the appellant&#146;s final point, the trial judge adopted a
test for the effective cause of the sale that was very favourable
to the appellant.  We have not been persuaded that he erred in
the application of that test to these facts when he found that,
while Christopher provided some assistance to Moore, with whom he
had a longstanding relationship, he was not the effective cause
of the sale by the respondents to Moore.
[3]  Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.  The money
paid into court shall be paid out to the respondents Theodore A.
Kudlac and William J. Kudlac.
