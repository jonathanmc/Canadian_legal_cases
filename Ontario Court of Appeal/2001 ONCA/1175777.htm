  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[1]       Magna International Inc. and Frank Stronach appeal from an 
    order of a single judge of the Divisional Court dated February 18, 2000 that 
    permitted the respondent to amend its statement of claim. The Divisional Court 
    overruled the decision of a Master dated October 5, 1999. The Master had refused 
    the respondent’s request to amend its statement of claim by adding a claim 
    for damages for intentional interference with economic relations to its existing 
    claims against Magna, and by adding Stronach, Chairman of the Board of Directors 
    of Magna, as a party defendant. The respondent’s proposed claims against Stronach 
    are for damages for intentional interference with economic relations and for 
    conspiracy to injure. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]       This appeal raises an issue about the nature of conduct that 
    is capable of qualifying as tortious interference with economic relations. 
    A second issue involves the viability of a claim for conspiracy to injure 
    against an officer of a corporation who allegedly instructed a subsidiary 
    corporation not to complete contractual negotiations or, alternatively, not 
    to perform a contract. If both of these grounds fail, the appellants submit 
    the proposed amendments amount to over-broad joinder of claims and should 
    be refused for that reason.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      The respondent’s primary claim is for damages for breach of a 
    contract the respondent alleges it made with Decoma International Inc. on 
    October 29, 1996. The respondent says Decoma agreed to lease a building the 
    respondent was constructing. Decoma was a subsidiary of Magna at the time. 
    The proposed occupant of the premises was to be Mytox Manufacturing, a division 
    of Magna. Magna and Decoma amalgamated after this litigation was commenced, 
    and have continued under the name Magna. Magna denies that Decoma entered 
    into the contract alleged. The statement of claim has been amended several 
    times, in part to clarify whether Magna or Decoma was the original contracting 
    party.<a href="#_ftn1"

lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>      In addition to these claims, the respondent also claims damages 
    against Magna and Heri Polzl for inducing breach of contract and for conspiracy 
    to injure. Polzl is a real estate consultant retained by Magna. The claim 
    against Polzl for inducing breach of contract formed part of the original 
    statement of claim. The claims for conspiracy to injure and the claim against 
    Magna for inducing breach of contract were added as a result of a motion made 
    on October 29, 1997. Stronach was described as a party to the conspiracy in 
    that amendment, but was not named as a defendant.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

      the Agreement, or in the alternative, Walker, acting on directions from 
      Stronach, intending to cause Decoma to breach the Agreement told Powers

      Stronach caused Magna Developments offered [sic] to purchase the property

    60 O.R. (2d) 696 (H.C.J.) and considered whether the proposed amendments set 
    forth claims that are “tenable at law”. As to the proposed claims against 
    Magna and Stronach for intentional interference with economic relations, he 
    relied on <i>Lineal Group Inc. v. Atlantis Canadian Distributors Inc. </i>(1998), 
    42 O.R. (3d) 157 (C.A.) which held that there were three elements to this 
    tort, the second being interference with the “plaintiff’s business <i>by illegal

    it is not illegal to refrain from completing contractual negotiations. He 
    found no illegal means had been pleaded. As to the claim for conspiracy to 
    injure against Stronach, he referred to <i>ADGA Systems International Ltd. 
    v. Valcom</i> (1999), 168 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 351 (C.A.) and <i>Meditrust 
    Healthcare Inc. v. Shoppers Drug Mart, a division of Imasco Retail Inc.,</i>

    12 – 15 as follows:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Said v. Butt</i> the plaintiff was engaged in 
        a dispute with an opera company which refused to sell him tickets to a 
        performance. The plaintiff purchased a ticket through an agent and when 
        he appeared at the opera the defendant, an employee of the opera company, 
        recognized him and ejected him. The plaintiff sued the employee for wrongfully 
        procuring the company to break a contract made by the company to sell 
        the plaintiff a ticket.</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span lang=EN-US>The court held that there was no contract because the 
        company would not knowingly have sold a ticket to the plaintiff. Nevertheless, 
        on the assumption that there was a contract, the court considered the 
        implications to the defendant employee. McCardie J. stated at p. 504:</span></p>
    </div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>It is well to point out that Sir Alfred Butt possessed the widest powers 
          as the chairman and sole managing director of the Palace Theatre, Ltd. 
          He clearly acted within those powers when he directed that the plaintiff 
          should be refused admission on December 23. I am satisfied, also, that 
          he meant to act and did act bona fide for the protection of the interests 
          of his company. If, therefore, the plaintiff, assuming that a contract 
          existed between the company and himself, can sue the defendant for wrongfully, 
          procuring a breach of that contract, the gravest and widest consequences 
          must ensue.</span></p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>After detailing the mischief that would 
      flow from permitting such claims to be made McCardie J. concluded at p. 
      506:</span></div>
    <blockquote> 
      <div class=Section1> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>I hold that if a servant acting bona fide within the scope of his authority 
          procures or causes the breach of a contract between his employer and 
          a third person, he does not thereby become liable to an action of tort 
          at the suit of the person whose contract has thereby been broken…Nothing 
          that I have said to-day is … inconsistent with the rule that a director 
          or a servant who actually takes part in or actually authorizes such 
          torts as assault, trespass to property, nuisance, or the like may be 
          liable in damages as a joint participant in one of such recognized heads 
          of tortious wrong.</span></p>
      </div>
    </blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>For present purposes, I extract the following 
      from McCardie J.’s reasons. First, this is not an application of <i>Salomon 
      and Salomon</i>…Second, it provides an exception to the general rule that 
      persons are responsible for their own conduct. That exception has since 
      gained acceptance because it assures that persons who deal with a limited 
      company and accept the imposition of limited liability will not have available 
      to them both a claim for breach of contract against a company and a claim 
      for tortious conduct against the director with damages assessed on a different 
      basis. The exception also assures that officers and directors, in the process 
      of carrying on business, are capable of directing that a contract of employment 
      be terminated or that a business contract not be performed on the assumed 
      basis that the company’s best interest is to pay the damages for failure 
      to perform. By carving out the exception for these policy reasons, the court 
      has emphasized and left intact the general liability of the individual for 
      personal conduct.</span></div>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The first question is whether the claim as 
    pleaded describes tortious conduct personal to Stronach. The heart of the 
    claim propounded is the assertion of the predominant purpose to injure on 
    the part of the principals to the conspiracy. The judge who heard the motion 
    to amend in October 1997, when this cause of action was originally added against 
    Magna and Polzl, recognized that feature of the claim and permitted the amendment 
    against those defendants. She concluded:</span></p>

    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>[u]pon a careful review of the pleading, 
      I find that, although it is highly doubtful from the facts and circumstances

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I am satisfied the same reasoning applies to 
    the claim as against Stronach. Though the respondent may have difficulty in 
    proving the allegations set out in paragraph 10.1 of the statement of claim, 
    by attributing a specific intention or purpose to Stronach and alleging steps 
    taken in furtherance of that purpose, the respondent has pleaded tortious 
    conduct personal to him. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second question is whether the allegations 
    fall within the class of conduct eligible for protection by <i>Said v. Butt</i>. 
    I am satisfied that they do. Though characterized as forming part of a conspiracy 
    to injure, the impugned conduct consists of “depriving 1175777 of the benefits 
    under the Agreement and ... facilitating the construction of the Mytox plant 
    by its competitor”. The remedy sought consists of benefits lost under the 
    Agreement. Reduced to its simplest form, the respondent’s complaint is that 
    Stronach induced a breach of contract, i.e. conduct to which the <i>Said v. 
    Butt</i> exception generally applies. The respondent cannot escape the application 
    of the rule by simply attaching a different label to the impugned conduct. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Furthermore, I can see no reason why the <i>Said 
    v. Butt</i> exception should not apply as well to an officer, director, or 
    employee of a parent corporation who, in the course of his duties, acts for 
    a subsidiary, provided the individual acts in the best interests of the subsidiary. 
    A director of a parent corporation acting on behalf of and in the best interest 
    of a subsidiary would not be a “stranger”, or “a third person”, standing “wholly 
    outside the area of the bargain made between the two contracting parties”.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[4]</span></a>  
    If the director of a parent corporation can and does act on behalf of a subsidiary, 
    then he or she is not a stranger to the contractual relationship breached, 
    and the policy considerations outlined in <i>AGDA</i> for application of the 
    <i>Said v. Butt</i> exception are properly applicable. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Said v. Butt</i> exception applies, 
    however, only where a person acts <i>bona fide</i>, in the interests of the 
    corporation, in this instance the subsidiary. Though the respondent has pleaded 
    Stronach was at all times acting for Magna, that is not equivalent to an allegation 
    that he was entitled to and did act for its subsidiary, nor that he acted 
    <i>bona fide</i> in the interests of its subsidiary. As it is not therefore 
    plain and obvious from the statement of claim that the <i>Said v. Butt</i> 
    exception is applicable to Stronach, the claim against him should not be precluded 
    at this stage.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>               The endorsement granting leave to amend stipulated that 
    the claim for conspiracy to injure in its proposed format was defective in 
    that it failed to plead the special damages suffered as a result of the alleged 
    conspiracy that were distinct from any damages that would flow from a contractual 
    remedy. The endorsement directed that the claim for conspiracy to injure should 
    therefore be struck with leave to amend by providing particulars of the special 
    damages alleged within 30 days. An amended statement of claim that described 
    the special damages allegedly caused by the conspiracy to injure and that 
    claimed those damages against both Magna and Polzl was subsequently delivered. 
    There is no indication the amended format was the subject of any judicial 
    scrutiny. The claims for <i>special </i>damages for conspiracy to injure against 
    Magna and Polzl were not incorporated into the proposed pleading forming the 
    subject matter of this appeal.</span></p>
