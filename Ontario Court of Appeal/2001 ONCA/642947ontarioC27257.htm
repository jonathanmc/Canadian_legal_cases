lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The litigation arises out of a fight between two sophisticated 
  developers – Burnac Corporation and George Halasi – to acquire a property in 
  North York (the “Property”) considered key to the development of the North York 
  corridor.  The Property was owned by Jules Fleischer and Melvin Newton and leased 
  to Sweet Dreams Delights Inc., a company controlled by Halasi and his partner 
  Larry Krauss, a lawyer.  Sweet Dreams’ lease contained a right of first refusal 
  on any offer to buy the Property.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In August 1989, 642947 Ontario Limited (“642947”), a nominee 
  of Burnac, agreed to buy the Property for $2,000,000.  Sweet Dreams exercised 
  its right of first refusal, but later terminated the agreement.  Then, in late 
  September 1989, 642947 resubmitted its original offer to Fleischer and Newton, 
  who accepted it and took the position that Sweet Dreams’ right of first refusal 
  was spent.  Sweet Dreams, however, obtained an interlocutory injunction restraining 
  the sale.  It gave the usual undertaking to pay any damages caused by the injunction.  
  On the injunction application, 642947 and Burnac requested and were granted 
  an extension of the closing date until after the injunction proceedings had 
  concluded.  In 1990, the real estate market in Metropolitan Toronto collapsed.  
  The Property fell in value, and both Burnac and Halasi lost interest in it.  
  Sweet Dreams’ injunction was dissolved in November 1990 and a new closing date 
  for the sale to 642947 was fixed for December 1990.  But 642947 refused to close, 
  citing the downturn in the real estate market.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> 642947 sued for a declaration that its agreement with Fleischer 
  and Newton had been terminated and for a return of its deposit.  Fleischer and 
  Newton counterclaimed for damages for breach of the agreement, and 642947 and 
  Burnac sought to be indemnified by Sweet Dreams, Halasi and Krauss on the undertaking 
  to pay damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After a long trial heard in July of 1995 and 1996, Greer J. held 
  642947 and Burnac liable for breach of the agreement of purchase and sale.  
  She assessed damages at the date of closing in December 1990, though the Property 
  fell in value afterwards.  She also held that Sweet Dreams’ undertaking required 
  it to indemnify 642947 and Burnac for their loss and she found Halasi and Krauss 
  jointly and severally liable on the undertaking because Sweet Dreams had no 
  assets and was simply their alter ego.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> All parties appealed the trial judgment.  Burnac and 642947 raised 
  several technical grounds why they were not liable to Fleischer and Newton.  
  In turn, Fleischer and Newton contended that the trial judge erred in assessing 
  damages at the date of closing instead of at or near the date of trial, and 
  alternatively that she erred in failing to order pre-judgment interest and post-judgment 
  interest at the commercial rate instead of the statutory rate.  Sweet Dreams, 
  Halasi and Krauss submitted that they were not liable on the undertaking because 
  642947 and Burnac’s damages were not caused by the injunction.  Finally, Halasi 
  and Krauss submitted that even if Sweet Dreams was liable on the undertaking, 
  the trial judge erred by piercing the corporate veil and making them liable 
  as well.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We found no merit in the appeal by 642947 and Burnac and did 
  not call on Fleischer and Newton to respond to it.  I would dismiss the appeal 
  by Fleischer and Newton on damages.  I would, however, allow the appeal by Sweet 
  Dreams, Halasi and Krauss because, in my view, the damages awarded against 642947 
  and Burnac were not caused by the injunction but by the fall in the real estate 
  market and by their deliberate refusal to close the transaction.  Had I, however, 
  found Sweet Dreams liable on its undertaking, I would have upheld the trial 
  judge’s conclusion that Sweet Dreams’ principals, Halasi and Krauss, were also 
  liable.</p>

<p class=headingtitle>A.        The Agreements of Purchase and Sale Between 642947 
  and Fleischer and Newton</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> The Property that has been the subject of all this litigation 
  is on a municipal block bounded by Yonge Street, Empress Avenue, Doris Avenue 
  and Kingsdale Avenue in the former City of North York.  It is next to a block 
  of land owned by the City.  Developers interested in assembling land in the 
  North York corridor knew that the City would only sell its block to a party 
  that owned neighbouring land.  Therefore, acquiring the Property was key to 
  developing the corridor.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Property was bought by Fleischer, a lawyer and a developer, 
  and Newton in 1985.  In 1986 they leased it to Sweet Dreams, a company controlled 
  by Halasi and Krauss, each of whom was a 40% shareholder through corporations 
  owned or controlled by them. Sweet Dream’s lease was for five years with several 
  renewal options to 2006.  The lease also contained a right of first refusal, 
  which provided that if the landlord received a <i>bona fide</i> offer to purchase 
  the property, Sweet Dreams had the right to purchase it on the same terms:  
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the event any Landlord hereunder receives a bona fide offer (the “Offer”) 
      to purchase the building and land during the Term or the Renewal Periods 
      from an arm’s length third party purchaser as defined under the Income Tax 
      Act, the Landlord shall send a copy of the Offer to the Tenant (the “Notice”) 
      and the Tenant shall have a first right of refusal to purchase the building 
      and land at a purchase price and upon terms and conditions equal and similar 
      to those contained in the Offer.  Upon receipt of the Notice, the Tenant 
      shall have seven (7) business days to reply to the Landlord in writing of 
      its intent to exercise or not exercise its right of first refusal as the 
      case may be.  Should the Tenant elect to exercise its right of first refusal 
      as set out hereunder, there shall be a binding agreement of purchase and 
      sale of the Landlord’s freehold estate in the building and the land upon 
      which is situated the Leased Premises between the Landlord and Tenant and 
      the parties agree to execute all additional documentation to give effect 
      thereto. …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>This right of first refusal gave Sweet Dreams 
  control over the development of the Property.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the late 1980’s, the real estate market in Metropolitan Toronto 
  was booming.  Burnac became interested in the Property and used a nominee or 
  shelf company, 642947, to try to buy it.  642947 was a bare trustee under a 
  trust agreement with Burnac dated August 28, 1989.  The sole shareholder, director 
  and officer of 642947 was John Handiak, a solicitor who had done work for Burnac 
  for about 15 years.  642947, however, had no assets, no employees and no independent 
  authority.  Under the trust agreement, 642947 was to act “solely and entirely 
  on the instructions” of Burnac.  Burnac’s Vice-Chairman Theodore Burnett testified 
  that the company typically used trust agreements to acquire real property in 
  order to hide the identity of the true purchaser and to limit Burnac’s liability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On August 31, 1989, 642947 entered into an agreement with Fleischer 
  and Newton (the “first agreement”) to buy the Property for $2,000,000, made 
  up of a $100,000 deposit and the balance due on closing, fixed for November 
  24, 1989.  The agreement was conditional on Sweet Dreams’ right of first refusal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Fleischer and Newton submitted the first agreement to Sweet Dreams 
  and on September 13, 1989, Sweet Dreams exercised its right of first refusal.  
  By doing so, Sweet Dreams took over 642947’s position as purchaser.  It then 
  turned around and offered to sell the property to 642947 for $2,050,000, an 
  increase of $50,000 over the original purchase price.  642947 declined the offer.  
  Later, Sweet Dreams used an unrelated condition in the first agreement to get 
  out of the deal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On September 25, 1989, 642947 made an identical offer of $2,000,000 
  to purchase the Property, which Fleischer and Newton accepted (the “second agreement”).  
  Fleischer and Newton, and Handiak, representing 642947, then signed a waiver 
  notice dispensing with the right of first refusal condition in the second agreement.  
  They took the position that once Sweet Dreams had exercised its right of first 
  refusal in connection with the first agreement that right was extinguished.  
  The trial judge agreed.  She found that 642947’s first offer was a <i>bona fide</i> 
  offer, and that “once Sweet Dreams exercised its option, even though it then 
  declined to purchase prior to the inspection period being concluded, its right 
  of first refusal was extinguished and it then no longer became necessary for 
  Fleischer and Newton to submit 642[947]’s identical second Offer to Sweet Dreams”, 
  9 R.P.R. (3d) 261 at 292.  In this court, neither Sweet Dreams nor its principals 
  Halasi and Krauss challenged these findings.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>B.        The Injunction Proceedings</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second agreement was scheduled to close on Friday, November 
  24, 1989.  In mid-November, Sweet Dreams sought to enjoin the closing on the 
  ground that it had not been given an opportunity to exercise its right of first 
  refusal.  The application for the injunction was supported by the affidavit 
  of Halasi, who gave an undertaking on behalf of Sweet Dreams in the standard 
  form prescribed by rule 40.03 of the Rules of Civil Procedure:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Applicant undertakes to abide by any Order concerning 
      damages that the Court may make if it ultimately appears that the granting 
      of the Order has caused damage to the responding party for which the Applicant 
      ought to compensate it.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>Acting on Burnett’s instructions, Andrew 
  Federer, a lawyer and president of a Burnac subsidiary, filed a responding affidavit 
  stating that Burnac would suffer great harm if the injunction were granted.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The application for the injunction was argued on Thursday, November 
  23, the day before the scheduled closing date.  Both Krauss and Fleischer attended 
  the hearing.  Krauss offered to buy the Property for $2,000,000 if the motions 
  judge, Isaac J., restrained 642947 and Fleischer and Newton from closing the 
  second agreement.  Fleischer said that he was indifferent and would sell to 
  whichever party the court found was entitled to buy.  After a full day of argument, 
  Isaac J. reserved his decision until Monday, November 27.  To avoid being prejudiced 
  while the decision was under reserve, 642947 and Burnac asked the motions judge 
  to extend the closing date until Monday, which he did.  On Monday the 27th, 
  Isaac J. released his decision, in which he enjoined 642947 and Fleischer and 
  Newton from completing their agreement of purchase and sale until trial or other 
  order of the court.  To preserve their interest in the Property while the injunction 
  was outstanding, 642947 and Burnac again asked the motions judge to extend the 
  closing date of the second agreement.  In Federer’s words, 642947 and Burnac 
  were “betting that the market would stay the same or go up”.  Isaac J. ordered 
  an extension until the disposition of the action or further order of the court.</p>

  </span></span> Before the injunction proceedings, Burnac had been an undisclosed 
  principal but during the injunction it participated openly and actively and 
  thus became a disclosed principal.  Burnac was later added as a defendant in 
  the action.</p>

  </span></span> In 1990, the real estate market in Metropolitan Toronto collapsed.  
  Property values in the North York area fell dramatically, by as much as 50 to 
  70 per cent.  Halasi and Krauss lost interest in buying the property.  Therefore, 
  in November 1990, Sweet Dreams moved to discontinue the action.  On November 
  22, 1990, Dunnet J. granted Sweet Dreams leave to discontinue, dissolved the 
  injunction and fixed December 7, 1990 for closing the second agreement.  She 
  also ordered that the question whether the undertaking of Sweet Dreams could 
  be imposed on Halasi and Krauss could be considered on an inquiry into damages 
  or in another proceeding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Burnac, too, lost interest in buying the Property.  The day after 
  Dunnet J.’s order, 642947 wrote to Fleischer and Newton waiving tender and stating 
  that it would not close the second agreement because of “the effect of the injunction 
  granted by Mr. Justice Isaac dated November 27, 1989 and the downturn in the 
  real estate market since that date”.  As Burnett testified at trial, Burnac 
  did not complete the transaction because “I didn’t think I was getting what 
  I had bargaining for”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the injunction was dissolved, Fleischer and Newton let 
  it be known that the Property was back on the market, though they did not list 
  it for sale.  When Sweet Dreams’ lease expired in 1991, Fleischer and Newton 
  leased the Property to a new tenant, Sonic Temple Music Store.  The litigation 
  began in April 1991.  When the trial ended in July 1996, Fleischer and Newton 
  still owned the Property and the music store remained a tenant with an option 
  to renew its lease until 2006.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>D.        The Reasons of the Trial Judge</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge gave detailed reasons in what turned out to be 
  a difficult case.  She held that both 642947 and Burnac were liable to Fleischer 
  and Newton for breaching the second agreement. And because it had repudiated 
  the agreement, 642947 was not entitled to the return of its deposit.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge dismissed the “technical” real property issues 
  raised by 642947 and Burnac – for example the inability of the vendors to give 
  vacant possession on closing – by concluding that these issues did not impede 
  the closing.  She found that the trust agreement between 642947 and Burnac applied 
  to the second agreement, that 642947 acted as agent on the transaction, and 
  that therefore Burnac was liable as an undisclosed principal.  Alternatively, 
  she held that Burnac was liable for inducing breach of contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge then turned to assess Fleischer and Newton’s 
  damages.  She made findings of fact on the value of the Property and on mitigation, 
  which are not challenged on this appeal.  She found that the Property was worth 
  $1,130,000 on the date scheduled for closing, December 7, 1990, and that by 
  November 1994, the last time it was appraised before trial, it had a value of 
  only $410,000.  She also found that the vendors had mitigated their loss by 
  re-leasing the Property at a reasonable rate and by advising the developer community 
  it was back on the market.  As well, in her view, 642947 and Burnac had not 
  shown that the vendors had breached their duty to mitigate.  Having made these 
  factual findings, the trial judge chose the date of closing to assess Fleischer 
  and Newton’s damages.  She therefore awarded them $870,000 (the difference between 
  the purchase price and the value of the Property on December 7, 1990) plus pre-judgment 
  interest on that amount at 8.8%, the rate provided by the <i>Courts of Justice 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43.  She rejected Fleischer and Newton’s request 
  for compound interest, holding that they did not satisfy the requirements in 
  <i>Claiborne Industries Ltd. v. National Bank of Canada</i> (1989), 59 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 533 (Ont. C.A.) or <i>Brock v. Cole</i> (1983), 40 O.R. (2d) 97 (Ont. 
  C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, the trial judge dealt with 642947 and Burnac’s third 
  party claim for indemnity based on Sweet Dream’s undertaking.  She held that 
  the undertaking should be enforced because its non-performance is a contempt 
  of court.  She concluded, at p. 297, that the damages she assessed, $870,000, 
  “flow from the undertaking given by Sweet Dreams”.  She also concluded that 
  Halasi and Krauss were liable on Sweet Dreams’ undertaking because they “were 
  the alter ego of Sweet Dreams and knew when the undertaking was given that Sweet 
  Dreams had no assets from which to pay damages.”  In her view, the undertaking 
  was fraudulent and Halasi and Krauss misconducted themselves by offering it 
  to the court.  She thus considered it appropriate to pierce the corporate veil 
  and hold Halasi, Krauss and Sweet Dreams jointly and severally liable both to 
  642947 and Burnac, which she found was a party to the injunction.  She fixed 
  their liability at $770,000 (the amount of damages awarded to Flesicher and 
  Newton less the deposit) together with pre-judgment interest.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I turn now to the three sets of appeals.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>I.          The Appeal by 642947 
  and Burnac </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On their appeal, 642947 and Burnac sought to avoid their liability 
  to the vendors Fleischer and Newton.  Their counsel, Mr. Carr, advanced two 
  arguments why Burnac should not be liable and two arguments why neither Burnac 
  nor 642947 should be liable.  These arguments were:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>1. Burnac was entitled to rely on the sealed contract 
      rule that an undisclosed principal cannot be sued on a contract made under 
      seal.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>2. Fleischer and Newton elected to contract with the agent 
      642947 and are therefore precluded from suing the principal Burnac;</span></p>
    <p>3.  642947 and Burnac are not liable because Fleischer and Newton acted 
      in bad faith; and</p>
    <p>4.  642947 and Burnac are not liable because Fleischer and Newton could 
      not give vacant possession on closing, as required by the second agreement.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We found no merit in any of these arguments and therefore did 
  not ask counsel for Fleischer and Newton to respond to them.  I will briefly 
  give my reasons for dismissing 642947 and Burnac’s appeal.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>1.         The Sealed Contract 
  Argument</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Friedmann Equity Developments Inc. v. Final Note Ltd.</i>, 
  [2000] 1 S.C.R. 842, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the continuing validity 
  of the sealed contract rule.  This rule holds that where a contract is made 
  under seal, only the parties to the contract may sue or be sued on it.  Therefore, 
  an undisclosed principal is not liable on a sealed contract. This rule is an 
  exception to the general rule that a principal, whether disclosed or not, may 
  sue or be sued on a contract made on its behalf by the principal’s agent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found that when it entered into both agreements 
  with Fleischer and Newton, 642947 acted as Burnac’s agent.  And Burnac was an 
  undisclosed principal when the agreements were signed.  Although the first agreement 
  was made under seal, the second agreement was not.  Yet the second agreement 
  was the subject of the litigation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Burnac still contends that it is entitled to invoke the sealed 
  contract rule for the second agreement for two reasons:  642947 intended to 
  execute it under seal and the court should give effect to that intention; and 
  s. 13(1) of the <i>Land Registration Reform Act</i>.  Neither contention has 
  merit.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Handiak, the sole director and shareholder of 642947, testified 
  that his standard practice was to seal all agreements of purchase and sale.  
  He did seal the first agreement, and though he intended to seal the second, 
  he failed to do so.  In my view, Mr.&nbsp;Handiak’s mere intention, unaccompanied 
  by any act of sealing, is insufficient to bring the sealed contract rule into 
  play.  The rule, at once historical and technical, should not be given any wider 
  effect than necessary.  To invoke it, more than an agent’s intention is required.  
  That intention must be accompanied by the deliberate application of the seal.  
  See <i>Friedmann Equity</i> at p. 867.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 13(1) of the <i>Land Registration Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. L.4, treats all conveyances and charges (or mortgages) as sealed documents 
  for all purposes, including the application of the sealed contract rule.  Section 
  13(1) reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>13. (1)  Despite any statute or rule of law, a transfer or other document 
      transferring an interest in land, a charge or discharge need not be executed 
      under seal by any person, and such a document that is not executed under 
      seal has the same effect for all purposes as if executed under seal.</p>
    <p>Burnac submits that the second agreement of purchase and sale is a “charge” 
      under s.&nbsp;13(1) because 642947 was entitled to a purchaser’s lien to 
      the extent of the $100,000 deposit.  To come under s. 13(1), however, the 
      charge must be created by a document.  That is consistent with the wording 
      of the subsection and its purpose, which “is to preserve the common law 
      substantive consequences associated with traditional forms of conveyancing 
      and mortgages.”  See <i>Friedmann Equity</i> at p. 869.  The purchaser’s 
      lien for deposit money is not a charge created by a document but a charge 
      created by equity.  It is an equitable charge on land, not included in s. 
      13(1).  And even if it was, in this case any existing purchaser’s lien ended 
      when 642947 and Burnac wrongfully repudiated the agreement.  For these reasons, 
      the second agreement was not made or deemed to be made under seal and Burnac 
      could be sued on it.  This first ground of appeal fails.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>2.         Fleischer and Newton’s 
  Election</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Assuming the second agreement of purchase and sale was not sealed, 
  Burnac advanced an alternative reason why it was not liable.  It submitted that 
  Fleischer and Newton chose to contract with 642947 knowing that it was a nominee 
  for an undisclosed principal.  Having elected to so contract, Fleischer and 
  Newton cannot now look to hold the principal Burnac liable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This submission has an air of unreality to it.  At trial, Burnac’s 
  main contention was that the trust agreement between it and 642947 applied only 
  to the first agreement but not the second, and therefore 642947 entered into 
  the second agreement as principal not agent.  The trial judge rejected that 
  contention, finding that the trust agreement applied to both agreements of purchase 
  and sale.  That finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Instead Burnac now tries to mount an estoppel or election argument.  
  But I see no basis for precluding Fleischer and Newton from suing Burnac simply 
  because they contracted with 642947.  To the contrary, had Burnac wished to 
  limit its liability it could have insisted on a clause to that effect in the 
  agreements of purchase and sale.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> 642947 was a bare trustee under its trust agreement with Burnac.  
  But as Morden J.A. pointed out in <i>Trident Holdings Limited v. Danand Investments 
  Ltd.</i> (1988), 64 O.R. (2d) 65 (C.A.), in many cases a bare trustee will also 
  be an agent, and when it contracts on behalf of a principal, the principal may 
  be liable for breach of the contract.  Here, 642947 was undoubtedly an agent 
  for Burnac in executing the second agreement of purchase and sale.  Under the 
  trust agreement, 642947 had no independent power, responsibility or discretion; 
  it acted only on the instructions of Burnac.  It was not so much carrying out 
  the terms of the trust as it was doing Burnac’s bidding.  In short, 642947 was 
  an agent for Burnac and the agency relationship predominated over the trust 
  relationship.  Because the agency relationship predominated, the agent’s principal 
  Burnac, though not disclosed and not a party to the second agreement, is still 
  liable for the agreement’s breach.  Holding Burnac liable simply gives effect 
  to the proposition that though an agent negotiates and signs a contract with 
  a third party, the contract remains one between the principal and the third 
  party.  Fleischer and Newton were therefore not estopped from suing Burnac for 
  breach of the second agreement of purchase and sale.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>3.         Bad Faith</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> 642947 and Burnac argued that the vendors Fleischer and Newton 
  should not be allowed to enforce the second agreement because they acted in 
  bad faith.  642947 and Burnac gave two examples of the vendors’ alleged bad 
  faith:  failing to submit the second agreement to Sweet Dreams under its right 
  of first refusal, and then negotiating to sell the Property to Sweet Dreams 
  while contractually obligated to 642947.  Neither example evidences bad faith.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge held correctly that Sweet Dreams’ right of first 
  refusal was spent once it was exercised in connection with the first agreement.  
  Therefore, Fleischer and Newton were not obliged to give Sweet Dreams an opportunity 
  to exercise the right of first refusal in connection with the second agreement.  
  Moreover, it hardly lies in the mouth of 642947 or Burnac to complain about 
  the vendors’ failure to submit the right of first refusal to Sweet Dreams, because 
  642947 signed the waiver notice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Burnac and 642947 argued that Fleischer and Newton exhibited 
  bad faith at the injunction proceedings by offering to sell the Property to 
  Sweet Dreams despite their agreement with 642947.  Both the motions judge and 
  the trial judge implicitly rejected this argument by concluding that Fleischer 
  and Newton took a neutral position.  The vendors were willing to sell the Property 
  to whichever party was entitled to buy it.  Their stance does not show bad faith.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>4.         Inability to Give 
  Vacant Possession on Closing</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> 642947 and Burnac also claimed that Fleischer and Newton could 
  not give vacant possession on closing because of Sweet Dreams’ lease.  Two obvious 
  answers to this claim are:  first, 642947 waived tender, thus making it unnecessary 
  for the vendors to show their ability to complete the transaction in accordance 
  with its terms; and second, on the injunction application Burnac, though aware 
  of the lease, represented that it was ready, willing and able to close and asked 
  for an extension of time to do so.  The existence of the lease was never an 
  impediment to closing the transaction.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>II.        The Cross-Appeal by 
  Fleischer and Newton</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the their cross-appeal, Fleischer and Newton contended that 
  the trial judge’s damages award did not fully compensate them for their loss.  
  Their main submission was that the trial judge erred by assessing damages in 
  a falling market at the date of closing instead of at or near the date of trial.  
  Their other submission was that the trial judge erred in awarding pre-judgment 
  interest and post-judgment interest at the statutory rate instead of at the 
  commercial rate.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>1.         The Date for Assessment 
  of Damages</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The judgment of Morden J.A. in <i>100 Main Street Ltd. v. W.B. 
  Sullivan Construction Ltd.</i> (1978), 20 O.R. (2d) 401 (C.A.) is the principal 
  authority in this court on the assessment of damages for breach of an agreement 
  of purchase and sale.  In that case, the purchaser agreed to buy an apartment 
  building but repudiated the contract before closing.  The vendor sued for damages 
  and both the trial judge and this court held the purchaser liable.  The main 
  issue in this court was when the damages should have been assessed.  At the 
  risk of doing a disservice to the thorough and thoughtful reasons of my colleague, 
  I summarize what he wrote about the choice of the date for assessing damages 
  for breach of an agreement to buy land in the following six propositions, which 
  are relevant to this appeal:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The basic principle for assessing damages 
      for breach of contract applies: the award of damages should put the injured 
      party as nearly as possible in the position it would have been in had the 
      contract been performed.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Ordinarily courts give effect to this principle by assessing 
      damages at the date the contract was to be performed, the date of closing.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The court, however, may choose a date different from the 
      date of closing depending on the context.  Three important contextual considerations 
      are the plaintiff’s duty to take reasonable steps to avoid its loss, the 
      nature of the property and the nature of the market.</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Assessing damages at the date of closing may not fairly compensate 
      an innocent vendor who makes reasonable efforts to resell in a falling market.  
      In some cases, the nature of the property – for example an apartment building 
      – hampers the vendor’s ability to resell quickly.  Thus, if the vendor takes 
      reasonable steps to sell from the date of breach and resells the property 
      in some reasonable time after the breach, the court may award the vendor 
      damages equal to the difference between the contract price and the resale 
      price, instead of the difference between the contract price and the fair 
      market value on the date of closing.</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Therefore, as a general rule, in a falling 
      market the court should award the vendor damages equal to the difference 
      between the contract price and the “highest price obtainable within a reasonable 
      time after the contractual date for completion following the making of reasonable 
      efforts to sell the property commencing on that date” (at p. 421).</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(6)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Where, however, the vendor retains the property 
      in order to speculate on the market, damages will be assessed at the date 
      of closing.</span></p>

  As Professor Waddams wrote in his text, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, 4th ed. 
  (1999), at p. 518,  “[i]t is on general considerations of justice, therefore, 
  that the choice of date must depend”.  The date for the assessment of damages 
  is determined by what is fair on the facts of each case.  See <i>Rice v. Rawluk</i> 
  (1992), 8 O.R. (3d) 696 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)); <i>Bitton v. Jakovljevic</i> 
  (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 143 (H.C.J.).</p>

  </span></span> With these propositions in mind, I turn to Fleischer and Newton’s 
  submission that on the trial judge’s factual findings she should have chosen 
  November 1994 instead of December 7, 1990, the date of closing, to assess the 
  vendors’ damages.  The trial judge found that the Property was worth $1,130,000 
  on December 7, 1990 but only $410,000 in November 1994.  She also found that 
  Fleischer and Newton had fulfilled their duty to mitigate by re-leasing the 
  Property and by letting the development community know that it was again on 
  the market.  Having made these findings, the trial judge still chose the date 
  of closing to assess the vendors’ damages.  In my view, she was correct to do 
  so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The vendors led no evidence about the “highest price obtainable 
  in a reasonable time” after the closing date.  They cannot pick a date at random, 
  nearly four years after the closing date, when the market was likely at its 
  lowest, and reasonably expect the court to choose that date to measure their 
  loss.  Even the trial judge’s finding that Fleischer and Newton initially met 
  their duty to mitigate must be viewed in the context of what occurred subsequently.  
  The trial was ongoing in July 1996, five and one-half years after the scheduled 
  closing date, yet Fleischer and Newton still owned the Property.  Although they 
  may not have been able to sell the Property immediately after 642947 repudiated 
  the second agreement, one might reasonably have expected them to have sold it 
  by the time of trial if they seriously intended to do so.  Indeed, they leased 
  the Property to a new tenant for a period that could extend to 2006, a period 
  that even they acknowledged was an impediment to a resale.  I think the irresistible 
  inference is that, at some point after the fall of the market in 1990, Fleischer 
  and Newton decided to retain the Property, speculating that eventually the real 
  estate market would go back up.  Having decided to do so, they alone must assume 
  the burden or the benefit of changes in the market after the closing date.  
  Fairness dictated that the vendors’ damages be assessed at December 1990.  I 
  therefore do not accept Fleischer and Newton’s main submission that the trial 
  judge erred by failing to assess damages as of November 1994.</p>

  </span></span> Their alternative submission that the trial judge should have 
  awarded both pre-judgment interest and post-judgment interest at the commercial 
  rate of interest instead of the rate under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> 
  was not pressed in oral argument.  I see no error in the trial judge’s award 
  of interest.  Indeed, the pre-judgment interest  rate of 8.8% awarded by the 
  trial judge seems reasonable.  For these reasons, I would dismiss the cross-appeal 
  of Fleischer and Newton.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge found that Sweet Dreams was liable on its undertaking 
  for the loss sustained by 642947 and Burnac, and she then found that Sweet Dreams’ 
  principals, Halasi and Krauss, were jointly and severally liable for the loss 
  because Sweet Dreams had no assets and was simply their alter ego.  Sweet Dreams, 
  Halasi and Krauss each appealed these findings.  Sweet Dreams argued that it 
  cannot be held responsible principally because the injunction did not cause 
  642947 and Burnac’s loss.  Halasi and Krauss argued that even if Sweet Dreams 
  is held responsible, they cannot be held liable personally because no grounds 
  existed to pierce the corporate veil.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge conducted an inquiry into the 
  liability of Sweet Dreams and its principals Halasi and Krauss under paragraphs 
  3 and 4 of Dunnet J.’s order, which provided:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>3.         THIS COURT ORDERS that the inquiry as to the entitlement of 
      the Defendants, 642947 Ontario Limited, Jules Fleischer and Melvin Newton

      Inc., made in the Order of The Honourable Mr. Justice Isaac is adjourned

      The issue as to whether or not the undertaking can be extended to the Defendants, 
      Andrew Federer, Lakeburn Land Capital Corporation and Burnac Corporation 
      was not raised when the motion was argued on November 22, 1990.  This issue 
      may also be considered on the inquiry as to damages, if any, or other proceedings.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>An inquiry was unquestionably called for.  The basis for 
  Sweet Dreams’ injunction – that it was denied an opportunity to exercise its 
  right of first refusal under the second agreement – was, as the trial judge 
  found, devoid of merit.  Having obtained the injunction, Sweet Dreams sought 
  its dissolution only when the market fell and the Property was no longer attractive.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Sweet Dreams, however, argued two grounds why it should not be 
  liable on its undertaking.  First, it submitted that it can be liable only if 
  the injunction caused 642947 and Burnac’s loss and it contended that the injunction 
  did not do so.  Second, Sweet Dreams submitted that 642947 and Burnac cannot 
  look to the undertaking when they voluntarily relinquished a valid ground not 
  to complete the transaction, the inability of the vendors to give vacant possession 
  on closing.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This latter submission has no merit.  Admittedly, one of the 
  conditions of closing required Fleischer and Newton to give vacant possession.  
  But no party to the dispute ever took this condition seriously, and the trial 
  judge rightly found that the failure to satisfy this condition would not have 
  prevented the closing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I therefore turn to the question whether the damages that 642947 
  and Burnac have to pay Fleischer and Newton flow from the injunction.  Many 
  cases have stated the principle that damages for an injunction wrongly granted 
  should be assessed on the same basis as damages for breach of contract.  This 
  principle was affirmed by the House of Lords in <i>F. Hoffmann-LaRoche &amp; 
  Co. A.G. and Others v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry</i>, [1975] 
  A.C. 295 at 361, where Lord Diplock said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The court has no power to compel an applicant for an interim injunction 
      to furnish an undertaking as to damages.  All it can do is to refuse the 
      application if he declines to do so.  The undertaking is not given to the 
      defendant but to the court itself.  Non-performance of it is contempt of 
      court, not breach of contract, and attracts the remedies available for contempts, 
      but the court exacts the undertaking for the defendant’s benefit.  It retains 
      a discretion not to enforce the undertaking if it considers that the conduct 
      of the defendant in relation to the obtaining or continuing of the injunction 
      or the enforcement of the undertaking makes it inequitable to do so, but 
      if the undertaking is enforced the measure of the damages payable under 
      it is not discretionary.  It is assessed on an inquiry into damages at which 
      principles to be applied are fixed and clear.  <i>The assessment is made 
      upon the same basis as that upon which damages for breach of contract would 
      be assessed if the undertaking had been a contract between the plaintiff 
      and the defendant that the plaintiff would not prevent the defendant from 
      doing that which he was restrained from doing by the terms of the injunction</i>:  
      see <i>Smith v. Day</i> (1882) 21 Ch.D. 421, <i>per</i> Brett L.J., at p.

  </span></span> I accept that contract principles apply to the assessment of 
  damages but it seems to me that, in Ontario, the wording of rule 40.03 focuses 
  more precisely on causation.  Rule 40.03 provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>On a motion for an interlocutory injunction or mandatory 
      order, the moving party shall, unless the court orders otherwise, undertake 
      to abide by any order concerning damages that the court may make if it ultimately 
      appears that the granting of the order has caused damage to the responding 
      party for which the moving party ought to compensate the responding party.</span></p>
    <p>The undertaking by Halasi for Sweet Dreams tracks the wording of rule 40.03.  
      Thus, Sweet Dreams undertook “to abide by any Order concerning damages that 
      the Court may make if it ultimately appears that the granting of the Order 
      has caused damage to the responding party for which the Applicant ought 
      to compensate it.”</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Sweet Dreams is liable on its undertaking if the injunction caused 
  the damages that 642947 and Burnac must pay to the vendors, or assuming more 
  than one cause, if the injunction materially contributed to these damages.  
  In my view, the trial judge erred in finding a causal connection.  Although 
  I think little of the conduct of Sweet Dreams and its principals, I cannot see 
  how the injunction caused or materially contributed to the damages 642947 and 
  Burnac must pay to Fleischer and Newton.  These damages were caused by the fall 
  in the real estate market and by Burnac’s deliberate refusal to close the transaction, 
  after having asked the motions judge to extend the closing date to preserve 
  its interest in the Property.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The injunction and its later dissolution gave rise to at least 
  three possible scenarios.  First, whether asked to or not, the motions judge 
  could have refused to extend the closing date.  On this scenario, the injunction 
  would have caused the loss of 642947’s bargain with Fleischer and Newton, and 
  Sweet Dreams could have been liable on its undertaking for that loss.  A second 
  possibility is that the motions judge could have extended the closing date as 
  requested by Burnac, and 642947 could then have closed the transaction on the 
  extended date.  On this scenario, Fleischer and Newton would not have suffered 
  any damages.  And Burnac would have acquired the Property it agreed to buy at 
  the price it agreed to pay.  But the injunction would have caused an approximately 
  one year delay in the closing (from November 24, 1989 to December 7, 1990).  
  Sweet Dreams would therefore be liable to 642947 and Burnac for any damages 
  attributable to the delay.  These damages could have included increased carrying 
  costs, loss of rental income or even loss of profits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The third scenario is the one that occurred.  The motions judge 
  extended the closing as requested by Burnac but then 642947 refused to close. 
  On this scenario, the injunction caused none of the damages that 642947 and 
  Burnac have been ordered to pay.  Instead, these damages were caused by the 
  combination of the fall in the real estate market and 642947’s refusal to close.  
  That this must be so can be seen by considering the position of 642947 and Burnac 
  had the injunction not been granted.  In that case, 642947 would have paid Fleischer 
  and Newton $2,000,000 for the Property in 1989 and a year later would have been 
  left with a Property worth only $1,130,000.  Although Fleischer and Newton would 
  have been paid the contract price, Burnac would still have suffered the same 
  loss, a loss caused solely by the fall in the market.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I therefore conclude that on causation principles, 642947 and 
  Burnac’s claim to be indemnified by Sweet Dreams must fail.  Some authorities, 
  however, have suggested that in assessing damages for the wrongful granting 
  of an injunction a court is not limited by contract law principles but has a 
  wider equitable discretion to do what is “fair and reasonable” or what is “just” 
  in all the circumstances.  See <i>Air Express Ltd. v. Ansett Transportation 
  Industries (Operations) PTW Ltd.</i> (1979 to 1981), 146 C.L.R. 249; <i>Village 
  Gate Resorts, supra</i>; Spry, <i>The Principles of Equitable Remedies</i>, 
  5th ed. (1997) at 660.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These other authorities address the extent to which damages under 
  an undertaking must conform to the general law applicable to contract damages.  
  They suggest that a judge awarding damages under an undertaking has some discretion 
  to depart from contract damages principles, particularly on the issue of remoteness.  
  None of these authorities states that damages may be awarded when a causal link 
  between the undertaking and the loss is entirely absent.  Indeed, each affirms 
  the necessity of establishing factual causation to obtain damages under an undertaking.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even assuming that a wide discretion to order damages in the 
  absence of a causal connection does exist in some jurisdictions, I doubt that 
  an Ontario court could invoke it in the face of the wording of rule 40.03, which 
  focuses the inquiry on causation.  And even if an Ontario court could award 
  damages that seem fair or just, I am not persuaded that this is the right case 
  to do so.  In asking for an extension of the closing date, Burnac gambled that 
  the value of the Property would stay the same or go up.  When its gamble did 
  not pay off, Burnac reneged on its bargain.  It cannot now look to Sweet Dreams 
  to relieve it from the consequences of its own default.  That would not be a 
  just result.  Therefore, I would set aside the trial judge’s order that Sweet 
  Dreams indemnify 642947 and Burnac for their loss.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'>2.         Are Halasi and Krauss 
  Personally Liable?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Halasi and Krauss’ liability depended on finding Sweet Dreams 
  liable on its undertaking.  Because 642947 and Burnac’s claim against Sweet 
  Dreams failed, so must their claim against the two principals of Sweet Dreams.  
  Nonetheless, I propose to discuss the liability of Halasi and Krauss on the 
  footing that Sweet Dreams was responsible for Burnac’s loss.  I do so because 
  the issue was fully argued before us and because I consider it relevant to the 
  question of costs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Halasi and Krauss put forward three reasons why they should not 
  have been held jointly and severally responsible for the damages Burnac and 
  642947 were ordered to pay Fleischer and Newton.  First, they submitted that 
  the trial judge erred in finding Sweet Dreams had insufficient assets to honour 
  its undertaking if called on to pay.  Second, they submitted that the adequacy 
  of Sweet Dreams’ assets should have been raised by 642947 and Burnac on the 
  injunction application.  And, third, they submitted that the trial judge erred 
  in piercing the corporate veil to hold them responsible.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found that, when its undertaking was given, Sweet 
  Dreams had no assets from which to pay damages.  Halasi and Krauss submitted 
  that this finding cannot be supported on the evidence.  I disagree.  Sweet Dreams 
  was used by Halasi and Krauss solely to hold their interest and their investors’ 
  interest in the property.  It had no other purpose.  It had no income other 
  than the rent it received on a sublease, a rent that was insufficient to pay 
  its own rent to Fleischer and Newton.  It had no assets other than the lease 
  itself.  Some evidence of the value of the lease, including the right of first 
  refusal, is found in the offer made by Halasi and Krauss to sell the Property 
  to Burnac for $50,000 more than the contract price.  Even if that figure is 
  not an accurate estimate of the lease’s value, the lease alone was inadequate 
  to protect 642947 and Burnac from any damages they may have sustained because 
  of the injunction.  Sweet Deams simply had no cash or liquid assets to honour 
  its undertaking.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Thus, the trial judge’s finding that Sweet Dreams did not have 
  sufficient assets to pay a damages award is amply supported by the evidence.  
  Indeed, Halasi admitted as much when cross-examined on his affidavit in support 
  of the injunction.  Hard cases may arise where the ability of a party to pay 
  damages for an injunction wrongly granted may not be obvious.  This is not one 
  of those cases.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even if Sweet Dreams did not have any assets to pay a damages 
  award, Halasi and Krauss contended that the adequacy of its assets should have 
  been raised by Burnac on the injunction application, and that Burnac cannot 
  after the fact extract what amounted to personal guarantees.  Halasi and Krauss 
  say that the adequacy of Sweet Dreams’ assets was relevant to the balance of 
  convenience.  If raised during the hearing, Sweet Dreams could have decided 
  whether to proceed with its injunction application and, if it did, the court 
  could have decided whether to require security or personal guarantees as a condition 
  of granting the injunction.  In substance, Halasi and Krauss’ submission puts 
  the onus on the party seeking the undertaking – here 642947 and Burnac – to 
  raise the adequacy of the assets of the party giving the undertaking.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not accept this submission.  I agree that on the injunction 
  application Burnac could have questioned the sufficiency of Sweet Dreams’ assets.  
  But Sweet Dreams itself had the primary obligation to disclose that its assets 
  were inadequate to satisfy its undertaking if called on to pay.  The undertaking 
  was not given to 642947 and Burnac.  It was given to the court.  By undertaking 
  to “abide by any Order concerning damages that the Court may make”, Sweet Dreams 
  implicitly represented that it had sufficient assets to honour that undertaking.  
  Both the court and Burnac were entitled to rely on that representation without 
  making inquiries into its accuracy.  If, as was the case here, Sweet Dreams 
  did not have sufficient assets to honour its undertaking, it had an obligation 
  to disclose that fact to the court.  Sweet Dreams could then have asked to be 
  relieved of its undertaking, or could have been asked to post security.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even so, Halasi and Krauss argued that the trial judge erred 
  in law in going behind Sweet Dreams to hold them personally liable.  In piercing 
  the corporate veil and imposing personal liability, the trial judge held that 
  Halasi and Krauss used Sweet Dreams as their alter ego and knew when the undertaking 
  was given that Sweet Dreams had no assets from which to pay damages.  She therefore 
  concluded, at p. 297, that “the undertaking was fraudulent and it was misconduct 
  on the part of Krauss and Halasi as officers of Sweet Dreams to offer it to 
  the Court.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Halasi and Krauss argued that the trial judge’s reasoning reflects 
  two errors:  Sweet Dreams was not their alter ego, indeed, they were not even 
  shareholders of Sweet Dreams; and the corporate veil should not have been pierced 
  because Halasi and Krauss incorporated Sweet Dreams for a valid purpose – to 
  hold property – and did not use the company as a sham to perpetrate a fraud.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first argument is specious.  Halasi and Krauss, through companies 
  they owned or controlled, each held 40% of the shares of Sweet Dreams.  They 
  described themselves as “partners” in trying to assemble land in the North York 
  corridor.  Whatever the legal form, they controlled Sweet Dreams and the interest 
  it held in the property.  The trial judge’s finding that “Sweet Dreams was merely 
  the alter ego of both Halasi and Krauss” was open to her on this evidence and 
  I would not interfere with it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Halasi and Krauss’ second argument is that the trial judge disregarded 
  well-known principles of corporate law in holding them personally liable.  In 
  my opinion, however, the trial judge took the correct view in concluding that 
  “Krauss and Halasi cannot hide behind the corporate veil.”  To pierce the corporate 
  veil is to disregard the separate legal personality of a corporation, a fundamental 
  principle of corporate law recognized in <i>Salomon v. Salomon &amp; Co.</i>, 
  [1897] A.C. 22.  Only exceptional cases – cases where applying the <i>Salomon</i> 
  principle would be “flagrantly” unjust – warrant going behind the company and 
  imposing personal liability.  Thus, in <i>Clarkson Co. Ltd. v. Zhelka et al</i>., 
  [1967] 2 O.R. 565 at 578 (H.C.J.), Thompson J. held that instances in which 
  the corporate veil has been pierced “represent refusals to apply the logic of 
  the <i>Salomon</i> case where it would be flagrantly opposed to justice.”  Similarly, 
  Wilson J. observed in <i>Kosmopoulos v. Constitution Insurance Co.</i>, [1987] 
  1 S.C.R. 2 at 10, that the law on when the corporate veil can be pierced “follows 
  no consistent principle.  The best that can be said is that the ‘separate entities’ 
  principle is not enforced when it would yield a result ‘too flagrantly opposed 
  to justice, convenience or the intersts of the Revenue’: L.C.B. Gower, <i>Modern 
  Company Law</i> (4th ed. 1979) at p. 112.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Typically, the corporate veil is pierced when the company is 
  incorporated for an illegal, fraudulent or improper purpose.  But it can also 
  be pierced if when incorporated “those in control expressly direct a wrongful 
  thing to be done”.  <i>Clarkson v. Zhelka</i> at 578.  Sharpe J. set out a useful 
  statement of the guiding principle in <i>Transamerica Life Insurance Co. of 
  Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</i> (1986), 28 O.R. (3d) 423 at 433-34 (Ont. 
  Ct. (Gen. Div.)), aff’d [1997] O.J. No. 3754 (C.A.): “the courts will disregard 
  the separate legal personality of a corporate entity where it is completely 
  dominated and controlled and being used as a shield for fraudulent or improper 
  conduct.”</p>

  </span></span> These authorities indicate that the decision to pierce the corporate 
  veil will depend on the context.  They also indicate that the separate legal 
  personality of the corporation cannot be lightly set aside. Yet, however restrictive 
  corporate law principles for piercing the corporate veil may be, in the context 
  of an undertaking to the court, the trial judge’s findings support going behind 
  Sweet Dreams and imposing personal liability.  </p>

  </span></span> She found that Sweet Dreams had no assets to honour its undertaking, 
  that Halasi and Krauss controlled Sweet Dreams and that when Halasi and Krauss 
  tendered the undertaking for Sweet Dreams they knew it had no assets. All of 
  these findings are reasonably supported by the evidence.  Moreover, Halasi was 
  a sophisticated developer and Krauss was a lawyer.  They tendered an undertaking 
  to the court, which they knew was worthless, to gain an advantage.  When called 
  on to honour the undertaking, they tried to hide behind a shell company, which 
  they controlled, to escape liability.  In the words of Sharpe J. in <i>Transamerica 
  Life</i>, Sweet Dreams was “completely dominated and controlled” by Halasi and 
  Krauss, and used by them “as a shield for…improper conduct.”  The trial judge 
  put it this way, in a passage that I endorse:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> Undertakings cannot be lightly given to the Court to selfishly protect 
      the self-interest of the parties giving the undertaking.  It would be a 
      mockery of injunction proceedings if that were so.  It would effectively 
      mean that worthless hollow undertakings could be given to the Court, leaving 
      the Court powerless to grant effective sanctions by way of damages which, 
      in the final analysis, could never be collected by the injured party.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>Had I upheld the trial judge’s finding that Sweet Dreams 
  was liable on its undertaking, I would have also upheld her finding that Halasi 
  and Krauss were liable.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> But as I said at the outset of this discussion, Halasi and Krauss 
  could be held liable only if Sweet Dreams were liable.  Because Burnac and 642947 
  could not show a causal connection between the injunction and the damages they 
  suffered, they cannot look to Sweet Dreams and therefore to Halasi and Krauss 
  for indemnification.  I would therefore allow the appeal by Sweet Dreams, Halasi 
  and Krauss and dismiss the third party claim against them.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would, however, deprive them of their costs both at trial and 
  on appeal.  The trial judge took a dim view of their conduct and so do I.  Indeed, 
  in the dispute between 642947 and Burnac on the one side, and Sweet Dreams, 
  Halasi and Krauss on the other, neither occupies the moral high ground.  642947 
  and Burnac refused to honour their bargain; Sweet Dreams, Halasi and Krauss 
  exercised a right – the right of first refusal – that was spent after the first 
  agreement in order to obtain the injunction.  At the hearing of the injunction, 
  they told the motions judge that they were willing to buy the Property for $2,000,000.  
  Then they too abandoned the Property and the injunction when the market fell.  
  Burnac and 642947 must bear full responsibility for the vendors’ loss.  Although 
  Sweet Dreams, Halasi and Krauss have been successful, because of their conduct 
  I would not award them any costs.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>IV.       Disposition</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For the reasons I have given, I would dismiss both the appeal 
  by Burnac and 642947 and the cross-appeal by Fleischer and Newton with costs.  
  I would allow the appeal by Sweet Dreams, Halasi and Krauss without costs.  
  I would therefore set aside paragraphs 5 and 6 of the judgment of Greer J. and 
  in their place would order that the claim of 642947 and Burnac against Sweet 
  Dreams, Halasi and Krauss be dismissed but without costs. I am grateful to all 
  counsel for their assistance on these appeals.</p>
