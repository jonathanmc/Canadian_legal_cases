  </span></span> The appellant, the Upper Grand District School Board (“School 
  Board”), appeals the decision of the Divisional Court dated October 5, 2000, 
  allowing the appeal of the respondents, 747926 Ontario Limited and The Realty 
  Group Corporation (“Claimants”), and awarding their claim for lost developer’s 
  profit together with interest on that award.   Further, the School Board appeals 
  the dismissal of its cross-appeal with respect to the determination of market 
  value by the Ontario Municipal Board (“OMB”) based on a method that it submits 
  had no application in fact and law to the Claimants’ property.</p>

  </span></span> The appeal arises out of the expropriation by the School Board 
  of a 7.86 acre parcel of land for a school site from the Claimants.   The Claimants 
  are developers and had purchased land in January 1988 for purposes of developing 
  a residential subdivision.  The OMB conducted a hearing to determine the amount 
  of compensation owing to the Claimants under the <i>Expropriations Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. E.26 (“<i>Act</i>”) and held that the Claimants were entitled 
  to $2,478,000.00 as compensation for the expropriation.</p>

  was $437,000.00.  The Divisional Court allowed this appeal and ordered compensation 
  for lost developer’s profit in the amount agreed upon and awarded interest on 
  this award. The School Board cross-appealed on the basis that ss.14(3) of the

lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The OMB, in its reasons for judgment, first assessed the market 
  value of the expropriated land pursuant to ss. 13(2)(a) of the <i>Act</i>. Preliminary 
  to its market valuation analysis, the OMB determined the number of lots that 
  the Claimants could have developed but for the expropriation. The OMB observed 
  that the planners for the Claimants and the School Board each adopted a similar 
  planning analysis of mapping out hypothetical lot patterns in order to determine 
  the number of lost lots. However, each planner used a different land base, with 
  the result that each arrived at a different number of lost lots.  The Claimants’ 
  planner mapped out hypothetical lots on the larger piece of land from which 
  the School Board carved out the school site and then subtracted the number of 
  lots remaining after expropriation. She concluded, based on this calculation, 
  that there were eighty lost lots. In contrast, the School Board’s planner mapped 
  out how many lots the school site alone could have yielded. He concluded that 
  there were sixty-four lost lots. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The OMB held that it must ignore the expropriation in order to 
  arrive at a market value and that this requires determining the most efficient 
  and realistic lot pattern that could have existed if the school site was integrated 
  with the rest of the development.  The OMB found that the number of lost lots 
  was seventy-six. In making this finding, the OMB adopted the Claimants’ calculation 
  of the number of lost lots with one small correction that is not important for 
  purposes of this appeal. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The OMB then continued with its analysis of the market value 
  of the expropriated land. It observed that there was agreement that a “cost 
  of development” approach was appropriate for this valuation. The first stage 
  of the cost of development approach involves identifying the gross retail value 
  of similar but already subdivided and serviced lots. The expert witnesses called 
  by the parties presented different comparables to establish gross retail values. 
  The second stage of the cost of development approach involves deducting the 
  estimated servicing and other costs included in the gross retail values that 
  would not yet have been incurred in relation to the expropriated land.  The 
  expert witnesses for both parties agreed that lost developer’s profit is to 
  be deducted at the second stage of the cost of development approach. However, 
  the expert witnesses differed significantly in their opinions about the total 
  amount of the development costs; in part because the Claimants’ expert used 
  a “before and after” methodology to determine total development costs whereas 
  the School Board’s witness did not. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The OMB accepted the Claimants’ evidence regarding the appropriate 
  comparables to establish gross retail values and regarding the total development 
  costs to be deducted from the gross retail values. Based on this evidence, subject 
  to the minor adjustment regarding the number of lost lots, the OMB concluded 
  that Claimants were entitled to $2,478,000.00 compensation for the market value 
  of the expropriated land.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The OMB next considered the claim for damages 
  for injurious affection under ss.13(2)(c) of the <i>Act</i>. The Claimants claimed 
  $39,000.00 that it alleged represented the loss in the value of the unexpropriated 
  property adjoining the school site. The OMB found that there was no strong evidence 
  that a school reduced the value of adjacent lots and denied this claim. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The OMB last considered the Claimants’ claim to recover, as disturbance 
  damages under ss. 13(2)(b) of the <i>Act</i>, the lost developer’s profit that 
  was deducted when calculating market value using the cost of development approach.  
  The OMB denied this claim, stating as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-GB>It is clear from textual and other evidence that the normal, conventional 
      and accepted practice among appraisers and valuators is to consider the 
      loss due to the taking of the land to be the value of the land only, to 
      which may be added injurious affection and disturbance damages. The texts 
      clearly indicate that, in arriving at the net loss to be compensated, developer’s 
      profit is considered akin to all the other foregone costs of production 
      and should be deducted to arrive at the net value. Both appraisers did this. 
      The appraiser for the [Claimants] calculated what he considered to be the 
      loss of profit and included it as an “additional loss”.<i></i></span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-GB>The Board agrees with what it regards as the conventional approach 
      to valuation and to compensation for loss of value. It is appropriate to 
      reduce the retail value of the land to arrive at its “raw value” by deducting 
      the profit that would have been made, since the land was not developed and 
      no profit is to be justifiably realised where no development has taken place. 
      The Board can see no convincing basis to restore anticipated profit on development 
      that does not take place, even if the fact that it does not take place is 
      the result of the taking. Nor is this a disturbance damage in the sense 
      in which it is used in the <i>Expropriations Act.</i></span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In oral reasons, now reported at 51 O.R. (3d)

  resolved by applying the general expropriation principles in <i>Dell Holdings</i>,<i> 
  supra</i>,<i> </i>and concluded that disturbance damages can include lost developer’s 
  profit. She pointed out that the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Dell Holdings</i> 
  cited with approval <i>LaFleche v. Ministry of Transportation and Communications</i> 
  (1975), 8 L.C.R 77 (Ont. Div. Ct.); which awarded disturbance damages based

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>MacFarland J. noted that the Claimants’ lands 
  were at a stage of imminent development at the time of the expropriation; and 
  that there was a strong market for subdivision lots in the area so that a sell-out 
  of the Claimants’ lots was virtually guaranteed. She ordered the School Board 
  to compensate for lost developer’s profit; stating as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In order to </span><span
lang=EN-GB>fully and fairly compensate the owner on the facts of this case, the 
      profit, which was a virtual certainty, had to be brought back into the equation 
      as disturbance damages. To do otherwise would be to unfairly deprive the 
      land developer of the money he would have had but for the expropriation.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Claimants rely upon the following language 
  of Cory J. in his interpretation of provisions of the <i>Act</i> dealing with 
  disturbance at p.47:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The words of the section should be given their natural 
      and ordinary meaning in the context of the clear purpose of the legislation 
      to provide fair indemnity to the expropriated owner for losses suffered

lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Claimants’ problem is that there is no evidence in this case 
  that the Claimants suffered actual damage as a result of the expropriation. 
  They had asserted that the unexpropriated land suffered damage by way of injurious 
  affection but the OMB rejected this on a factual basis.  I can conceive that 
  in a proper case, an expropriation might reduce the profitability of the lots 
  developed from the unexpropriated lands to a figure that is less per lot than 
  would have been available if such developed lots were part of the larger pre-expropriation 
  holding, but that is not what is being put forward here. Further, unlike the 
  claimant in <i>Dell Holdings</i>, the Claimants are not seeking compensation 
  for business losses that arose before expropriation. Rather, the lost developer’s 
  profit claimed is the prospective profit that the Claimants anticipate they 
  would have received sometime after the valuation date upon the sale of the expropriated 
  lands. Having failed, properly in my view, to obtain compensation for the loss 
  of a prospective profit on the expropriated segment of the intended development, 
  the Claimants attempted to recover this same prospective profit under the guise 
  of disturbance damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This argument by the Claimants illustrates the confusion that 
  inevitably seems to arise when parties rely on a cost of development approach 
  to establish market value.  Subsection 13(2)(a) of the <i>Act</i> is clear that 
  the compensation payable to the owner for a compulsory taking shall be the market 
  value of the land. Absent any application of ss. (b) “damages attributable to 
  disturbance”, (c) “damages for injurious affection”, and (d) “any special difficulties 
  in relocation”, this is the entire compensation package. Market value does not 
  include damages.  It is defined in ss.14(1) as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The market value of land expropriated is the amount that 
      the land might be expected to realize if sold in the open market by a willing 
      seller to a willing buyer.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This definition makes no reference to any concept of profit because 
  the market adjusts for the potential of the land for future development.  A 
  willing seller does not refuse to sell unless he gets the profit he anticipates 
  will result when the land is subdivided into serviced lots. Rather, a willing 
  seller takes what the market in the form of a willing buyer is prepared to pay.  
  Where the seller has expended time and money to bring the land close to development 
  by obtaining the required changes in zoning and by obtaining the necessary approvals 
  for the installation of services, the market value of the land has been enhanced 
  because the buyer will recognise that much of the work required of a developer 
  to exploit the land for its residential potential has already been done.  The 
  market pays more for land that is close to subdivision.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The parties appear to have agreed that establishing 
  market value in this case through a direct comparison approach was difficult 
  given the lack of suitable comparables for residential development land. The 
  Claimants' appraiser used the cost of development approach to establish the 
  market value of the expropriated land. The School Board's appraiser used a combination 
  of the cost of development approach and the direct comparison approach. However, 
  the School Board's appraiser made the following cautionary remarks regarding 
  the market value estimates derived from the direct comparison approach: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In the appraisal of residential development land, there 
      are usually few sales that are truly comparable in terms of development 
      timing, stage of completion, and exhibiting similar external market characteristics.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The estimate derived from the Direct Comparison Approach 
      was weakened by the lack of truly comparable land sales.</span></p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the cost of development approach is an unsatisfactory 
  means to determine market value. However, it is not prohibited by the <i>Act.  
  </i> Further, I do not think that my opinion as to the proper approach to determining 
  market value justifies putting the parties to the expense of sending the matter 
  back to the OMB for a new hearing.  The expertise of the OMB merits deference 
  in the market valuation process. The OMB accepted the cost of development approach 
  by considering it and preferring the market valuation of the Claimants' appraiser. 
  I can only take from this that the OMB was not satisfied with the testimony 
  of the School Board’s appraiser who relied on a combination of the cost of development 
  approach and the direct comparison approach. I accept that the OMB was satisfied 
  that it had arrived at the market value of the subject site after removing the 
  developer’s profit in the calculation put forward by the Claimants.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> From the reasons I have developed above, it follows that the 
  Divisional Court was in error in adding the lost developer’s profit back into 
  the compensation award as disturbance damages.  The Court below seemed to approach 
  this case as if it was presented with a personal injury matter, where the injured 
  party is entitled to be made as whole as a money judgment can achieve. The Divisional 
  Court circumvented the statutory framework of compensation set out in the <i>Act 
  </i>by extracting lost developer’s profit from a methodology directed to the 
  market valuation of expropriated land and characterising this lost developer’s 
  profit as disturbance damages. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Disturbance damages are not intended to supplement the market 
  value that ss.14(1) of the <i>Act</i> prescribes: they are directed to damages 
  that are a consequence of the expropriation and are not addressed by the compensation 
  for market value as described in ss.14(1).  Relocation expense is a classic 
  example of disturbance damages.  Business disruption is another: see <i>Blatchford 
  Feeds Ltd. v. Board of Education for the City of Toronto</i> (1974), 6 L.C.R. 
  355 (Ont. L.C.B.) and <i>LaFleche v. Ministry of Transportation and Communications, 
  supra. </i>If the loss of land means the loss of a business operated on the 
  land, even a farming business, the expropriating authority may well be obliged 
  to pay damages for the loss of the business.  But these Claimants were not operating 
  a farm; they were in the process of converting farmland into residential housing.  
  They may have been operating, as they maintain, a business. But it was a development 
  business and even looking at it from this perspective, the Claimants were not 
  put out of business. They lost inventory.  More realistically, the Claimants’ 
  development project was reduced in size by the loss of the school site.  By 
  receiving the market value of the school site, the Claimants could replace their 
  lost inventory by purchasing land elsewhere at market value.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Complainants called as an expert Professor Lawrence B. Smith, 
  a professor of economics at the University of Toronto with extensive practical 
  experience in real estate development, to give evidence about developer’s profit.  
  Dr. Smith described developer’s profit as the return for a developer’s entrepreneurial 
  talent and risk-taking. He argued that a developer’s expected profit that is 
  not realised because of expropriation must be included in the expropriation 
  compensation paid to a developer if the developer is to be made whole.  Stressing 
  this testimony, the Complainants sought to employ the purposive language of 
  <i>Dell Holdings</i>,<i> supra</i>, to argue that the loss of developer’s profit 
  in certain cases is a natural and reasonable consequence of the expropriation, 
  and therefore compensable as disturbance damages under ss. 13(2)(b) of the <i>Act</i>.  
  In my view, while there is no denying Professor Smith’s qualifications, to the 
  extent that his economic theory is used to advocate a method of compensation 
  for compulsory taking that is not authorised by the <i>Act</i>, it is not admissible 
  in evidence.</p>

  </span></span> The School Board also appeals from the Divisional Court’s dismissal 
  of its cross- appeal relating to ss. 14(3) of the <i>Act</i>.  The School Board 
  submits that the OMB erred in accepting the Claimants' use of the before and 
  after methodology to calculate the number of lost lots and the market value 
  of the expropriated land. The Claimants submit that the before and after methodology 
  is what is described in ss. 14(3) of the <i>Act:</i><b></b></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Where only part of the land of an owner is taken and such 
      part is of a size, shape or nature for which there is no general demand 
      or market, the market value and the injurious affection caused by the taking 
      may be determined by determining the market value of the whole of the owner’s 
      land and deducting therefrom the market value of the owner’s land after 
      the taking.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have some difficulty with this issue. I agree with the School 
  Board that ss.14(3) is not of general application. This provision is directed 
  to the taking of strips of land for road widening or easements for public utilities 
  across large tracts of land.  In those circumstances the property expropriated 
  has no sale value or, in some cases, no value whatsoever except to the expropriating 
  authority.  Subsection 14(3) of the <i>Act</i> has no application to a 7.86 
  acre parcel of land that may be viewed as a stand alone subdivision the taking 
  of which, in the contention of the Claimants, deprived them of a developer’s 
  profit of $437,000.00. That being said, the Claimants' appraiser did not regard 
  this section as the only authority for the use of a before and after methodology. 
  Subsection 14(3) was put briefly to the Claimants' appraiser in cross-examination. 
  But the transcript excerpt that was filed on this appeal as well as the appraisal 
  report makes it clear that the Claimants' appraiser relied on the before and 
  after methodology because the direct comparison approach couldn't be used and 
  because, in his opinion, the before and after methodology best screened out 
  the expropriation from the valuation process. . The OMB accepted this methodology 
  for similar reasons. In my view, ss. 14(3) is simply one permitted use of the 
  before and after methodology.  I would leave to another time any discussion 
  as to when a before and after approach is appropriate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Having determined that there is no basis for the Divisional Court’s 
  award of lost developer’s profit as disturbance damages, the question of interest 
  on the award is moot.  However, since it appears to be a matter of some controversy, 
  I would hold that there is no authority in the <i>Act</i> for interest on disturbance 
  damages.  Subsection  33(1) of the <i>Act</i> provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Subject to subsection 25(4), the owner of lands expropriated 
      is entitled to be paid interest on the portion of the market value of the 
      owner’s interest in the land and on the portion of any allowance for injurious 
      affection to which the owner is entitled, outstanding from time to time, 
      at the rate of 6 per cent a year calculated from the date the owner ceases 
      to reside on or make productive use of the lands.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, there is no authority under the <i>Act</i> to award interest 
  on disturbance damages: see <i>Van den Elzen</i> v. <i>Ministry of Transportation

  as follows:  (a) the Divisional Court erred in finding that a loss of developer’s 
  profit is compensable as disturbance damages under the <i>Act</i>; (b) the Divisional 
  Court erred in concluding that <i>Dell Holdings, supra, </i>resolves this matter; 
  (c) the OMB did not err in relation to ss. 14(3) of the <i>Act</i>; and (d)
