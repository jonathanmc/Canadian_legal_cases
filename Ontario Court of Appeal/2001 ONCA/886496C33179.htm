<p class=headingtitle>OVERVIEW</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This appeal arises out of a dispute over the final purchase price of 
  shares in United Pumps of Canada Limited.  On July 17, 1990 the respondent, 
  886496 Ontario Inc. (“the purchaser”), agreed to purchase all of the shares 
  of United Pumps of Canada Limited (Pumps).  Pumps is now known CPC Pumps International 
  Inc.  Pumps manufactures centrifugal pumps, primarily for the oil and gas industries.  
  The vendor was Quorum Industries Inc., now known as YCI Holdings Inc. (YCI).  
  The appellant, John Yarnell, through holding companies, controlled Quorum.  
  I will refer to Quorum (and YCI) as the vendor.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The share purchase and sale agreement (the agreement) provided that 
  the purchase price would be Pumps’ shareholders equity, less the book value 
  of the goodwill, in accordance with Pumps’ May 31, 1990 financial statements.  
  This was referred to in the agreement as the “estimated purchase price”.  The 
  agreement also provided a means to determine Pumps’ shareholders’ equity as 
  of the date of closing, July 19, 1990.  This was referred to in the agreement 
  as the “final purchase price”.  The final purchase price was to be based on 
  Pumps’ July 19, 1990 (date of closing) financial statements.  Thus, under the 
  agreement, in order to establish the estimated and final purchase prices, the 
  vendor and the purchaser were required to determine the value of Pumps’ assets 
  and liabilities as of May 31, 1990 and July 19, 1990.  As the deal unfolded, 
  the value of Pumps’ inventory became the central area of dispute for purposes 
  of establishing the final purchase price. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The value of Pumps’ inventory was also the central issue around which 
  the purchaser’s damages for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation 
  were found by the trial judge.  In normal circumstances, one might expect the 
  purchaser to pay the vendor for Pumps’ shares since Pumps was an operating company 
  which usually generated a profit.  However, after a 12-day trial without a jury, 
  the trial judge found that Pumps’ inventory was overvalued.  He concluded that 
  Pumps’ shareholder’s equity, net of goodwill, was zero and that the purchaser 
  should pay nothing to buy Pumps shares.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In determining what the final purchase price should have been, the trial 
  judge concluded that Pumps’ inventory, valued at $1,654,356 for purposes of 
  calculating the estimated purchase price for Pumps’ shares, was overvalued by 
  $527,159.  He thus reduced the purchase price by $527,159.  In the end, based 
  on a calculation I will review later in these reasons, the trial judge found 
  that not only should the purchaser pay nothing for the shares, but that the 
  vendor should pay the purchaser $19,258 to buy the vendor’s shares.  He tempered 
  that finding by concluding that the vendor should simply repay the purchaser 
  what it had paid for Pumps’ shares on closing.  That meant that the vendor got, 
  and the purchaser paid, nothing for the shares.  The vendor and its principals 
  contend that this was not what they had in mind when they agreed to sell Pumps’ 
  shares.  They also contend that the result does not accord with the provisions 
  of the agreement.</p>

<p class=headingtitle>The Agreement</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On July 17, 1990 the vendor, the purchaser and Pumps signed a share 
  purchase and sale agreement.  Article 2.01 of the agreement provided that on 
  July 19, 1990, the stipulated closing date, the purchaser would buy and the 
  vendor would sell all of Pumps’ shares for a price equal to Pumps’ shareholders’ 
  equity, less goodwill, based on Pumps’ financial statements for the financial 
  period February 1, 1990 to the date of closing, July 19, 1990.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By Article 2.01(1)(b) of the agreement, the purchaser agreed to provide 
  an “earn-out promissory note” payable to the vendor.  Under that note, the purchaser 
  became potentially liable to the vendor to a maximum of $300,000 based on a 
  stipulated percentage of Pumps’ collected invoices in excess of $3,000,000 in 
  each of the five years following the closing of the agreement.  The specific 
  terms of the earn-out promissory note are set out in Article 2.01(1)(b) of the 
  agreement.  The purchaser acknowledges that Pumps’ collected invoices in the 
  relevant time frame triggered its liability to pay the vendor the maximum $300,000 
  on the earn-out promissory note.  This was the subject matter of the vendor’s 
  counterclaim.  The purchaser did not pay on the earn-out promissory note because 
  of its dispute with the vendor concerning the appropriate final purchase price.</p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> (a)   The estimated purchase price</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Since Pumps’ July 19, 1990 financial statements were not available at 
  closing, the agreement provided for an “estimated” purchase price.  It was based 
  on Pumps’ May 31, 1990 balance sheet which was prepared by Robert Yarnell, the 
  respondent John Yarnell’s son.  The calculation of the estimated purchase price, 
  that is, the purchase price payable on closing, was provided for in Article 
  2.02 of the agreement.  Article 2.02(2) provided that the calculation was to 
  be based on Pumps’ May 31 interim financial statement: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>2.02(2)  The estimated purchase price payable under s. 2.02 shall be based 
      on the interim financial statement of the corporation as at May 31, 1990, 
      with such adjustments as shall be agreed upon by the Vendor and Purchaser, 
      acting reasonably, at the Closing Date, as a result of the inventory count 
      referred to in subsection 2.04(1).  The outstanding balance to be evidenced 
      by the Purchase Promissory Note pursuant to paragraph 2.02(1)(c) shall be 
      estimated by the Vendor and Purchaser, acting reasonably, at the Closing 
      Date and shall be amended or cancelled immediately following the completion 
      of the Acquisition Review.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Read together, Articles 2.02(2) and 2.02(1)(c) provide that any excess 
  over $500,000 was to be accounted for by a purchase promissory note:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>2.02(1)(c) a non-assignable promissory note of the Purchaser in an amount 
      equal to the Corporation’s Shareholder Equity, less the book value of goodwill, 
      less the sum of FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ($500,000.00) DOLLARS (the said promissory 
      note being referred to hereafter as the “Purchase Promissory Note”).  The 
      outstanding balance of the Purchase Promissory Note shall bear interest 
      at the prime lending rate of The Royal Bank of Canada as determined from 
      time to time plus one (1%) per cent per annum.  The principal shall be repayable 
      in three equal annual instalments, with the first payment commencing one 
      year following the Closing Date.  Interest shall be calculated and payable 
      semi-annually, using the average of the said prime lending rate over the 
      previous six months for the said interest calculations.  The Purchaser shall 
      have the right to pay all or part of the principal outstanding from time 
      to time without notice or bonus;</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The purchase promissory note was to be amended or cancelled following 
  the purchaser’s receipt of Pumps’ July 19, 1990 change of control (date of closing) 
  financial statements and completion of what the agreement referred to as the 
  Acquisition Review.  I will refer to the Acquisition Review when I deal with 
  the final purchase price.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Just as Articles 2.02(2) and 2.02(1)(c) of the agreement provided for 
  a purchase price greater than $500,000, Article 2.02(3) of the agreement provided 
  for a purchase price less than $500,000:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>2.02(3)  To the extent that the Corporation’s Shareholders’ Equity less 
      the book value of goodwill is less than FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ($500,000) 
      DOLLLARS, then the Vendor shall repay the difference to the Purchaser, together 
      with interest at The Royal Bank of Canada’s prime lending rate as determined, 
      from time to time, plus one (1%) per cent, not to exceed seventeen (17%) 
      per cent per annum.  Payment of the same shall be immediately due and payable 
      upon the determination of the same.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Clearly, Article 2.02(3) of the agreement required the vendor to repay 
  part of the estimated purchase price if Pumps’ shareholders’ equity, net of 
  goodwill, was less than $500,000.  I very much doubt that the purchaser’s principals 
  fully understood the implications of this part of the agreement.</p>

      Note provided for in paragraph 2.02(1)(c) shall be amended to reflect the

  </span> According to Article 4.02(6), the vendor was required to prepare change 
  of control financial statements to reflect Pumps’ financial position as at July 
  19, 1990, the date of closing.  The vendor agreed to provide the change of control 
  financial statements within 45 days of the closing date, that is, by September 
  3, 1990.  The change of control financial statements were to be reviewed by 
  the purchaser’s accountants as part of the Acquisition Review which was intended 
  to determine the final purchase price.  If the accountants for the purchaser 
  and the vendor agreed on the final purchase price, the purchase promissory note 
  was to be amended or cancelled, depending on whether the final purchase price 
  was more or less than $500,000.  If no agreement could be reached, the agreement 
  provided that the issue of the final purchase price was to be arbitrated.  </p>

  </span> The Acquisition Review was defined in the agreement to mean the purchaser’s 
  due diligence review by its accountants, Cooper &amp; Lybrand.  The review was 
  to be paid for by the purchaser, as was the cost of taking inventory.  It was 
  to be completed within 30 days of the purchaser’s receipt of the change of control 
  financial statements, which, as I have said, were to be provided within 45 days 
  of the closing date.  Thus, the Acquisition Review was to be completed by early 
  October 1990, at the latest.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span> As it turned out, the inventory count contemplated by Article 2.04 took 
  place on July 14, 1990, not on July 17 and 18, 1990.  On July 14<sup>th</sup>, 
  the purchaser determined what Pumps’ saleable inventory was (Article 2.04(a)) 
  and took a physical count of the saleable inventory (Article 2.04(b)).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Financial Statements referred to in Article 2.04(b) were defined 
  in the agreement to mean Pumps’ audited January 31, 1990 financial statements.  
  Article 2.04(b) contemplated that the purchaser and its accountants, in the 
  presence of the vendor’s representatives, would determine and count Pumps’ saleable 
  inventory and that the inventory be priced in a manner consistent with Pumps’ 
  audited January 31<sup>st</sup> financial statements.  Article 2.04(b) is not 
  clear as to when the purchaser would value Pumps’ saleable inventory.  As I 
  will explain later in these reasons, by their conduct both the vendor and purchaser 
  seem to have proceeded on the premise that the agreement required the purchaser 
  to determine and count Pumps’ saleable inventory <u>before</u> closing, but 
  establish the value of the saleable inventory <u>after</u> closing.  Thus, the 
  purchaser did not attempt to value or price the inventory on July 14, 1990.  
  It did that after closing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Pumps’ January 31, 1990 audited financial statements are significant 
  because the agreement provided that the financial statements on which the estimated 
  and final purchase prices were to be prepared in accordance with “generally 
  accepted accounting principles on a basis consistent with the audited financial 
  statements as at January 31, 1990”.  Thus, Pumps’ January 31<sup>st</sup> audited 
  financial statements were something of a model.  </p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> (d)   The Closing</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The deal closed on July 19, 1990.  At that time, the principals of the 
  purchaser and the vendor, and their solicitors, met in the purchaser’s solicitors’ 
  office.  The purchase price for the purpose of the July 19<sup>th</sup> closing, 
  as I have said, was to be based upon Pumps’ unaudited May 31, 1990 financial 
  statements.  Those statements showed total assets of $2,784.514, goodwill of 
  $136,152 and total liabilities of $2,042,984.  The difference between Pumps’ 
  total assets, less goodwill, and its total liabilities was $605,378.  This became 
  the estimated purchase price for purposes of closing the deal on July 19, 1990.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Going into the closing, the purchaser had expressed concern about the 
  value of Pumps’ inventory.  On July 17, 1990, two days before closing, the purchaser’s 
  solicitors wrote to the vendor’s solicitors on a number of subjects.  One of 
  them was the saleable inventory which had been counted, but not valued, on July 
  14, 1990.  The letter stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Further, upon a review by our client on the weekend of the inventory, 
      it appears to fall far short of the amount previously set out in the audited 
      financial statements.  Accordingly, our client is reasonably requesting 
      that $100,000 of the amount due and payable on the closing date be held 
      in escrow [sic] pending the completion of the acquisition review.  Following 
      the same, the purchase money shall be dispersed to the vendor or purchaser 
      following the correct determination of the corporation’s shareholders’ equity, 
      less goodwill, as at the closing date.  </p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The purchaser’s concern about the value of Pumps’ inventory was raised 
  again at the closing.  Although the evidence is not entirely clear as to precisely 
  what happened at this time, it would appear that one of the parties, presumably 
  the purchaser, threatened to walk away from the deal.  In the result, Yarnell 
  and Blumentrath, representatives of the vendor and purchaser respectively, left 
  the room to see if they could resolve the purchaser’s concerns about the value 
  of Pumps’ inventory.  What happened at their meeting requires brief reference 
  to their evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Yarnell said that at the time of closing, the issue of saleable inventory 
  was raised in the context of the purchaser’s conclusion that Pumps’ saleable 
  inventory was overvalued by approximately $100,000 because that much of it was 
  obsolete.  Yarnell went on to testify:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>There was considerable discussion on the matter and we didn’t seem to be 
      making any effective resolution and I asked Mr. Blumentrath to step out 
      of the meeting room with me and we went to an adjoining room, and in our 
      discussions agreed to resolve these issues by the vendors doing two things, 
      agreeing to the purchase promissory note which premised on the May 31 statements 
      would have had a face value of approximately $100,000 to $105,000, that 
      it would be nil.  And secondly, Quorum Industries supported by my personal 
      guarantee would support a further $100,000 of questionable saleable inventory.</p>
    <p>Q. So on the basis of these two items was there an agreement to proceed 
      to closing?</p>
    <p>A. Yes.  In my judgment, inventory matters had been dealt with in the negotiations 
      that took place at closing.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his evidence, Blumentrath did not comment specifically on the closing 
  arrangements which led to the cancellation of the $105,378 purchase promissory 
  note and the delivery to the purchaser of Yarnell’s $100,000 personal guarantee.  
  Blumentrath recognized that inventory was the largest component of Pumps’ assets.  
  He knew that after closing “… there would be a plus or minus on the selling 
  price based on the inventory”.  He clearly assumed that the purchaser would 
  value Pumps’ inventory after closing.  In his examination-in-chief he was not 
  asked about the specific arrangements, which were later referred to in Yarnell’s 
  evidence, made at the closing.  In his cross-examination, Blumentrath was not 
  asked about the closing arrangements he made with Yarnell.  He did not give 
  evidence in reply.  Thus, Blumentrath’s evidence does not deal directly with 
  Yarnell’s evidence that at the closing he and Blumentrath made a side deal, 
  as representatives of the vendor and purchaser, the effect of which was to resolve 
  the inventory issue once and for all.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Whatever the scope of the Yarnell-Blumentrath arrangements was, it is 
  clear from their evidence that at the time of closing, the purchase promissory 
  note of $105,378 was cancelled and Yarnell provided his personal guarantee of 
  $100,000.  Neither the cancellation of the purchase promissory note at closing, 
  nor the provision of Yarnell’s $100,000 guarantee, was contemplated by the agreement.  
  Specifically, the agreement said nothing about a guarantee to be provided by 
  anyone, including Yarnell.  Further, although the agreement provided for the 
  amendment or cancellation of the purchase promissory note, those steps were 
  to be taken, if at all, after the vendor provided Pumps’ July 19, 1990 financial 
  statements (the change of control financial statements) and after the purchaser 
  completed its Acquisition Review.  While there is much that is unclear about 
  the closing arrangements in respect of the purchase promissory note and Yarnell’s 
  guarantee, it is clear that at the very least, the purchase promissory note 
  was cancelled and Yarnell provided his guarantee because of the purchaser’s 
  concerns about the value of Pumps’ inventory.  Indeed, once the purchaser secured 
  the cancellation of the purchase promissory note and acquired Yarnell’s personal 
  guarantee for $100,000, the deal closed.</p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> (e)   Representations and Warranties</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The agreement contained a number of representations and warranties. 
   I see no need to review them in any detail.  It will suffice to note that the 
  purchaser relies on two of the vendor’s representations.  First, that Pumps 
  kept its books and records in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
  principles;  and second, that Pumps did not withhold any material information 
  in its possession pertaining to Pumps’ assets (including inventory), liabilities, 
  business and operations.  Article 3.02 of the agreement provided that all of 
  the vendor’s representations and warranties would survive the completion of 
  the sale.  Article 4.02(3) provided that the vendor indemnify and save harmless 
  the purchaser from and against all losses, damages or expenses sustained by 
  the purchaser resulting from any breach of any covenant of the vendor.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the trial, the purchaser led evidence and submitted that Pumps’ January 
  31, 1990 financial statements were not prepared in accordance with generally 
  accepted accounting principles.  The trial judge found that the inventory as 
  set out in the vendor’s audited January 31, 1990 financial statements was “consistently 
  misstated in the subsequent statements of May and July of 1990”.  He concluded 
  that the auditors, Deloitte, Touche, relied too heavily on representations made 
  by the vendor with respect to the inventory, particularly in respect of the 
  labour component (the hours spent) of the vendor’s work in process.  In the 
  end, he agreed with the purchaser and concluded that Pumps’ January 31, 1990 
  financial statement was not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
  principles.  Since Pumps’ financial statements of May 31, 1990 and July 19, 
  1990 were consistent with its January 31, 1990 financial statement, it followed 
  that the May and July financial statements were also not prepared in accordance 
  with generally accepted accounting principles.</p>

  </span> Robert Yarnell did not complete the change of control of financial statements 
  until January 1991, that is about four months after the vendor should have provided 
  them in accordance with the agreement.  By January 1991, the purchaser had written 
  down Pumps’ inventory by $897,957.  The acquisition review contemplated by the 
  agreement was never undertaken because the change of control financial statements 
  were not delivered until January and because the purchaser had already determined 
  that the inventory had been grossly overvalued.  As the acquisition review was 
  not undertaken, the parties did not resort to the arbitration provisions of 
  the agreement.<a href="#_ftn2"

<p class=headingtitle>Analysis</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I begin with the standard of appellate review.  An appellate court will 
  not interfere with the trial judge’s findings of fact unless the trial judge 
  committed a clear and material error in his appreciation of the evidence.  See 
  <i>Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills (Town)</i> (1997), 35 O.R. 
  (3d) 321 and <i>Toneguzzo-Norwell Burnaby Hospital</i>, <a
name="_Hlt518105281"></a>[1994] 1 S.C.R. 114.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The agreement is clear that the final purchase price could be more or 
  less than the estimated purchase price, that is more or less than $605,378.  
  In particular, Article 2.02(2) contemplates a final purchase price of more than 
  $500,000.  This article provides for a purchase promissory note (here $105,370) 
  if the estimated purchase price turned out to be more than $500,000, as it did 
  according to the May 31, 1990 financial statements.  By contrast, as I have 
  noted, Article 2.02(3) manifestly contemplates a final purchase price of less 
  than $500,000.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I doubt that the vendor’s principals recognized the extent to which 
  the agreement exposed them to repaying not only part, or even all, of the estimated 
  purchase price, but also to actually paying the purchaser to buy Pumps’ shares.  
  The reality of this risk is on display here where the purchaser, after having 
  written down Pumps’ inventory following the July 19<sup>th</sup> closing, sought 
  an adjustment of the final purchase price of almost $900,000 with the result 
  that the purchaser’s position at trial was that the vendor should be ordered 
  to pay the purchaser about $400,000 to buy Pumps’ shares.  From the vendor’s 
  standpoint, the down side risk was increased where the inventory valuation assessment 
  was done after closing when the purchaser was in total control of Pumps.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is unfortunate that the provisions of the agreement were not followed 
  to the end.  By that I refer to the purchaser’s failure to provide change of 
  control financial statements as required by the agreement, with the result that 
  the Acquisition Review was not done, and to the failure of all concerned to 
  arbitrate the dispute.  Instead, as I have said, the purchaser sued the vendor, 
  Yarnell, and the auditor, Deloitte &amp; Touche, for damages for breach of contract 
  and negligent and fraudulent misrepresentation.  The trial judge found no fraud.  
  However, in determining the correct final purchase price he accepted that a 
  write down of over $500,000 of the purchaser’s inventory was justified.  He 
  reduced the final purchase price accordingly.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The vendor submits that the trial judge stated the issue incorrectly 
  when he posed the over-arching question – “What is the final purchase price 
  of the shares?”  Although I think that the trial judge ought to have recognized 
  that there was more involved in resolving the action than determining the correct 
  final purchase price, I accept that the damages to which the purchaser is entitled 
  can reasonably be quantified by determining what the final purchase price would 
  have been had there been no inventory value misrepresentation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The resultant final purchase price determination does not, however, 
  end the matter.  Since this is an action for damages, mitigation is a live issue.  
  I will return to this issue later.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For reasons that follow, with one relatively minor exception, I accept 
  the trial judge’s findings regarding the value of Pumps’ inventory, since there 
  was evidence to support his findings on all but one inventory valuation issue.  
  However, I think that the trial judge erred in failing to recognize that this 
  was not a reference to determine the final purchase price, but rather an action 
  for damages in both tort and contract.  Looked at in that context, the purchaser 
  was obliged to mitigate its loss and having done so, the trial judge was required 
  to reduce the purchaser’s damages to reflect the product of the purchaser’s 
  efforts at mitigation.  I will refer to this in more detail shortly.  I also 
  think that the trial judge erred in finding that Yarnell was liable to pay damages 
  to the purchaser totalling over $800,000, including prejudgment interest.  In 
  my view, Yarnell’s liability should not exceed $100,000, the limit of his personal 
  guarantee.  Finally, the trial judge set-off the vendor’s judgment on the earn 
  out promissory note against the purchaser’s judgment against the vendor and 
  Yarnell.  However, because Yarnell has no legal interest in the earn out promissory 
  note, this creates a set-off problem.  Fortunately, this problem is a non-issue 
  once the purchaser’s damages are reduced to reflect the results of steps taken 
  by the purchaser to mitigate its loss.  I will deal with the issue of Yarnell’s 
  liability first.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span

  </span> There are three reasons to limit Yarnell’s liability to a maximum of 
  $100,000.  First, the purchaser’s claim against Yarnell as set out in its statement 
  of claim was for $100,000, the limit of his personal guarantee.  Second, there 
  was no evidence that Yarnell made false misrepresentations concerning Pumps’ 
  financial statements.  Indeed, for the most part, to the extent that there were 
  discussions about Pumps’ assets, it was Yarnell’s son Robert who was involved.  
  Third, there is the issue of reliance.  There was no evidence that the purchaser 
  relied to its detriment on anything Yarnell may have said about Pumps’ financial 
  circumstances.  To the contrary, the purchaser relied not on what Yarnell said, 
  but rather on the asset and liability values as set out in Pumps’ January 31, 
  and May 31, 1990 financial statements.  The contract assumed that the final 
  purchase price would be different from the estimated purchase price which in 
  turn reflected a different shareholders’ equity from that set out in Pumps’ 
  audited January 31, 1990 financial statements.  The underlying assumption, explicitly 
  set out in the contract, was that the relevant financial statements were all 
  prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that 
  the May and July financial statements were prepared in a manner consistent with 
  Pumps’ audited January 31, 1990 financial statements.  The purchaser relied 
  on Pumps’ financial statements, not on anything Yarnell said about Pumps’ assets 
  or liabilities.  In my view, Yarnell’s exposure is limited to his $100,000 guarantee.</p>

  </span> I turn now to the vendor’s liability based upon the representations 
  and warranties set out in the agreement.  In my view, looked at generally, with 
  the exception of obsolete inventory there was evidence to support the trial 
  judge’s inventory valuation adjustments.  Pumps’ January 31, 1990 balance sheet 
  reflected a compromise on inventory which resulted from discussions between 
  Deloitte, Touche’s representatives and Robert Yarnell, particularly with respect 
  to the work in process component of Pumps’ inventory.  According to the evidence 
  of Rosen, the purchaser’s expert witness, the vendor, through the representations 
  and warranties in the agreement concerning Pumps’ financial statements, breached 
  the agreement.  Since the trial judge accepted Rosen’s evidence, there is no 
  basis upon which to interfere with the trial judge’s inventory valuation findings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I pause here to note that the financial statements in issue (Pumps’ 
  January 31 and May 31, 1990 financial statements) were Pumps’ financial statements.  
  The owner of the shares being sold was Quorum, later named YCI.  There were 
  frequent references in the trial judge’s reasons to the financial statements 
  in questions being the financial statements of the vendor.  Clearly, the financial 
  statements in issue were Pumps’, and not the vendor’s.  However, in my view, 
  nothing turns on the failure of the trial judge to consistently recognize that 
  the shares being bought and sold were not the vendor’s, since the vendor’s representations 
  and warranties as they related to financial statements focussed on Pumps’ financial 
  statements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is a further issue raised in the vendor’s submissions that I can 
  conveniently dispose of here.  The vendor submits that at closing Yarnell and 
  Blumentrath made the side deal to which I have referred earlier, the effect 
  of which was to amend the agreement so that the inventory valuation component 
  of Pumps’ shareholders’ equity would no longer be in issue.  The deal to which 
  I refer was Yarnell’s provision of his $100,000 guarantee and the cancellation 
  of the $105,378 purchase promissory note.  It was following the meeting between 
  Yarnell and Blumentrath which took place on the day of closing that the deal 
  in fact closed.  The vendor submits that the Yarnell-Blumentrath closing arrangements 
  ended the debate about the valuation of Pumps’ inventory.  Yarnell’s evidence, 
  which I reviewed earlier, tends to support the vendor’s position on this issue.  
  Blumentrath was not questioned about the details of the guarantee arrangements, 
  even in reply.  Weitner was not present when Blumentrath and Yarnell met privately 
  on the day the deal closed.  Thus, he did not testify about the discussion that 
  took place at that meeting.  The trial judge did not comment on this aspect 
  of the vendor’s submissions in his reasons.  Thus, apart from the trial judge’s 
  generally adverse finding on the issue of Yarnell’s credibility, the trial judge’s 
  reasons are not of much help on this issue.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although I think that Yarnell might have assumed that his $100,000 guarantee 
  and the cancellation of the $105,378 purchase promissory note put the inventory 
  issue to rest, I am not prepared to accept the vendor’s submission on this issue.  
  The understanding upon which the vendor now relies was not confirmed by either 
  party after closing.  The vendor’s conduct after closing does not seem to me 
  to reflect the finality of the inventory arrangements now alleged.  Indeed, 
  after closing, the vendor provided the change of control financial statements 
  required by the agreement. When the vendor was told about the substantial inventory 
  write down, it did not take the position that the debate about the value of 
  Pumps’ inventory had ended at closing.  I would not give effect to this ground 
  of appeal. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This brings me to the specifics of the trial judge’s inventory adjustment.  
  The trial judge started with the estimated purchase price of $605,378 which, 
  as I have said, came from Pumps’ unaudited interim financial statements as at 
  May 31, 1990.  Pumps’ May 31<sup>st</sup> balance sheet valued Pumps’ inventory 
  at $1,654,356.  After closing, the vendor prepared the change of control financial 
  statements required by the agreement.  The July 19<sup>th</sup> balance sheet 
  valued Pumps’ inventory at $1,737.679.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge accepted the legitimacy of some, but not all, of the 
  purchaser’s inventory write downs.  After reviewing the evidence about the inventory 
  valuation as of the date of closing, July 19, 1990, he found that Pumps’ inventory 
  was overvalued by $527,159 and he deducted that sum from Pumps’ assets in order 
  to determine Pumps’ shareholders’ equity (net of goodwill).  As I have said, 
  apart from the obsolete inventory write down of $105,378, there is no basis 
  to interfere with the trial judge’s inventory valuation adjustments.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence with respect to the value of obsolete inventory was somewhat 
  confusing.  Weitner estimated that the obsolete inventory had a value of about 
  $90,000.  In his examination-in-chief he expressed the view that at closing 
  the purchaser protected itself from the obsolete inventory problem by obtaining 
  John Yarnell’s personal guarantee of $100,000.  Later, in response to blatantly 
  leading questions, he stated that account of the obsolete inventory was taken 
  by reducing the purchase promissory note to nil.  Throughout Weitner’s evidence, 
  the terminology was confusing as it related to Yarnell’s personal guarantee 
  of $100,000 and the purchase promissory note of $105,378.  The guarantee and 
  the promissory note were frequently referred to interchangeably as if they were 
  the same document.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is quite apparent that both the elimination of the purchase promissory 
  note and the provision of Yarnell’s $100,000 guarantee at the very least were 
  intended to provide the purchaser with protection in respect of the purchaser’s 
  inventory valuation concerns, which at the time centred on Pumps’ obsolete inventory.  
  I am unable to conclude from the evidence that the vendor and purchaser agreed 
  at closing that Pumps’ obsolete inventory should be valued for purposes of the 
  closing at $105,378, the amount of the purchase promissory note.  Therefore, 
  I think that the trial judge’s finding that the parties agreed on closing that 
  Pumps’ obsolete inventory had a value of $105,378 is unreasonable in that it 
  is not supported by the evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> If the $105,378 obsolete inventory valuation is wrong, there remains 
  to be considered what the correct obsolete inventory valuation is.  Weitner 
  consistently referred  to “about $90,000” when asked about the value of Pumps’ 
  obsolete inventory.  Since the evidence does not support the proposition that 
  the parties agreed that the value of the obsolete inventory was $105,378, although 
  the value of the obsolete inventory was not established with precision, I see 
  no reason not to assess that aspect of the inventory dispute at $90,000.    
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think that directing a new trial on this issue makes sense.  
  That would not be in the best interests of the parties or of justice.  Furthermore, 
  this adjustment of the obsolete inventory component of Pumps’ inventory will 
  have no bottom line impact.  This is because the trial judge, in his determination 
  of the appropriate reduction in the value of Pumps’ inventory, ended with a 
  negative purchase price of $19,258.  Nonetheless, perhaps invoking the “enough 
  is enough” principle, the trial judge did no more than to require the vendor 
  to repay what it received before and at closing, that is, $500,000 (not including 
  the cancelled purchase promissory note of $105,378).  He did not require the 
  vendor to pay $19,258 to the purchaser.  Accordingly, reducing the obsolete 
  inventory deduction from $105,378 to $90,000, and holding the other inventory 
  deductions constant, will not change the zero dollars purchase price as determined 
  by the trial judge, subject to one important consideration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The vendor contends that the obsolete inventory adjustment of $105,378 
  as per the trial judge’s reasons and the cancellation at closing of the purchase 
  promissory note leads to double counting in the sense that the vendor has been 
  charged with the obsolete inventory twice, once at closing when the purchase 
  promissory note was cancelled and again when the trial judge deducted the obsolete 
  inventory from Pumps’ assets as at the date of closing.  I do not agree.  The 
  estimated purchase price dictated what the purchaser had to pay for Pumps’ shares 
  to get the deal closed.  The agreement assumed that the final purchase price 
  would be different simply because the value of Pumps’ assets, liabilities and 
  goodwill (and hence its shareholder’s equity), would be different on July 19, 
  1990 than they were on May 31, 1990.  Looked at in that way, establishing the 
  estimated purchase price on the basis of Pumps’ May 31, 1990 balance sheet and 
  the final purchase price on the basis of its July 19, 1990 balance sheet were 
  distinctly separate exercises.  Since there was an appropriate $90,000 obsolete 
  inventory write-down, the final purchase price should reflect that write-down.  
  This exercise is not connected with the cancellation at closing of the $105,378 
  purchase promissory note.  I see no double counting in respect of obsolete inventory.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I mentioned earlier, there is also the issue of mitigation.  Whether 
  the misrepresentation is viewed as a tort – negligent misrepresentation – or 
  a breach of contract – the specific breach of the many contractual representations 
  and warranties concerning the legitimacy of Pumps’ financial statements – makes 
  no difference in respect of the issue of mitigation.  The purchaser was under 
  a positive duty to take reasonable steps to reduce, that is to mitigate, its 
  loss.  Mitigation is an aspect of causation in the sense that a defendant’s 
  breach of contract or tortious conduct does not cause losses that a plaintiff 
  could reasonably have avoided.  See S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, 
  3<sup>rd</sup> ed (Toronto:  Canada Law Book, 1993) at paragraph 747.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think that the purchaser can be accused of failing to mitigate 
  its damages.  In my view, the problem here is that the trial judge did not take 
  account of the plaintiff’s successful efforts at mitigation.  I refer specifically 
  to two aspects of the purchaser’s successful efforts to reduce its loss.  First, 
  when the purchaser wrote down Pumps’ inventory by $897,000, it claimed and received 
  a tax benefit of between $150,000 and $200,000.  The evidence with respect to 
  this tax benefit was no more precise than that.  It seems to me that the purchaser’s 
  recoverable loss must reflect the benefit that directly flowed from the vendor’s 
  overstatement and the purchaser’s write down of Pumps’ inventory.  I would take 
  $175,000, the midpoint of the benefit, as an appropriate credit against the 
  damages assessed by the trial judge.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, as a result of the inventory valuation problems which gave rise 
  to this litigation, the purchaser received a payment of $150,000 from Deloitte 
  &amp; Touche, I assume in exchange for a release.  The trial judge ignored that 
  benefit which was also directly related to the overstatement of Pumps’ inventory.  
  It too should be taken into account in determining the purchaser’s actual loss 
  as a result of the inflated inventory valuation found by the trial judge.  To 
  ignore the tax benefit and the payment made by Deloitte, Touche would result 
  in the purchaser being overcompensated.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apart from the valuation of obsolete inventory, I am prepared to accept 
  the trial judge’s reductions from inventory.  As I have noted, I think the obsolete 
  inventory should be valued at $90,000, not at the amount of the purchase promissory 
  note, that is $105,378.  Including the relatively small adjustment for obsolete 
  inventory, the reductions from Pumps’ inventory as recorded on its July 19, 
  1990 balance sheet are:</p>

  </span> The trial judge correctly used Pumps’ July 19, 1990 balance sheet to 
  determine Pumps’ shareholders’ equity, that is the appropriate final purchase 
  price for Pumps’ shares.  The total assets in accordance with that balance sheet 
  were $2,481,996.  The corrected total after deducting the overvaluation of Pumps’ 
  inventory in accordance with the trial judge’s findings, subject to the obsolete 
  inventory adjustment referred to above, is $1,970,215.47.  Pumps’ total liabilities 
  were $1,839.625.  The difference between Pumps’ total assets, as adjusted, and 
  Pumps’ total liabilities is $130,590.47.  To get to the final purchase price 
  as prescribed in the agreement, goodwill must be deducted.  The goodwill listed 
  on Pumps’ July 19, 1990 balance sheet is $134,470.  Deducting goodwill leads 
  to a negative purchase price of ($3,879.53).  The trial judge rounded the final 
  purchase price down to zero, I assume on the premise that the parties did not 
  contemplate that the vendor would pay the purchaser to buy Pumps’ shares.  I 
  see no reason to adopt a different approach.  Neither parties’ reasonable expectations 
  contemplated a negative purchase price.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span

  </span> The trial judge moved from a determination of what Pumps’ shareholder’s 
  equity, net of goodwill, should have been to the consideration of what the vendor 
  should repay the purchaser because of the substantial inventory adjustment.  
  He correctly proceeded on the premise that the purchaser had paid $500,000 to 
  buy Pumps’ shares.  </p>
<p class=headingtitle>Conclusion</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The purchaser’s damages quite properly reflect what it should have paid 
  for Pumps’ share had the inventory been valued in a manner consistent with generally 
  accepted accounting principles.  I thus have no difficulty with the approach 
  followed by the trial judge in determining what the purchaser’s loss was.  However, 
  I think that the trial judge erred in not recognizing that this was an action 
  for damages, not an action to determine what the purchase price should be as 
  if the deal was to close immediately following the release of the judgment.  
  In my opinion, it follows that the benefits that accrued to the purchaser as 
  a result of the inflated estimated closing purchase price, caused by the vendor’s 
  misrepresentations as to the value of Pumps’ inventory, should take into account 
  the $150,000 that the purchasers received from Deloitte &amp; Touche and the 
  $175,000 tax benefit that resulted directly from the inventory write down.

  </span> The purchaser’s net – and compensable – loss is the difference between 
  its gross inventory write down, $511,781, and the deductions which total $325,000, 
  that is $186,781.  The purchaser is entitled to judgment in that amount against 
  the vendor.  The purchaser is also entitled to prejudgment interest.  I am confident 
  that counsel can work out the interest calculations.</p>

  </span> The purchaser’s obligation under the earnout promissory note is a separate 
  matter.  Judgment should issue in favour of the vendor on its counterclaim for 
  $300,000 on that note.  The formal trial judgment provided that the purchaser’s 
  obligation under the earn-out promissory note of $300,000 be cancelled and discharged 
  since, on the trial judge’s findings, the vendor owed the purchaser more than 
  the $300,000 that the purchaser owed the vendor on the earn out promissory note.  
  The judgment should be varied to reflect the purchaser’s obligation to pay the 
  vendor $300,000 on the earn out promissory note since the vendor’s net obligation 
  to the purchaser caused by the inventory adjustment is less than what is owing 
  on the earn out promissory note.  The vendor is entitled to interest on the 
  $300,000 earn out promissory note.  The $186,781 that the vendor owes the purchaser 
  should be set off against the purchaser’s earn out promissory note obligation 
  of $300,000.  When that is done, Yarnell’s contingent liability on his guarantee 
  disappears.  Accordingly, the purchaser’s action against Yarnell should be dismissed.</p>

  supplementary reasons referred to a settlement offer made by the purchaser on

  The trial judge thus ordered the vendor to pay the purchaser’s solicitor and

    a motion to stay this action, pending completion of the arbitration.  It was 
    alleged that there was no failure to agree that would trigger the arbitration 
    provided for in the agreement.  Neither party submits that their dispute should 
    have been arbitrated.  Accordingly, I will say no more on that subject.</p>
