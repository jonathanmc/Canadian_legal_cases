<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice William 
  J. Festeryga dated November 4, 1999.</p>
<p class="boldcenter">ENDORSEMENT ON COSTS </p>
 <p> [1]  We have considered the written submissions on costs made by both parties.  
  In our view, the respondents (plaintiffs) are entitled to their party and party 
  costs of the trial.  This court’s judgment did not alter the trial judge’s principal 
  findings of liability and, even though this court reduced the award of damages, 
  the respondents still largely succeeded in their claim.  The respondents’ offer 
  to settle referred to by the trial judge no longer affects the disposition of 
  costs.  The appellants did not make a relevant offer to settle.</p>
<p> [2]  We decline to alter the costs of the appeal.  As set out in paragraph 
  67 of the reasons of Osborne A.C.J.O. the appellants are entitled to the costs 
  of the appeal because they achieved substantial success on the appeal.</p>
