<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Maurice Cullity dated October 19, 1998.</p>
<h4 align="center">REASONS ON COSTS</h4>
<p class=headingtitle>WEILER J.A.:</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The court consented to receiving additional submissions from 
  counsel with respect to costs.  The appellant (plaintiff) submits it is entitled 
  to the costs of trial on a solicitor-and-client scale from January 7, 1977 to 
  the date of judgment pursuant to rule 49.10 as a result of its offer to settle 
  and the results of the case before this court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The offer to settle served by the appellant 
  on January 7, 1997 is as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The Plaintiff and Defendants by Counterclaim offer to settle this proceeding 
      on the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> 1.  a.  Payment by the Defendant Cornell Engineering Company Limited 
        to the Plaintiff 978011 Ontario Limited of $5,354.87 for unpaid salary, 
        GST, and out of pocket expenses;</p>
      <p> b.  Payment by the Defendant Cornell Engineering Company Limited to 
        the Plaintiff 978011 Ontario Limited of $99,000.00 and GST on same in 
        the amount of $6,930.00;</p>
      <p> c.  The parties shall each bear their own costs;</p>
      <p> d.  Execution and delivery of mutual releases by the parties; and</p>
      <p> e.  The action and counterclaim shall be dismissed without costs on 
        consent.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>If the Offer to Settle as set out in paragraph 1 above is not accepted 
      on or before January 15, 1997 at 5:00 p.m., it is hereby withdrawn and the 
      Plaintiff and Defendants by Counterclaim offer to settle this proceeding 
      on the following terms:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p> 2.  a.  Payment by the Defendant Cornell Engineering Company Limited 
        to the Plaintiff 978011 Ontario Limited of $5,354.87 for unpaid salary, 
        GST and out of pocket expenses;</p>
      <p> b.  Payment by the Defendant Cornell Engineering Company Limited to 
        the Plaintiff 978011 Ontario Limited of $99,000.00 and GST on same in 
        the amount of $6,930.00;</p>
      <p> c.  Payment by the Defendant Cornell Engineering Company Limited of 
        the Plaintiff/Defendant by Counterclaim’s [sic] costs to the date of settlement 
        of judgment on a party and party basis to be assessed or agreed upon;</p>
      <p> d.  Execution and delivery of mutual releases by the parties; and</p>
      <p> e.  The action and counterclaim shall be dismissed on consent.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The offer to Settle as set out in paragraph 2 above shall expire ten minutes 
      after the commencement of the trial unless withdrawn prior thereto.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first paragraph pertains to an offer that expired on January 
  15, 1997 at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. if not accepted.  This offer was not accepted.  It 
  is not a rule 49.10 offer because it expired before the commencement of the 
  hearing.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second paragraph contains an offer that expired ten minutes 
  after the commencement of trial unless withdrawn before that time.  This offer 
  was not withdrawn and it was also not accepted.  It is a rule 49.10 offer.  
  The respondent (defendant) submits that the offer to settle was ambiguous, uncertain 
  and incapable of acceptance.  The basis for this submission is paragraph 2.c. 
  which provides for payment of costs, “to the date of settlement or judgment”.  
  In my opinion, the objection of the defendant has been settled by the recent 
  decision of this court in <i>Rooney (Litigation Guardian of) v. Graham</i>, 
  released on March 27, 2001.  The majority of the court held that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> … in evaluating a rule 49 offer any “uncertainty” that arises from a provision 
      for costs should only be relevant in deciding whether the party relying 
      on the offer has met its burden of proof under rule 49.10(3).  In other 
      words, uncertainty or lack of clarity in an offer may prevent a party from 
      showing that the judgment it obtained was “as favourable as the terms of 
      the offer to settle, or more or less favourable, as the case may be.”  See 
      <i>Schumacher v. Toronto-Dominion Bank</i> (1997), 153 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
      187 (Ont. Gen. Div.); aff’d (1999), 173 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 577 (Ont. 
      C.A.).”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The rationale in <i>Rooney</i>, <i>supra</i>, is equally applicable 
  to the instant case.  The appellant has met its burden of proof under rule 49.10.  
  Accordingly, the objection of the respondent that the offer was incapable of 
  acceptance must be dismissed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second objection raised by the respondent is that the appellant 
  failed to obtained the relief sought in the offer because, in its offer, the 
  appellant sought mutual releases and the payment of $5,354.87 owing for unpaid 
  wages plus expenses and this relief was not awarded.  This objection is without 
  merit.  It is uncontested that the respondent paid the amount of $6,640.04 in 
  satisfaction of the appellant’s claim for unpaid salary and out-of-pocket expenses 
  after the offer and prior to trial and this effectively met that condition of 
  the offer to settle.  In a similar vein, the resolution of the issues by the 
  court supplanted the requirement for mutual releases.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would amend the judgment granted by ordering that the appellant 
  is entitled to its costs on a party-and-party basis to January 15, 1997 and, 
  thereafter, on a solicitor-and-client basis to the date of judgment.  Costs 
  of the appeal are on a party-and-party basis.</p>
