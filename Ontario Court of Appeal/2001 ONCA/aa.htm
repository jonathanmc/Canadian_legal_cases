    </span>The appellant was the superintendent in the building where the complainant 
    lived. The complainant was married and aged about 40. She is intellectually 
    disabled. The appellant did work on the apartment while the complainant's

    the appellant sexually assaulted the complainant. </p>

    mental difficulties of the complainant would be evident to anyone hearing

    </span>The defence was that over a period of some months the two engaged in 
    consensual intercourse which provided mutual comfort. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>At the opening of the trial, and in the presence of the jury, the trial 
    judge conducted an inquiry pursuant to s. 16(1) of the <i>Evidence Act</i> 
    to determine whether the complainant understood the nature of an oath and 
    was able to communicate the evidence. The trial judge concluded that she may 
    not understand the oath but was able to communicate and could testify on a 
    promise to tell the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>At the conclusion of the evidence and argument the trial judge distributed 
    to counsel a draft charge to the jury. Crown counsel expressed his view in 
    these terms:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>My position is that she did not consent, and that you 
    ought not to charge on no capacity. I say that because she is a married woman. 
    I haven’t called any medical evidence to say she is not capable of consenting, 
    intellectually capable of consenting, and I think that she, in the context 
    of her marital relationship, could consent to sexual intercourse, but that 
    the issue before the jury is did she, in fact, consent. And all the things 
    about her handicap and her age go to whether she consented, in fact, and whether 
    the accused’s story that she did, and what his position is, is reasonable. 
    So it is my respectful submission that ought to be deleted. That paragraph 
    with respect to I think it is s. 273.2. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Defence counsel agreed to this position. The trial judge, however, 
    did not agree. He referred to <i>R. v. Bernier</i> (1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 
    467 (Que. C.A.), aff'd 124 C.C.C. (3d) 383 where the Quebec Court of Appeal 
    noted that a trial judge must consider the application of s. 273.1(2)(b) of 
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> where appropriate. That subsection reads:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>273.1 (2)   No consent is obtained, for the purposes of 
    sections 271, 272 and 273, where </p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>…</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>(b)            the complainant is incapable of consenting 
    to the activity;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Accordingly, the trial judge decided that the jury should be instructed 
    on the question of capacity and read his proposed charge to counsel:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Our law states that no consent is obtained where the complainant 
    is incapable of consenting. A valid consent is an informed consent. Therefore, 
    the individual must be able to understand the risks and consequences associated 
    with the activity to be engaged in. </p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>As a society we recognize that some of our citizens are 
    handicapped in their ability to make informed choices and are severely lacking 
    in the sophistication, maturity, or intellect necessary to properly scrutinize 
    what is being requested of them. Children and mentally challenged persons 
    are such citizens. The law seeks to protect such persons. With children the 
    law clearly states that children under the age of 14 cannot consent. In other 
    words, they are incapable of consenting.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>With mentally challenged persons, the law does not and 
    could not set a particular age prerequisite. Part of the problem in defining 
    a mentally challenged person who is incapable of consenting is that it is 
    not as clear-cut as isolating all children under the age of 14. Mentally challenged 
    adults obviously do and are indeed encouraged to make decisions. Society seeks 
    to normalize their existence as much as possible.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>H. chose to marry R.. She chooses to pay her bills. She 
    chooses the type of listening music that she has. Her ability must be assessed 
    by you with an eye to exactly what her capabilities are. You have to be satisfied 
    beyond a reasonable doubt that she is incapable of consenting to the sexual 
    activity in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Both counsel agreed that this charge was appropriate and the trial 
    judge proceeded accordingly. On my reading of the transcript it appears that 
    counsel had at this time accepted that a charge would be made and were agreeing 
    to its form. The trial judge also charged the jury with the following:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>If you believe beyond a reasonable doubt that subjectively 
    H.B. did not consent, or that she was incapable of consenting, the Crown has 
    discharged the obligation to prove the absence of consent. If, on the other 
    hand, you have reasonable doubt, you must give the benefit of that doubt to 
    A.A. and acquit him.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>What this case comes down to is whether or not H.B. consented 
    to the sexual activity committed by A.A. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt 
    that she did not consent to the activity by her words, it is academic whether 
    or not she was capable of consenting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Defence counsel was satisfied with this charge but Crown counsel raised 
    concern that the jury may not have understood that capacity was not relevant 
    if in fact there was no consent. This led to a re-charge:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Basically what I am saying is that . . . you don’t really 
    have to go to the second issue, as it were, with respect to whether or not 
    she is capable of consenting if you find as a fact that she didn’t consent, 
    period. You don’t have to get into the issue of capability. But I felt for 
    a variety of reasons that I had to leave that issue with you in any event.</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE><b>ISSUE ON APPEAL</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>On appeal, the appellant takes the position that the issue of diminished 
    capacity should not have been left with the jury because there was no medical 
    evidence to identify and define the complainant’s limitations in the context 
    of the issue of consent and because lack of capacity to consent was not an 
    issue before the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Capacity is a factual issue to be decided by the jury. Barring any 
    statutory requirement there is no policy reason to establish a mandatory requirement 
    for expert testimony. The issue should be approached on a case-by-case basis, 
    examining whether the non-expert testimony is sufficient to make a rational 
    finding. In <i>State v. Summers, </i>(1993), 853 P.2d 953 Wash. App. Div., 
    the appellant was convicted of second-degree rape based on the victim's mental 
    incapacity to consent. The Washington Court of Appeals held that expert testimony 
    was not required to establish a complainant's capacity to consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In <i>R. v. Aminian</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 4240 (C.A.), this court endorsed 
    a lower court decision that suggested an intellectually disabled complainant's 
    consent was a factually based determination: &quot;The accused, a mature adult, 
    would immediately observe [the complainant's] striking features and obvious 
    mental retardation.&quot;  Similarly, in <i>R. v. K.E.T.</i>, [1990] O.J. 
    No. 2674 (Dist. Ct.), no expert evidence was provided in the trial judge's 
    assessment of an intellectually disabled complainant's capacity to consent. 
  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Save for exceptional circumstance, a requirement for expert testimony 
    in assessing a special needs complainant's capacity to consent is not necessary. 
    The jury in the present case had a full opportunity to make a rational assessment 
    of the complainant’s capacity and to apply it to the issue of consent. They 
    heard the s. 16(1) inquiry, they heard evidence of the complainant's capability 
    to deal with the challenges of daily life, they heard the appellant testify 
    about his awareness of the complainant's diminished intellectual capacity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Aside altogether from the question of the lack of expert evidence, 
    it is my view that when Crown counsel asserted that it was not raising the 
    issue of lack of capacity to consent, it was not appropriate for the trial 
    judge to charge the jury pursuant to s. 273(2)(b) of the <i>Code</i>. At the 
    time the charge was discussed (recited above) both counsel had completed their 
    final addresses and the jury had heard nothing from Crown counsel about the 
    complainant's lack of capacity to consent. In fact, Crown counsel's submissions 
    were overwhelmingly focused on the credibility of the appellant's testimony. 
    Further, the accused was prejudiced by being denied the opportunity to testify 
    that he thought the complainant had the capacity to consent and, in turn, 
    defence counsel was denied a response on mistaken but honest belief in consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Much of what the trial judge said to the jury was an invitation to 
    make a general finding of incapacity. The trial judge attempts, in some of 
    his remarks, to put consent out front as the first issue but in reality it 
    was the only issue. The single question was whether this complainant, with 
    all her frailties, consented to the appellant’s advances. The jury might also 
    have been influenced to make a general finding of lack of capacity to consent 
    by the trial judge’s references to the law that children under 14 can’t consent, 
    having heard the appellant testify that the complainant operated at a lower 
    mental level than his 12-year-old child. The imitation to make a general finding 
    of incapacity rendered the trial judge’s efforts to particularize less than 
    effective and potentially prejudiced the accused. The jury instructions on 
    this subject should have opened and closed with the observation that the complainant 
    was married, presumably consented to intercourse on a regular basis, and can 
    be taken to be capable of doing so on the alleged occasions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Reviewing the whole of the charge it is my view that there is a real 
    possibility that one or more jurors may have voted for conviction on the basis 
    of a general finding of incapacity notwithstanding the appearance of consent. 
    That would be a miscarriage of justice and justifies a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>A further ground of appeal was that the trial judge should have given 
    a cautionary warning as to acceptance of the complainant’s evidence and the 
    need for corroboration. In fact the trial judge did refer to evidence that 
    could be corroborative, such as the complainant lying in a fetal position 
    and sobbing when first encountered by the police. Further, the trial judge 
    spoke extensively of the complainant’s disability, including reference to 
    her need to hold a stuffed animal for security, that she did not know her 
    own age and could not read or spell. There is no question in my mind that 
    this jury had a complete picture of the complainant’s strengths and weaknesses 
    and needed no further assistance, beyond that given by the trial judge, to 
    assess the critical issues.</p>
