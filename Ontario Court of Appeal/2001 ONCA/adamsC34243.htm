<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from his conviction by Madam Justice Wailan Low, 
  sitting without a jury, on April 6, 2000</span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals his conviction for possession 
  of a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking contrary to the <i>Controlled Drugs 
  and Substances Act</i>, S.C. 1996, c.&nbsp;19. The drugs which formed the subject-matter 
  of the charge were found in the appellant’s pocket as a result of a search incidental 
  to his arrest for trafficking in a narcotic on a previous occasion. The sole 
  issue on this appeal is whether the arrest was unlawful, in which case it is 
  conceded by the Crown that the search would constitute a violation of the appellant’s 
  right to be secure against unreasonable search and seizure under s.&nbsp;8 of 
  the <i>Charter</i> and that the evidence should be excluded under s.&nbsp;24(2). 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was arrested by the police in the laundry room 
  of the rooming house in which he resided. Although the appellant conceded that 
  the police had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest him, he argued that 
  his arrest was illegal because the police failed to obtain a warrant to enter 
  a dwelling house pursuant to s.&nbsp;529 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 
  1985, c.&nbsp;C-46. The Crown in turn conceded that the police did not obtain 
  a warrant and that there were no exigent circumstances within the meaning of 
  s.&nbsp;529.3 justifying a warrantless entry in the dwelling house. The Crown 
  at trial argued, however, that the <i>R. v. Feeney</i> (1996), 7 C.R. (5th) 
  101 (S.C.C.) warrant requirement only applies to arrests in a suspect’s dwelling 
  house and not a third party’s dwelling house.  As the appellant had no expectation 
  of privacy in the laundry room, it was not his dwelling house, and consequently, 
  no warrant was required. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge agreed with the Crown’s contention 
  that the appellant had no expectation of privacy with respect to the laundry 
  room. She further concluded that the laundry room was not part of the superintendent’s 
  apartment and that the arrest did not take place in a dwelling house, period. 
  Consequently, she held that the arrest was not unlawful. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  the arrest did not take place in a dwelling house. He submits that, at the very 
  least, the evidence was clear that the laundry room was part of the superintendent’s 
  dwelling house. Indeed, this fact was admitted at trial. The appellant argues 
  that the <i>Feeney</i> warrant requirement is not limited to a suspect’s dwelling 
  house — it is equally applicable to third-party dwelling houses.  Consequently, 
  the appellant argues that, absent a warrant, the police required a lawful consent 
  in order to effect a lawful entry. Crown counsel on appeal concedes that the 
  trial judge erred in finding that the arrest did not take place in a dwelling 
  house and that the lawfulness of the entry in this case hinged on the existence 
  of a valid consent. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On the issue of consent, Crown counsel takes 
  the position that the police were afforded lawful entry into the premises by 
  the superintendent of the rooming house who had unquestioned authority to grant 
  them entry, particularly to the laundry room. The appellant disputes the validity 
  of the consent. He submits that the police obtained the superintendent’s permission 
  to enter the premises because they tricked him into believing that their purpose 
  was to investigate a noise complaint whereas, as admitted by the Crown at trial, 
  their purpose was to come in and arrest him. Consequently, he argues that the 
  consent was not informed, and therefore invalid. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the appellant is quite correct in that the <i>Feeney</i> 
  warrant requirement is not limited to arrests in a suspect’s dwelling house.  
  There is nothing in s.&nbsp;529 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> or in <i>Feeney</i> 
  to suggest that a warrant is not required for an arrest in the dwelling house 
  of a third party.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Also, in our view, the evidence is clear, and 
  it is not seriously contested by the Crown, that the consent in this case was 
  not valid: see <i>R. v. Mellenthin</i> (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 487 (S.C.C.); 
  <i>R. v. Borden</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 404 at 417 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Wills</i> 
  (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 529 at 543-46 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Lewis</i> (1998), 
  13 C.R. (5<sup>th</sup>) 34 at 40-41 (Ont. C.A.). </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Crown counsel, however, argues that the appellant 
  has no standing to question the validity of the superintendent’s consent in 
  the absence of a reasonable expectation of privacy in the premises in question. 
  The appellant submits that since he shared the laundry room with his superintendent, 
  he had a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to the area where he 
  was arrested, and therefore has standing. Alternatively, he submits that he 
  has standing to raise this issue based on his right to contest the validity 
  of his arrest.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is not necessary for us to determine the reasonable expectation 
  of privacy issue with respect to standing. In our view, the appellant has standing 
  to contest the validity of his arrest by virtue of the fact that his <i><u>own</u></i> 
  <i>Charter</i> right was involved. This is not a case where an accused seeks 
  to exclude evidence obtained as a result of a violation of a third party’s s.&nbsp;8 
  <i>Charter</i> right. It is the appellant’s own s.&nbsp;8 right which was engaged 
  when the police effected the search of his person incidental to his arrest.  
  In the circumstances of this case, absent a valid consent, the arrest was unlawful. 
  Consequently, the appellant’s s.&nbsp;8 right was violated and, as agreed, the 
  evidence should have been excluded.</p>
