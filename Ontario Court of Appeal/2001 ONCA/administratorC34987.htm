    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The primary issue in this appeal is whether 
    the Ontario Review Board (the &quot;Board&quot; or &quot;Review Board&quot;) 
    applied the wrong legal test in deciding that as a condition of his continued 
    hospitalization under s. 672.54(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the respondent, 
    Pertti Tulikorpi, should be transferred from a maximum security hospital to 
    a medium security hospital.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Pertti Tulikorpi has suffered from chronic 
    schizophrenia since at least 1986. Between 1986 and 1991, he was hospitalized 
    on numerous occasions as a result of his illness. On one such occasion in 
    1987, he sexually molested a female patient and was charged with and convicted 
    of sexual assault. That was not his first offence. His criminal record dates 
    back to 1981 and includes convictions for mischief, failing to appear, breach 
    of probation and theft.</span></p>
  <p><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On March 11, 1991, while living at a rooming 
    house for persons with mental disorders, Mr. Tulikorpi stabbed a male staff-worker. 
    He did so under the delusional belief that the worker had beaten and raped 
    him and that he was about to strangle Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi's mother. The incident 
    resulted in a charge of assault with a weapon, for which Mr. Tulikorpi was 
    found not criminally responsible on account of mental disorder on April 30, 
    1991.</span></p>
  <p><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As a result of this finding, Mr. Tulikorpi 
    was committed on August 13, 1991 to the Kingston Psychiatric Hospital, a medium 
    security facility. He remained there until January 19, 1993, at which time 
    the Board ordered his transfer to the Oak Ridge Division of the Penetanguishene 
    Mental Health Centre, a maximum security facility. </span></p>
  <p><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following his arrival at Oak Ridge, Mr. Tulikorpi 
    was diagnosed as suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia, a personality 
    disorder with anti-social traits, and substance abuse.  That diagnosis remains 
    unchanged to this day.</span></p>
  <p><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Annual review hearings conducted by the Board 
    from 1993 to and including 1999 resulted in Mr. Tulikorpi's continued hospitalization 
    at the Oak Ridge Division. That situation changed however following Mr. Tulikorpi's 
    annual review on July&nbsp;13, 2000. By disposition dated July 24, 2000, the 
    Board ordered that he be transferred from Oak Ridge to the medium security 
    unit at the Whitby Mental Health Centre. The essence of the Board's decision 
    is found in the following two paragraphs of its reasons:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1> 
      <p><span lang=EN-US>The Board is unanimously of the view that Mr. Tulikorpi 
        continues to represent a significant threat to the safety of the public 
        by reason of his poor insight into his mental illness and as to the need 
        for medication as well as the probability that he would immediately become 
        non-compliant in terms of medication and would decompensate such that 
        his behaviour would become dangerous if left to his own devices. He clearly 
        requires monitoring and supervision.</span></p>
      <p><u><span lang=EN-US>However, section 672.54 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
        requires this Board to make a disposition that is the least onerous and 
        least restrictive to the accused taking into account the need to protect 
        the public from dangerous persons, the mental condition of the accused, 
        the reintegration of the accused into society and the other needs of the 
        accused</span></u><span
lang=EN-US>. Having carefully reviewed the hospital report on a year by year basis 
        since Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi's initial admission to the Kingston Psychiatric 
        Hospital in 1991 and his transfer to the Oak Ridge Division of the Mental 
        Health Centre, Penetanguishene in 1993, where he has remained to date, 
        and taking into account that there have been no episodes of physical assault 
        for four years, only one episode of sexually inappropriate behaviour in 
        1998 and no episodes of sexually inappropriate behaviour since that time, 
        the fact that water intoxication can and is often managed at medium secure 
        facilities, and the increased family support that would be available to 
        him if he were located closer to Toronto, with all due respect to the 
        submissions made on behalf of the hospital which were carefully considered 
        by the Board, this <u>Board is unanimously of the view that the least 
        onerous and least restrictive disposition for the accused is as follows</u>: 
        one, transfer to the medium secure unit of the Whitby Psychiatric Hospital, 
        two, hospital and grounds privileges, staff accompanied. (Emphasis added)</span></p>

  <p><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Administrators of the Penetanguishene and 
    Whitby Mental Health Centres take issue with the Board's decision. In particular, 
    they, along with the Attorney General for Ontario, submit that the Board applied 
    the wrong legal test in concluding that Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi should be transferred 
    to a medium security facility. The Administrators further submit that the 
    Board's decision is unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. 
    If successful, they do not ask this court to exercise its jurisdiction under 
    s.&nbsp;672.78(3)(a) of the <i>Code</i> and order that Mr. Tulikorpi be kept 
    in secure custody at Oak Ridge. Rather, they request that the matter be remitted 
    to the Board for a rehearing pursuant to s.&nbsp;672.78(3)(b).</span></p>
  <p><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For reasons which follow, I am satisfied that 
    the Board applied the wrong legal test in determining that Mr. Tulikorpi should 
    be transferred to a medium security facility and in the circumstances of this 
    case, I have concluded that the appeal must be allowed for that reason alone. 
    As for the second submission, I am not persuaded on the basis of this record, 
    that had the Board applied the correct legal test, it would inevitably have 
    accepted the position of the hospital, supported by the Attorney General, 
    that Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi should remain hospitalized at Oak Ridge. I am, however, 
    of the view that before rejecting the uncontradicted evidence and recommendations 
    of the experts who examined Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi, the Board should have obtained 
    more information about two matters which figured prominently in its decision, 
    namely: (a) the precise reason or reasons underlying Mr. Tulikorpi's transfer 
    from the medium security facility at Kingston to the maximum security facility 
    at Oak Ridge in January 1993; and (b) the suitability of the Whitby Mental 
    Health Centre to monitor and treat Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi, having regard to the 
    need to protect the public from dangerous persons, as well as Mr. Tulikorpi's 
    particular mental condition and other needs.</span></p>

    to transfer was based, at least in part, on the Board's belief that as a matter 
    of law, it was required under s. 672.54 to impose the &quot;least onerous 
    and least restrictive&quot; conditions upon Mr. Tulikorpi, taking into account 
    the need to protect the public from dangerous persons, Mr. Tulikorpi's mental 
    condition, his reintegration into society and his other needs. At issue is 
    whether the Board was correct in applying the &quot;least onerous, least restrictive&quot; 
    test to this aspect of its decision.</span></p>

    whether the Board's decision to transfer Ronald Clement from the maximum security

    Centre was unreasonable. Writing for a unanimous court, Goudge&nbsp;J.A. found 
    that the Board's decision to transfer was unreasonable for three reasons, 
    the first being that it had applied the wrong legal test in reaching its decision.

    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>First, the Review Board appears to have 
      used the wrong test in reaching its decision. It ordered the transfer of 
      Mr. Clement to a medium security facility because that constituted the least 
      restrictive disposition for him in light of the need to protect the public 
      from dangerous persons, his mental condition, and his other needs. However, 
      as this court said in <i>R. v. Pinet</i> (1995), 23 O.R. (3d) 97 at 102, 
      100 C.C.C. (3d) 343 (C.A.), these considerations should only be applied 
      in choosing among the three alternative dispositions in paras. (a), (b) 
      and (c) of s. 672.54.<br>

      </span></div>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>Here, the Review Board was deciding upon 
      the conditions that should attach to the detention of Mr. Clement in a hospital.

      consideration of the relative restrictiveness of conditions, it is not confined

    Mr. Tulikorpi. To the contrary, I am satisfied that when Doherty J.A. uses 
    the words &quot;in making this determination&quot; in the last sentence, he

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The second argument raised by Mr. Tulikorpi 
    is that <i>Pinet</i> and <i>Penetanguishene </i>have been overtaken and implicitly 
    overruled by <i>Winko v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, 
    [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625. <i>Winko</i>, of course, is the landmark decision in 
    which the Supreme Court of Canada found that, properly construed, s. 672.54 
    of the <i>Code </i>does not violate the s. 7 or s. 15 <i>Charter </i>rights 
    of a NCR accused. In reaching that conclusion, McLachlin J. (as she then was), 
    for the majority, carefully considered the history, structure and purpose 
    of Part XX.1 of the <i>Code</i> in conjunction with the specific wording and 
    function of s. 672.54. </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Given their potential significance to the issue 
    at hand, I have read and reread the majority reasons in <i>Winko</i> with 
    a view to discerning whether McLachlin J. intended that the &quot;least onerous, 
    least restrictive&quot; test apply not only to the three categories of disposition 
    referred to in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of s. 672.54 but also, as Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi 
    submits, to conditions a court or Review Board might see fit to impose under 
    subsections (b) or (c) of that provision. In the end, although I recognize 
    that there are isolated passages that could be construed as supporting Mr. 
    Tulikorpi's position, when the reasons are read as a whole, I am not persuaded 
    that McLachlin J. intended that the &quot;least onerous, least restrictive&quot; 
    test apply to conditions imposed under subsections (b) and (c). It follows, 
    in my view, that <i>Pinet</i> remains the law of this province and it has 
    not been overruled by <i>Winko</i>. My reasons for so concluding are threefold.</span></p>

    of s. 672.54 formed the centrepiece of both decisions and that the resolution 
    of the s. 7 constitutional issue in <i>Winko</i> hinged on the provision's 
    proper construction, I believe that McLachlin J. would have explicitly overruled 
    <i>Pinet</i> had she been of the view that the construction given to it by 
    this court undermined its constitutional integrity.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, I note that in her reasons, whenever 
    McLachlin J. refers to the &quot;least onerous, least restrictive&quot; test, 
    she does so in the context of the three categories of disposition identified 
    in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of section 672.54. For example, at paragraph 
    42, she states:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US> The NCR accused is not to be punished. 
      Nor is the NCR accused to languish in custody at the pleasure of the Lieutenant 
      Governor, as was once the case. Instead, having regard to the twin goals 
      of protecting the safety of the public and treating the offender fairly, 
      <u>the NCR accused is to receive the disposition &quot;that is the least 
      onerous and least restrictive&quot; one compatible with his or her situation, 
      be it an absolute discharge, a conditional discharge or detention: s. 672.54</u>. 
      (Emphasis added)</span></div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p><span lang=EN-US>Likewise at paragraph 47, McLachlin J. observes:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>The introductory part of s. 672.54 requires 
      the court or Review Board to consider the need to protect the public from 
      dangerous persons, together with the mental condition of the accused, his 
      or her reintegration into society, and his or her other needs. <u>The court 
      or Review Board must then (the operative verb is &quot;shall&quot;) make 
      the disposition - absolute discharge, conditional discharge, or detention 
      in a hospital &quot;that is the least onerous and least restrictive to the 
      accused&quot;</u>. (Emphasis added)</span></div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p><span lang=EN-US>Another example appears at paragraph 55:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US> If the court or Review Board, after 
      reviewing all the relevant material, cannot or does not conclude that the 
      NCR accused poses a significant threat to public safety, it must order an 
      absolute discharge. <u>If it concludes that the NCR accused does represent 
      such a threat, then it must order the least restrictive of the two remaining

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In contrast to this, nowhere in her reasons 
    does McLachlin J. associate the &quot;least onerous, least restrictive&quot; 
    test to the conditions that a court or Review Board may see fit to impose

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, and perhaps most significantly, I think 
    for present purposes, the importance of <i>Winko</i> lies in the fact that 
    the Supreme Court corrected the commonly held view that if a court or Review 
    Board, faced with deciding whether a NCR accused should be discharged absolutely 
    or conditionally, was uncertain whether he or she would pose a serious risk 
    to society if discharged absolutely, it could err on the side of caution and 
    impose a conditional discharge. Similarly, if the choice was between a conditional 
    discharge and detention in a hospital and the court or Review Board was uncertain 
    whether a conditional discharge was warranted having regard to its analysis 
    of the four mandated factors specified in the introductory part of s. 672.54, 
    it could err on the side of caution and order detention in a hospital. <i>Winko</i> 
    put an end to this practice by pointing out that it rested on a faulty construction 
    of s. 672.54. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According to McLachlin J., properly construed, 
    s. 672.54 provides that if a court or Review Board, faced with a decision 
    to discharge absolutely or conditionally, cannot be certain that the NCR accused 
    will represent a significant threat to society if discharged absolutely, then 
    it is required to apply the &quot;least onerous, least restrictive&quot; test 
    and discharge absolutely. Likewise, when faced with a decision to discharge 
    conditionally or hospitalize, if, consistent with its analysis of the four 
    mandated factors in s. 672.54, a court or Review Board cannot be certain that 
    a conditional discharge is unwarranted, then it is required to apply the &quot;least 
    onerous, least restrictive&quot; test and discharge conditionally. Notably, 
    however, <i>Winko</i> stopped short of advocating a similar analysis in the 
    case of conditions attaching to dispositions made under subsections (b) or 
    (c) of s.&nbsp;672.54.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In sum, I can find nothing in <i>Winko</i> 
    that detracts from the view expressed by McKinlay J.A. on behalf of this court 
    in <i>Pinet</i> at p. 101:</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>In my view, the correct reading of s. 672.54 is that only 
    three dispositions are possible - (a) absolute discharge, (b) discharge subject 
    to conditions, and (c) detention in a hospital subject to conditions - and 
    that the criteria set out in the preceding portion of the section are relevant 
    only to a choice between dispositions (a), (b), or (c). Thus consideration 
    of the least onerous and least restrictive disposition is required only with 
    respect to a determination as to whether the accused should be absolutely 
    discharged, discharged subject to conditions, or detained in a hospital subject 
    to conditions. That determination having been made, and the requirements in 
    the first part of s. 672.54 having been satisfied, it is not necessary that 
    the Board, in imposing conditions under (b) or (c), consider whether the type 
    of hospital or the conditions contemplated under (b) or (c) would be the least 
    onerous and least restrictive.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Apart from anything else, I believe that in 
    general, McKinlay J.A.'s construction of s. 672.54 makes good sense from a 
    practical point of view. Requiring a Review Board to apply the &quot;least 
    onerous, least restrictive&quot; test to every condition that could be said 
    to impact on the &quot;liberty&quot; of a NCR accused would be to hamstring 
    the Board in the exercise of its discretion and place this court in the untenable 
    position of having to micro-manage the Board's every decision. Take for example 
    the situation where a Board, in the context of a conditional discharge, chooses 
    to impose a curfew on the NCR accused from 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Assuming 
    that a curfew is otherwise justified, surely the 11:00&nbsp;p.m. to 6:00 a.m. 
    time-frame should not be open to attack because the Board could not rule out 
    the possibility that a slightly shorter time-frame would suffice. The same 
    can be said for all manner of conditions, including residence restrictions, 
    travel restrictions, reporting requirements and the like. In short, I do not 
    accept that Parliament intended to fix Boards with the next to impossible 
    task of having to fine-tune conditions with the degree of precision and exactness 
    needed to meet the &quot;least onerous, least restrictive&quot; test.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That said, in light of <i>Winko</i>, I recognize 
    that the <i>Pinet</i> approach may be less palatable when the condition in 
    question relates to the security level of the hospital in which the NCR accused 
    is to be detained.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a> 
    For my part, were it not for <i>Pinet</i>, I think a forceful argument could 
    be made that the naming of a specific hospital or type of hospital within 
    which the NCR accused is to be detained is not a condition at all but rather, 
    an integral part of the disposition under subsection (c).<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a> In that event, the court 
    or Board would of course be obliged to apply the &quot;least onerous, least 
    restrictive test&quot; in arriving at its decision. It may be that further 
    guidance from the Supreme Court of Canada is needed on this and other matters 
    relating to the question of conditions. Alternatively, if <i>Pinet</i> stands 
    in all respects, then Parliament may wish to consider whether s. 672.54 should 
    be amended to specify that the &quot;least onerous, least restrictive&quot; 
    test should be applied when a court or Board is deciding something as significant 
    as the security level of the hospital within which the NCR accused is to be 
    detained.</span></p>

    Mr. Tulikorpi had originally been hospitalized in the medium security section 
    of the Kingston Psychiatric Hospital and that his transfer to Oak Ridge in 
    1993 was not due to the fact that he presented a serious management problem

    report clearly indicates that Mr. Tulikorpi was not presenting a serious management 
    problem in the fall of 1992 when his treating psychiatrist recommended that 
    he be transferred to Oak Ridge, it also points out that for a substantial 
    period of time after his arrival at the Kingston Hospital, Mr. Tulikorpi refused 
    to take any medication, he engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct such 
    as masturbating and walking around nude in public, and he was psychotic and

    transfer Mr. Tulikorpi to the medium security unit at Whitby, the Board considered 
    it significant that he had originally been detained in the medium security 
    unit at Kingston and that his transfer was apparently not &quot;management&quot; 
    related. With respect, I think the information before the Board relating to 
    Mr. Tulikorpi's transfer to Oak Ridge was deficient and to the extent that 
    the Board intended to rely on his stay at Kingston and the reason for his 
    transfer as partial justification for his transfer to Whitby, it should have 
    gathered further and better information. Accordingly, at the rehearing, I 
    would direct the Board to obtain and consider such additional information. 
    Its authority for doing so is found in <i>Winko, supra,</i> at p. 160. In 
    the circumstances, this should not pose a problem for the Board. A simple 
    request that the relevant records from the Kingston hospital be produced should 
    suffice.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the experts who examined Mr. Tulikorpi 
    were unanimous in their opinion that in view of the nature of his illness 
    and his lack of insight into it and the need to take medication, his self-indulgent 
    personality and his intimidating behaviour towards other patients, it would 
    be difficult, if not impossible, for the staff at Whitby or any other medium 
    security facility to monitor and control his activities and prevent him for 
    physically or sexually assaulting other patients. According to the experts, 
    this concern was particularly acute given Mr. Tulikorpi's propensity to engage 
    in sexually inappropriate conduct and the fact that he would be in the company 
    of female patients at Whitby. While the experts, particularly Dr. Jacques, 
    conceded that it had been some time since Mr. Tulikorpi had either physically 
    assaulted anyone or engaged in inappropriate sexual behaviour, Dr. Jacques 
    put this down to the fact that Oak Ridge was not only well-staffed but staffed 
    by persons who knew Mr. Tulikorpi well and who would intervene before things 
    got out of hand.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Manifestly, the Board was alive to these concerns, 
    as well as the additional concern that Mr. Tulikorpi had to be closely watched 
    to ensure that he did not become intoxicated from the excessive consumption 
    of water. That said, apart from observing that &quot;water intoxication can 
    and is often managed at medium secure facilities&quot;, there is nothing in 
    the reasons of the Board from which I can conclude that because of its expertise, 
    it was able to take official notice of the resources available at Whitby and 
    their adequacy in relation to Mr.&nbsp;Tulikorpi's specific needs and problems. 
    Bearing in mind that there was no evidence before the Board on this subject, 
    I think that Goudge J.A.'s remarks at p. 480 of <i>Penetanguishene</i> are 
    apposite:</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>Hence, it seems to me that a specific order like the order 
    in this case requires either some evidence concerning the host facility or 
    perhaps some showing by the Review Board in its reasons of information concerning 
    the facility of which it is able to take official notice.</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It may be that the Board, in this case, is 
    sufficiently knowledgeable of the facilities and resources at Whitby such 
    that it can take official notice of them. If so, it will no doubt make that 
    clear in its reasons following the rehearing should it decide to confirm its 
    decision transferring Mr. Tulikorpi to Whitby. If not, then in my respectful 
    opinion, the Board should gather information on this subject before specifying 
    Whitby as the hospital to which Mr. Tulikorpi is to be transferred.  The same, 
    of course, would apply to any other medium security facility the Board might 
    have in mind.</span></p>
