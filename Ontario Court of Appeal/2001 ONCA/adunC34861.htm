<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction and sentence imposed by Justice

<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span> </h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted of three offences:  1) uttering a forged 
  document; 2)&nbsp;breach of recognizance; and 3) fraud under $5,000.  He was 
  sentenced to nine months’ incarceration.  He appeals both his conviction and 
  sentence.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to conviction, the appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  
  First, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his assessment of 
  the identification evidence, that this error affects the verdicts on all counts, 
  and the verdicts are unreasonable. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The manager of a courier franchise complained to the police about a 
  customer who tried to send a package to Turkey by charging the delivery cost 
  to the account of a company, Ebony, that did not have an account with UPS as 
  alleged.  The package when opened was found to contain forged cheques.  The 
  manager did not give an initial description of the  customer.  The manager was 
  shown a photo line-up and initially picked out another person as the person 
  sending the packages but, upon being shown the next photo line-up, immediately 
  said he was mistaken and identified the appellant as definitely being the person 
  who sent the packages.  The appellant submits that the initial misidentification 
  of the person alleged to be the culprit means that the identification evidence 
  is unreliable and the trial judge erred in his acceptance of it. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The circumstances under which the identification was made were of good 
  quality.  The manager of the courier franchise testified that he had seen the 
  appellant on ten occasions and personally dealt with the appellant on approximately 
  five prior occasions.   He specifically recalled that the appellant had sent 
  packages in March, June, July and the date in question – September 23, 1999 
  – and on each prior occasion he had spent approximately five minutes with the 
  person sending the packages in close proximity.  He testified that he remembered 
  the appellant because he was obnoxious and required special handling.  The appellant 
  was also one of approximately one hundred customers of Ebony.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge was alive to the issue of misidentification.  He found, 
  however, that the manager was a reliable witness.  It was open to him to do 
  so.  We cannot retry this case. The appeal on this ground is dismissed.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Secondly, the appellant submits that not all of the elements of uttering 
  have been made out and that at most he is guilty of attempted uttering.  The 
  submission is that the document was not in fact uttered or dealt with by the 
  intended recipient as if it was genuine.  This argument was not made to the 
  trial judge.  The Crown concedes the point.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, we would allow the conviction appeal to the extent of quashing 
  Count 1 for uttering a forged document and, in its stead, we would substitute 
  a conviction for the included offence of attempting to utter a forged document.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As to sentence, there is no reason to depart from the joint submission 
  of a sentence of three months in light of the above.  Bearing in mind that the 
  offence of attempted uttering is less serious than uttering, leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted and the sentence on Count 1 is reduced to three months concurrent.</p>
