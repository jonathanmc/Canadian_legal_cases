  </span></span> The appellant’s sentence appeal arises from the context in which 
  the sentence was imposed.  This was the appellant’s second trial on the charges.  
  He was convicted of the offences at the first trial and received a sentence 
  of 32 months incarceration from Justice Edythe MacDonald.  The appellant contends 
  that, although a sentence of 44 months was within the appropriate range and 
  although Forestell J. referred to the appropriate principles, it was unfair 
  to impose a significantly higher sentence at the second trial.</p>

  </span></span> The Crown concedes that the trial judge and the Crown made errors 
  relating to the first three grounds of appeal.  However, the Crown contends 
  that the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> should be 
  applied because the three errors did not result in a substantial wrong or a 
  miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> I agree that there were three errors in A.R.’s second trial.  
  I would describe two of the errors as serious and the third as minor.  I do 
  not think that the proviso can be applied in this case.  Hence a new trial, 
  regrettably because it will be the third, is necessary.</p>

  it is unnecessary to consider them in these reasons, I do not think there is 
  merit in the final five grounds of  A.R. ’s appeal.  </p>

  </span></span> A.R. was convicted of indecent assault and incest against his 
  daughter, Kathleen (“Kathy”), which occurred some 20 years prior to the trial 
  when she was 15 or 16 years old.  The allegations involved sexual intercourse 
  on three or four occasions and touching and fondling.</p>

  the complainant, a sister, a brother, a childhood friend and a woman who lived 
  with the family during part of the relevant time.  The appellant, who conducted

  </span></span> At trial, the Crown adduced evidence from the complainant and 
  from other Crown witnesses about prior statements made by the complainant disclosing 
  various sexual assaults on her by her father.  During her testimony, the complainant 
  stated on, by my count, seven occasions that she had told others what her father 
  was doing to her.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is a general exclusionary rule against the admission of 
  self-serving evidence to support the credibility of a witness.  The rule is 
  usually applied to the prior consistent statements of a witness:  see Sopinka, 
  Lederman and Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. 
  (Toronto: Butterworths, 1999), at p. 313.  However, the rule is not absolute.  
  Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant list eight exceptions to the rule in their text.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown relies on two of the eight exceptions in this appeal.  
  The Crown contends that the evidence of the complainant’s prior complaints and 
  prior consistent statements (from both the complainant and from other Crown 
  witnesses) was admissible to rebut allegations of recent fabrication and as 
  part of the narrative relating to the various incidents.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not accept, for two reasons, that the evidence relating 
  to prior complaints and prior consistent statements was admissible under the 
  first exception.  First, the Crown did not indicate to the court that it was 
  seeking to introduce the evidence of prior statements to rebut an allegation 
  of recent fabrication:  see <i>R. v. F. (J.E.)</i> (1993), 85 C.C.C. (3d) 457 
  (Ont. C.A.), and Paciocco and Stuesser, <i>The Law of Evidence</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 1999), at p. 305.  Second, although  A.R.’s defence 
  ultimately unfolded as an attack on the credibility of the complainant and other 
  Crown witnesses, especially his son Keith, almost all of the evidence about 
  the complainant’s prior complaints and prior consistent statements was introduced 
  before the defence made any allegation of fabrication.  Indeed, most of the 
  evidence in this category was introduced during the examination-in-chief of 
  the complainant, who was the second Crown witness.  In short, there was virtually 
  nothing in the nature of <i>rebuttal</i> in the Crown evidence about the complainant’s 
  prior complaints and statements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do agree with the Crown’s submission that the evidence about 
  the complainant’s prior complaints and statements was admissible under the narrative 
  exception.  In <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>, Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant 
  note that narrative is of particular importance in cases where there has been 
  a history of sexual abuse: “[i]n such cases, it may be necessary for the jury 
  to hear the former statements so that they can better appreciate the unfolding 
  of events”.  In <i>R. v. F. (J.E.)</i>, Finlayson J.A. described the exception 
  in these terms, at p. 472:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It seems to me that the court should look to narrative as an exception 
      to the rule against the admission of previous consistent statements . . 
      . It must be a part of the narrative in the sense that it advances the story 
      from offence to prosecution or explains why so little was done to terminate 
      the abuse or bring the perpetrator to justice.  Specifically, it appears 
      to me to be part of the narrative of a complainant’s testimony when she 
      recounts the assaults, how they came to be terminated, and how the matter 
      came to the attention of the police.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The prior statements must be an essential part of the narrative 
  in order to be admitted and are only admissible for the purpose of understanding 
  the witness’ story.  The evidence is not admissible for the truth of what the 
  witness is now saying.  Also, the evidence of prior consistent statements should 
  only be described in general terms and should not contain much detail as details 
  of the statements would invite the trier of fact to conclude that the witness 
  must be telling the truth by reason of the apparent consistency with the witness’ 
  testimony:  see Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada,

  </span></span> In my view, the evidence in this case about the complainant’s 
  prior complaints and prior consistent statements complies with these strictures 
  relating to the narrative exception to the general exclusionary rule.  The complainant’s 
  testimony, in particular, was central to her experience of being sexually abused 
  by her father and her failure to report the abuse to the police or other authorities 
  when it occurred.  Because she had complained to several people who either did 
  not believe her or did not help her, she may have felt that a complaint to the 
  police at that juncture would have been futile.</p>

  </span></span> Moreover, her testimony on this issue was quite general; she 
  testified principally about the fact of her complaints and statements.  Typical 
  of the complainant’s testimony in this regard was her description of the complaints 
  she made to Judy K., a woman who moved into the home to live with her father:</p>

<p class=No style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The testimony of several 
  Crown witnesses, including a sister, a brother and a childhood friend, about 
  the complainant’s complaints and statements to them was in a similar vein; they 
  confirmed the complainant’s testimony, but did not provide much detail.</span></p>

  </span></span> Accordingly, I conclude that the evidence about the complainant’s 
  prior complaints and prior consistent statements was admissible as narrative.  
  However, that is not the end of the matter on this issue.  When this type of 
  evidence is admitted, it is crucial that the trial judge provide a limiting 
  instruction to the jury regarding the use it can make of the evidence.  As expressed 
  by Finlayson J.A. in <i>F.(J.E.)</i>, at p. 476:</p>

  (1993), 64 O.A.C. 213 at 215-16, where this court stated:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Even though he had treated the evidence as a prior consistent statement, 
      there was nothing in the charge by way of instruction as to its limited 
      evidentiary value.  Nor was such an instruction asked for by either party.  
      Indeed, there was no objection to the charge which recounted the position 
      of the Crown and the defence, and then reviewed the evidence of each of 
      the witnesses.  Whether viewed as a prior consistent statement or a complaint, 
      the evidence in question was not evidence of the truth of the facts stated 
      by the complainant in her testimony.  <i>But left as it was the jury may 
      well have used the evidence for the very purpose they were not to use it, 
      a form of self corroboration</i>.  The jury should have been told that the 
      evidence could not be used as proof of the truth of the facts stated, but 
      was evidence of the fact that she had complained and so, depending on the 
      view the jury took of that evidence, conduct consistent with her story.  
      There was non-direction amounting to misdirection.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> Unfortunately, the trial judge provided no limiting instruction 
  about the use the jury could make of the evidence relating to the complainant’s 
  prior complaints and prior consistent statements.  Indeed, in his jury charge, 
  the trial judge seemed to suggest that the jury could use the evidence of prior 
  complaints as corroboration of the complainant’s testimony about the sexual 
  assaults:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>You will have, as I said, the exhibits. Exhibit number two is a letter 
      written by Kathy to Denise in July of 1979 when these alleged acts were 
      taking place.  This letter was accepted to confirm that it was Kathy’s or 
      can be used as confirming evidence of Kathy’s.</p>

  counsel compounded the problem in her closing address by telling the jury that 
  it could use the evidence of prior complaints and statements as corroboration 
  of the complainant’s testimony:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Kathleen’s credibility was bolstered significantly in this trial by witnesses 
      . . .  She complained to a lot of people when she was a child.  As her father 
      has told her, no one will believe you.  It took 20 years.  But all those 
      witnesses, after 20 years, have now said, yes, she did tell us.  Yes, it 
      did happen.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In my view, both the trial judge’s charge and 
  the Crown’s closing address had the potential to be regarded by the jury as 
  an invitation to use the evidence of prior complaints and statements, in the 
  language from the passage in <i>Lajoie</i> set out above, “for the very purpose 
  they were not to use it, as a form of self-corroboration”.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown relies on several cases in which this court has held 
  that in certain circumstances a limiting instruction is not required because 
  it would have been obvious to the jury that the evidence could only be used 
  to establish the fact of prior complaints and statements, and not as corroboration 
  of the complainant’s testimony about the nature of the sexual assaults:  see 
  <i>R. v. R. (G.)</i> (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 130 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Clark</i> 
  (1995), 87  O.A.C. 178; <i>R. v. S.(P.)</i> (2000), 144 C.C.C. (3d) 120 (Ont. 
  C.A.); and <i>R. v. G.M.,</i> [2000] O.J. 5007 (C.A.).  I do not think these 
  cases govern the present appeal.  In the present case, not only did the trial 
  judge not provide an appropriate limiting instruction; both he and Crown counsel 
  further suggested that the jury could use the evidence about prior complaints 
  and statements as corroboration of the complainant’s testimony generally.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge permitted four different statements to be entered 
  as exhibits, even though the persons who made the statements testified at the 
  trial.  The four statements were: a letter the complainant wrote to her step-mother 
  at the time of the alleged incidents; statements the witnesses Carol W. and 
  Keith, the complainant’s brother, gave to the police; and a letter Keith wrote 
  to the complainant’s psychiatrist in 1995.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown contends that the letter the complainant wrote to her 
  step-mother was admissible as narrative and was relevant to her attempts to 
  stop the abuse.  I agree with this submission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown concedes that the two statements given to the police 
  and Keith’s letter to the complainant’s psychiatrist should not have been made 
  exhibits.  This is a fair concession.  As a general proposition, the Crown is 
  not entitled to make an exhibit of a prior consistent statement by a witness, 
  especially where the statement may contain additional information not disclosed 
  by the witness in his or her testimony in court.  The statement has no evidential 
  value and should not be something the jury takes with it into the jury room:  
  see <i>R. v. Pleich</i> (1980), 55 C.C.C. (2d) 13 (Ont. C.A.); <i> R. v. McShannock</i>

lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown contends that no prejudice was occasioned by the admission 
  of the four statements as evidence.  With respect, I disagree, essentially for 
  two reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>First, the trial judge gave no limiting instruction 
  about the four prior consistent statements.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Second, two of the statements admitted as exhibits 
  contained important information that may well have been misused, by both the 
  jury and the trial judge.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In Carol W.’s statement to the police, but not in her testimony, 
  she said that she had seen Keith touch another brother, Ronnie, in a sexual 
  way and that she had told the father about this who, in turn, told her to mind 
  her own business.  When this matter was broached during A.R.’s cross-examination 
  of Carol W., the trial judge told him “to stay away from that”.  Yet Carol W.’s 
  evidence on this issue was in the jury room as an exhibit.  The jury obviously 
  saw this portion of her statement because they posed this question during their 
  deliberations:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>2. </b>Carol’s statement (#4) includes a reference to sexual conduct 
      between Keith and Ronnie.  During this verbal testimony and Evidence similar 
      dialogue was denied.  This inconsistency in procedure is making it difficult 
      for the jury to determine Keith’s credibility.  Why did the jury receive 
      only part of this information.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=No style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge answered the question by 
  telling the jury that testimony on this issue “was kept out [because] it has 
  nothing to do and is not relevant to this charge at all”.  Yet the jury knew 
  about this alleged incident because Carol W.’s statement stayed with them as 
  an exhibit.  Perhaps it assisted A.R. by raising a doubt in the jury’s mind 
  about Keith’s  credibility.  On the other hand, it may have prejudiced A.R. 
  if the jury thought that if he was the type of man to ignore a sexual assault 
  against one of his children, he might also be the type of man to commit such 
  an assault himself.  It is pure speculation to try to imagine what the jury 
  was thinking about this information.  However, what is clear is that the evidence 
  should not have been before the jury, that the jury noticed and was concerned 
  about it, and that the evidence potentially could have improperly prejudiced 
  A.R.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The other troubling aspect of the statements entered as exhibits 
  relates to Keith’s statement to the police in 1995.  In the statement he said:  
  “She was lying naked on her bed and my dad was lying on top of her.  I was looking 
  from the foot of the bed, I stayed about five minutes and saw Dad having sexual 
  intercourse with Kathy”.  In Keith’s examination-in-chief, the Crown put this 
  portion of the statement to him and asked whether he remembered making it to 
  Sergeant Augustino.  Keith responded:  “I recall the statement, but don’t recall 
  the scene.  When I close my eyes now, I don’t see it.”  Also in his examination-in-chief, 
  Keith’s description of what he saw was different in important respects from 
  his statement to the police.  He described his father as sitting on the bed 
  and rubbing Kathy’s stomach, not lying on top of her.  And he testified that 
  “I looked up and I got to, basically get to know what sex was”, rather than 
  the more explicit “I . . . saw Dad having sexual intercourse with Kathy”.  With 
  respect to these differences, the Crown submits that, when examined properly 
  and in context, the only logical way to understand Keith’s oral testimony is 
  to view what he said (“I learned what sex was that day”) as being the same as 
  what was contained in his statement.  Although there is some merit in this argument, 
  I am concerned with the inconsistencies in his oral evidence and the written 
  statement, especially since the statement was before the jury as an exhibit.  
  Moreover, and quite significantly, in spite of these differences, the trial 
  judge instructed the jury that “if you accept the evidence of Keith, obviously 
  there was intercourse”. In my view, this was an improper and inaccurate instruction.  
  In his testimony, Keith did not adopt the component of his statement to the 
  police relating to “sexual intercourse”.  Further, the inconsistencies between 
  the statement and his testimony did not support the trial judge’s assertion 
  that if the jury believed him “obviously there was intercourse”.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> One of the charges against A.R. was that he committed the offence 
  of indecent assault.  The trial judge read the former s. 149 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> to the jury.  However, he then provided the jury with the definition 
  of “sexual assault”.  When Crown counsel pointed out this error at the conclusion 
  of the trial judge’s charge to the jury and observed that the error “might be 
  a problem” for the jury, the trial judge responded: “No, I do not think I am 
  going to recharge them on that point”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge’s error is probably explicable on the basis that 
  the <i>Criminal Code</i> was amended in 1983; the single offence of sexual assault 
  replaced the former offences of indecent assault and rape.  The elements of 
  the former offence of indecent assault and the current offence of sexual assault 
  are essentially the same.  Accordingly, in my view, the Crown’s submission in 
  its factum on this issue is correct: “the trial judge’s inadvertent mistake 
  could not have had any impact on the outcome of the trial . . . the judge’s 
  instructions on this issue would have been correct had he simply replaced the 
  word ‘sexual’ with the word ‘indecent’ in this portion of his charge”.</p>

  in his submission that he “was entitled to have the jury instructed with respect 
  to the elements of the offence he was charged with and not with the elements

  error in this regard as a relatively minor one.</span></p>

  </span></span> Where the Crown seeks to rely on the curative proviso, it must 
  establish either “(i) that the error was minor and inconsequential and could 
  not possibly have affected the verdict; or (ii) that although the error was 
  potentially serious, the evidence is so overwhelming that the verdict would 
  inevitably have been the same had the jury been properly instructed”:  see <i>R. 
  v. W. (L.K.)</i> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 472 (Ont. C.A.).  In the present 
  appeal, in light of my characterization of the three errors, the second of these 
  inquiries is in play.  Moreover, it is in play against the backdrop of the clear 
  instruction of the Supreme Court of Canada that the proviso must be “used with 
  great circumspection” lest it “would effectively deprive accused persons of 
  the right to have their guilt or innocence determined by a properly instructed 
  jury of their peers”:  see <i>R. v. B. (F.F.)</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 112

  </span></span> I cannot conclude that this is a proper case for applying the 
  proviso.  Although the complainant’s evidence was strong and not seriously contradicted 
  and although there was some corroborating evidence from various witnesses, my 
  review of the record does not make me confident that the verdict would inevitably 
  have been the same if the errors had not been made.  In my view, the two serious 
  errors relating to prior consistent statements and improper admission and use 
  of exhibits could have affected the verdict.  The jury saw too much that it 
  should not have seen, was instructed erroneously with respect to crucial testimony 
  of the most important of the Crown’s corroborating witnesses, and was not instructed 
  properly with respect to permissible, and impermissible, uses of major components 
  of the Crown evidence at trial.  Accordingly, I am not prepared to conclude 
  that the jury’s verdict is a safe one.</p>

  trial were also made on the first trial of this matter.  At both trials, the 
  appellant represented himself, which makes it more difficult for Crown counsel

  However, it will be incumbent on Crown counsel and, of course, the trial judge
