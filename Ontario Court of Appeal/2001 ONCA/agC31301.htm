<p>On appeal from the conviction entered by Justice Edward F. Wren, sitting with 
  a jury, dated November 20, 1998 and the sentence imposed on December 18, 1998.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>*</span></a></p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants were convicted of sexual assault.  It was alleged that 
  they and two others gang raped a 15 year old girl who had previously dated A.  
  A. was also convicted of threatening the complainant in a telephone conversation 
  a short time after the rapes and with breaching a recognizance.  This endorsement 
  addresses the issues raised on both appeals.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>1.         The Crown’s closing argument</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> B. testified that he engaged in consensual sexual activity with the 
  complainant after a person named “Allan” had done so.  According to B.’s testimony, 
  comments made by Allan immediately after Allan had engaged in sexual activity 
  with the complainant led to B.’s consensual sexual activity with the complainant.  
  B. said that he did not know Allan, but that Allan was a friend of A.  In cross-examination, 
  B. agreed that once he became aware that the victim was alleging that she did 
  not consent to the sexual activity, he made no attempt to locate or contact 
  Allan and did not even so much as ask A. about Allan.  In closing argument, 
  Crown counsel contended that B.’s indifference to Allan’s whereabouts, or even 
  his existence, was inconsistent with B.’s testimony as to how the consensual 
  sexual activity had occurred, but was consistent with an attempt to shield a 
  co-perpetrator from exposure to the justice system.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Whatever force this argument may have had, it was open to the Crown 
  on the evidence.  The Crown did not suggest that B. had an obligation to assist 
  the police or an obligation to produce witnesses.  The Crown simply argued that 
  B.’s evidence was not credible given his own conduct after the relevant events.  
</p>
<h4 class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>2. <b>        </b>B.'s evidence and the verdict against A. </h4>
<p class=headingtitle style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A. did not testify, but did rely on B.’s evidence to the extent that 
  it contradicted the evidence of the complainant concerning sexual activity with 
  A.  Counsel for the appellant argues that the trial judge should have told the 
  jury that A. was entitled to be acquitted if the evidence of B. left them with 
  a reasonable doubt as to A.’s culpability.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge repeatedly told the jury that A. must be acquitted if 
  based on all of the evidence they had a reasonable doubt as to his culpability.  
  The trial judge also told the jury that the onus was on the Crown to prove the 
  absence of consent.  Finally, with respect to the two conflicting versions of 
  events advanced by the complainant and B., the trial judge told the jury that 
  they were not to choose between the two, but must acquit <u>the accused</u>, 
  if after considering all of the evidence they had a reasonable doubt as to guilt.  
  He did not limit this instruction to B.  These instructions made it clear that 
  A. was entitled to be acquitted if the jury had a reasonable doubt as to whether 
  his sexual activity was consensual, whatever the evidentiary source of that 
  doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Even if the trial judge should have instructed the jury in the manner 
  described by the appellant, a failure to do so caused no prejudice to A.  The 
  jury was told that it must acquit B. if his evidence left them with a reasonable 
  doubt as to his guilt.  The jury convicted B.  It is impossible to imagine how 
  the jury could have totally rejected B.’s evidence as it applied to B., but 
  somehow had a reasonable doubt based on that very same evidence as it applied 
  to A.</p>
<h4 class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>3.<b>        </b> The &quot;Miller&quot; error</h4>
<p class=headingtitle style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge repeatedly told the jury that its verdict must be based 
  on all of the evidence.  Unlike <i>R. v. Miller</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 517 
  (Ont. C.A.), the trial judge did not tell the jury to proceed through their 
  deliberations with a two-step approach, first determining the facts and then 
  the verdict based on the facts as found.  Nor, did the trial judge tell the 
  jury that an acquittal could be based only on evidence that was accepted.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s clear indication to the jury that the Crown could 
  prove its case based only on evidence that the jury accepted as true was a correct 
  instruction in law.  Similarly, his instruction that the jury should look for 
  evidence confirming the complainant’s evidence only in evidence it found to 
  be credible was a proper instruction. </p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>4.         The re-reading of the complainant’s evidence</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The jury asked to have a part of the complainant’s testimony read to 
  it during its deliberations.  With the support of at least counsel for one of 
  the appellants (the other said nothing), the trial judge asked the jury to clarify 
  its request.  In doing so, the trial judge distinguished between examination-in-chief 
  and cross-examination.  He told the jury that the cross-examination was more 
  difficult to locate and read back than was examination-in-chief.  The trial 
  judge made it clear, however, that both the examination-in-chief and cross-examination 
  could be made available to the jury.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The jury clarified its areas of concern and told the trial judge that 
  it needed to hear only the examination-in-chief.  Without objection by counsel 
  for either appellant, the trial judge proceeded to have the reporter read back 
  a large part of the complainant’s examination-in-chief.  This exchange between 
  the judge and the foreperson of the jury followed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Court:  I had mentioned to you, but you appear from your answers to 
      be satisfied with having this and not having the cross-examination?  </p>
    <p>The Juror:  That’s correct, sir.</p>
    <p>The Court:  If there is anything else then we will remain at your disposal. 
      …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Immediately after the jury retired, the trial judge became concerned 
  that he should have required that the jury hear the parts of the complainant’s 
  cross-examination dealing with the topics raised by the jury.  After consultation 
  with counsel, the trial judge recalled the jury to tell them that the cross-examination 
  could be made available to them.  He reminded them that the purpose of cross-examination 
  was to test the reliability and the truth of the evidence given in examination-in-chief.  
  The trial judge told the jury that there was a danger in looking only at the 
  victim’s evidence in-chief.  He admonished the jury that concerns about lengthening 
  the proceedings should not inhibit them from listening to the cross-examination.  
  He concluded by telling the jury that if it was their firm decision not to hear 
  the cross-examination, he would abide by that decision.   The jury responded 
  with the following note:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The members of the jury did not request more than the testimony of the 
      Crown in order to conserve time.  The reasons for the request were the sequence 
      of events according to P.H. [the complainant] alone during a brief period 
      and the wording according to Ms. H. of the alleged threat.  The jury has 
      been polled on the above and are unanimous in their decision.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The jury announced that it had a verdict in the same note.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge was obviously trying to respond to the jury’s question 
  in a way that would provide the most assistance to the jury.  He received little 
  help from counsel in that endeavour.  In our view, the trial judge was wrong 
  to distinguish between examination-in-chief and cross-examination when seeking 
  clarification from the jury as to its areas of concern.  The trial judge’s remarks 
  could have discouraged the jury from including the cross-examination in its 
  request to rehear certain evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is not uncommon for a jury to request to have evidence made available 
  to it during the course of its deliberations.  Where their request is unclear 
  or so broad as to make compliance impractical in the context of an ongoing jury 
  trial, it is entirely appropriate for the trial judge to seek clarification 
  of that request.  If the trial judge seeks clarification, he should attempt 
  to have the jury identify the areas of the evidence that are of interest to 
  them.  They may do so by reference to the witnesses, by reference to topics, 
  or in some other way.  The trial judge should not say anything that might invite 
  the jury to pick and choose from among the various parts of the evidence it 
  has identified as relevant to its request.  After the trial judge has clarified 
  the jury’s request to the extent possible, the jury should be excused and counsel 
  invited to make submissions as to what parts of the evidence should be read 
  to the jury.  The trial judge is entitled to the assistance of counsel and will 
  no doubt give considerable weight to counsel’s submissions as to which parts 
  of their examination or cross-examination should be read to the jury.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The aim must be to provide the jury with all of the evidence that is 
  responsive to the question regardless of whether that evidence comes by way 
  of examination-in-chief, cross-examination or reply.  While the trial judge 
  no doubt has some leeway not to read evidence which is simply repetitive of 
  evidence already read, he or she must proceed cautiously.  Repetition is not 
  necessarily harmful.  Where evidence in-chief has been read to the jury, the 
  trial judge must include any cross-examination which weakens or qualifies the 
  part of the examination-in-chief which has been read to the jury:  <i>R. v. 
  Olbey</i> (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 257 at 273 (S.C.C.).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for both appellants cross-examined the victim on matters referred 
  to in the part of the victim’s evidence read to the jury.  Neither cross-examination 
  was extensive.  As a result of that cross-examination, three relatively minor 
  inconsistencies or qualifications were revealed in the complainant’s testimony.  
  At least those parts of the cross-examination should have been re-read to the 
  jury.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are satisfied, however, that the failure to read those parts of the 
  cross-examination did not prejudice the appellants.  Of the minor inconsistencies, 
  only one related to the actual events at which the jury’s question was directed.  
  That inconsistency did not go to a crucial element of the allegation against 
  either appellant.  In addition, that inconsistency had been mentioned by the 
  trial judge in the course of his review of the position taken on behalf of the 
  appellants.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was no suggestion by counsel for the appellants at trial that 
  the relevant parts of the cross-examination should be read to the jury until 
  the trial judge raised the issue.  No doubt, counsel realized that a reading 
  of the cross-examination pertaining to the topics to which the jury’s question 
  was directed would result in a repetition of a great deal of the evidence given 
  by the complainant during her examination-in-chief.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we know exactly what this jury 
  was concerned about.  As indicated in their final note to the trial judge, all 
  twelve jurors were interested in “the sequence of events according to P.H.” 
  and “the wording of the alleged threat”.  Nothing said in cross-examination 
  qualified the victim’s evidence given in-chief on either of these matters.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>5.         The sentence appeals</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The sentences were substantial and deservedly so.  This was a vicious 
  gang rape of a young girl by four men.  The appellants are young, come from 
  good families and have enjoyed academic success.  Despite these mitigating factors, 
  nothing short of a significant penitentiary term could adequately reflect the 
  seriousness of the assault on the complainant.  The appellants also have criminal 
  records involving crimes of violence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s reasons for sentence demonstrate no error in principle 
  and the length of the sentence imposed cannot be said to be manifestly unreasonable.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The conviction appeals are dismissed.  Leave to appeal the sentences 
  is granted and the sentence appeals are dismissed.</p>
