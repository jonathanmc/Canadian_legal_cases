  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The narrow focus of this appeal is 
  whether Kealey J. erred in refusing to permit the Attorney General of Canada 
  (the Crown) to amend its statement of defence and counterclaim to plead negligent 
  misrepresentation, professional negligence and conspiracy against Andersen Consulting 
  of Canada (ACC) and to add Andersen Consulting of the United States (ACUS) and 
  Andersen International (AI) as defendants by counterclaim and assert claims 
  against them for negligence and conspiracy.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>For reasons that follow, I am of 
  the view that Kealey J. should have permitted the proposed amendments. Accordingly, 
  I would allow the appeal.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>BACKGROUND FACTS</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The litigation between the Crown 
  and ACC has its genesis in a four-phase project known as the Public Service 
  Compensation System (PSCS). Initiated by the Auditor General of Canada in the 
  late 1980s, the project involved the assessment, design, construction and implementation 
  of a computer system capable of automating salary and other forms of compensation 
  for all Crown employees. Although ACC was involved in PSCS from its inception, 
  it is the construction phase of the project that gives rise to the present litigation.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The construction phase began in August 
  1993 pursuant to a contract executed by the parties on August 26, 1993. The 
  contract is accurately described by Kealey J. in his reasons as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Needless to say, this is a most comprehensive 
      document. It comprises more than 72 volumes of detailed provisions, technical 
      specifications, standards, procedures, schedules, plans and other materials. 
      Included is a main contract document, 46 pages in length, incorporating 
      16 annexes, some of which in turn refer to voluminous appendices. The contract 
      price was $48,026,500.60, and the agreed schedule to complete was 32 months.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In April 1995, the Crown terminated 
  the contract prior to its completion and on June 27, 1996, ACC commenced an 
  action against the Crown seeking damages for wrongful termination. In its statement 
  of defence dated July 29, 1996, the Crown took the position that the termination 
  was justified because ACC had consistently failed to comply with its obligations 
  under the contract and in the Crown's view, it was incapable of doing so. As 
  for the counterclaim, the Crown essentially sought damages arising from ACC's 
  failure to perform the contract.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The litigation moved along at a snail's 
  pace throughout 1997 and the first half of 1998. In February 1997, ACC served 
  a sworn affidavit of documents which the Crown considered to be unsatisfactory 
  then and now. In February 1998, ACC made some amendments to its claim without 
  objection from the Crown. In May of that year, after advising ACC of its intention 
  to amend its pleadings, the Crown delivered a first draft of a proposed amended 
  statement of defence and counterclaim. The amendments did not include claims 
  in tort or conspiracy, nor did they include a request to add parties.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Also in May 1998, the Crown moved 
  for disclosure of a complete list of all of ACC’s partners worldwide from June 
  1989 to April 1995. Binks J., the case management judge at the time, concluded 
  that although a commercial association existed between ACC and ACUS and AI (its 
  extended corporate family), the latter two entities were not parties to the 
  PSCS construction contract or the action as pleaded. Accordingly, he dismissed 
  the Crown's motion.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>That is how matters stood in the 
  summer of 1998 when the parties entered into settlement discussions and agreed 
  to hold the action in abeyance. The settlement discussions lasted from August 
  1998 to August 1999, during which time the Crown carefully reviewed all of the 
  factual and legal issues arising from the documents produced. The discussions 
  ultimately proved futile and on August 31, 1999, the law firm of Meighen, Demers, 
  newly retained by the Crown as lead counsel, advised ACC of its intention to 
  amend the Crown's statement of defence and counterclaim. To that end, on September 
  28, 1999, the amended statement of defence and counterclaim that forms the subject 
  matter of this appeal was delivered to ACC's counsel. Given ACC's refusal to 
  consent to the proposed amendments, the Crown moved before Kealey J., the newly-appointed 
  case management judge, for leave to amend its pleadings.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The motion to amend was initially 
  scheduled for December 8, 1999 in order to accommodate ACC's counsel. It did 
  not proceed on that date due to ACC's last-minute delivery on December 3 of 
  a cross-motion and six volumes of responding material. The matter was finally 
  heard on June 15, and 16, 2000 and Kealey J. released his decision on December 
  8, 2000.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>As against ACC, the 
  Crown seeks to add claims for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation 
  and professional negligence. With respect to the former, the amended pleadings 
  allege that ACC made various representations about the design of the PSCS and 
  Foundation 2.0, the computer assisted software engineering (CASE) tool needed 
  to implement it, which the Crown relied upon and which ACC knew or should have 
  known were false. With respect to the latter, the Crown alleges that ACC was 
  negligent in the work it performed during the construction phase of the PSCS. 
  In this regard, the amended pleadings refer to the duty and standard of care 
  owed by ACC to the Crown and specify 18 instances in which ACC allegedly breached 
  its duty of care. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>As against ACUS and 
  AI, apart from seeking to add both entities as defendants by counterclaim, the 
  amended pleadings assert a products liability claim against them, alleging that 
  they manufactured and authorized the Foundation 2.0 CASE tool for use during 
  the construction phase of the PSCS despite knowing of its inadequacies and deficiencies.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Kealey J. refused 
  to allow the proposed tort claims because in his view, they were precluded by 
  the terms of the contract which he characterized as &quot;a complete code and 
  the primary and sole source of actionable conduct …&quot;. Considering &quot;the 
  whole tenor of the contract&quot;, and certain key provisions in it, he concluded 
  that the contract exhibited &quot;an intent to exclude reliance on common law 
  standards&quot;. The key provisions to which he referred are sections&nbsp;19 
  and 27 headed &quot;Limitation of Liability&quot;, section 25 entitled &quot;Liquidated 
  Damages&quot; and section 36 headed &quot;Entire Agreement&quot;.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In sum, based on his 
  assessment of the contract, it was Kealey J.'s view that the parties intended 
  to negative the right to sue in tort and that the proposed claim against ACC 
  for professional negligence was therefore untenable in law. With respect to 
  the claim against ACC for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation, Kealey 
  J. held that the same reasoning applied &quot;even more forcefully&quot; in 
  light of &quot;the 'entire agreement clause' in s. 36 of the contract&quot;. 
  In his view, &quot;any claims based on representations by ACC to the Crown clash 
  headlong with s. 36 and are untenable&quot;. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>As for the tort claim 
  against ACUS and AI, Kealey J. rejected the proposed amendments on the basis 
  that the Crown was aware throughout that staff from both entities &quot;were 
  directly engaged in supplementing ACC's forces by providing skill and technical 
  know-how to enable fulfillment of the work called for in the contract. They 
  rendered services directly designed to further the contract objectives. Their 
  involvement was promoted and expected by the Crown&quot;. In these circumstances, 
  it was Kealey J.'s view that the foreign entities should be treated as third 
  party beneficiaries and afforded the same contractual exemption from tort claims 
  as that afforded to ACC.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ANALYSIS</span></b></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In determining that 
  the Crown was foreclosed from suing ACC in tort, Kealey J. interpreted the contract 
  and concluded that it was the intention of the parties to negative the right 
  to sue in tort. It followed, in his view, that the proposed tort claims were 
  untenable in law having regard to the general rule, enunciated in <i>Central 
  Trust v. Rafuse</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 147 and restated at p. 26 of <i>B.C .Hydro 
  v. B.G. Checo</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12 that:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>. . . where a given wrong <i>prima facie</i> 
      supports an action in contract and in tort, the party may sue in either 
      or both, except where the contract indicates that the parties intended to 
      limit or negative the right to sue in tort.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The general rule, sometimes referred to as the rule against concurrent 
  actions, is a sound one and its legitimacy is not contested. At issue is its 
  application in circumstances such as these, where one party seeks to invoke 
  it to either strike out a particular pleading or resist an application by the 
  other side to amend its pleadings. In such circumstances, I believe that the 
  rule should be applied sparingly and only in the clearest of cases.  This accords 
  with the general principles applicable to pleadings and the amendment of pleadings, 
  outlined below at paragraphs 34 and 37.</p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The present case illustrates the need to proceed with caution. 
  In oral argument, the respondents did not even attempt to justify the motion 
  judge's reliance on ss.19, 25 or 27 of the contract. In effect, they conceded 
  that those clauses either had nothing to do with the &quot;concurrent actions&quot; 
  issue or they were sufficiently ambiguous to be of little or no assistance. 
  Instead, they relied almost exclusively on s.36,  the &quot;Entire Agreement&quot; 
  clause, submitting that it was the key provision in the contract that foreclosed 
  the Crown from suing ACC in tort. That section reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>s. 36  <b>ENTIRE AGREEMENT</b></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The Contract constitutes the entire and sole 
      agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter of the 
      Contract and supersedes all previous negotiations, communications and other 
      agreements, whether written or oral relating to it, unless they are incorporated 
      by reference in the Contract. There are no terms, covenants, representations, 
      statements or conditions binding on the parties other than those contained 
      in the Contract.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect, it is 
  not at all clear to me how s. 36 can be read to bar a claim against ACC for 
  professional negligence where the claim relates to the negligent performance 
  of work by ACC during the construction phase. Perhaps the parties intended the 
  clause to have that meaning, but that is not something that could be determined 
  at the pleading stage. As for the claim against ACC for fraudulent and/or negligent 
  misrepresentation, while s. 36 would certainly appear to be relevant, there 
  are, in my view, several reasons why it cannot be used at this stage to preclude 
  the proposed amendments. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>First, some of the 
  alleged misrepresentations relate to statements made after the contract had 
  been consummated and while the construction work was being performed. In those 
  circumstances, I question whether s. 36 would apply. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As for representations made before the contract was finalized, 
  it is well established  that disclaimer clauses such as s. 36 cannot be invoked 
  to resist allegations of fraudulent misrepresentation. (See <i>Grossman v. Woolf</i> 
  (1990), 44 C.P.C. (2d) 288 (Div.Ct.)) Although it may have come as a surprise 
  to counsel for the respondents, counsel for the Crown confirmed in oral argument 
  that the proposed pleadings did allege fraudulent misrepresentation against 
  ACC. Accordingly, to that extent at least, s. 36 cannot act as a bar to the 
  proposed amendments. </p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Nor, in my view, can 
  it act as a bar at this stage to the alternate claim of negligent misrepresentation. 
  The law is clear that disclaimer clauses such as s.&nbsp;36 will not bar claims 
  of negligent misrepresentation &quot;where the representation is as to some 
  overriding or collateral matter&quot;. (See <i>Hayward v. Mellick</i> (1984), 
  45 O.R. (2d) 110 at p.117 (Ont.C.A.)) At this juncture, I cannot say with certainty 
  that the alleged negligent misstatements, or at least some of them, do not come 
  within this category. Accordingly, s. 36 cannot be invoked to bar the negligent 
  misrepresentation claim.</span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>For these reasons, 
  I am of the view that the motions judge erred in refusing to permit the proposed 
  tort claims against ACC on the basis that they are untenable in law. Given this 
  conclusion, it follows that in so far as the tort claims against ACUS and AI 
  are concerned, the motions judge also erred in concluding that those entities 
  could shelter under the terms of the contract. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Even if the motions 
  judge had been correct in holding that the contract shielded ACC from tort claims, 
  I fail to see how that finding could assist ACUS or AI. The motions judge was 
  of the view that because the Crown knew that employees from those two entities

  is a products liability claim against ACUS and AI as manufacturers and distributors

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The proposed conspiracy 
  claims assert that ACC, ACUS and AI (the Andersen parties) engaged in two separate 
  conspiracies to injure the Crown by unlawful means. In summary form, the first 
  alleges that the Andersen parties, though fully aware of problems with the Foundation 
  2.0 CASE tool that made it inadequate for the PSCS project, actively conspired 
  to conceal that information from the Crown to avoid adverse publicity and maintain 
  the marketability of Foundation products. The second alleges that AI and AUS 
  conspired together with ACC to have ACC breach the PSCS contract as part of 
  a &quot;strategy to attempt to eliminate or minimize the impact to Andersen 
  Consulting and shift the blame for delay [in the project] to the Crown&quot;. 
  It is further alleged that AI engaged in this conspiracy to avoid having to 
  &quot;subsidize Andersen Canada for each year that the net income of Andersen 
  Canada fell below a reasonably adequate level&quot; and that ACUS did so because 
  it realized that it was not only &quot;losing the prospect of profits [from 
  the project]&quot; but that it could &quot;no longer hope to recoup the substantial 
  amounts . . . it had invested into the PSCS project . . .&quot;.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span> </span>The motions judge refused to allow the proposed 
  &quot;conspiracy&quot; amendments because in his view, they were &quot;not sufficiently 
  independent of the breach of contract claims to stand on their own as a permissible 
  basis for a separate cause&quot;. Rather, he viewed them as being &quot;so entwined 
  in the alleged breach of contract&quot; pleadings that the two causes of action 
  merged.  In this regard, citing this court’s decision in <i>Normart Management 
  Ltd. v. West Hill Redevelopment Co.</i> (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 97, he observed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… for a conspiracy claim to be permitted to go forward as an alternative 
      claim in a breach of contract action it must be based on conduct distinct 
      from that alleged to constitute the breach itself.  As well, interests specific 
      to each of the alleged conspirators must be identified.  </p>

  </span></span> Kealey J. found that the first component was not met because 
  &quot;the alleged conspiratorial acts and objectives are all intricately concerned 
  with matters pertaining to the performance and/or breach of the contract in 
  question&quot;.  As for the second component, he concluded that the amended 
  pleadings failed to establish a separate or individual interest on the part 
  of ACUS and AI from that of ACC.  In this regard, he observed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Moreover, considering all the evidence and 
      submissions on this aspect of the case, I am satisfied no separate or individual 
      interests existed among the three entities [ACC, ACUS and AI] at any time 
      regarding the subject contract, except its due completion. Each provided 
      needed skill and talent. Each expected proper payment for so doing. Each 
      anticipated enhancement of their good reputation from participation. <u>The 
      presence of some convincing individual motive or separate interest suggesting 
      or supporting conspiratorial conduct in some manner is an ingredient which 
      could help sustain such a plea, but there is a notable absence of these 
      here</u>. (Emphasis added.)</span></p>

  </span></span> The issue upon which <i>Normart </i> was decided was the sustainability 
  of the pleadings in that case, not the doctrine of merger.  Any discussion in 
  the decision about the doctrine of merger is obiter.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span>

<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  </span></span> In <i>Normart</i>, the personal claims in conspiracy against 
  the directors of the defendant companies were struck out because the facts underlying 
  the conspiracy allegations were identical to the facts underlying the claims 
  against the companies for breach of contract and breach of fiduciary duty.  
  In other words, as Finlayson J.A. pointed out at p. 102, there were no allegations 
  that the directors engaged in conduct that was &quot;either tortious in itself&quot; 
  or exhibited &quot;a separate identity or interest from that of the corporations 
  such as to make the acts or conduct complained of those of the directing minds. 
  (citation omitted)&quot; Hence, the personal claims in conspiracy were found 
  to be unsustainable.</p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> That is a far cry from the present case, where the facts pleaded 
  in support of the conspiracy claims against the Andersen parties are very different 
  from the facts pleaded against ACC for the breach of contract claim.  The fact 
  that there may be some overlap or that the allegations relate to the same contract 
  is in my view, of no moment.  It follows that the motions judge erred in concluding 
  that the conspiracy claims must fail because they were not “based on conduct 
  distinct from that alleged to constitute the breach [of contract] itself.”</p>

  </span></span> Given the factual differences that exist between the conspiracy 
  allegations and the breach of contract allegations, this court’s decision in 
  <i>Berry v. Pulley </i>(2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 169 makes it clear that the two 
  causes of action can co-exist in law.  The relevant passage is found at p. 179, 
  where Sharpe J.A. for the court, observed that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>A claim for tortious conspiracy to deprive 
      a party of contractual rights is plainly distinct from a claim for breach 
      of those contractual rights.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>I am also of the view 
  that the motions judge erred in rejecting the conspiracy claims on the basis 
  that the amended pleadings fail to establish a sufficient separate or individual 
  interest on the part of AI and ACUS from that of ACC. In this respect, the fact 
  that certain employees from the two foreign entities may have performed work 
  for ACC with the knowledge and approval of the Crown does not foreclose the 
  possibility that the same individuals, wearing a different hat, may have acted 
  on behalf of their corporate employers in furtherance of the alleged conspiracies. 
  Unfortunately, it would appear that the motions judge did not appreciate this 
  distinction. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In relation to this 
  issue, the motions judge was clearly influenced by what he described as the 
  lack of &quot;some convincing individual motive or separate interest suggesting 
  or supporting conspiratorial conduct in some manner&quot; on the part of ACUS 
  and AI. With respect, the pleadings do specify a separate motive for the respective 
  conspirators and it was not for the motions judge to weigh that evidence at 
  this stage and discard it as &quot;unconvincing&quot;. Rather, the law is clear 
  that unless the facts alleged are based on assumptive or speculative conclusions 
  that are incapable of proof, they must be accepted as proven and the court should 
  not look beyond the pleadings to determine whether the action can proceed. (See 
  <i>Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen</i> [1985], 1 S.C.R. 441 at 445 and 
  <i>Prete v. Ontario</i> (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 161 at p.170 (Ont.C.A.), leave 
  to appeal to Supreme Court of Canada refused (1994), 17 O.R. (3d) xvi.) </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect, I view 
  the latter error as symptomatic of the motion judge's erroneous approach to 
  the matter before him. That approach resulted in his weighing evidence, interpreting 
  controversial contractual provisions and making findings of fact, all matters 
  that should have been avoided at the pleading stage. In short, I believe that 
  the motions judge effectively treated the motion to amend as if it were a motion 
  for summary judgment, if not a trial. </span></p>
<p class=MsoHeader> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In approaching the 
  matter as he did, the motions judge was clearly concerned about the length and 
  complexity of trials in general and the impact the proposed amendments were 
  likely to have on the length and complexity of the trial in this case. His concerns 
  appear in the following passage near the end of his reasons:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Fundamentally this is a contract action which 
      as originally framed will take a year, perhaps two years, to try. It involves 
      millions of pages of documentation. Pre-trial examinations have been ongoing 
      and will take months to complete. The issues are substantial and complex. 
      Some three years into the litigation, the Crown seeks to effectively reconstitute 
      the whole dispute and add two parties. What is sought is really much more 
      than a mere amendment. I believe, in this type of case the court is required 
      to closely scrutinize the request and refuse it, except perhaps if some 
      unusual factual scenario might dictate otherwise. This is not such a case. 
      While I am mindful of the principle which suggests reluctance to dismiss 
      an action at this stage, I am also of the view that the ever increasing 
      length and complexity of trials compels a court to be vigilant before allowing 
      what is sought as an amendment here. It is important there be some assurance 
      that only meaningful and necessary issues required to fairly and fully try 
      the cause involved in the law suit are permitted to be put forward.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Without diminishing 
  the concerns raised by the motions judge, they cannot be used to emasculate 
  the well-established rule that amendments like those sought in the present case 
  should be presumptively approved unless they would occasion prejudice that cannot 
  be compensated by costs or an adjournment; they are shown to be scandalous, 
  frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of the court's process; or they disclose no 
  reasonable cause of action. (See generally<i> Atlantic Steel Industries Inc. 
  v. CIGNA Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 12 (Ont.Gen.Div.)

  judge was aware of the correct test. Indeed, he enunciated it at the outset 
  of his reasons. Unfortunately however, in the passage quoted at paragraph 34 
  above, he turned the test on its head and applied a &quot;presumptive refusal&quot; 
  rather than a &quot;presumptive approval&quot; test, stating:</span></p>
