<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Jack H. Jenkins dated October 10, 2000.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent Hunt resigned from her appointment as a producer 
  of insurance with the appellant broker.  Pursuant to a written agreement between 
  the parties, the respondent elected to purchase her &quot;book of business&quot; 
  rather than sell it to the appellant.  This appeal concerns the amount owing 
  to the appellant as a result. The central issue at trial was whether the amount 
  to be paid by the respondent, fixed as a percentage of annual commissions, was 
  to be determined with reference to the commissions for the year past or with 
  reference to the year following the respondent’s resignation.  The trial judge 
  accepted the appellant's contention and granted judgment on the basis that the 
  calculation was to be made on a prospective basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant raised three grounds of appeal:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)    that the trial judge erred in failing to award the appellant $1491.68 
      on account of bad debts;</p>
    <p>(2)    that the trial judge erred in failing to award the plaintiff pre-judgment 
      interest and; </p>
    <p> (3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span> that the trial judge erred in refusing to award the appellant costs.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The first ground of appeal was abandoned during 
  oral argument.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The respondent cross-appeals, alleging that 
  the trial judge erred in his interpretation of the agreement between the parties 
  and that the trial judge erred in dismissing the respondent’s counterclaim.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is convenient to deal first with the cross-appeal.  In our 
  view, there is no merit to the respondent’s contention that the trial judge 
  erred in his interpretation of the agreement.  There was ample support for the 
  trial judge’s finding that the amount the respondent was to pay was to be fixed 
  by reference to commissions received during the year following her resignation.  
  We refer in particular to the terms of the agreement itself, to the subsequent 
  agreement dated February 25, 1994 and signed by both parties, which clearly 
  supports the appellant’s position, and to the decision of this court in <i>Andrew 
  Kowalczewski Insurance Brokers v. Janicki</i> (2000), CarswellOnt. 3650 affirming 
  the decision of Loukidelis J. (November 26, 1998) interpreting a similar agreement. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although the trial judge failed to make any explicit findings 
  with respect to the counterclaim, the parties have treated his judgment as amounting 
  to a dismissal of the counterclaim.  In our view, there is no basis for us to 
  interfere with this result.  The principal element of the counterclaim was the 
  contention that the appellant had wrongfully withheld commissions paid following 
  the respondent’s departure from his brokerage, but prior to the transfer of 
  the respondent’s business to the new broker.  During this interim period the 
  appellant remained the broker of record with all the obligations and responsibilities 
  pertaining thereto.  In our view, the respondent could not expect to receive 
  100% of the commissions during this period.  She was required by virtue of her 
  agreement with the appellant to split the commissions on a 50% - 50% basis and 
  she had gone to another broker where she was subject to a less favourable split 
  of commissions.  The appellant paid her 50% of these commissions and we see 
  no basis for the contention that she was entitled to more.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, the cross-appeal is dismissed with 
  costs.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We allow the appeal on both remaining grounds<b>, 
  </b>the failure to award pre-judgment interest and costs.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge gave no reasons for failing to order pre-judgment 
  interest.  He did say the following with respect to costs:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my view, even though I warned counsel and the parties before this trial 
      started that I wasn’t very happy about this kind of law suit over this amount 
      of money involving this kind of court time and obvious expense to the parties, 
      however, the agreement was prepared by the plaintiff, and there is at least 
      an argument created by the poor wording of the agreement.  I agree with 
      counsel for the defendant that it is a poorly worded document.  It could 
      have been much more precise, and then there wouldn’t be any law suit.  In 
      those circumstances, I’m going to deprive the plaintiff of costs.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In the circumstances of this case, these reasons 
  reflect an error in principle justifying the intervention of this court.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The dispute between the parties revolved around the interpretation 
  of the agreement.  If the respondent’s contention had been accepted, she would 
  still have been obliged to pay the appellant $20,000 for the book of business.  
  The appellant had submitted an offer to settle in the amount of $20,000.  Accordingly, 
  we cannot accept as reasonable the trial judge’s finding that the appellant 
  should bear the brunt of the matter proceeding to trial.  In view of the result 
  reached by the trial judge and in view of the fact that the appellant had offered 
  to settle the case on the basis of the respondent's interpretation of the agreement, 
  there was no basis for the trial judge's refusal to award the appellant costs.  
  In the circumstances, we see no reason to depart from the ordinary result flowing 
  from rule 49.10.  The appellant is entitled to costs on a party and party basis 
  up to the date of the offer to settle and costs on a solicitor client basis 
  thereafter.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge gave no reasons for failing to order pre-judgment 
  interest.  It may be inferred, however, that the reason was the same as that 
  expressed with respect to costs, namely, his apparent displeasure with the appellant 
  for having brought and continued the lawsuit.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the decision to award or withhold pre-judgment interest 
  is a discretionary matter, we are of the view that the trial judge’s failure 
  to award pre-judgment interest reflects an error in principle justifying the 
  intervention of this court.  Pre-judgment interest is ordinarily awarded, absent 
  special circumstances, to reflect the value of money wrongfully withheld from 
  the plaintiff.  On the basis of the trial judge’s findings and in the absence 
  of any valid finding as to special circumstances justifying the refusal of pre-judgment 
  interest, his refusal to order pre-judgment interest cannot be sustained.  The 
  appellant is entitled to pre-judgment interest at the rate prescribed by the 
  <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> from February 1, 1995.<b><u></u></b></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For these reasons, we would allow the appeal 
  with costs, dismiss the cross-appeal with costs and order that the judgment 
  be amended to provide:</span></p>
