lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal and the cross-appeal have been thoroughly argued on each 
  side and we have determined that both should be dismissed.  We shall state our 
  reasons briefly.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the appeal two issues were raised.  The first is that the trial judge 
  erred in dismissing Global Drug Ltd.’s motion to amend its damage claim in the 
  counterclaim.  We accept Global’s submission that the trial judge’s reasons 
  are sparse and that he did not expressly mention the prejudice required by rule 
  26.01.  We are satisfied, however, on the history of the development of the 
  counterclaim and, particularly, the fact that the experts’ reports had been 
  exchanged and trial evidence on the question of damages on each side (in the 
  form of commission evidence) had been given before the motion was made, that 
  the proper conclusion would be that the defendant by counterclaim would be inevitably 
  prejudiced by the amendment.  We do not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second issue on appeal relates to Global’s claim for damages flowing 
  from Apotex’s breach of contract.  It sought damages for loss of profits and, 
  in the alternative, sought compensation for expenditures incurred in part performance 
  of the contract.  Global failed in its claim for loss of profits and has not 
  appealed from this result.  The trial judge quantified Global’s expenditures 
  in the amount of $109,255.  However, he awarded Global nominal damages of $1 
  because, in his view, Apotex had proved that the contract, if performed, would 
  have resulted in a loss to Global, i.e., its expenses would have exceeded the 
  benefits to it under the contract.  In this regard, we read “defendant” in the 
  statement “the defendant has established” on page 36 of the trial judge’s reasons 
  as referring to the defendant by counterclaim.  This is the most sensible reading 
  in the overall context.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As indicated, in the circumstances of this case, to avoid compensating 
  Global for the expenditures that it had incurred in part performance of the 
  contract, Apotex was required to prove that even if it had not breached the 
  contract and the contract had been fully performed, Global inevitably would 
  have suffered a loss on the contract.  Although, perhaps, self-evident, it is 
  Global’s position that it incurred the expenditures on the faith of the contract, 
  expecting that Apotex would perform its obligations under the contract which, 
  as the trial judge found, it failed to do.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this case, the contract was in its initial stages and, Global had 
  not reached the point where it was in receipt of any revenue as the marketing 
  of Apotex’s products had not commenced.  Given that Apotex breached the contract 
  in its early stages, Global contends that it was not possible for Apotex to 
  prove that it would have been unprofitable even if it had been fully performed 
  and that the evidence did not support the trial judge’s finding to this effect. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, on the facts of this case it is not logical to separate 
  Global’s claim for damages for loss of profits from its claim for compensation 
  for its expenditures in part performance of the contract.  It failed to recover 
  damages for loss of profits because, as the trial judge found, it had been unable 
  to prove what, if any, profits it would have earned had the contract been fully 
  performed.  The trial judge found that it was clear from the provisions of the 
  contract that the expenditures were to be borne by Global, which was to be reimbursed 
  for its expenses out of the profits earned on its sale of the Apotex products.  
  Global presented a theory of how it would have profited had the contract been 
  performed which was rejected by the trial judge, largely on the basis of expert 
  evidence presented by Apotex.  It seems obvious that there was evidence that 
  supported the trial judge’s findings, which presumably explains why Global did 
  not appeal from the rejection of its claim for anticipated loss of profits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found on the evidence that Global’s expenses would have 
  exceeded its benefits under the contract if it had been fully performed.  This 
  is essentially the same finding which the trial judge reached in dismissing 
  Global’s claim for loss of profits.  In other words, the fact that Global failed 
  to establish any reasonably anticipated profits is consistent with his analysis 
  and finding that Global was not entitled to recover its expenditures.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Global’s effort to try to separate the two claims and argue that Apotex 
  had not satisfied its onus to prove that Global’s expenditures would exceed 
  its anticipated revenue, in our view, lacks merit.  In determining whether Apotex 
  had satisfied its onus the trial judge was entitled to consider all the evidence.  
  He was not limited to considering the evidence directly associated with Global’s 
  claim for compensation for its expenditures.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the cross-appeal, the first issue raised is that the trial judge 
  erred in not finding that Global was in breach of the August 4, 1987 agreement 
  and that its breach entitled Apotex to terminate the contract.  The basic issue 
  respecting legal responsibility for the termination of the contract is largely 
  one of fact.  The trial judge reviewed the relevant evidence in his reasons 
  and concluded that “in breach of its contractual relationship, the plaintiff 
  [Apotex] had entered into different arrangements in Israel for the registration 
  and marketing of its products and that it suited their convenience better to 
  terminate their agreement with the defendant” and that “the reasons for termination 
  raised in the [plaintiff’s] letter are manufactured and do not reflect the true 
  reasons why the plaintiff wished to terminate its relationship with the defendant 
  at the time in question, namely, its intentions to deal directly with Meditrend 
  and bypass its contractual relationship with the defendant.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We think that the trial judge’s conclusions in this respect are reasonably 
  based on the evidence.  Further, we think that it is implicit in his reasons 
  that he found that, in all the circumstances, including lack of complaint by 
  it, Apotex could not reasonably assert that registration had not been effected 
  within a reasonable time.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Apotex’s other issues on the cross-appeal relate to costs.  First, on 
  the material before us, it is our view that the trial judge correctly applied 
  the relevant provisions in rule 49.10 in the order that he made.  Second, we 
  do not think that it was open to Apotex to submit that, on the counterclaim, 
  Gail Bocknek put forward the named defendant Global Drug Ltd. as “a man of straw” 
  as a basis for an order making Gail Bocknek personally liable for the costs.  
  Global was the party to the contract in question, was properly made a defendant 
  in the action, and was the proper plaintiff by counterclaim against Apotex.</p>

  without costs.</p>
