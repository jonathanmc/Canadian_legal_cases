  </span></span> The deceased was the appellant’s mother-in-law.  She was found 
  dead in her home by her husband shortly after 6:00 p.m. on November 11, 1992.  
  She had been brutally beaten some 65 times in the head and shot five times, 
  also in the head.  The issue at trial was the identity of the perpetrator.

  </span></span> It was the Crown’s theory at trial that the appellant, who was 
  experiencing financial difficulties, sought to kill both his mother-in-law and 
  father-in-law so that he and his wife could inherit a significant sum of money.  
  It was the Crown’s position at trial that the appellant arrived at the home 
  of his parents-in-law around 5:00&nbsp;p.m. and, knowing that his mother-in-law 
  would be alone at the time and that his father-in-law would arrive around 6:00 
  p.m, he beat his mother-in-law about the head in the hallway outside the bathroom, 
  and then dragged her into the bathroom so that her husband would not immediately 
  see the body upon entering the residence. It was the Crown’s further theory 
  that it had been the appellant’s intention to ambush his father-in-law in this 
  fashion and kill him as well, but that his plan was frustrated by the arrival 
  of the newspaper carrier, Mr.&nbsp;Kurtz. Upon hearing the sound of the mail 
  box and subsequently seeing Mr.&nbsp;Kurtz walking up the driveway, the appellant 
  hurriedly decided to flee. He rapidly cleaned himself up but was not successful 
  in removing all of the diluted blood from his clothing. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s case against the appellant was largely 
  circumstantial. In support of its theory, the Crown relied on a large body of 
  evidence that included: evidence of bloodstains and tissue fragments found at 
  the scene, on the appellant’s clothing, on his tool box and in his car; evidence 
  of a nose pad from the appellant’s glasses found under the deceased’s body, 
  coupled with the discoloration on the appellant’s face consistent with him having 
  been struck in the glasses; the appellant’s admitted presence at the scene; 
  his flight; the phone call to his wife, immediately after leaving the scene; 
  lying about his attendance at the deceased’s house; his heavy alcohol consumption 
  shortly after leaving the scene; the disposal of his clothes; his lies to the 
  police and his fabrication of evidence to cover up his lies; the observations 
  of the newspaper carrier and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Kurtz; evidence that the 
  deceased was shot with a home made gun and the appellant’s ability to make a 
  firearm including evidence of hand-drawn diagrams found at his home and workplace; 
  the appellant’s apparent knowledge that the murder weapon was a home made gun 
  at a time prior to the disclosure of this fact by the police; the appellant’s 
  financial circumstances and his motive to kill his parents-in-law; and the unlikelihood 
  of attack by an intruder or stranger. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The defence position at trial was that the appellant arrived 
  at his mother-in-law’s home at 5:30 p.m. and discovered her dead body lying 
  in a pool of blood.  He took her pulse and then fled in panic without calling 
  911 or waiting for his father-in-law to arrive home. The defence called psychiatric 
  evidence to explain that, as a result of psychological traumas suffered in childhood, 
  the appellant was ill-equipped to deal with the discovery of his mother-in-law’s 
  body.  The appellant admitted to having lied to the police in his various interviews 
  with them and explained his conduct over the days prior to his arrest as attempts 
  on his part to support the false statements made to the police over the course 
  of the investigation. The appellant denied any motive to kill his mother-in-law 
  and offered explanations for the crude firing device diagrams found at his former 
  place of work and at his home.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s main contention on this appeal is that his trial 
  counsel’s failure to call available evidence that would have supported his explanation 
  at trial about the source of his knowledge that the murder weapon was a handmade 
  gun resulted in a miscarriage of justice. The appellant further contends that 
  the Crown’s theory that he also intended to kill his father-in-law was entirely 
  speculative, unsupported by the evidence, and improperly used by the Crown to 
  explain the weakness in the Crown’s theory that the appellant killed the deceased 
  for a financial motive when he could not have benefited from her death alone. 
  Finally, the appellant alleges that the trial judge’s instructions to the jury 
  were inadequate with respect to eyewitness identification, motive, opportunity, 
  and post-offence conduct.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We did not call upon Crown counsel to respond 
  to any of the grounds of appeal related to the trial judge’s charge to the jury. 
  In our view, the trial judge’s instructions to the jury on the issues identified 
  by counsel contained no error and were entirely adequate in the circumstances 
  of this case. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, it is unnecessary to inquire into the reasonableness 
  of trial counsel’s  decision not to call the fresh evidence now sought to be 
  introduced by the appellant because the failure to call this evidence did not 
  occasion any miscarriage of justice. Hence, the proposed evidence does not meet 
  the criteria for the admission of fresh evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is further my view that the Crown’s theory 
  on motive was reasonably supported by the evidence and, consequently, was properly 
  left with the jury to consider. It is particularly noteworthy that no objection 
  was made at trial to the Crown’s approach on this issue.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At trial, Crown counsel elicited through the appellant in cross-examination 
  that he, on November 25, 1992, in an interview with a psychiatrist retained 
  by the defence, told that psychiatrist that the police “seem to think I made 
  a gun.  I’m probably capable of making one”. There was ample other evidence 
  that the appellant was capable of making a firearm. However, the appellant’s 
  knowledge of the police suspicion about the nature of the murder weapon became 
  significant because the investigating officer had testified for the Crown that 
  at no time prior to December 17, 1992 had he or anyone under his direction disclosed 
  to the appellant, any member of the appellant’s family or any member of the 
  defence team, that the police believed that the murder weapon was a home-made 
  gun. Indeed, the investigating officer testified that he himself had not harboured 
  this suspicion before November 26, 1992. The appellant testified that his counsel, 
  Michael Block, had informed him of the police suspicion prior to his meeting 
  with the psychiatrist. Michael Block, who was co-counsel with William Gorewich 
  for the defence, did not testify at trial to confirm the appellant’s explanation 
  for the source of his knowledge about the police suspicion. Crown counsel, in 
  his closing address to the jury, argued that the only explanation for the fact 
  that on November 25, 1992, the appellant had knowledge of the type of weapon 
  used in the murder, was that he was the killer. The appellant’s statement to 
  his psychiatrist was one of more than 20 items of circumstantial evidence relied 
  upon by Crown counsel in his closing address to the jury. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The proposed fresh evidence consists of the affidavits of both 
  trial counsel for the defence.  In particular, it consists of the statement 
  of Mr. Block that, upon hearing the appellant's testimony at trial, he remembered 
  that he had informed the appellant of the police suspicion on November 17, 1992 
  before the appellant's interview with the psychiatrist.  To support this, Mr. 
  Block relies upon contemporaneous notes of his November 17 conversation with 
  the appellant, which contain three point-form lines relating to the topic of 
  a gun. The fresh evidence is intended to corroborate the appellant’s testimony 
  as to the source of his knowledge about the murder weapon.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The test for admission of fresh evidence is well-established. 
  It is that set out in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Palmer </i>(1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 193 
  at 205 (S.C.C.):  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1)            the evidence should generally not be admitted if, by due 
      diligence, it could have been adduced at trial provided that this general 
      principle will not be applied as strictly in a criminal case as in civil 
      cases…;</p>
    <p>(2)            the evidence must be relevant in the sense that it bears 
      upon a decisive or potentially decisive issue in the trial;</p>
    <p>(3)            the evidence must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably 
      capable of belief, and</p>
    <p>(4)            it must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when 
      taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected 
      the result.<span>  </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>These criteria for admitting fresh evidence 
  were reiterated recently in <i>R. </i>v. <i>B.(G.D.) </i>(2000), 143 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 289 (S.C.C.). In <i>B.(G.D.)</i> the Supreme Court of Canada stressed the 
  importance of the due diligence criterion stating, at para.19, that it “exists 
  to ensure finality and order – values essential to the integrity of the criminal 
  process.” The Court quoted the following words of Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. M.(P.S.)</i> 
  (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont. C.A.) at para.19:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The interests of justice referred to in s.&nbsp;683 of the <i>Criminal 
      Code</i> encompass not only an accused's interest in having his or her guilt 
      determined upon all of the available evidence, but also the integrity of 
      the criminal process.  Finality and order are essential to that integrity.  
      The criminal justice system is arranged so that the trial will provide the 
      opportunity to the parties to present their respective cases and the appeal 
      will provide the opportunity to challenge the correctness of what happened 
      at the trial.  Section&nbsp; 683(1)(<i>d</i>) of the <i>Code</i> recognizes 
      that the appellate function can be expanded in exceptional cases, but it 
      cannot be that the appellate process should be used routinely to augment 
      the trial record.  Were it otherwise, the finality of the trial process 
      would be lost and cases would be retried on appeal whenever more evidence 
      was secured by a party prior to the hearing of the appeal.  For this reason, 
      the exceptional nature of the admission of &quot;fresh&quot; evidence on 
      appeal has been stressed …. </p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Hence, as stated in <i>Palmer</i>, the failure to satisfy the 
  due diligence criterion will generally be determinative of the issue. If the 
  evidence, by due diligence, could have been adduced at trial, it generally should 
  not be admitted on appeal.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, the Supreme Court of Canada also reiterated the principle 
  in <i>B. (G.D.)</i>, established by the jurisprudence pre-dating <i>Palmer</i>, 
  that the criterion of due diligence must yield, particularly in criminal cases, 
  where its rigid application might lead to a miscarriage of justice.  It is apparent 
  from the words of Ritchie J. in <i>R. v. McMartin</i>, [1964] S.C.R. 484 at 
  491, quoted in <i>B.(G.D.) </i>at para.&nbsp;19 in support of this principle, 
  that the inquiry into whether there has been a miscarriage of justice involves 
  a consideration of the remaining <i>Palmer</i> criteria – the relevance of the 
  evidence, its credibility and the reasonable likelihood that it might have affected 
  the verdict at trial:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In all the circumstances, if the evidence is considered to be of sufficient 
      strength that it might reasonably affect the verdict of the jury, I do not 
      think it should be excluded on the ground that reasonable diligence was 
      not exercised to obtain it at or before trial.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In cases where the fresh evidence was not in 
  existence until after the trial, obviously the due diligence criterion will 
  have been met. The criterion will also have been met in cases where the evidence, 
  although in existence at the time of trial, could not have been discovered by 
  the exercise of due diligence. In all other cases, the applicant, in order to

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The explanation may, in some cases,<i> </i>give 
  rise to an allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel. The applicant may 
  allege that the evidence was not discovered because of the lack of due diligence 
  of counsel, or, although discovered, it was not called because counsel, with 
  or without the acquiescence of his client, decided against calling it. In either 
  situation, the competency of counsel may be put in issue by the appellant. When 
  a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is made, it becomes necessary to 
  consider the test that must be met by the appellant, the approach that should 
  be taken by an appellate court, and how these principles intersect with the 
  test in <i>Palmer.</i> </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The case of <i>B.(G.D.) </i>is one example where 
  the appellant, on his application to introduce fresh evidence, alleged that 
  the proposed evidence, although available at trial, was not led due to the incompetence

  Canada provided guidance on the general approach that should be adopted by appellate 
  courts when such a claim is made.</span></p>

  </span></span> The Supreme Court adopted the reasoning in <i>Strickland v. Washington</i>, 
  466 U.S. 668 (1984), <i>per</i> O’Connor J., where an ineffectiveness claim 
  was identified as comprising a performance component and a prejudice component. 
  Major J., in writing for the court,  stated as follows at para.&nbsp;26:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>For an appeal to succeed, it must be established, first, that counsel’s 
      acts or omissions constituted incompetence and second, that a miscarriage 
      of justice resulted. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Major&nbsp;J. provided guidance on how to determine 
  incompetence and what constitutes a miscarriage of justice at paras. 27-28:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Incompetence is determined by a reasonableness standard. The analysis 
      proceeds upon a strong presumption that counsel’s conduct fell within the 
      wide range of reasonable professional assistance. The onus is on the appellant 
      to establish the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have 
      been the result of reasonable professional judgment. The wisdom of hindsight 
      has no place in this assessment. </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Miscarriages of justice may take many forms in this context. In some 
      instances, counsel’s performance may have resulted in procedural unfairness. 
      In others, the reliability of the trial’s result may have been compromised.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Major J. then provided guidance on the approach 
  that should be adopted where it is apparent that no prejudice has occurred from 
  the alleged incompetent conduct of counsel at para.&nbsp;29:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>In those cases where it is apparent that no prejudice has occurred, 
      it will usually be undesirable for appellate courts to consider the performance 
      component of the analysis. The object of an ineffectiveness claim is not 
      to grade counsel’s performance or professional conduct. The latter is left 
      to the profession’s self-governing body. If it is appropriate to dispose 
      of an ineffectiveness claim on the ground of no prejudice having occurred, 
      that is the course to follow (<i>Strickland</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p.697).</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, it follows from the principles set out in <i>B.(G.D.)</i> 
  that the due diligence criterion will be met when the proposed fresh evidence 
  was not led at trial due to the incompetence of trial counsel. This court has 
  expressly so stated in <i>R. </i>v. <i>Wang, </i>[2001] O.J. No. 1491 (C.A.) 
  at para.&nbsp;58. Of course, the incompetent decision of counsel, in and of 
  itself, will not result in a new trial. It is incumbent upon the appellant to 
  also show that the failure to call the evidence resulted in a miscarriage of 
  justice in order to satisfy the “prejudice component” of the test for ineffective 
  assistance of counsel. This additional requirement is also necessary under the 
  remaining three <i>Palmer</i> criteria for the admission of fresh evidence. 
  The inquiry at this stage is essentially the same under either test. Indeed, 
  in <i>B.(G.D.)</i>, Major J., after determining that the claim of incompetence 
  had not been made out, concluded that the due diligence criterion had not been 
  met, and proceeded  to  inquire whether  the  failure to  use the  evidence 
  in question  occasioned  a miscarriage of justice.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> He did so by considering the remaining <i>Palmer</i> criteria 
  - reliability, credibility, and the reasonable likelihood that the evidence 
  might have affected the verdict at trial.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In summary, on any application to introduce 
  fresh evidence, the applicant must meet the <i>Palmer</i> criteria. Where the 
  applicant claims that the proposed evidence was not introduced at trial due 
  to the ineffective assistance of his or her counsel, this claim is properly 
  addressed under the first <i>Palmer</i> criterion of due diligence. If the applicant 
  satisfies the court that trial counsel was incompetent (the “performance component” 
  of the test for ineffective assistance), the due diligence criterion will have 
  been met. The applicant must then satisfy the court that counsel’s incompetence 
  in failing to introduce the evidence has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
  This inquiry leads to a consideration of the remaining three <i>Palmer</i> criteria.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Where the applicant does not satisfy the court 
  that trial counsel was incompetent and hence does not meet the criterion of 
  due diligence, the court should nonetheless consider the remaining three <i>Palmer</i> 
  criteria, keeping in mind that the due diligence requirement is but one factor 
  to be considered and that it must yield if its rigid application might lead 
  to a miscarriage of justice. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In cases where it is apparent that there has 
  been no miscarriage of justice, it will usually be undesirable for an appellate 
  court to decide the issue of competency of trial counsel. In such cases, if

  that the three remaining <i>Palmer</i> criteria have not been met, without deciding 
  the question of due diligence, then that course should be followed.</span></p>
<h4><b><span lang=EN-US>3. Application to this case</span></b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, the appellant concedes that the proposed evidence 
  was available at trial and could have been called. Indeed the prospect of calling 
  the evidence was specifically considered by the defence team. Upon hearing the 
  appellant’s testimony at trial, Mr. Block advised Mr. Gorewich that he did, 
  in fact, recall informing the appellant of the police suspicion during a conversation 
  on November 17. Defence counsel communicated with Crown counsel during a recess, 
  then sought and obtained the trial judge’s permission to have the trial adjourned 
  early so that defence counsel could consider their position. The prospect of 
  Mr. Block testifying was then discussed between the two counsel and their client.  
  Advice was also sought from other experienced defence counsel.  Ultimately, 
  the appellant provided instructions that Mr. Block was not to testify based 
  on counsel’s considered opinion that such testimony would constitute a waiver 
  of solicitor-client privilege with respect to the appellant's discussion with 
  Mr. Block on that day, and that this waiver would damage the appellant's defence. 
  The defence team also concluded that no application to the trial judge for a 
  ruling on the privilege issue could be made until after Mr. Block had testified 
  in chief.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel’s analysis of the first <i>Palmer</i> criterion on due 
  diligence is centred on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at trial. 
  Counsel submits that the decision by trial counsel not to call Mr. Block was 
  demonstrative of an erroneous understanding of the law of privilege.  He submits 
  that the information conveyed by Mr. Block to his client on November 17, 1992 
  about the police suspicion was not privileged and hence its disclosure would 
  not have constituted a waiver of the solicitor-client privilege.  Alternatively, 
  he argues that any waiver would have been limited to the subject matter of the 
  gun and not to the entire discussion between the solicitor and his client on 
  the day in question as believed by trial counsel.  He therefore submits that 
  the evidence was not called due to trial counsel’s ineffectiveness and that, 
  consequently, the due diligence criterion was met. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, it is not clear on the basis of the proposed fresh 
  evidence that trial counsel’s decision not to call Mr. Block was unreasonable 
  as alleged. The law of privilege is not without uncertainty.  Indeed, as conceded 
  by counsel for the appellant in his alternate submission, it is possible, if 
  the court took this approach to the law of privilege, that Mr. Block's testimony 
  about his communication to his client would have opened the door to some cross-examination 
  by the Crown on the issue of the appellant's knowledge of the murder weapon 
  as revealed to his solicitor at the time. This cross-examination may well have 
  included damning evidence for the appellant.  The defence team was in the best 
  position to assess the risk involved in calling Mr. Block.  In any event, it 
  is my view that it is neither necessary nor advisable for this court to assess 
  the reasonableness of trial counsel’s decision.  This is one of those cases 
  where it is apparent that no miscarriage of justice was occasioned by counsel’s 
  decision. Consequently, I will not address the performance component of the 
  ineffective assistance claim or the criterion of due diligence. The application 
  turns, rather, on a consideration of the remaining <i>Palmer</i> criteria. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the second criterion, relevance, there is no doubt that Mr. 
  Block’s testimony could have provided support for the appellant’s explanation 
  of the source of his apparent knowledge of the nature of the murder weapon. 
  His explanation, without this corroboration was certainly weakened, particularly 
  having regard to the serious credibility issues raised by the appellant’s testimony 
  generally. For corroboration purposes, then, the proposed fresh evidence would 
  have been relevant.  However, it is noteworthy that the trial judge, acceding 
  to the request of defence counsel, outlined in his instructions to the jury 
  other evidence that could lend support to the appellant’s testimony on this 
  point. This included the evidence of Mr. Barbetta from the Centre of Forensic 
  Sciences who testified that he conveyed his suspicion about the murder weapon 
  being a handmade gun to the investigating officers at the time of the post-mortem 
  examination on November 13, 1992. This testimony could potentially undermine 
  the evidence of the investigating officer who had testified that he himself 
  had not considered the murder weapon was a homemade gun until November 26, 1992. 
  The trial judge also reminded the jury that the November 14, 1992 search warrant 
  listed a firearm capable of discharging a .22 calibre cartridge as one of the 
  items to be searched for. The trial judge left these items of evidence as possible 
  sources of knowledge for the appellant at the time of his November 25, 1992 
  interview with the psychiatrist. Hence, the appellant’s testimony was not left 
  totally unsupported in the eyes of the jury.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the third criterion, credibility, there is no doubt that Mr. 
  Block’s proposed testimony is reasonably capable of belief and meets the test 
  on that basis. However, a number of issues regarding its reliability would likely 
  have arisen had Mr. Block testified at trial. Mr. Block would have testified 
  that he discussed the issue of a homemade gun with the appellant during an interview 
  with him on November 17, 1992, and that he  remembered this conversation for 
  the first time during the course of the appellant’s testimony some two years 
  later. The reliability of his recollection based on brief notes that could be 
  subject to interpretation by the jury could well be questioned.  Mr. Block would 
  further have testified that he received this information from Mr. Gorewich, 
  who advised Mr. Block that he was told about the police suspicion about the 
  gun by the investigating officer during an informal chat at the courthouse earlier 
  on the morning of November 17. Mr. Block’s stated recollection that he had received 
  the information from Mr. Gorewich on November 17 is not<i> </i>confirmed by 
  Mr. Gorewich, and is contradicted by the investigating officer’s statement that 
  the police suspicion was not disclosed until December 17.  Further, the likelihood 
  of Mr. Gorewich having received information from the police on the morning of 
  November 17, at a time when he himself was not yet retained to represent the 
  appellant, may have been raised as a further issue. In the result, the testimony 
  of Mr. Block may well have injected numerous additional issues into the trial, 
  at a very late stage in the proceedings, related to the reliability of defence 
  counsel’s own recollection. Instead of weakening the suggested inference of 
  guilty knowledge, the evidence could have tended to confirm it. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, and most importantly, Mr. Block’s testimony, if accepted, 
  could only have served to weaken one single item of circumstantial evidence 
  against the appellant in what can only be called an overwhelming case for the 
  Crown. The appellant’s statement to his psychiatrist, although elicited by the 
  Crown in cross-examination, did not even form part of the Crown’s case. It was 
  introduced because the defence sought to rely on the testimony of the psychiatrist 
  in support of the appellant’s testimony generally. The appellant’s weak explanation 
  for his knowledge of the murder weapon was only one of many equally weak explanations 
  for many items of highly incriminating circumstantial evidence against him.  
  Unlike the situation in <i>R</i>. v. <i>Wildman </i>(1984), 14 C.C.C. (3d) 321 
  at 330 (S.C.C.), upon which the appellant relies, this item of evidence can 
  not be described as ‘the most incriminating evidence adduced’ that would tip 
  the scales to make an overwhelming case. The Crown’s case, even without the 
  item of evidence, was still overwhelming. The failure to call Mr. Block could 
  not reasonably have affected the verdict.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant argues that the Crown should not 
  have been permitted to invite the jury to speculate that the appellant intended 
  to kill the husband of the deceased as well as the deceased. This, he argues, 
  was mere speculation to rationalize the Crown’s allegation that the appellant 
  killed the deceased for a financial motive in circumstances where he stood to 
  gain nothing unless both his parents-in-law were dead. In support of his contention, 
  the appellant relies on the following cases: <i>R. </i>v. <i>Khan </i>(1998), 
  126 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Man. C.A.); and <i>R. </i>v. <i>Nugent </i>(1995), 100 
  C.C.C. (3d) 89 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, these cases can be distinguished. 
  The Crown’s theory on the possible motive for this crime in this case was not 
  entirely speculative as contended. There is no question that the Crown called 
  evidence of possible financial motive and the admissibility of this evidence 
  was not contested at trial. In addition, there was some evidence to support 
  the contention that the killer took some measures to conceal the body of the 
  deceased so that it would not be immediately visible upon entry in the house, 
  which in turn could support the inference that the killer intended to surprise 
  Mr. Petzoldt on his arrival. There was also evidence that the killer may have 
  been surprised by the unexpected appearance of Mr. Kurtz in the driveway, which 
  in turn could support the inference that he departed prematurely.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is particularly noteworthy that no objection was made at trial 
  with respect to the evidence, the Crown’s closing address, or the trial judge’s 
  instructions on this aspect of the Crown’s theory on motive. Obviously the impropriety 
  that is now being alleged was not perceived by experienced trial counsel as 
  the trial unfolded.  </p>

    therefore included a consideration whether the failure to obtain the appellant’s 
    express instructions occasioned any miscarriage of justice. Major J. held 
    on the particular facts of the case that counsel had the implied authority
