      <p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Monique Métivier dated November

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> This is an appeal from the decision of Métivier&nbsp;J. dismissing 
        the appellant's motion for summary judgment and granting the respondents' 
        cross-motion for summary judgment, dismissing the action.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The essence of this action is that the appellant's former wife, 
        Rima, and his daughter, Lali, illegally wrestled from him a company that 
        he had purchased.  On September&nbsp;29, 1989, the common shares of Willis 
        Business College were transferred to the appellant, in trust.  On the 
        same day, the shares were transferred to Lali from the appellant who, 
        as trustee, held them beneficially for her.  On September&nbsp;29, 1989, 
        the appellant was appointed President and Secretary of the company.  On 
        October&nbsp;3, 1989, Rima and Lali were appointed directors and the appellant 
        resigned as director, President and Secretary.  There is also a trust 
        declaration dated October&nbsp;3, 1989 declaring that the appellant purchased 
        all of the shares of the company in trust for Lali.  On November&nbsp;1, 
        1993, Lali resigned as President and Secretary and on the same day she 
        transferred all her shares in the company to Rima, who was appointed sole 
        director, President and Secretary of the company.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> In 1991, the appellant declared bankruptcy.  In his Statement 
        of Affairs, signed under oath, he declared he had no assets.  He disavowed 
        owning any shares and none were disclosed as part of his estate at the 
        time of his bankruptcy.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The appellant made assertions that certain documents were forgeries.  
        There is no evidence to substantiate these allegations.  The appellant 
        provided no evidence to establish that any of his property was unlawfully 
        taken from him.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The motions judge noted that it was not always easy to glean the 
        points that were being made by the appellant.  The appellant's factum 
        and submissions suffer from the same defect.  The motions judge was unable 
        to find that there was any credibility issue sufficient to require a trial.  
        In the absence of any supporting evidence for his numerous assertions, 
        the motions judge was correct in dismissing the applicant's motion for 
        summary judgment and dismissing his action against the respondents.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at $4,000.</p>
