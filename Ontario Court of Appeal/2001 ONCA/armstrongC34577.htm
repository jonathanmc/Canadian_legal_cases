  </span> Mr. Armstrong is a cash crop farmer in Haldimand-Norfolk. He appeals 
  from a judgment dated June 1, 2000 requiring that he pay Clark Agri Service 
  Inc. $124,104.90 plus interest on account of soybean seed, chemicals, and spraying 
  services supplied for the 1997 crop year and dismissing his counterclaim for 
  losses suffered as the result of negligent spraying and inferior quality seeds.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> the trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Armstrong had authorized substitution 
  of the herbicide Pursuit for the herbicide Basagran, and further erred in ordering 
  payment for the unauthorized product;   </p>

  </span> the trial judge erred in ordering payment for the supply of Roundup, 
  Pursuit, and 2,4-D, an unregistered spray combination, thus enforcing an illegal 
  contract; </p>

  </span> the trial judge erred in dismissing his counterclaim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Substitution of Pursuit 
  for Basagran</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Despite Mr. Armstrong’s testimony that he did not authorize Clark Agri 
  to substitute Pursuit for Basagran, the trial judge relied on four pages of 
  handwritten notes of telephone instructions made by an unidentified Clark Agri 
  employee, and the absence of any complaint prior to litigation, to find that 
  the substitution was authorized. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Pursuit was noted under Mr. Armstrong’s name on each of the first three 
  pages of the handwritten notes. A note that appears to be “Basagran” on the 
  fourth page is struck out. “Pursuit + 28%” appears above the struck reference. 
  An expert witness called by Mr. Armstrong testified that Pursuit and Assure 
  are a more effective herbicide combination later in the season than Basagran 
  and Assure. “Assure” also appears on pages three and four of the handwritten 
  notes.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge noted that Clark Agri conceded that the substitution 
  of Pursuit for Basagran may have been made without the knowledge and consent 
  of Mr. Armstrong. It remained open to the trial judge, however, to reject Mr. 
  Armstrong’s testimony that he did not authorize the substitution, even though 
  that testimony was unchallenged by cross-examination. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the handwritten notes standing alone and unexplained also support 
  an inference of a unilateral decision made by the unidentified employee, when 
  viewed in conjunction with the absence of a prompt complaint, we are unable 
  to say that they do not support the inference drawn by the trial judge, or that 
  his finding amounts to a palpable and overriding error. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Contract Illegality</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>Pest Control Products Act,</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. P-9, and regulations 
  enacted under that <i>Act </i>and the <i>Pesticides Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  P.-11, prohibit use of unregistered<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> pesticides as well as use of  a “control product” in a manner 
  inconsistent with directions on the product label. It is conceded that although 
  each of Roundup, Pursuit, and 2,4-D are registered individually, the product 
  comprised of their combination is not, nor does product labelling permit their 
  combination. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Clark Agri was aware of this apparent illegality, but persisted in using 
  the combined product in any event, based on an understanding that its use has 
  been approved in the United States, and because registration in Canada would 
  not be economically viable. The combined product is a more effective spray mixture 
  than the mixture of Pursuit and Roundup that Mr. Armstrong actually ordered. 
  There is however no evidence indicating that Clark Agri informed Mr. Armstrong 
  in advance that it proposed to use the unregistered combined product. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Neither the <i>Pesticides Act </i>nor<i> </i>the<i> Pest Control Products 
  Act</i> contains a specific provision making contracts for the supply of unregistered 
  products unenforceable. Accordingly, “the question is whether, having regard 
  to the purpose of the Act, and the circumstances under which the contract was 
  made, and to be performed, it would be contrary to public policy to enforce 
  it because of illegality”: <i>Beer v. Townsgate I Ltd</i> (1998), 36 O.R. (3d) 
  136 (C.A.) at p. 144. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The <i>Pesticides Act </i>and the<i> Pest Control Products Act</i> appear 
  to be aimed, at least in part, at ensuring the safety of food products through 
  appropriate testing and regulation of potentially hazardous products. Here, 
  no evidence was led dealing directly with the relative safety of the combined 
  product supplied. However,<i> </i>given that contract illegality was not raised 
  until closing submissions, and given that there was <i>some</i> evidence suggesting 
  the relative safety of the unregistered combined product in the form of evidence 
  that its use is authorized in the United States, we would not interfere with 
  trial judge’s finding that the particular contract is enforceable.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Clark Agri relied on invoices prepared and sent in the ordinary course 
  of business in support of its claim for 55 totes of soybeans. Again, there was 
  no evidence of complaint prior to the commencement of litigation, and the trial 
  judge’s conclusion that Mr. Armstrong was unable to refute the suggestions put 
  to him by trial counsel for Clark Agri concerning the calculation of seed he 
  used was not challenged here. Once again, we are unable to say the trial judge’s 
  finding was unreasonable or that it amounted to palpable and overriding error.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Counterclaim</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Armstrong conceded there was evidence capable of supporting the 
  trial judge’s findings of fact concerning the counterclaim, but asserted that 
  if he succeeded on his other grounds of appeal, there would be a basis for setting 
  aside the dismissal of the counterclaim. In light of our other findings, we 
  would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Disposition</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  with respect to the motion for security for costs of the appeal.</p>
