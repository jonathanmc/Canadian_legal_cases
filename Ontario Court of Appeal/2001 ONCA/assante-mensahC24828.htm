<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:200%'><b><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>MACPHERSON 
  AND SHARPE JJ.A.:</span></b></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [1]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These appeals concern two important issues arising from the <i>Trespass 
  to Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.21 (&quot;<i>TPA</i>&quot;).  The accused 
  is a taxi driver who persistently flouted an airport regulation prohibiting 
  the picking up of passengers by those who do not hold a permit to do so.  As 
  a last resort, the airport authorities served him with a notice under the <i>TPA</i> 
  prohibiting him from entering upon the property of Pearson International Airport.  
  The accused appeals from the finding of the trial judge that this notice and 
  the manner of its enforcement against him did not infringe his rights protected 
  by ss. 7 and 9 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [2]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the accused failed to comply with the <i>TPA</i> notice, he was 
  arrested by an airport inspector.  A scuffle ensued and the accused was charged 
  with assault with intent to resist arrest.  The accused argued successfully 
  at trial that the inspector, acting as a private citizen, had no lawful authority 
  to use force in effecting the arrest and that he was justified in defending 
  himself from the force the inspector used.  The Crown appeals from this finding.</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [3]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A federal licensing scheme, the <i>Government Airport Concession Operations 
  Regulations,</i> S.O.R./79-373, limits the right to pick up taxi passengers 
  at Pearson International Airport.  Permits are issued to a dedicated licensed 
  fleet of vehicles.  Taxi drivers without a permit are prohibited from picking 
  up passengers at the airport.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [4]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The accused is an independent taxi driver who does not have the permit 
  required to pick up passengers.  The accused strongly disagrees with the permit 
  system.  For many years, he and a core group of about 65 unlicensed drivers 
  displayed open contempt for the scheme.  They refused to comply with the permit 
  system and regularly showed up at the airport to solicit (or “scoop”) customers 
  illegally.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [5]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The airport 
  authorities had difficulty enforcing the regulations.  The penalties imposed 
  under the scheme were modest and the inherently transient nature of airport 
  passengers who might be required as witnesses made prosecution difficult.  Eventually, 
  in consultation with the federal Department of Justice and the police, the airport 
  authorities attempted to remedy these enforcement difficulties by issuing notices 
  to the accused and several other &quot;scoopers&quot; under s. 3 of the <i>TPA</i>.  
  These notices prohibited parties named and served from entering on airport property.<span>  
  </span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [6]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The accused was served with his notice under the <i>TPA</i> on June 
  4, 1990.  Between August 23,1990 and July 10, 1991, he was charged with trespassing 
  in violation of the notice on 22 separate occasions.  At trial in this proceeding, 
  he made clear his defiance of the permit system. </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [7]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On July 22, 1991, two airport ground transportation inspectors observed 
  the accused’s vehicle parked unattended at the curb of the arrivals level.  
  Both inspectors had prior regulation enforcement experience with the accused.  
  While the duties of these inspectors include the enforcement of airport regulations, 
  they are not peace officers and, when carrying out enforcement duties, their 
  legal powers are those of the ordinary citizen.  One of the inspectors approached 
  the accused, touched him on the shoulder and informed him that he was under 
  arrest for trespassing.  The accused moved quickly past the inspector and fled 
  the scene in his car.  As a result of this transaction, the accused was charged 
  with escaping lawful custody.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [8]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On July 25, 1991, two inspectors again saw the accused’s unattended 
  vehicle parked at the curb in a prohibited parking area along with another scooper’s 
  vehicle.  The accused and the other scooper subsequently emerged from inside 
  the airport terminal.  One inspector approached the accused, touched his shoulder, 
  and informed him that he was under arrest for trespassing and that he would 
  be detained for police arrival.  The accused attempted to enter his vehicle 
  to flee the scene and avoid further consequences of his arrest.  The inspector 
  tried to prevent the accused from re-entering his vehicle.  The inspector's 
  position impeded the accused from opening his car door and entering the vehicle.  
  A physical altercation ensued.  The inspector attempted to prevent the accused 
  from entering the vehicle and the accused effectively employed his car door 
  to strike the inspector.  Eventually, the accused managed to close the door 
  of his vehicle and he drove off.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [9]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This incident led to charges being laid against the accused for assault 
  of the inspector with intent to resist arrest and escaping lawful custody.  
  The accused laid an assault charge against the inspector one week after the 
  incident, but the Crown later withdrew the charge. </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [10]     A further incident occurred at the airport on July 25, 1991 that resulted 
  in the accused being charged with counts of dangerous driving, use of a weapon 
  in committing an assault, and escaping lawful custody.  These charges are not 
  the subject of this appeal.</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>Trial Proceedings</span></h4>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [11]     At trial before a Superior Court judge sitting without a jury, the 
  accused brought <i>Charter</i> challenges against the provisions of the <i>TPA</i> 
  providing for exclusionary notices and the power of arrest, alleging infringement 
  of his ss. 7 and 9 rights.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [12]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In his thorough and thoughtful 
  reasons, the trial judge dismissed the <i>Charter</i> challenges and convicted 
  the accused on the charges of escaping lawful custody for both the July 22 and 
  July 25 incidents.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [13]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On</span><span lang=EN-US> 
  </span>the s. 7 issue, the trial judge held that the exclusionary notice did 
  not infringe the accused’s liberty.  He noted that the accused’s admitted purpose 
  in going to the airport was to seek and solicit fares.  Relying on several decisions 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada and of this court, especially <i>Irwin Toy Ltd. 
  v. A.G. Quebec</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, he concluded that this reason for seeking 
  access to the airport was not sufficient because “I have difficulty accepting 
  that s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> is sufficiently all-inclusive to include a liberty 
  interest extended to an unlimited right to pursue commercial activity in any 
  public space.”</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [14]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge further held that the exclusionary notice comported 
  with the principles of fundamental justice component of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  
  He did not think that the absolute exclusion authorized by s. 3(1) of the <i>TPA</i> 
  was overbroad; nor did he think that it was inappropriate in this case:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In light of the accused’s evasiveness and contempt for 
      regulation by the occupier, no lesser intrusion than absolute refusal of 
      admittance could reasonably be viewed as proportionate to the problem faced.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [15]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to the <i>Charter</i> s. 9 issue, the trial judge held 
  that an arrest without warrant of a trespasser on airport premises, authorized 
  by s. 9 of the <i>TPA</i>, was not arbitrary.  Section 9 of  the <i>TPA</i> 
  contained appropriate criteria for an arrest, and the actual arrest of the accused 
  was “reasonable in the public interest in order to prevent the continuation 
  or repetition of the offence.”</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [16]     The trial judge dismissed the charge of assault with intent to resist 
  arrest arising from the July 22 incident on the ground that while the arrest 
  itself was lawful, the inspector, who was acting as a private citizen, had no 
  right to use force to effect the arrest.  It followed, held the trial judge, 
  that the inspector's use of force after the arrest was effected was unlawful 
  and the accused was entitled to resist that unlawful use of force. </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [17]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge noted that s. 9 of the <i>TPA</i> did not explicitly 
  confer the right to use force.  He noted as well that s. 146 of the <i>Provincial 
  Offences Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. P-33,<i> </i>deals with the use of force by 
  the police in the execution of their lawful duties and by private citizens called 
  to aid the police, but makes no provision for the use of force in a citizen's 
  arrest.  By way of comparison, the trial judge cited several other provincial 
  statutes that also deal expressly with the use of force in carrying out statutory 
  powers.  He concluded from his review of the legislative framework that the 
  inspector lacked lawful authority to use reasonable force when arresting the 
  accused:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Where legislation specifically addresses 
      the scope of a person's authority, recognition of the operation of a parallel 
      and broader common law authority or privilege is generally to be avoided: 
      <i>Silveira v. The Queen</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 450 (S.C.C.) at 464-5, 
      466-7 per Cory J.; <i>Regina v. Noble</i> (1985), 16 C.C.C. (3d) 146 (Ont. 
      C.A.) at 172 per Martin J.A. When it has seen fit to do so, the provincial 
      legislature has had little difficulty in expressly conferring an authority 
      to employ reasonable force: see for example, <i>Child and Family Services 
      Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-11, s. 44(2) (police officer or child protection 
      worker); <i>Children's Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C-12, s. 36(5) 
      (police officer); <i>Environmental Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.19, 
      s. 163 (a provincial officer); and, <i>Game and Fish Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, 
      c. G-1, s. 8(3) (conservation officer). </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [18]     <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judge found that the important 
  public policy of minimizing the risk of violence favoured limiting the powers 
  of private citizens carrying out arrests:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>I do not accept that there is no public policy or societal 
      interest in denying the use of force to a citizen performing an arrest simply 
      because the statute, in any event, permits the intrusive action of a deprivation 
      of liberty through conferral of a power of arrest. Inherent in the employ 
      of physical force, to arrest and to promote restraint of a suspected offender, 
      is the risk of an escalation of violence and the prospect of injury. There 
      is no public interest in having persons, other than peace officers who are 
      trained in the limits and safe avenues of use of force, engaging in the 
      use of physical force against the person.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [19]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judge considered 
  and rejected the argument that the use of force was inherent in the power of 
  arrest in the following terms:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>While it may be argued that it is inherent in the act 
      of any arrest that force will be employed, such is not always the case. 
      An arrest, as discussed, may be effected by a touching or by an individual 
      yielding to the control of an arresting party in circumstances of clear 
      words of arrest and the reason therefor. Therefore, it cannot be said that 
      the statutory conferral of a power to arrest is rendered nugatory without 
      affording a right to employ reasonable physical force. Where the trespasser 
      does not yield to an arrest effected by words of arrest and touching or 
      to words of arrest alone, the concerned occupier can alert the police to 
      attend to arrest, follow the trespasser and request police assistance, or 
      report the occurrence to the police where identity of trespasser or vehicle 
      is known. Of course, the trespasser, who flees the citizen's arrest effected 
      by words of arrest and touching, faces the prospect of an arrest and conviction 
      for escape of lawful custody. </span></p>

<h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
<h4><i>Issue 1     Did the trial judge err in concluding that the trespass notice 
  under the TPA did not violate the accused’s Charter s. 7 rights?</i></h4>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [22]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The accused contends that 
  the trespass notice he received under the TPA violates s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i><b>.</b></span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [23]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did not accept this submission.  He held that the accused’s 
  asserted interest of seeking passengers at the airport was commercial in nature 
  and therefore not a liberty interest protected by s. 7.  In the alternative, 
  he held that if the accused’s liberty was implicated by the trespass notice, 
  the deprivation of his liberty was in accordance with the principles of fundamental 
  justice.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [24]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the appeal can be disposed of on the basis of the trial 
  judge’s alternative line of reasoning.  Without commenting on the difficult 
  question of the relationship between liberty in s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> and 
  commercial activity engaged in by an individual, we agree with the trial judge’s 
  conclusion that even if the trespass notice did implicate the accused’s liberty 
  interest, it did so in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [25]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The accused’s principal submission 
  on this issue is that the trespass notice suffers from ‘overbreadth’ because 
  of several factors: the notice is permanent; it is not sensitive to legitimate 
  public use of the airport; it is not tailored to the problem of scoopers in 
  relation to which it was employed; and a more limited notice was available under 
  s. 4 of the <i>TPA</i>.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [26]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We do not agree with these submissions.  It is true that the notice 
  the accused received in July 1991 amounted to an unqualified prohibition from 
  “entering upon the premises” of the airport.  However, this prohibition needs 
  to be assessed in context.  By July 1991, the accused had been charged with 
  trespassing on 22 different occasions.  Moreover, the accused testified that 
  he knew at all times that his conduct was contrary to the law.  He also indicated 
  that he had no intention of altering his conduct; as the trial judge put it: 
  “When asked how he could be stopped, the accused testified that he did not know 
  – perhaps the airport could be ‘opened up’ giving all drivers an opportunity.”  
  In these circumstances, it is difficult to see any validity to the argument 
  that a less restrictive prohibition should have been directed at the accused.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [27]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In view of the accused’s history of disregard for the regulation and 
  his stated intention to persist in disobedience, we do not accept the argument 
  that a permanent prohibition went beyond what was necessary to control him.  
  Moreover, the airport manager had lifted the trespass notices directed at four 
  other taxi drivers when they provided an undertaking to abide by the rules and 
  regulations of the airport.  There is no suggestion in the record that if the 
  accused stopped thumbing his nose at the law he would not be treated in a similar 
  fashion.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;'> [28]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  our view, the notice was not defective on the ground that it was not sufficiently 
  sensitive to the accused's right to make legitimate use of the airport.  On 
  the evidence, the accused <i>only</i> attends at the airport for the purpose 
  of “scooping”.  Before he received the prohibition notice he had been charged 
  with trespassing on 22 occasions.  After he received the notice, but before 
  the trial, the accused continued to trespass at the airport.  As expressed by 
  the trial judge:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As of the time of trial, the accused continued to play a cat-and-mouse 
      game with the airport inspectors as he continued to frequent the airport 
      property for commercial purposes.  On some days, the accused would have 
      ten paying trips.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [29]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are, of course, other uses that the accused could theoretically 
  make of the airport.  He could go there for a flight himself, or to meet arriving 
  family members or friends, or to shop in the airport stores.  The point, however, 
  is that the accused does not appear to engage in these activities.  Each time 
  he has been charged with trespassing it has been in the context of his blatantly 
  unlawful commercial activity.  In short, on the record before the trial judge, 
  the only reason the accused attends at the airport is to carry out his activities 
  as a scooper.  The termination notice directed at him is, therefore, sufficiently 
  tailored to the scooper problem which the appellant presents to be in accordance 
  with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [30]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, we agree with the trial judge that a conditional notice envisioned 
  in s. 4 of the <i>TPA</i> would be ineffective in relation to the accused in 
  light of his “persistence and resourcefulness to escape detection.”  Twenty-two 
  knowing violations of a law, without remorse and without a commitment to alter 
  conduct, disentitles the accused to make a serious submission grounded in the 
  niceties of a conditional prohibition.  The only way to ensure his compliance 
  is to ban him at the gate of the premises.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In conclusion, we specifically endorse the 
  trial judge’s summary on this issue:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>       </span>Government officials, charged with the responsibility 
      of effective operation of one of the world’s busiest airports, in an effort 
      to provide a superior and safe commercial passenger service to the travelling 
      public and to avoid traffic chaos and the potential for violence at the 
      Toronto Airport, came to a reasonably held view that the trespass initiative 
      would significantly further these important objectives.  The action was 
      legitimately taken in good faith and in an evenhanded, not an arbitrary, 
      or capricious, way.  The means chosen were rational and, in the circumstances 
      of the entire history of the accused, were justified with a rational connection 
      between the means chosen and the objectives pursued. Within an acceptable 
      range, the solution adopted by federal airport authorities, exercising a 
      legal right to manage property in the public interest of the users of the 
      facility, was sufficiently tailored to intrude to the extent reasonably 
      viewed as necessary to stop the accused, and those of a similar bent, from 
      undermining the regulatory scheme for commercial vehicles operating at the 
      airport.  In light of the accused’s evasiveness and contempt for regulation 
      by the occupier, no lesser intrusion than absolute refusal of admittance 
      could reasonably be viewed as proportionate to the problem faced.</p>

  to effect an arrest.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='

  on this issue is unassailable:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>       </span>The trespass statute authority to arrest is actually 
      quite narrow in scope and application.  The jurisdiction to arrest relates 
      to a single offence – trespass.  The citizen must see the subject actually 
      on the premises in circumstances of trespass addressed by s. 2 of the Act.  
      Unlike the Criminal Code scheme, the arresting party, pursuant to s. 9, 
      must have reasonable and probable grounds to believe the offence is being 
      committed.  Such a state of belief includes both subjective belief and an 
      objectively reasonable component for the arresting party’s conclusion:  
      <i>Storrey v. The Queen</i> (1990), 53 C.C.C. (3d) 316 (S.C.C.) at 323-4 
      per Cory J.  Lastly, the arrestee is to be promptly transferred to the custody 
      of a police officer.</p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

  9 of the <i>TPA </i>must, by virtue of the common law and by necessary and reasonable 
  implication, include the power to use reasonable force in order to effect the 
  arrest.  The Crown submits that the authority to use reasonable force is implicit 
  and inherent in the power to arrest under s. 9 and does not require separate 
  explicit statutory authority.  The accused submits that an arrest does not by 
  definition include the right to use force to detain the party arrested and that, 
  in the absence of an explicit grant of statutory power, a private citizen lacks 
  lawful authority to use force upon an arrest.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [37]     For the reasons that follow, we have concluded that the Crown's submission 
  on this point is correct in law and that the right to use reasonable force is 
  an incident of the statutory power of arrest.  In our respectful view, the trial

  reasonable force in order the effect the arrest, and the Crown's appeal should 
  be allowed and a conviction entered on the assault with intent to resist arrest 
  charge.</p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> The law defines with reasonable precision the circumstances in which 
  a private citizen has the legal right to effect an arrest.  In the present case, 
  there is no doubt about the right of the inspector, as a private citizen, to 
  arrest the accused pursuant to s. 9 of the <i>TPA</i>.  There is, however, a 
  surprising lack of explicit authority on the nature and scope of the powers 
  attendant upon or ancillary to a private citizen's right of arrest.  While this 
  appeal deals with a statutory power of arrest, the common law relating to the 
  law of arrest sheds light on the nature and scope of the power conferred by 
  the legislature.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [39]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Historically, the powers of arrest of ordinary citizens preceded and 
  formed the basis of the more extensive powers of arrest of public officers.  
  As explained by <i>Holdsworth</i>, <i>A History of English Law</i>, vol. III, 
  2nd impression (1973) at pp. 598-600, common law powers of arrest are derived 
  from the rights and duties of ordinary citizens in relation to the maintenance 
  of “the King’s peace”. In early times, before the advent of professional police 
  forces, the ordinary citizen not only enjoyed the <i>right</i> to make arrests, 
  but was <i>duty-bound</i> in certain cases to do so.  </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [40]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There can be little doubt that at common law, the private citizen's 
  powers of arrest included the authority to use force to ensure that the person 
  arrested was detained to be brought to justice.  The private citizen was duty-bound 
  to effect the arrest in order to ensure the King's peace and subject to legal 
  penalties for failure to live up to this duty.  The law could hardly expect 
  the citizen to fulfil this duty without the right to use reasonable force to 
  ensure that the arrested party was brought to justice.  <i>Blackstone</i>, <i>Commentaries 
  on the Law of England</i>, Book 4, Lewis ed. (1897) at p. 289 defines arrest 
  as “the apprehending or restraining of one’s person, in order to be forthcoming 
  to answer an alleged or suspected crime.”  Blackstone describes the common law 
  powers of arrest by a private person without warrant at pp. 292-93:</p>
<blockquote>

  </span> As the common law evolved, distinctions were drawn between the circumstances 
  in which public officers and private citizens could effect an arrest.  The powers 
  of public officers expanded and the legal compulsion upon private citizens to 
  arrest felons became obsolete. The important point is that the citizen’s power 
  to arrest preceded that of the law enforcement officer.  The latter is a species 
  of the former, not the reverse.  It follows that it is not appropriate to treat 
  the citizen's power to arrest as exceptional or as a partial derivative of the 
  powers possessed by peace officers.  While the circumstances in which a private 
  citizen could conduct an arrest were defined more narrowly than those of peace 
  officers, where a private citizen had the right to effect an arrest, the right 
  to use reasonable force to effect the arrest remained.</p>

  </span> There is little doubt that, at common law, a private citizen who had 
  the lawful authority to arrest was also authorized to use reasonable force to 
  ensure that the arrest was effective and that the arrested party was brought 
  to justice.  The right to use reasonable force is, in the eyes of the common 
  law, simply part and parcel of the right to make an arrest.</p>

  the right to use reasonable force upon arrest, recourse to common law authority 
  should be avoided.  We do not accept that submission.  The relevance of common 
  law principles to the definition and scope of statutory powers of arrest is 
  well established in Canadian law.  In <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i>, (1974), 19 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 129 (S.C.C.), the issue was whether a peace officer authorized to make 
  an arrest had the lawful authority to commit a trespass if necessary to make 
  the arrest.  Dickson J. concluded that although there was no statutory authority 
  to trespass, the officer did have the authority by virtue of the common law.  
  Similarly, the power to conduct a personal search upon arrest is not provided 
  for in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, but has been found to exist by virtue of the 
  common law: see <i>R.</i> v. <i>Alderton</i> (1985), 49 O.R. (2d) 257 (C.A.); 
  <i>R.</i> v. <i>Lerke</i> (1986), 24 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Alta C.A.).  In <i>R.

      albeit within the general scope of such a duty, involve an unjustifiable 
      use of powers associated with the duty. [emphasis added]</span></p>

  power on the police carries with it &quot;ancillary powers&quot; that arise 
  &quot;by necessary implication and unavoidable inference&quot;: see <i>Lyons

  </span> The submission that the powers of someone conducting a lawful arrest 
  must be strictly limited to the literal terms of what is specified by the statute 
  authorizing the arrest is at odds with <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> and the cases 
  dealing with the right to search the person arrested.  In those cases, common 
  law principles defining the powers of a party conducting an arrest were applied 
  to elaborate the powers of a party acting under the authority of a statute.  
  When the legislature uses a word such as &quot;arrest&quot; that has an established 
  meaning in law, the legislature must be taken to have intended the word to be 
  interpreted in light of that meaning.  As Lord Diplock stated in <i>Holgate-Mohammed 
  v. Duke</i>, [1984] 1 A.C. 437 at p. 441, when the word &quot;arrest&quot; appears 
  in a statute, it is a &quot;term of art&quot;.  By authorizing a private citizen 
  to conduct an arrest in s. 9 of the <i>TPA</i>, the legislature may be taken 
  to have adopted a shorthand method of authorizing whatever powers are implicit 
  or inherent in the very meaning of arrest by virtue of established common law 
  principles.  </p>

  </span> The leading Canadian case dealing with the powers ancillary to an arrest 
  by a private citizen is the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>R.</i> 
  <i>v</i>. <i>Lerke</i>, <i>supra</i>.  The appellant had been arrested as a 
  trespasser by a private citizen following an incident in a bar.  The arrest 
  was made pursuant to Alberta's <i>Petty Trespass Act </i>which confers a power 
  of arrest in terms very similar to the <i>TPA</i>.  Upon the arrest, the private 
  citizen searched the pockets of the appellant and found an illegal drug.  The 
  appellant was charged with possession of the drug.  A crucial issue was whether 
  the private person who made the arrest also had the lawful authority to search 
  the person of the party arrested.  The statute clothing the private citizen 
  with the power to effect the arrest was silent on the point.  Writing for the 
  court, Laycraft C.J.A. reviewed the historical common law origins of the citizen's 
  power to arrest and observed at p. 134:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The conclusion of English historians is that the citizen’s right to arrest 
      should not be analyzed as being derived from the rights of a peace officer 
      or as consisting of some portion only of the rights and powers of a peace 
      officer.  The reverse is true.  A peace officer possesses the rights of 
      a citizen with some additions.  For the most part, he does as a matter of 
      duty the acts which he might have done voluntarily.</p>

'> [47]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Laycraft C.J.A. concluded that where a citizen had the right to conduct 
  an arrest, the powers ancillary to that right should be treated as equivalent 
  to those possessed by the police.  Laycraft C.J.A. cited this Court’s decision 
  in <i>R.</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Alderton</i>, <i>supra,</i> where Martin J.A. held 
  that it was settled law that police officers may automatically conduct a reasonable 
  search of an arrested person after a valid arrest and seize anything that they 
  believe will afford evidence of the offence in question.  In considering the 
  application of the law pertaining to police officers to the context of the citizen’s 
  arrest, Laycraft C.J.A. held at p. 135.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The modifications to the common law power of a citizen to make an arrest 
      incorporated in the <i>Criminal Code</i> or in the <i>Petty Trespass Act</i> 
      do not change the fundamental nature of the citizen's arrest.  The power 
      exercised by a citizen who arrests another is in direct descent over nearly 
      a thousand years of the powers and duties of citizens in the age of Henry 
      II in relation to the &quot;King's Peace&quot;.  Derived from the sovereign 
      it is the exercise of a State function.</p>

  </span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Laycraft C.J.A. commented 
  on the search powers of citizens and police officers as follows, at p. 139:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In both cases the search is needed for protection of the person making 
      the arrest against later attack by the person arrested who might use a concealed 
      weapon.  It is also needed to obtain and preserve evidence related to the 
      offence for which the arrest is being made. … <i>Of course there are fewer 
      occasions when a private citizen is permitted to make an arrest compared 
      to a police officer.  But if the private citizen is acting validly within 
      his more limited powers, I see no ground to suppose that his rights of search 
      incidental to that arrest are less or different than those of a police officer.</i> 
    </p>
    <p>A citizen may, on occasion, have greater need of a right to search than 
      does the peace officer.  Citizen’s arrests, infrequently as they occur, 
      take place when the police are neither present nor available.  Often they 
      result from a chase, in circumstances where violent reaction can be expected.  
      The citizen has neither side-arm, badge nor uniform, let alone warrant, 
      on which to rely.  He lacks the coercive presence of these attributes of 
      authority which help the peace officer to avoid violence<i>.</i>  The right 
      to search, at least to disarm, is essential. [emphasis added]</p>

  </span> In our view, the same reasoning should govern the circumstances of this 
  case. At common law, a private citizen has the right to use reasonable force 
  to ensure that the accused is brought to justice.  Similarly, it is well accepted 
  in Canada that a police officer has the right to use reasonable force to effect 
  an arrest: see <i>R. </i>v. <i>Whitfield</i> (1969), 7 D.L.R. (3d) 97 at p. 
  99 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Tricker </i>(1995), 96 C.C.C. (3d) 198 at p. 207 (Ont. 
  C.A.).  There is no dispute that the inspector had the power to arrest the accused 
  under the authority of the <i>TPA </i>and that he did effect an arrest.<i>  
  </i>The actions of the accused resisting the arrest and escaping the custody 
  of the inspector made the use of some force by the inspector necessary if the 
  arrest was to be effective. The common law principles defining arrest as including 
  the right to use reasonable force support the conclusion that implicit in the 
  statutory power is the right to use reasonable force to ensure the arrest is 
  effective. </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;'><b><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Is

  </span> The accused submits that the legislature addressed the question of the 
  use of reasonable force in the <i>Provincial Offences Act,</i> s. 146.  That 
  section only applies to police officers or private citizens called to assist 
  police officers and does not apply to private citizens who make arrests.  The

  arrests are not covered by the section, they do not have the right to use force.

  </span> We were not referred to any authority on s. 146 itself.  However, s. 
  146 is cast in terms similar to s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It has been 
  consistently held that s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not confer powers 
  upon police officers or others, but rather shields them from civil or criminal 
  prosecution if they act on reasonable and probable grounds in the exercise of 
  their authority and use reasonable force for that purpose.  The argument that 
  s. 25 is a power-conferring provision was rejected by Dickson J. in <i>Eccles 
  v. Bourque</i>, <i>supra</i> at p. 131:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Section 25 does not have such amplitude. The section merely affords justification 
      to a person for doing what he is required or authorized by law to do in 
      the administration or enforcement of the law, if he acts on reasonable and 
      probable grounds, and for using necessary force for that purpose. The question 
      which must be answered in this case, then, is whether the respondents were 
      required or authorized by law to commit a trespass; and not, as their counsel 
      contends, whether they were required or authorized to make an arrest.  If 
      they were authorized by law to commit a trespass, the authority for it must 
      be found in the common law for there is nothing in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>

  serves, in other words, as a &quot;shield&quot; and not as a &quot;sword&quot;, 
  and accordingly does not represent a legislative attempt to deal exhaustively 
  with the use of force by those conducting arrests.  We therefore reject the 
  contention that the exclusion of arrests by private citizens from the protective 
  shield of s. 146 is indicative of a legislative intention to limit the authority 
  of private citizens to use reasonable force when conducting a lawful arrest 
  under provincial legislation.</p>

  (2) provides that a conservation officer has the power of arrest in certain 
  circumstances and that he or she may use reasonable force in so doing.  Similarly, 
  the <i>Fish Inspection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F-18, ss. 7(2), (3) provides 
  that an inspector has certain powers of arrest; and that reasonable force may 
  be used in the exercise of such powers.  As noted earlier, the trial judge referred 
  as well to other statutes expressly providing for the use of force in certain 
  circumstances.  We do not regard the fact that the legislature went out of its 
  way to specify the power to use force in aid of the powers conferred by these

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

      should not be necessary to an arrest that there should be a possession of 
      the person.  <i>But probably the reason which led to the laying down of 
      the law as it stands was that it was thought desirable to avoid unnecessary 
      violence; and therefore it was determined that, if the officer was near 
      enough to the debtor to touch him, it was the duty of the debtor to submit; 
      and this for the purpose of preventing conflict.</i>  I may remark parenthetically 
      that what the law of <u>England</u> most aims at is the preservation of 
      peace.  It will not allow a man to take forcible possession of even his 
      own property.  But, whatever be the reason, the law is that, if the officer 
      is near enough to the debtor to touch him, and does touch him, and gives 
      him notice of the writ, it is an arrest.  I can well understand the reason

      actually seizes the accused’s person, is found not to have made an arrest

  amount to a &quot;symbolic&quot; or &quot;technical&quot; arrest in which force

  A private person who effects an arrest without warrant is obliged to turn the 
  person arrested over to the authorities to be dealt with according to law.  
  The purpose of an arrest is to ensure that the party arrested is brought to 
  justice, and the common law defines arrest in terms of a continuing act, not 
  just the initial apprehension and assertion of control.  In <i>John Lewis &amp; 
  Co. Ltd. v.</i> <i>Tims</i>, [1952] 1 All E.R. 1203 at pp. 1209-11 (H.L.), Lord 
  Porter reviewed the authorities on the point, and held at p. 1210 that &quot;the 
  arrestor is not free of his obligation until he has proceeded before a magistrate.”  
  Similarly, in <i>Holgate-Mohammed v. Duke</i>, <i>supra</i> at p. 441, Lord 
  Diplock stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>it should be noted that arrest is a continuing 
      act; it starts with the arrester taking a person into his custody, (sc. 
      by action or words restraining him from moving anywhere beyond the arrester's 
      control), and it continues until the person so restrained is either released 
      from custody or, having been brought before a magistrate, is remanded in 
      custody by the magistrate's judicial act.</span></p>

  </span> The <i>TPA</i> makes explicit reference to the private citizen's duty 
  to deliver the arrested party.  Pursuant to s. 9(2), a private party who makes 
  an arrest is required promptly to call for police assistance and to deliver 
  the person arrested into the custody of the police officer.  This statutory 
  duty corresponds to the duty that exists at common law.  It indicates that the 
  nature of the arrest contemplated by the <i>TPA</i> consists of continuing control 
  and constraint, not merely the touching and initial apprehension of the trespasser.</p>

  </span> The trial judge was quite properly concerned with the implications of 
  according private citizens the right to use force in conducting arrests.  We 
  agree that limiting the risk of escalating violence in the tense circumstances 
  often surrounding arrests by private citizens is an important policy objective 
  to be pursued in this area of the law.  However, we do not agree that denying 
  the private citizen the right to use reasonable force is unambiguously the best 
  way to minimize the risk of escalating violence.  Private citizens do not have 
  broad powers of arrest.  A private citizen’s power of arrest is restricted, 
  for the most part, to situations in which there is an observable crisis.  Where, 
  as in the present case, the party arrested does not comply willingly with the 
  arrest, there is an inherent risk of violence.  The issue is who becomes the 
  wrongdoer if force is used.  If the party conducting a legal arrest has no power 
  to employ reasonable force to effect the arrest in the face of unlawful resistance, 
  the law would create a situation in which the party being arrested is free to 
  resist the arrest without fear of reprisal.  If the party conducting the arrest 
  attempts to use force to control the arrested party, such force would not be 
  justified and the arrester becomes the wrongdoer.  Arguably, this legal regime 
  would unduly encourage those being arrested to resort to unlawful means to avoid 
  the arrest.  It may well be that maintenance of public peace would be better 
  served by allowing private persons to use reasonable force to bring offenders 
  under control.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [64]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A related point is the apparent lack of logic in a regime that entitles 
  a party to conduct a lawful arrest but prevents him or her from using reasonable 
  force to make the arrest effective.  The accused was legally required to comply 
  with the lawful arrest conducted by the inspector.  Up to the point the accused 
  resisted the arrest and escaped the inspector's custody, the inspector's actions 
  were lawful.  The actions of the accused in resisting the arrest and escaping 
  the inspector's custody were unlawful.  Those unlawful actions were met with 
  a direct and understandable response by the inspector.  The minimal force used 
  by the inspector would clearly pass any test of reasonableness.  Yet on the 
  legal theory advanced by the accused, the inspector's use of force would be 
  unlawful and would represent an illegal assault.  To accept that theory would 
  be to say that, although the arrest was lawful, as soon as the arrested party 
  resisted the arrest, the arrester would immediately have to desist and not respond 
  to the unlawful actions of the arrested party.  In our view, it is difficult 
  to accept the proposition that in this sequence of actions, the <i>unlawful</i> 
  act of the arrested party should render the subsequent acts of the arrester 
  illegal. </p>

  </span> On this issue, we find the discussion in Bassiouni, <i>Citizen’s Arrest: 
  The Law of Arrest, Search, and Seizure For Private Citizens and Private Police</i> 
  (1977) to be helpful.  Bassiouni, at p. 54, analyzes of the relationship between 
  the prohibition on resisting legal arrest and the policies behind the citizen’s 
  arrest: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>An arrest is by its very nature a limitation on the personal freedom of 
      the arrestee.  To allow resistance to arrest would be to deny the ranking 
      (superiority) of the right of the arrestor over the right of the arrestee 
      to be free from any limitations thereto.  The inarticulate premise of such 
      an argument rests on the lawfulness of the arrest (which includes the authority 
      of the arrestor).  <i>The outcome of this assertion is predicated on the 
      balancing of the right to perform an arrest (lawful and with legal authority) 
      and the right to be free from restraint.  Where the first is allowed, the 
      second must abate.</i> [emphasis added]</p>

  </span> Bassiouni then discusses the public order policy of several of the American 
  jurisdictions that deny a right to resist <i>any</i> form of arrest (<i>i.e.</i> 
  whether lawful or not).  He writes at pp. 55-56: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span>If prohibition against resisting arrest is dependent 
      upon who is the performer of the arrest, then a distinction can be made 
      between a peace officer and a citizen whereby, by reason of his duties, 
      the officer would be shielded by the law more than the citizen.  If the 
      prohibition is based solely on a public order consideration, then no distinction 
      should be made between a citizen and a peace officer since resisting arrest 
      in either case is disruptive of public order and contravenes the exercise 
      of a public order function.</p>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Were the law to discourage 
      citizen’s arrest, it would allow resisting it;</span></i> but in that case, 
      the right or privilege to perform a citizen’s arrest would not legally exist.  
      <i>One can then assume that a right or privilege must be generative at law 
      of a superior authority which imposes limitations upon another right deemed 
      subject to legally imposed infirmities.</i> [emphasis added]<u></u></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In 
  footnotes to the above, Bassiouni states (at pp. 55-56):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span>Use of force to perform an arrest or prevent the 
      commission of an offense or stop the escape of a criminal is not a license 
      but a legal privilege.  It must be exercised within the legal limitations 
      delineated by law in the context of the purposes and aims of the privilege.  
      An arrest is intended to prevent the commission of a crime and to apprehend 
      any offender.  The force to be employed must be commensurate to that which 
      the circumstances and conduct of the offender reasonably project in the 
      eyes of the arresting officer.…</p>
    <p>…A private person who makes or assists another private person in making 
      a lawful arrest need not retreat or desist from efforts to make a lawful 
      arrest because of resistance or threatened resistance to the arrest.  He 
      is justified in the use of force which he reasonably believes to be necessary 
      to effect the arrest and of any force which he reasonably believes to be 
      necessary to defend himself or another from bodily harm while making the 
      arrest.</p>

<p><b><i><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>What is “reasonable force”?</span></i></b></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [67]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We emphasize that at issue here is the use of <i>reasonable</i> force 
  to make an arrest effective.  No issue is taken with the proposition that the 
  force used by the inspector was reasonable in the circumstances.  In these circumstances, 
  it is not necessary for us to consider the limits of reasonable force.  However, 
  it should be mentioned that the valid policy concerns expressed by the trial 
  judge on the importance of legal rules that limit violence or the risk of escalation 
  of violence have an important bearing on the limits of reasonable force. </p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [68]     <span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We conclude accordingly that the inspector had lawful authority to use 
  reasonable force in effecting a lawful arrest pursuant to s. 9 of the <i>TPA</i>.  
  It follows that the trial judge erred in finding the accused not guilty of assault 
  with intent to resist arrest.  </p>

  </span> Accordingly, we would dismiss the accused’s appeal against the convictions 
  for escaping lawful custody and allow the Crown’s appeal against the acquittal
