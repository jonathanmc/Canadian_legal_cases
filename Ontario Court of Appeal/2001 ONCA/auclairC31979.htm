lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Jacques Auclair (“Auclair”) appeals from his conviction on charges 
  of breaking and entering with intent, kidnapping, sexual assault causing bodily 
  harm, sexual invitation and sexual touching of a person under the age of 14 
  years.  Auclair also seeks leave to appeal from the sentence imposed of 11 years 
  imprisonment with no eligibility for parole for 5½ years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The conviction appeal is based upon arguments of unreasonable 
  verdicts and misapprehension of the evidence.  The sentence is said to be unduly 
  harsh and the order under s. 743.6(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> requiring 
  the appellant to serve one half of his sentence before being eligible for parole, 
  to be without any proper basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was about 53 years of age at the time of the offences 
  charged.  He had a grade 10 education and was an admitted alcoholic.  He lived 
  with Claire Leduc, then about age 30, in a rented house in St. Charles, Ontario.  
  At the time of the offences charged, he was in the process of moving back to 
  Sudbury to live by himself and had rented a U-haul van for that purpose.  Leduc 
  was not pleased with this change.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant, F.B., then age nine, lived with her mother D.W. 
  and D.W.’s brother in a second floor apartment in Sudbury.  The appellant and 
  Leduc visited D.W. on the evening of December 3, 1996.  The appellant had been 
  drinking and continued to drink while on the premises.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It seems clear that the complainant ended up driving off with 
  the appellant and Leduc either that night or early the next morning.  The accounts 
  given by the complainant and her mother were quite different but they agree 
  to the extent that her departure was without her mother’s consent.  In examination-in-chief 
  the complainant said the appellant picked her up and put her in his moving van.  
  On cross-examination she agreed that it could have been Leduc who picked her 
  up and took her to the van.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant said he had passed out at D.W.’s apartment.  He 
  said he remembered leaving it without the complainant and arriving at his home 
  in St. Charles, but he remembered nothing further until he awoke next morning 
  and found the complainant there.  Leduc told him that D.W. had given permission 
  for the complainant to go with them and that he had been passed out all night.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Leduc did not testify at the appellant’s trial.  She was charged 
  jointly with the appellant with breaking and entering with intent and kidnapping.  
  She was charged at the same time with two counts of breaching probation orders 
  to keep the peace and be of good behaviour. On August 1, 1997 she pleaded guilty 
  to kidnapping and to one of the breach of probation charges.  She had a record 
  extending back to 1987, comprising three convictions for theft under $1,000, 
  two of making harassing telephone calls and one of criminal harassment.  She 
  received a sentence of five years for kidnapping, six months concurrent for 
  breach of probation and a ten year prohibition order with respect to firearms 
  under s. 100 of the <i>Criminal Code</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant testified that the appellant and Leduc took her 
  in the van to a house she had never been to before.  The man picked her up and 
  took her inside and into a bedroom where he lifted up her night-gown and pulled 
  down her underwear.  She also testified that she couldn’t see because her eyes 
  were closed.  She testified that he pushed his finger into her vagina and it 
  hurt her.  He then tried to push his penis into her vagina.  He told her to 
  shut up because no one could hear her cry.  Although she thought it was the 
  man, the complainant agreed it could have been the woman (Leduc) who touched 
  her.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was the testimony of the complainant that the appellant and 
  Leduc then took her to another house which she could not see because her eyes 
  were closed.  She testified that the appellant picked her up and took her into 
  the second house, putting her on the couch.  He told the complainant to play 
  with his penis but she refused to do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainant testified that Leduc told her to hide upstairs 
  when they heard someone approaching the house.  She went to a bedroom and could 
  hear talking downstairs.  She thought the visitor sounded like a man.  The complainant 
  testified that she heard the three leave in a vehicle.  In previous testimony, 
  the complainant testified that she had seen the two men and the woman kill a 
  bear.  However, during the trial, she admitted that she did not see a bear, 
  nor had she seen anyone shooting a gun, and must have been mistaken about hearing 
  a bear.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ken Kiddle (“Kiddle”), who was convicted of sexual assault on 
  a minor in 1990, testified that he was at home that day when Leduc came to visit 
  him.  She stayed for a while before they both went back to the residence where 
  the appellant was.  When they arrived, Kiddle observed the appellant drinking 
  rye.  He seemed to be sleepy and a little drunk while Leduc appeared sober.  
  The three decided to go into St. Charles and the appellant and Kiddle returned 
  to Kiddle’s residence in the U-haul van to get some money. Kiddle and the appellant 
  both consumed alcohol while they were there.  They returned to the residence 
  to pick up Leduc before driving into St. Charles.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to the appellant he had no sexual contact whatever 
  with the complainant.  From his house in St. Charles he went to a second residence 
  to get his furniture for the move.  He took Leduc and the complainant with him.  
  While there he drank alcohol and made food for the complainant and himself.  
  He had intercourse with Leduc.  She then went to visit Kiddle and was back in 
  about fifteen minutes.  Then the appellant drove Kiddle back to his place to 
  get some money so they could go to the store.  Kiddle and the appellant then 
  returned to the second residence.  The complainant was asleep so Leduc, Kiddle 
  and the appellant went off to the store.  On their way back to the second residence 
  from the store they were stopped by police.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The police intended to inquire about a missing person but upon 
  observing the appellant, they arrested him for impaired driving.  According 
  to the police officer the appellant had a strong odour of alcohol, slurred speech, 
  red glassy eyes and unsteady balance.  The van was stopped at 3:25 p.m.  A breathalyzer 
  test administered an hour later produced readings of 252 and 248 mg. of alcohol 
  per 100 ml. of blood.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the appellant was arrested and taken away, Leduc took the 
  police to the second residence.  The complainant testified that after she found 
  herself alone, she took a chair and an axe, broke a window, crawled out and 
  began walking in the direction of a construction site.  The police found her 
  about 4:20 p.m. by following her footprints in the snow from the second residence.  
  The temperature was approximately -5° to -10° Celsius and snow was falling.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s defence was that Leduc somehow brought about 
  his predicament.  A few days before the appellant’s arrest, Leduc visited Gaetanne 
  Poulin who had known Leduc since Leduc was a child.  Ms. Poulin testified that 
  during the visit Leduc had expressed anger towards the appellant and that Leduc 
  said repeatedly that the appellant was “going to get it” and that he was not 
  finished with her.  Leduc would not elaborate except to say that the appellant 
  would have trouble and it would be in the newspaper.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The next evening, while Ms. Poulin, Leduc and the appellant were 
  visiting James Pearson, Poulin heard Leduc say that she had something up her 
  sleeve.  Poulin also testified that she often observed Leduc wearing the appellant’s 
  coat and playing with condoms.  She testified that Leduc could physically handle 
  the appellant when he passed out, which sometimes happened when he drank.  Pearson 
  testified that during the visit he offered the appellant some strong prescription 
  sleeping pills.  In Leduc’s presence he warned the appellant not to mix the 
  pills with alcohol.  When Pearson tendered the pills to the appellant, Leduc 
  took them and put them in her purse.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s brother-in-law, Laurent Desormeaux, testified 
  that the appellant and Leduc had visited him during the afternoon before going 
  on to the D.W.’s.  Desormeaux testified that the appellant was drinking beer, 
  but Leduc did not seem to be drinking.  Throughout the visit Leduc referred 
  to having something up her sleeve but Desormeaux did not know what she was referring 
  to.  He testified that the appellant was tipsy when he left with Leduc at about 
  5:30 p.m.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While visiting D.W. that evening Leduc mixed the appellant’s 
  drinks and he passed out on the floor.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dr. Vijay Kumar examined the complainant once on the evening 
  of the day she was found and again two days later.  On the first occasion he 
  observed two lacerations or breaks in the skin on opposite sides of the labia 
  minora.  He said the hymenal orifice was irregular and that there was redness 
  and congestion of the vaginal area.  During the second examination which was 
  under anaesthetic, he found two further lacerations he estimated as being two 
  to three days old.  He said one was very unlikely to find these on a healthy 
  nine year old and that the cause was an object small enough to go deep.  He 
  could not say what the object would be, but the cause could not be disease.  
  There had to be some degree of force used.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Later testing of complainant’s urine showed that there was metabolite 
  in her system consistent with the ingestion of halcion.  Halcion is a hypnotic 
  drug intended to induce sleep. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> DNA analysis was also done, although not with respect to either 
  Leduc or Kiddle.  Ms. Pamela Newall testified as to the results; her testimony 
  is summarized in the table set out as appendix A to these reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The case was tried without a jury.  The trial judge gave relatively 
  short, but clear reasons.  On appeal, the ground of unreasonable verdicts was 
  argued largely on the basis of credibility, there being a very substantial number 
  of conflicts in the testimony of the prosecution’s witnesses.  I am not persuaded 
  however, that the weight of those conflicts is such that the verdicts could 
  be said to be unreasonable and I would not give effect to that ground.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the other hand, the trial judge appears to have misapprehended 
  some of the DNA evidence respecting the charges of sexual assault and sexual 
  touching.  Towards the end of his reasons the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The defense argues that the evidence of F.B., a child of nine when the 
      events were said to have taken place, and 11 when she testified, is so full 
      of inconsistencies that it cannot be relied upon as proof beyond a reasonable 
      doubt of the accused’s guilt.  The Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Stewart </i>(1994), 
      18 O.R. (3d) 509 (C.A.) sets out clearly the way in which trial courts should 
      view a child’s evidence.  If it were only F.’s evidence left for the court 
      to consider one would be hard pressed to say the Crown has proven its case 
      against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.  However, there is a substantial 
      body of evidence to corroborate F.  Below is a non-exhaustive list of evidence,

  </span></span> Contrary to the trial judge’s understanding of the evidence, 
  it is clear from the testimony of Ms. Newall, which is summarized in Appendix 
  A, that the DNA evidence was not “completely consistent” with the appellant 
  having sexually assaulted the complainant.  The trial judge appears to have 
  misunderstood item 4 of Appendix A which states that a blood and semen stain 
  on the inside of the appellant’s underwear “matched the appellant”, was “consistent 
  with a mixture of the complainant and the appellant, however, [it is] overstating 
  it to say that it matched the complainant” and it “could not be said whether 
  the blood/semen stain was a mixture or layered over time”.  According to Ms. 
  Newall’s testimony the semen and blood stain found in the appellant’s underwear 
  matched <i>his</i> DNA and was consistent with a mixture of the appellant’s 
  and complainant’s DNA, but it could not be said to “match” the complainant’s 
  DNA.  The fact that there was semen on his underwear could be explained by his 
  having had intercourse with Leduc.  If the DNA in item 4 had matched that of 
  the complainant, then that aspect of the DNA evidence would have been completely 
  consistent with F.B. having been sexually assaulted by the appellant on December 
  4<sup>th</sup>, 1996.  That, however, was not the case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Perhaps more important, the trial judge did not deal in his reasons 
  with the DNA evidence which tended to exculpate the appellant.  Item 7 of Appendix 
  A deals with a condom found in the appellant’s pocket.  It had been used, but 
  no semen was found on it.  However, the condom was found to have two sources 
  of DNA on it, the dominant one matching that of the complainant and the subordinate 
  one being from an unknown source.  In the circumstances, it is possible that 
  the condom was used during the sexual assault on the complainant.  It is significant 
  that the test absolutely excluded the appellant as the source of this subordinate 
  DNA.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Earlier in his reasons, the trial judge stated that “the forensic, 
  toxicological and DNA scientific evidence called by the Crown established the 
  following:”,  setting out the various items of scientific evidence linking the 
  appellant to the offences, including item 4 of Appendix A.  There is no mention, 
  however, in any part of the reasons, to the exculpatory aspect of item 7 of 
  Appendix A.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>While trial judges are not obliged to give reasons 
  dealing with every aspect of the evidence, however insignificant:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Where the record including the reasons for judgment, discloses a lack of 
      appreciation of relevant evidence and more particularly, the complete disregard 
      of such evidence, then it falls upon the reviewing tribunal to intercede.

lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Reading the reasons of the trial judge as a whole, it appears 
  he misapprehended the evidence in item 4 of Appendix A and failed to apprehend 
  the significance of item 7 of Appendix A.  Failure to understand and apply this 
  evidence renders the conviction unsafe.  This leads me to conclude that there 
  may well have been a miscarriage of justice with respect to the convictions 
  for sexual assault and sexual touching.  Accordingly, those convictions must 
  be set aside and a new trial directed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The conviction for sexual invitation was based upon the complainant’s 
  evidence that when they went to the second house, the appellant put her on the 
  couch and told her to play with his penis but she refused to do so.  It could 
  be argued that this evidence stands by itself and that accordingly the conviction 
  for that offence should not be set aside.  The whole course of reasoning of 
  the trial judge, however, was that the purpose of the kidnapping was the sexual 
  gratification of the appellant.  That reasoning is undermined and rendered suspect 
  because of its connection to the convictions for sexual assault and sexual touching, 
  which have been set aside.  It is my view that in these circumstances it would 
  be unsafe to leave standing the conviction for sexual invitation.  I would, 
  therefore, set it aside as well and direct a new trial on all three counts.</p>

  </span></span> Although it was not argued on the appeal, the matter of the halcion 
  gives me some concern.  It was mentioned as the first point in the recital of 
  forensic, toxicological and DNA evidence in the trial judge’s reasons for conviction, 
  but not otherwise in those reasons.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>At the outset of his reasons for sentencing, 
  however, the trial judge said:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>It is important to say something though about the incident.  </p>
    <p>On December the 3<sup>rd</sup>, 1996 the offender, in the company of a 
      female friend stopped at the residence of D.W. and her 11 year old daughter 
      F.B., the victim in this matter.  During this social evening there is some 
      evidence that F. was drugged.  This was done for the sole purpose of returning 
      later to abduct her and this was accomplished.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing further was said by the trial judge respecting the drugging.  The uncontradicted 
  evidence of Pearson was that he offered pills to the appellant, pills he said 
  which would knock one out and when he held them out to the appellant, Leduc 
  took them and put them in her purse.  The drugging of the complainant and the 
  appellant’s defence that he was also drugged required that that evidence be 
  considered and dealt with, but it was not.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For these reasons, I would set aside the convictions 
  for sexual assault, sexual touching and sexual invitation and order a new trial 
  with respect to them.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The convictions for breaking and entering with intent and kidnapping 
  are amply supported by the evidence.  The trial judge accepted the evidence 
  of D.W. that she was awakened early in the morning and heard the voices of Leduc 
  and the appellant and then the voice of the appellant as he attempted to choke 
  D.W. when they came back for the complainant.  The trial judge also accepted 
  the evidence that the appellant must have done the driving.  I would therefore 
  dismiss the appeal from the convictions for breaking and entering with intent 
  and kidnapping.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant spent two years in pre-trial custody.  After conviction 
  his counsel suggested a sentence of five years in addition, to reflect a total 
  of nine years in custody.  The Crown requested that in addition to the time 
  already served, he receive a sentence of 15 years, together with an order under 
  s. 743.6(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that he serve half of his sentence before 
  being eligible for parole.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge began his reasons for sentencing as set out above 
  in paragraph 31.  He continued as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The offender took F. to two isolated locations in the vicinity of St. Charles, 
      Ontario where he sexually assaulted her on more than one occasion.  As a 
      result of his actions, and in her attempt to escape F. was fortunate to

    <p>Something must be said about the obvious disparity between the sentence

      before him.  I have read the Reasons of Justice Meehan.  There is do doubt 
      that his greatest emphasis was on the principle of general deterrence emanating 
      from society’s needs to protect our children.  However, he also considered 
      the particular circumstances of the offender before him; her mental state, 
      criminal record, her involvement in the offences and the assistance she 
      gave the police in locating the victim.  </p>
    <p>The involvement of this offender in the offence was far greater than that 
      of Ms. Leduc.  The kidnapping was carried out solely for his sexual gratification 
      and at his instigation.  As well, this offender’s criminal record demonstrates 
      he is a far greater danger to the community than Ms. Leduc.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant was 55 years old at the time of sentencing.  He 
  had a lengthy criminal record going back to 1962.  It included a ten year sentence, 
  but no sex-related offences.  Counsel for the appellant argues that the sentence 
  was harsh, that there was gross disparity and there was no basis for a s. 743.6(1) 
  order.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Harshness and disparity may be dealt with together.  Leduc may 
  have had a lesser role in the offences, but they could not have been carried 
  out without her co-operation.  She received a five year sentence in addition 
  to eight months pre-trial custody.  She also pleaded guilty, as well as taking 
  the police to the residence, resulting in the rescue of the complainant.  The 
  trial judge appears to have laid the drugging of the complainant at the feet 
  of the appellant but whether that is fair is not at all clear.  In any event 
  the sentence must be reconsidered in the light of the setting aside of the convictions 
  for sexual assault causing bodily harm, sexual touching and sexual invitation.  
  In all of the circumstances the appropriate remedy in my view would be to set 
  aside the sentences of five years each for the sexual offences, all concurrent 
  and reduce the sentences for breaking and entering with intent and kidnapping 
  from 11 years and ten years respectively to seven years and six years concurrent 
  respectively.</p>

  </span></span> Section 743.6(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> permits the court 
  to order that the portion of a sentence that must be served before an offender 
  may be released on full parole is one-half of the sentence or ten years, which 
  ever is the less.  The section requires consideration of the circumstances of 
  the commission of the offence, the character and circumstances of the offender 
  and whether the expression of society’s denunciation of the offence or the objective 
  of specific general deterrence so requires.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>It is significant that in this context the <i>Code</i> 
  places denunciation and deterrence, specific and general, ahead of the rehabilitation 
  of the offender. Section 743.6(2) provides as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>S. 743.6(2) </b>For greater certainty, the paramount principles which 
      are to guide the court under this section are denunciation and specific

  </span></span> The reasons given by the trial judge for the making of the s. 
  743.6(1) order in this case are set out above.  Their foundation is the finding 
  that the sexual gratification of the appellant is the reason for the kidnapping.  
  The setting aside of the sexual offences therefore requires a reconsideration.  
  The appellant’s participation in the kidnapping cannot be doubted but his motivation 
  and his precise role are now much less clear.  In the circumstances, it is my 
  respectful view that an order under s. 743.6(1) is no longer appropriate and 
  I would therefore set it aside.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In summary, the appeal with respect to the convictions for breaking 
  and entering with intent and  kidnapping is dismissed.  The appeal with respect 
  to sexual assault causing bodily harm, sexual touching and sexual invitation 
  is allowed and those three convictions are set aside and a new trial directed.  
  Leave to appeal the two remaining sentences is granted and those sentences are 
  reduced to seven years and six years concurrent, respectively.  The appeal against 
  the s. 743.6(1) order is allowed and that order is set aside.</p>
