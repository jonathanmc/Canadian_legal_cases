  </span></span> The applicant for intervenor status in this appeal, The National 
  Council of Veteran Associations in Canada (“NCVA”) is an umbrella organization 
  comprised of 37 associations, which represent collectively the interests of 
  more than 200,000 military veterans across Canada.  The NCVA has brought this 
  motion under Rule 13.03(2) seeking leave to intervene in this appeal as a friend 
  of the court. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appeal is from the judgment of Brockenshire 
  J. granting summary judgment to a class of disabled veterans, their dependants 
  and descendants who claimed that the Crown owed a fiduciary duty to pay them 
  interest on surplus statutory benefits being retained and administered by Veterans 
  Affairs Canada (formerly the Department of Veterans Affairs).</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The moving party has for many years played a significant role 
  in the development of legislation that affects veterans.  It is beyond dispute 
  that the NCVA has acted as an effective advocate and lobbying voice for Canada’s 
  veterans on Parliament Hill.  It submits that because of its long-term involvement 
  with veterans’ issues, it can put into perspective the history and nature of 
  the relationship between veterans and the government, as well as the nature 
  of the statutory scheme that governs that relationship, and thereby assist in 
  understanding the issues on this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondents oppose the motion, and submit that the NCVA does 
  not have a useful contribution to make to the legal issues on the appeal, in 
  that it would only support and repeat the issues that the Attorney General has 
  raised.  The respondents submit that the issues in which the NCVA proposes to 
  intervene involve the interpretation of federal legislation and issues that 
  are in the nature of private law, not matters of general public policy.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant takes no position in respect of 
  the motion.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I am guided in the exercise of my discretion 
  on this motion by the reasons of Dubin C.J.O. in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) 
  v. Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Co. of Canada Ltd</i> (1990), 74 O.R. (2d) 164 
  (C.A.) (“<i>Peel</i>”) who stated the test to be applied on motions such as 
  this, as follows, at p. 167:</span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE><span lang=EN-US>Although much has been written as to the 
  proper matters to be considered in determining whether an application for intervention 
  should be granted, in the end, in my opinion, the matters to be considered are 
  the nature of the case, the issues which arise and the likelihood of the applicant 
  being able to make a useful contribution to the resolution of the appeal without 
  causing injustice to the immediate parties.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Peel</i>, Chief Justice Dubin noted that in constitutional 
  cases, including cases decided under the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, 
  </i>there has been a relaxation of the rules heretofore governing the disposition 
  of motions for leave to intervene.   This approach ensures that the court will 
  have the benefit of various perspectives of the historical and sociological 
  context, as well as policy and other considerations that bear on the validity 
  of legislation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In contrast, Ontario courts have interpreted Rule 13 more narrowly 
  in conventional, non-constitutional litigation.  (See for example, <i>Peixeiro 
  v. Haberman </i>(1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 666 at  670 (Gen. Div.)).  Intervention 
  of third parties into essentially private disputes should be carefully considered 
  as any intervention can add to the costs and complexity of litigation, regardless 
  of an agreement to restrict submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Many appeals will fall somewhere in between the constitutional 
  and strictly private litigation continuum, depending on the nature of the case 
  and the issues to be adjudicated.  In my view, the burden on the moving party 
  should be a heavier one in cases that are closer to the “private dispute” end 
  of the spectrum. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The NCVA submits that this appeal “rises above” a purely private 
  dispute because it involves the relationship between the Crown and veterans 
  and their dependants.   In this appeal, however, the NCVA does not seek to intervene 
  in the issues relating to the impact of the <i>Charter</i> and the <i>Bill of 
  Rights</i> on the federal legislative scheme. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>While the case involves a claim against funds 
  that the Crown administers, under statute, and in the context of an action under 
  the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>, <i>1992</i>, it retains significant elements 
  of private litigation. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The main issues on this appeal are matters of statutory interpretation, 
  including the application of the <i>Charter </i>and the<i> Bill of Rights</i>, 
  and issues of trusts and fiduciary law. The plaintiffs claim that the Crown, 
  during the time the government administered the pensions, did not invest the 
  funds and did not pay interest but at all times owed the plaintiffs a fiduciary 
  duty to do both.  The Crown argues that it owes no fiduciary duty to these plaintiffs 
  and that the plaintiffs had no right in law to claim for such interest or to 
  demand that the funds be invested for their benefit. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The position of the NCVA is that an extension of the Crown’s 
  obligation, to the descendants of veterans, goes beyond the group that was contemplated 
  by the relevant legislation and such an obligation contravenes public policy.  
  The practical result of the judgment would be the diversion of public funds 
  and government resources to persons who were not intended to benefit under the 
  statutory benefits scheme established by Parliament. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The issues on which the NCVA seeks leave to 
  intervene as stated above are not, strictly speaking, constitutional issues 
  and do not require the sort of public-policy analysis that is called for in 
  cases of a constitutional nature. Moreover, the NCVA has not demonstrated that 
  it can bring any particular legal expertise to these issues. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, the second component of the <i>Peel</i> 
  test does not favour NCVA’s motion. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The NCVA argues that it can bring to this appeal its special 
  knowledge and unique perspective concerning the application of the statutory 
  scheme of pensions and other benefits to veterans.  The organization and its 
  member associations have, for example, represented the interests of veterans 
  before parliamentary committees and in the legislative process for approximately 
  eighty years.   The NCVA has developed extensive public-policy knowledge and 
  practical experience with respect to the administration of programs and benefits 
  that Veterans Affairs Canada administers. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>However, the moving party’s assertion in relation 
  to this appeal that the effect of the judgment on appeal would be the diversion 
  of public funds and resources from other worthy initiatives being advanced by 
  the NCVA on behalf of veterans, is entirely speculative.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>While I recognize the valuable contributions 
  that the NCVA has made and, continues to make in the political and legislative 
  process, in speaking for the interests of veterans and their dependants, I am 
  not persuaded that the NCVA has any special contribution to make in relation 
  to the interpretation of the legislation and the scope of any fiduciary duty 
  on the federal government in the circumstances of this action.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Having considered the submissions on behalf of the proposed intervenor, 
  I am satisfied that the public interest and that of the veterans will be fully 
  and adequately represented by counsel for the Attorney General of Canada.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I therefore conclude that the National Council 
  of Veteran Associations should not be granted leave to intervene as a friend 
  of the court on this appeal.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Given the nature of the moving party and its 
  member associations as non-profit and mostly voluntary groups who work tirelessly 
  for the benefit of those who have served their country, I do not think this 
  is an appropriate case for an award of costs.</span></p>
