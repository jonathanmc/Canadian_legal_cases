    </span>Assuming without deciding that the appellant’s action was not foreclosed 
    by the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine, we are satisfied that the action was 
    properly dismissed on its merits.</p>

    </span>The finding in the Quebec proceedings that the respondents (plaintiffs 
    in the Quebec action) did not have standing to challenge the will did not 
    constitute a finding that those proceedings were brought for an improper purpose.  
    The Quebec court did not address the purpose for which the proceedings were 
    brought.  In the Ontario action, the appellant had to establish that the respondents 
    had brought the Quebec proceedings for an improper purpose.  There was conflicting 
    evidence on this point.  The trial judge ultimately decided that the Quebec 
    action was not commenced for an improper purpose.  That factual finding is 
    entitled to deference.  The appellant has not demonstrated any ground upon 
    which we could interfere with that finding of fact.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The trial judge’s determination that the Quebec proceedings were not 
    brought for an improper purpose was determinative of the abuse of process 
    claim and the other claims advanced by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The appellant also contends that certain comments made by the trial 
    judge at the outset of the trial demonstrated a reasonable apprehension of 
    bias.  After reviewing the pleadings, the trial judge outlined several difficulties 
    which he saw with the appellant’s claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Some of the trial judge’s comments are troubling.  They suggest that 
    he had formed rather firm views on the issues even though he had not heard 
    any evidence or counsels’ submissions.  Considering the trial judge’s comments 
    in their totality, however, we are not satisfied that they display a reasonable 
    apprehension of bias.  In reaching this conclusion, we have considered not 
    only the comments relied on by the appellant but also later statements by 
    the trial judge.  Those statements contraindicate any predetermination of 
    the issues.</p>

    </span>The appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
