  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On a charge of first

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The deceased was the 
  wife of Vickram Mattai. The appellant was Vickram’s long-time employee. Unbeknownst 
  to the deceased, Vickram had been having an affair for years with the appellant<b>.</b> 
  Frustrated by the fact that Vickram would not leave his wife, the appellant 
  testified that she went to the deceased’s apartment on the morning of July 26, 
  1995 and disclosed to her the true nature of her relationship with Vickram. 
  According to the appellant, upon learning this, the deceased became angry and 
  attacked her. A violent struggle ensued. Although the appellant could not recall 
  all of the details, she remembered ending up on top of the deceased in a washroom 
  located some distance from where the struggle had begun. Both she and the deceased 
  were covered in blood. Believing that the deceased was alive but unconscious, 
  the appellant removed her own clothing and after changing into an outfit belonging 
  to the deceased, she left the apartment.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Vickram testified 
  that later that day, upon returning home in the early afternoon, he discovered 
  his wife’s lifeless body in the washroom. Her head was immersed in the bathtub 
  under about six inches of water, her torso was straddling the tub, and she was 
  wearing only a pair of panties. According to the pathological evidence, although 
  drowning could not be ruled out, manual strangulation was the most likely cause 
  of death.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>After being questioned 
  by the police for many hours on July 26 and 27, 1995, the appellant finally 
  admitted that she and the deceased had met and fought. She claimed however, 
  that she was acting in self-defence throughout and she denied killing the deceased. 
  Nonetheless, in view of her admission and other information available to the 
  police, she was arrested and charged with first degree murder.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>At trial, the appellant 
  maintained that she did not intend to kill the deceased and, to the extent that 
  she may have inflicted injuries upon her, that she was acting in self-defence 
  to preserve herself from death or serious bodily harm. The Crown, on the other 
  hand, maintained that the killing was planned and deliberate and that the appellant 
  committed the murder so that she and Vickram could be together. By its verdict 
  of second degree murder, the jury clearly rejected the Crown’s theory that the 
  killing was planned and deliberate. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>We have concluded 
  that the conviction for second degree murder cannot stand because of two significant 
  errors made by the trial judge in his charge to the jury. </span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>First, the trial judge 
  failed to instruct the jury on the lesser and included offence of manslaughter. 
  In our view, he was required to do so because, on this record, the appellant’s 
  intent at the time of the killing was a live issue. Specifically, on the basis 
  of the evidence presented at trial, it was open to the jury to find that the 
  victim died as a result of manual strangulation, that death occurred in the 
  course of a violent struggle between the appellant and the victim and that the 
  appellant’s state of mind at the time was such that she may not have foreseen 
  or intended the consequences of her acts.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The trial judge was 
  alive to this body of evidence. Indeed, in his instructions and reinstruction 
  on the issue of intent, he directed the jury as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>Looking at the issue of intent another way, you may find when considering the 
      evidence as a whole that at the time of the choking the accused was filled 
      with all sorts of emotions ranging from fear to anger to excitement and 
      then as a result she may have acted instinctively without consideration 
      of the consequences of her action.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>She testified that she was unaware 
      that her choking of the deceased caused the deceased’s death and that she 
      felt the deceased was merely unconscious when she stopped moving. The onus 
      is upon the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time of 
      this choking the accused intended to kill Neela Mattai or to cause her grievous 
      bodily harm which the accused knew was likely to cause death and was reckless 
      whether death ensued or not.</span></p>
    <p>If the Crown has satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that at the time 
      of the choking the accused either intended to kill Neela Mattai or intended 
      to cause grievous bodily harm to her which the accused knew was likely to 
      cause death and was reckless whether death ensued or not, then the accused 
      would be guilty of second degree murder.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>That instruction was 
  correct in so far as it went. Unfortunately, over the objection of defence counsel, 
  the trial judge refused to go further and direct the jury that if they believed 
  or had a reasonable doubt that the appellant did not possess one or the other 
  of the requisite intents for murder at the time of the killing, she could not 
  be convicted of second degree murder but only manslaughter. </span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='

  behalf of the Crown, Mr. Bulmer submits that the trial judge was not required 
  to instruct the jury on the included offence of manslaughter because intent 
  was not a live issue. As indicated, we do not accept that submission. Alternatively, 
  he submits that the trial judge’s failure to instruct on manslaughter occasioned 
  no prejudice to the appellant and he urges us to apply the curative proviso 
  to save the conviction. In short, Mr. Bulmer maintains that in view of the instruction 
  reproduced above, the trial judge effectively left the issue of intent to the 
  jury and if anything, the instruction was overly favourable to the appellant 
  because it would have led the jury to believe that the appellant must be acquitted 
  if she lacked the intent for murder. With respect, we disagree.</span></p>

  93 C.C.C. (3d) 107 (S.C.C.), Sopinka J. for the court explained why, as a general

  included offence has not been left to the jury:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The application of s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the 
      <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c.C-46 requires the court to consider 
      whether a jury properly instructed could, acting reasonably, have come to 
      a different conclusion absent the error. In applying this test the findings 
      of the jury in the case under appeal may be a factor in determining what 
      the hypothetical reasonable jury would have done, provided those findings 
      are not tainted by the error. <i>In cases in which an included offence is 
      not left with the jury, a conviction by the jury of the more serious offence 
      cannot generally be relied on by reason of the fact that it may very well 
      be a reaction against a complete acquittal. There is an apprehension that 
      the jury convicted because they had no other alternative than acquittal 
      and acquittal was unpalatable</i>. [Emphasis added]</span></p>

  second error in the charge relates to the trial judge’s instructions on the 
  issue of self-defence. In the charge proper and in his reinstruction in response 
  to a question from the jury concerning the interplay between s. 34(2) of the 
  <i>Code</i> and s. 37 of the <i>Code</i>, the trial judge directed the jury 
  as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Now, the thrust of your question, 
      as I understand it which I repeat here:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>“Does Section 34 override 
        the excessive force factor contained in Section 37?”</span></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>“Override” I do not believe 
      is the appropriate word to use here in this context. Overlay is perhaps 
      a better word to describe the relation of S. 37 to S. 34(2) but I will read 
      to you what I indicated and instructed you as to the effect of S. 37 on 
      S. 34(2). You will note that S. 34(2) allows a person to defend himself 
      or herself from the assault of another person by repelling the attacker 
      with such force as could cause death or grievous bodily harm to the attacker 
      providing the person being attacked is under a reasonable apprehension of 
      death or grievous bodily harm. On the other hand, S. 37 merely says that 
      a person being attacked can only justify the use of such force against the 
      attacker as is necessary to prevent the assault of the attacker or a repetition 
      of it.</span></p>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
      S. 34(2) applies on the facts of this case as you find them, then that section 
      and not the provisions of S. 37 must govern your assessment of the use of 
      the force that the accused could use in defending herself against the attack 
      of Neela Mattai. In other words, if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable 
      doubt that the accused reasonably believed that she was facing death or 
      grievous bodily harm at the hands of Neela Mattai then the accused was entitled 
      to use like force against Neela Mattai if she believed on reasonable grounds 
      she could not otherwise protect herself from death or grievous bodily harm.</span></i></p>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
      the accused struck back at Neela Mattai in the circumstances described in 
      S. 34 and used force against Neela Mattai which could have caused death 
      or grievous bodily harm to Neela Mattai, then there is not room for questioning 
      the proportionality or degree of force used by the accused.</span></i></p>
    <p>That question, that is questioning the degree of force or the proportionality 
      is within the ambit of S. 37 as I have read it.  [Emphasis added]</p>

  The Crown concedes, correctly in our view, that this instruction was erroneous. 
  In particular, it was wrong for the trial judge to tell the jury that the appellant 
  could only derive the benefit of s. 34(2) if the jury was satisfied beyond a 
  reasonable doubt that the prerequisites of that provision had been met, failing 
  which s. 37 would govern. The jury of course should have been told that unless 
  the Crown satisfied them beyond a reasonable doubt that it was not applicable, 
  the appellant was entitled to the benefit of s.&nbsp;34(2) and that they need 
  only consider s. 37 if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that s. 34(2) did  
  not apply.</p>

  our view, this error was serious not only because it reversed the burden of 
  proof, but also because the appellant’s case for self-defence rested primarily 
  on s. 34(2),  not s. 37. The impugned instruction turned the defence position 
  on its head and it may well have resulted in s. 37 becoming the focus of the 
  jury’s attention. The significance of the error is compounded by the fact that 
  the erroneous instruction was given in response to a question from the jury. 
  The Supreme Court of Canada has made it clear that in such circumstances, misdirection 
  will generally result in reversible error. (See for example <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> 
  (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 per Cory J. at p. 411. In our view, this case is 
  no exception.</p>

  foregoing errors in the charge were significant. Each was capable of occasioning 
  serious prejudice to the appellant and in our view, neither can be saved by

  respect to the alleged improprieties by Crown counsel [not Ms. Tse or Mr.&nbsp;Bulmer], 
  we agree that it was wrong for the Crown to focus on a line of attack by defence 
  counsel designed to implicate Vickram as the killer and then use this to portray 
  the appellant as a person without conscience, who would deliberately implicate 
  an innocent man in a murder he did not commit to save herself. We also agree 
  that it was wrong to place the appellant in the position of having to call the 
  police “liars” where her evidence differed from their evidence. We need not 
  decide whether standing alone, this ground of appeal would have necessitated 
  a new trial. Suffice it to say that, in our view, the first of the alleged improprieties 
  was serious and it was capable of  impacting on the overall fairness of the 
  trial.</p>

  next to the trial judge’s refusal to leave the jury with the “alternative suspect” 
  theory, we think that there was some evidence capable of supporting the defence 
  position that the deceased’s husband was responsible for his wife’s death. That 
  evidence however, was weak when compared with the substantial body of evidence 
  available to the Crown tending to prove the opposite. Bearing in mind that the 
  trial judge did not remove the “alternative suspect” theory from the jury’s 
  consideration, we think it unlikely that his refusal to put it specifically 
  to the jury resulted in any harm to the appellant.</span></p>

  finally to the ground of appeal relating to the appellant’s statements to the 
  police and particularly, whether the trial judge erred in finding that the statements 
  were voluntary and that the appellant was not detained within the meaning of 
  s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> until she confessed to the killing at 7.03 a.m., 
  we think that these issues are best left for the trial judge conducting the 
  new trial. That said, in the hope of assisting the new trial judge, we make 
  these observations.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>First, in his discussion 
  of the issue of detention based on psychological compulsion, the trial judge 
  stated:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
'>In <i>Therens</i> [<i>R. v. Therens</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 481] and in <i>Thomsen</i> 
      [<i>R. v. Thomsen</i> (1988), 40 C.C.C. (3d) 411], the Supreme Court has 
      clearly recognized a form of detention within the scope of s. 10 other than 
      physical constraint of the person, that is, when a police officer or other 
      state agent assumes control over the person by a demand or direction. <i>The 
      control here envisaged, is a form of mind control which the police officer 
      in effect deprives the person of the will to assert his or her own views 
      and causes him or her to bend or submit to the will of the police officer 
      as the person perceives such will.</i> [Emphasis added]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='

'> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>22.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>We 
  think that in framing the test that way, the trial judge set the bar too high. 
  In<i> Thomsen, supra</i>, at p. 418, LeDain J. stated that “the necessary element 
  of compulsion or coercion to constitute a detention may arise . . . from a reasonable 
  belief that one does not have a choice as to whether or not to comply”. With 
  respect, rather than attempting to recast the test in his own words, the trial 
  judge should simply have applied the test outlined by LeDain J. in <i>Thomsen</i>, 
  <i>supra.</i></span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='

'> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>23.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Turning 
  to the trial judge’s analysis of the seven factors in <i>R. v. Moran</i> (1987), 
  36 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at pp. 258 and 259 that relate to the issue of detention, 
  with respect to item 5, we disagree with the trial judge’s finding that “there 
  was no information [available] to the police prior to her [the appellant’s] 
  admission at 7.03 a.m. that would constitute reasonable and probable grounds 
  to suspect that she had committed the homicide”. Certainly, by the time the 
  final statement began at around 5:55 a.m., we think there was evidence capable 
  of supporting a finding that the police did have reasonable grounds to suspect, 
  if not believe, that the appellant had committed the crime or been directly 
  involved in it.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>24.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span> 
  <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect to the sixth of the 
  <i>Moran</i> factors, we think, particularly in relation to the last statement 
  taken between 5:55 a.m. and 7:03 a.m., that the trial judge failed to adequately 
  consider the pointed and accusatory nature of the questions being asked, the 
  length of time the appellant had been present at the police station, her individual 
  characteristics, including lack of food and sleep, and the determined, persistent 
  and unrelenting fashion in which Constable Skwarek pursued his admitted goal. 
  </span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='
text-align:left;
'> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>25.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Had 
  the trial judge applied the correct test for psychological compulsion and considered 
  factors five and six in the manner suggested, we think he might well have come 
  to a different conclusion on the issue of detention and perhaps even voluntariness, 
  particularly in relation to the final statement made by the appellant commencing 
  at 5:55&nbsp;a.m. and ending with her confession at 7:03 a.m. In the end however, 
  as indicated, we think it best to leave the question of admissibility to the 
  judge presiding at the new trial.</span></p>
