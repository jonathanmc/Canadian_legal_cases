<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Terrance P. O’Connor dated March 28, 
  2000 made at Brampton, Ontario</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The  appellant sued the respondent for specific performance of 
  an agreement of purchase and sale of a home to be built. During the trial he 
  abandoned his claim for specific performance and amended his claim to one of 
  damages for breach. The respondent counterclaimed in respect of damages suffered 
  as a result of the registration of a certificate of pending litigation. The 
  trial judge dismissed both the action and the counterclaim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant and the respondent entered into 
  two contracts for the purchase and sale of a custom home to be built on a particular 
  lot with a view of the Credit River. The first contract was frustrated by conservation 
  authority regulations which did not permit a walk-out at the rear of the home. 
  The parties agreed to release each other from that contract and entered into 
  a new agreement dated July 28, 1997. The agreement provided for a home to be 
  built on the same lot for an agreed price of $329,000. The transaction was to 
  close on March 28, 1998.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge found that the plans for the 
  second house were based on sketches prepared by the appellant, which contained 
  some features which did not comply with the Building Code or other requirements 
  of the municipality. The plans were drafted by an architectural firm retained 
  by the respondent contractor. The trial judge accepted that the respondent instructed 
  the architectural firm to prepare the plans in accordance with the appellant’s 
  wishes in order to try to accommodate him, even though they would not be approved. 
  In particular, the offending features were an extra kitchen in the basement, 
  the house footprint exceeded the lot coverage limits, the building violated 
  set-back allowances and the windows on several facings were too large.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Although most of these difficulties were resolvable 
  with some reworking of the plans or by obtaining Committee of Adjustments minor 
  variance approval, the trial judge concluded that the set-back problem would 
  have been difficult to correct or overcome.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The respondent made the application for the building permit 
  on February 2, 1998. The City responded on March 6, 1998 listing items that 
  had to be satisfied in order to obtain the building permit. The parties met, 
  and the respondent made three proposals to the appellant: 1) release from the 
  contract and return of deposit; 2) purchase the lot at the respondent’s cost 
  of $110,000 for the appellant to build his own house; 3) build a house with 
  a walk-out feature but on a less attractive lot. The appellant rejected all 
  three proposals, taking the position that the type of house he wanted could 
  be designed for the lot he wanted. With the agreement of the respondent, he 
  retained his own architect, had new plans drawn, and received a building permit 
  for them. Unfortunately, this house was considerably larger than the second 
  house and with extra features, and was going to cost approximately $110,000 
  more for the respondent to construct. The respondent took the position that 
  the contract was at an end and returned the deposit of $20,000, which the appellant 
  did not accept, as he was seeking specific performance of the agreement.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The trial judge relied on three legal bases for denying the 
  appellant’s claim:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-GB>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The contract provides that the plans and 
      specifications of the dwelling may be subject to approval by the developer 
      or the municipality and were not approved by either. </span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-GB>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The contract gives the vendor the right 
      to approve final design drawings in accordance with the agreement and this 
      was never done. He reached this conclusion on the basis that the architectural 
      firm retained by the respondent was not in its employ and therefore the 
      fact that the firm drew the plans does not constitute approval.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-GB>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The contract provides that the agreement 
      is subject to a building permit being issued. The respondent never received 
      the permit and before it could negotiate a resolution of outstanding issues 
      with the City, the appellant retained his own architect to draw new plans. 
      The vendor was entitled to terminate the contract if the approval of the 
      municipality for the sittings and plans was not obtained. The respondent 
      was entitled to take advantage of this clause, which it did.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB>Analysis</span></u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>The appellant focused on the third basis which he had to 
  overcome in order to succeed on the appeal, as it depends on the lack of approval 
  by a third party. The appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing 
  to deal with the evidence that the appellant was prepared to go to the Committee 
  of Adjustments to obtain a minor variance for the non-conforming plans submitted 
  for the second home, but the respondent, who owned the land and therefore had 
  to make the application, refused to proceed with it.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant relies on the law articulated in <i>Mason v.Freedman, 
  </i>[1958] S.C.R. 438,  that where one party to a contract controls compliance 
  with a condition, that party must take all reasonable steps to ensure that the 
  condition is complied with, and cannot sit back, take no steps, then rely on 
  non-compliance to terminate the agreement. The appellant points to the fact 
  that the trial judge made no finding in respect of the appellant’s evidence 
  that the respondent refused to co-operate with the application for a variance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>In our view, the trial judge did not fail to address this 
  issue. He made a finding that: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-GB>Before it [the respondent] could satisfy or negotiate a resolution 
      of the outstanding items in the City’s letter of March 6, 1998, Mr. Baron 
      retained his own architect and proceeded independently of Pal-Bac to have 
      his own plans drawn and submitted to the City. (para. 17) </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This finding negates the suggestion that the respondent had the opportunity 
  to take steps to satisfy the building permit condition. The trial judge also 
  made the finding that the set back and coverage problems would have been “difficult 
  to correct or overcome.” (para.&nbsp;7.)  We are satisfied that the trial judge 
  therefore considered any failure of the respondent to co&#8209;operate with 
  a variance application as having no practical effect.  Read as a whole, the 
  reasons of the trial judge reflect his view that because it was the appellant 
  who was insisting on the non-conforming features of the plans, the appellant 
  must accept the consequences of his position. We cannot conclude that the trial 
  judge made a palpable or overriding error which would warrant the intervention 
  of this court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>However, we do agree that because the agreement 
  was terminated by the vendor and the deposit returned in accordance with the 
  agreement, the appellant is entitled to retain the deposit. As indicated, he 
  did not initially cash the cheque because he was insisting on specific performance 
  of the agreement. Now that that issue has been determined against him, it follows 
  that he is entitled to return of the deposit.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><u><span lang=EN-GB>Result</span></u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appeal on the issue of damages for breach 
  of contract is dismissed. The appeal with respect to return of the deposit is 
  allowed. Judgment will therefore go to the appellant in the amount of $20,000 
  together with pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The disposition of the trial judge with respect 
  to costs is confirmed. As success was divided on the appeal, there shall be 
  no costs of the appeal.</span></p>
