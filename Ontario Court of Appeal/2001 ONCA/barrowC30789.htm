<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from her conviction by Justice Gladys I. Pardu, 
  sitting without a jury, on June 5, 1998 [1998] O.J. No. 2449 (Gen. Div.) and 
  from the sentence imposed on October 26, 1998</span></b></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant ran an escort agency in the City of Sault Ste. 
  Marie.  In 1996, the police began an investigation into her business practices.  
  That investigation showed that the appellant arranged “dates” between male clients 
  who called the agency and female escorts who were employed by the agency.  For 
  her services, the appellant kept one-third of a fee that ranged between $150 
  and $180.  The escorts would on occasion engage in sexual activity with the 
  clients.  The appellant was aware of this and counseled the escorts as to how 
  to deal with such requests and precautions to take.  The evidence tended to 
  show that the appellant did not coerce the escorts and that she was supportive 
  of them. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As a result of the police investigation, the appellant was charged 
  with a number of prostitution-related offences.  These charges were based upon 
  the evidence of two female undercover officers, who posed as potential employees, 
  and the evidence of four of the appellant’s escorts.  Following a trial before 
  Pardu J. the appellant was convicted of attempting to procure women to become 
  prostitutes (2 counts); attempting to procure illicit sexual intercourse (2 
  counts); living on the avails of prostitution (3 counts); and breach of probation 
  (1 count).  Pardu J. sentenced the appellant to a total sentence of twelve months’ 
  imprisonment.  The appellant appeals against the convictions and the sentence.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the appellant raises a number of issues in her conviction 
  appeal, the principal legal issue concerns the elements of the offence of living 
  on the avails of prostitution.  The appellant submits that this offence requires 
  proof of a parasitic relationship between the appellant and the escorts and 
  that there was no evidence of this element of the offence.  I have concluded 
  that the appellant’s conduct falls within the scope of the living-on-the-avails 
  offence as it applies to persons supplying services to a prostitute.  The required 
  element of parasitism was present in this case because she was in the business 
  of rendering services to prostitutes because they are prostitutes.  With respect 
  to the charges of attempting to procure, which were based upon the conversations 
  between the undercover officers and the appellant, I have concluded that they 
  were made out in Constable Urajnik’s case but they  were not made out in Sergeant 
  Rollin’s case. I have also concluded that the breach of probation conviction 
  must be set aside because the Crown failed to prove that the probation order 
  was in effect at the time of any alleged criminal activity by the appellant.  
  Finally, I would allow the sentence appeal and substitute a fine.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge gave extensive reasons for judgment and made 
  numerous findings of fact.  I did not understand the appellant or the respondent 
  to seriously quarrel with those factual findings.  Accordingly, I have drawn 
  this summary of the facts largely from the trial judge’s reasons for judgment.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>The background</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant operated an escort agency called “Elite Escort 
  Service”.  The appellant advertised the services of the agency in a local newspaper 
  and on her web site.  The trial judge found that it was clear from the sexually 
  suggestive nature of the web site, her business cards, and the advertisements 
  that provision of sexual services for money was the dominant purpose of meetings 
  between the appellant’s escorts and the clients.  The appellant received all 
  calls soliciting the services of an escort.  She would describe the various 
  escorts so that the potential client could express a preference.  The appellant 
  had acted as an escort for some of the callers and thus was aware of their preferences.  
  When a request for service was received, the appellant would page or telephone 
  the escort.  The appellant rarely called an escort to work unless that escort 
  had notified the appellant that she would be available to work at that time 
  or that she could be called if one of her regular customers wished for her companionship.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant made all of the financial arrangements with the 
  client.  He was directed to leave the fee, usually $150, by the telephone.  
  On arrival at the residence or motel room, the escort would telephone the appellant 
  and confirm that all was well and that the money was there.  After the “date” 
  the escort would arrange to meet with the appellant.  The escort would hand 
  over the appellant’s fee at that time.  The appellant received one-third of 
  the money received from the client.  The size of the fee or the appellant’s 
  share did not depend upon the services provided by the escort.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Living on the avails of prostitution</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These charges were based upon the evidence of four women who 
  worked for the appellant.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] 
  </span></a>  Their evidence was generally consistent.  They contacted the appellant 
  after seeing newspaper advertisements.  The witnesses testified that they were 
  not pressured by the appellant to be available for engagements nor to provide 
  sexual services.  However, they all understood that certain clients would expect 
  sexual “favours”.  Whether or not to provide such services was in the discretion 
  of the escort.   The trial judge found that while the appellant took pains to 
  tell the escorts that they were not obliged to participate in any sexual activity 
  that made them uncomfortable, “oral sex or conventional sexual intercourse was 
  the service most frequently delivered”.  The escorts were responsible for arranging 
  contraception, supplying condoms, and looking after their own health care needs.  
  The appellant provided advice to escorts about various matters such as anal 
  sex, bondage, how to handle the dirty or smelly client, the clothes to wear, 
  the number of services to be offered and the expected duration of the encounter.  
  Technically, the escorts were free to spend the hour chatting with the client.  
  It was, however, most unlikely that a client would request that woman’s company 
  a second time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> S. had worked as an escort on prior occasions and was aware that 
  sex for money was involved.  She preferred to work for an agency because the 
  agency took care of the headaches of negotiating fees and arranging meetings.  
  The appellant provided S. with business cards and advised her to bring a condom 
  and to invent a false name.  Over a period of about six months, S. went on five 
  or six dates.  She provided sexual services on three occasions.  On the other 
  occasions, she had dinner with the client, talked to him and on one occasion 
  simply watched television with him.  S. was 20 years old when she began to work 
  for the appellant.  She stopped working when her student loan arrived.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> W. had also worked for another escort agency.  She asked the 
  appellant if she had to “sleep” with any of the clients and the appellant said 
  no, that it was her choice, “but that’s what they expected”.  She had three 
  dates over a two-month period and all three involved sexual contact.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> L. contacted the appellant because she was in financial difficulty.  
  She understood that some sexual contact would be involved but that she was free 
  to reject any sexual activity.  She asked if she should bring condoms and the 
  appellant told her that she should.  Over a two-month period she went on fifteen 
  dates and one-third involved sexual activity.  She came to view the appellant 
  as a friend.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> B. testified that “we were an escort to whoever and we did what 
  we wanted.  We held the cards”.  She had thirty encounters and about three-quarters 
  involved sexual activity.  B.’s testimony was adduced as similar fact evidence.  
  No count specifically referred to the appellant’s relationship with her.</p>

  </span></span> Constable Urajnik responded to the appellant’s advertisement.  
  She pretended to be a student in need of extra funds.  She told the appellant 
  that she had never worked as an escort or a prostitute.  At the first meeting, 
  the appellant explained the fee and her share.  The appellant also explained 
  the system for calling in when she was available and for arranging meetings.  
  The officer raised issues of contraception and sexually transmitted disease 
  and the appellant said that these were the officer’s responsibility.  The appellant 
  provided advice on how to approach distasteful clients and secure her safety.  
  The appellant mentioned several times that the escort was free to decide whether 
  sexual activity would occur on a “date”, and that it was possible that she would 
  not have sex at all.  At the end of the meeting the appellant asked the officer 
  to call her if she was interested in working. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ten days later, the officer called the appellant.  The officer 
  recorded this conversation.  The appellant repeated that she does not like calling 
  the escorts if they have not called her, unless the escort has indicated to 
  call her when a regular client calls.  Even then, the escort can say that she 
  does not want to go.  The appellant and the officer discussed a first date and 
  sex with clients.  The appellant said that she would set the officer up with 
  one of her regulars who would understand if she didn’t want to stay.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant set up an appointment for the officer with one 
  of her regular customers.  The officer pretended to balk because of nervousness 
  and said she might not want to go. The appellant urged the officer to attend 
  and to bring condoms, but repeated that she only had to talk to the client.  
  The appellant became upset with her and said that, “you have to show up … even 
  if it doesn’t work out.  Just sit and talk.”  The appellant repeated that and 
  added that she would start to lose clients.  She told the officer to have an 
  open mind and “you’re gonna stay and if you find that it’s not what you want 
  then leave.  But if you sit and talk, like, take the money”.  The officer finally 
  arrived but by then the client had left the motel.  This upset the appellant.  
  However, later that day the officer and the appellant had a final conversation.  
  The appellant spoke at length about the need to be comfortable and certain about 
  working as an escort.  She was no longer angry with the officer and there was 
  no suggestion that the officer had to compensate the appellant for the lost 
  client.  The appellant urged the officer to take time to consider her choices 
  because she did not want her to feel pressured.  The appellant said that she 
  did not want it on her conscience that she pressured her into anything.  She 
  said, “all you’re doing is agreeing to spend an hour of your time with them.  
  You don’t have to do anything.”</p>

  </span></span> Sergeant Monique Rollin made a similar approach to the appellant.  
  She told the appellant that she had never worked as an escort or a prostitute.  
  Her conversations with the appellant were similar to those with Constable Urajnik.  
  The appellant told the officer that she could earn a lot of money.  The appellant 
  also told her that having sex with the clients was part of the job but that 
  providing sex would be the officer’s choice.  The appellant said that “technically” 
  the clients were not expecting anything but that “realistically” they won’t 
  call back.  The appellant told the officer that she was never obliged to work 
  or engage in any activity not acceptable to her.  The officer said she would 
  think it over and might call back.  </p>

  </span></span> The appellant was convicted of various fraud-related offences 
  on March 12, 1993.  As part of her sentence, she was placed on probation.  On 
  January 19, 1994, the appellant was “re-sentenced” to a custodial term of three 
  months, a term of probation and a compensation order.  It was unclear whether 
  the re-sentencing involved the probation order.  The order itself stated that 
  it shall run “for a period of three years from August 4, 1993”.  The allegation 
  of breach of probation was based on a breach of the condition to keep the peace 
  and be of good behaviour by committing criminal offences.  On the appeal, Crown 
  counsel conceded that the three-year probation order ran from August 4, 1993 
  and that therefore the Crown had to prove that the appellant committed a criminal 
  offence prior to August 4, 1996.  The only witness to testify about alleged 
  illegal activity during this period was S.  She testified that the appellant 
  outlined the structure of her business, including that she bring condoms to 
  her “dates” during this period.  There was no evidence that the appellant received 
  any money from S. prior to August 4, 1996.</p>

  </span></span> Section 212(1)(j) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides that everyone 
  commits an offence who “lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution 
  of another person”.  The appellant concedes that each of the escorts named in 
  the counts of the indictment were prostitutes making money from prostitution 
  and that they gave money from their prostitution to the appellant.  Looking 
  only at the words of s. 212(1)(j), it would seem that the offence was made out 
  in relation to the three escorts named in the indictment.  The appellant submits, 
  however, based principally on the decision of this court in <i>R. v. Grilo</i> 
  (1991), 64 C.C.C. (3d) 53, that the offence requires proof that the appellant 
  received the earnings because she had a parasitic relationship with the prostitute.  
  The appellant submits that the Crown failed to prove this element.  The trial 
  judge reviewed <i>Grilo</i> and many of the other leading cases but concluded 
  that the charge of living on the avails was made out.  She adopted the reasoning 
  of Gerein J. in <i>R. v. Friesen</i> (1995), 39 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 46 (Sask. 
  Q.B.) at 57:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>On the other hand, if two or more people embark upon a joint venture which 
      has as its goal the earning of money through the prostitution of one of 
      them, it follows that all who share in the earnings are living off the prostitution.  
      The fact that each makes a contribution to the success of the venture does 
      not change its essential nature which is to enrich oneself through the prostitution 
      of a person.  Whether one cloaks the endeavour in terminology of contract 
      or business does not change the underlying reality.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The evidence clearly established that Donna Barrow entered into a cooperative 
      arrangement with each of S., L., and W. with a view to producing income 
      from prostitution, and that Donna Barrow took one-third of the revenue generated 
      from prostitution.  This is sufficient to establish the offence.</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Grilo</i>, this court adopted the interpretation by Lord 
  Reid in <i>Shaw v. Director of Public Prosecutions</i>, [1961] 2 All E.R. 446 
  (H.L.) of the comparable provision in the <i>Sexual Offences Act, 1956, </i>4 
  &amp; 5 Eliz. 2 c. 69.  Lord Reid introduced the concept of a requirement of 
  a parasitic relationship as the way to keep the reach of the offence within 
  reasonable limits.  He described the cases to which the section was clearly 
  directed at p. 453:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>It is well known that there were, and are, men who live parasitically 
      on prostitutes and their earnings.</span></u><span>  </span>They may be 
      welcome and merely cohabit, or they may bully women into earning money in 
      this way.  They prey or batten on the women.  <u>Such men are clearly living 
      on the earnings of prostitution</u>; if they have or earn some other income, 
      then they are living in part on such earnings.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Shaw was charged because he published the “Ladies Directory” 
  containing the names, addresses and telephone numbers of prostitutes with nude 
  photographs and other information about the services the prostitutes were willing 
  to perform.  Shaw had conceived of this service when the <i>Sexual Offences 
  Act</i>, <i>1956</i> came into effect so that it was no longer possible for 
  prostitutes to solicit in the streets and the prostitutes needed an alternative 
  way to advertise.  Lord Reid had no doubt that this conduct also fell well within 
  the terms of the offence, as he said at pp. 453-54:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>Such men may render services as protectors or as touts, but that cannot 
      make any difference, even if their relationship were dressed up as a contract 
      of service</span></u>; and a man could not escape because he acted in some 
      such capacity for a number of women.  <u>His occupation would still be parasitic; 
      it would not exist if the women were not prostitutes.</u>  It appears to 
      me that the accused in this case comes well within this class.  <u>His occupation 
      of gathering and publishing these advertisements would not exist if his 
      customers were not prostitutes.</u>  He was really no more than a tout using 
      this means of bringing men to the prostitutes from whom he received money.

  </span></span> Lord Reid then considered a third case, people who provide services 
  to prostitutes as they would to anyone else.  As in the other two cases, they 
  would be found to have committed the offence only if they lived parasitically.  
  He described the nature of the relationship that the prosecution would have 
  to prove in such cases at p. 454:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;Living on&quot; normally, I think, connotes living parasitically</span></u>. 
      It could have a wider meaning but, if it is to be applied at all to those 
      who are in no sense parasites, then <u>I think its meaning must be the same, 
      whether we are considering the earnings of prostitution or of any other 
      occupation or trade.</u>  If a merchant sells goods to tradesmen, is he 
      living on the earnings of their trades? or if a landlord lets premises for 
      business purposes, is he living on the earnings of those businesses? or 
      if he lets to a man of leisure, is he living on that man's dividends? Those 
      are the sources of the rent which he receives, but I do not think that one 
      would normally say that he is living on those sources. It is not an impossible 
      use of the words -- only unusual. And a penal statute ought not to be widened 
      by reading its words in an unusual sense unless there is very good reason 
      for doing so.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span

      as the accused, and there might be a tradesman who used his trade as a means

      leaving such possible cases aside, I could not hold that a tradesman who 
      supplies goods or services to a prostitute in the ordinary course of his 
      business is living on her immoral earnings.  I cannot find or think of any 
      case which cannot be adequately dealt with on what I think to be the ordinary

  </span></span> The acts of the appellant fall within the scope of the living

  in that it would not exist if the escorts were not prostitutes.  The fact that 
  on some occasions the escorts did not provide sexual services simply means that 
  the appellant did not live wholly on the avails of prostitution.  Put another

  (1977), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 540 (B.C.C.A.) concerned the liability of the owners 
  of a nightclub frequented by prostitutes.  The court referred with approval 
  to <i>Shaw</i> and in particular to the test set out by Viscount Simonds at 
  p. 450:  “a person may fairly be said to be living in whole or in part on the 
  earnings of prostitution if he is paid by prostitutes for goods or services 
  supplied by him to them for the purpose of their prostitution which he would 
  not supply but for the fact that they were prostitutes”.  Speaking for the court 
  in <i>Celebrity Enterprises</i> at p. 557, Robertson J.A. pointed out that there 
  was nothing that the nightclub supplied to the prostitutes, such as seats at 
  tables or food and drinks, that it would not have supplied to any other patron.  
  He went on to point out that “the management took no cut whatever from the earnings 
  of any woman from prostituting herself with a man she met on the premises”.  
  The court in <i>Celebrity Enterprises</i> allowed the conviction appeals and 
  entered acquittals.</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US>Grilo</span></i> did not directly concern 
  either a pimp or a person supplying services to prostitutes like <i>Shaw, Celebrity 
  Enterprises</i> or this case.  Grilo was living with a prostitute, Tracy Pinette.  
  The trial judge described Grilo’s role in these terms, as quoted by Arbour J.A. 
  at p. 55:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>There is no persuasive evidence to suggest that, throughout this period, 
      Pinette worked as a prostitute under the control, direction or influence 
      of the accused. <u>Rather, on the evidence presented to me, it is more likely 
      that the function of the accused was solely to act as Pinette's protector 
      and to hold her earnings safely for her until they next returned home, at 
      which time he would give the money back to Pinette</u>. </span></p>
    <p><span> </span>Apart from their working relationship which I have described 
      above, the accused and Pinette were likely romantically involved with each 
      other. At the time of the accused's arrest, he and Pinette lived together 
      in an apartment rented by him. </p>
    <p><span> </span>Following his arrest, the accused made the following admissions 
      in a statement given by him to the police: </p>
    <p><span> </span>1.            He occasionally buys a submarine sandwich or 
      a cup of coffee for his own use out of Pinette's prostitution-related earnings; 
    </p>
    <p><span> </span>2.            Pinette helps him to pay the rent for their 
      apartment;</p>
    <p><span> </span>3.            Pinette buys food for herself and for the accused.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>...it is a likely inference to be drawn from all of the evidence that 
      the accused benefited from the proceeds of Pinette's prostitution solely 
      by virtue of his status as her live-in mate and that there was no element 
      of exploitation or parasitism on his part. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In considering this fact situation, Arbour J.A. made it clear, 
  in my view, that she was concerned only with the situation of a person living 
  with a prostitute as opposed to someone supplying services to a prostitute.  
  Thus she introduced her discussion of the question as follows at p. 60:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>Neither <i>Shaw</i> nor <i>Celebrity Enterprises</i> considered directly 
      the situation at bar. Both were concerned with the criminal responsibility, 
      if any, of persons who supply services to prostitutes.</span></u> Neither 
      of these cases addressed directly the separate issue of the extent to which 
      a person may derive benefits from living with a prostitute before that person 
      can be said to be living on the avails of prostitution.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Arbour&nbsp;J.A. therefore must have concluded that the accused 
  did not receive any of Pinette’s earnings for the “protector” services he provided.  
  Arbour J.A. held, at p. 60, that in the case of a person living with a prostitute 
  the <i>Shaw </i>test, whether as enunciated by Viscount Simonds or Lord Reid, 
  had to be modified:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>To pursue the rhetorical questions raised by Lord Reid in <i>Shaw</i> 
      one would ask here: if a man shares expenses with his spouse or room-mate, 
      is he living on the avails of her income? As well, to the list of persons 
      contemplated by Viscount Simonds who may engage in legitimate activities 
      with prostitutes even though money may change hands, such as the grocer, 
      doctor or lawyer, one must add the spouse or room-mate.</span></p>
    <p>Of course, neither the grocer, the doctor nor the spouse is exempt from 
      conviction merely because his or her activity or status is otherwise legitimate. 
      In the case of a person living with a prostitute, one must turn to indicia 
      which will serve to distinguish between legitimate living arrangements between 
      room-mates or spouses, and living on the avails of prostitution. <u>When 
      a person receives money directly or indirectly from a prostitute in exchange 
      for services rendered, the test, according to <i>Shaw</i>, is whether the 
      service is rendered to the prostitute because she is a prostitute or, alternatively, 
      whether the same service would be rendered to anybody else. In the case 
      of living arrangements the test obviously must be modified. In my view, 
      the proper question is whether the accused and the prostitute had entered 
      into a normal and legitimate living arrangement which included a sharing 
      of expenses for their mutual benefit or whether, instead, the accused was 
      living parasitically on the earnings of the prostitute for his own advantage.</u> 
      The occasional buying of a doughnut or a cup of coffee would hardly amount 
      to feeding a parasite in the ordinary acceptance of that word.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Arbour J.A. went on to explain at p. 61 that where the accused 
  is living with a prostitute, the parasitic aspect of the relationship contains 
  “an element of exploitation which is essential to the concept of living on the 
  avails of prostitution”.  She distinguished the parasitic relationship from 
  the case where the prostitute supports a child or a disabled parent, someone 
  whom she is legally or morally obliged to support.  Arbour&nbsp;J.A. concluded 
  her analysis at p. 61 with this statement:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Living on the avails is directed at the idle parasite who reaps the 
      benefits of prostitution without any legal or moral claim to support from 
      the person who happens to be a prostitute.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that she should not be convicted of the 
  living on avails offence because her relationship with the escorts was supportive 
  rather than exploitive.  She provided services that allowed the women to remain 
  off the streets in relative safety.  No escort was forced to take a particular 
  job, nor perform any particular act, including sexual acts.  She provided advice 
  and, in some cases, friendship.  Be that as it may, it is my view that the appellant 
  was properly convicted.  Her conduct falls squarely within the <i>Shaw</i> test 
  that was approved in <i>Celebrity Enterprises</i> and <i>Grilo</i> as applied 
  to a person supplying services to a prostitute.  The test as modified by Arbour 
  J.A. in <i>Grilo</i> has no application to this case since the appellant was 
  supplying services to the escorts.  She was not merely living with them, nor 
  were the escorts in a relationship in which they were legally or morally obliged 
  to support the appellant.  The element of parasitism is found in the fact that 
  she is in the business of rendering services to the escorts because they are 
  prostitutes. To repeat an excerpt from the speech of Lord Reid in <i>Shaw</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>Such men may render services as protectors or as touts, but that cannot 
      make any difference, even if their relationship were dressed up as a contract

      such capacity for a number of women.  <u>His occupation would still be parasitic;

  </span></span> At the hearing, counsel for the appellant presented an interesting 
  policy argument.  He pointed out that while many aspects of prostitution have 
  been rendered illegal, the act of prostitution by an individual has not been 
  criminalized.  He argued that Parliament has implicitly recognized that there 
  will always be prostitution.  He argued that the appellant, and people like 
  her, supply a valuable service to prostitutes.  If women could not form these 
  kinds of business relationships they would be driven into the streets where 
  they would be much more vulnerable, isolated and subject to violence.  He suggested 
  that the escort agency relationship should not fall within the living on the 
  avails offence unless there was some element of coercion or control.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a>  Both counsel referred us to a number of articles concerning 
  the policy underlying Canada’s treatment of prostitution.  In my view, this 
  kind of policy discussion is beyond the scope of this appeal.  The appellant 
  did not challenge the constitutionality of the living-on-the-avails offence

  </span></span> The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that 
  these offences were made out, because it was made clear to the officers that 
  they were not required to engage in acts of prostitution or illicit sexual intercourse.  
  The appellant told the officers that it was their choice whether to become escorts 
  and whether to engage in sexual intercourse, and that the fee was the same whether 
  or not sexual acts were performed.  The appellant therefore submits that she 
  did not attempt to “procure” the officers to have illicit sexual intercourse 
  or to become prostitutes.</p>

  this court and the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Deutsch</i> (1983), 5 
  C.C.C. (3d) 41 (Ont. C.A.) affirmed (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.).  Le

      or to induce, or to have a persuasive effect upon the conduct that is alleged.&quot; 
      Martin J.A. expressed his agreement at p. 49 with the following statement 
      of the issue by the trial judge: &quot;The question for decision is did 
      Mr.&nbsp;Deutsch attempt to cause or attempt to induce or attempt to have 
      a persuasive effect upon the woman in question to have illicit sexual intercourse 
      with another person ...&quot;. I agree that the sources referred to by the

      &quot;procure&quot;.</span></p>

  </span></span> The charge of attempting to procure Constable Urajnik to have 
  illicit sexual intercourse related to the date at the motel, which was arranged 
  for her by the appellant.  Despite the care with which the appellant conducted 
  the interviews with the officers and her obvious intention not to pressure them 
  into having either illicit sexual intercourse or to become prostitutes, I am 
  satisfied that it was open to the trial judge to find that the element of procuring 
  was made out in relation to Constable Urajnik.  This was essentially a question 
  of fact.  There was some evidence of an attempt by the appellant to have a persuasive 
  effect upon the officer.  The appellant advised the officer, whom the appellant 
  had hired after the initial interview, to obtain condoms before going to the 
  motel room and told her that she had to go through with the appointment because 
  the appellant did not have another escort who could attend.  This was all in 
  the context of the earlier conversations where it was made clear that some of 
  the clients were expecting the escort to perform sexual acts for the $150 fee.  
  It was open to the trial judge, who had the advantage of hearing the officer 
  and listening to the tape recordings, to find that the conversations leading 
  up to the motel date were intended by the appellant to have the required persuasive 
  effect.  I would uphold the conviction for attempting to procure illicit sexual 
  intercourse in relation to Constable Urajnik.  I would conditionally stay the 
  charge of attempting to procure Constable Urajnik for the purpose of prostitution.</p>

  </span></span> I take a different view, however, of the encounter between the 
  appellant and Sergeant Rollin.  This never went beyond the first interview and 
  Rollin was not “hired” and no “date” was arranged.  Even taking into account 
  the trial judge’s advantage, my reading of the transcript of evidence and the 
  transcript of the tape recordings shows little more than the appellant acquainting 
  the officer with the business.  The officer presented herself as experienced 
  with men and of knowing what an escort agency involved.  The only element of 
  persuasion was the appellant’s references to the possibility of earning a lot 
  of money.  These statements were not tied to a requirement of illicit sexual 
  intercourse or prostitution.  The appellant simply told the officer that if 
  she worked a lot she could make a lot of money, but it was entirely up to the 
  officer. The appellant stressed that the officer should think about it and make 
  sure it was what she wanted to do.  There is one part of the taped transcript 
  that is of some concern where the appellant described for the officer what a 
  date might be like:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Appellant:            Like tonight I can tell you exactly what’s going 
      to happen, you’re going to get there and you’re not going to have any problem 
      … (unintelligible).</p>
    <p>Rollin:            (unintelligible)</p>
    <p>Appellant:            (unintelligible) … <u>oh God, you’re going to make 
      a fortune</u>.  Like I always tell the girls … (unintelligible).</p>
    <p>Rollin:            Oh, that’s too funny.</p>
    <p>Appellant:            He’s gonna tell you, oh, I don’t do this that often, 
      he does it three times a week.  Oh, you’re really pretty, you’re so beautiful, 
      like why are you doing this, give me your telephone number I want to call 
      you at home on your own.  </p>
    <p>Rollin:            Yeah right.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> As in <i>Deutsch,</i> the holding out of large financial rewards 
  in the course of the interview dependent upon the necessity of having sexual 
  intercourse is capable of constituting the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence.  
  However, so much of this part of the conversation is unintelligible that it 
  is impossible to determine whether this is what the appellant is referring to.  
  In her testimony, Sergeant Rollin was not asked about this part of the conversation.  
  In the end, I cannot be satisfied that the appellant attempted to procure Sergeant 
  Rollin within the meaning of s. 212 and I would set aside the convictions on 
  those counts.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>Breach of probation</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the conviction for breach of probation cannot stand.  
  As indicated, the probation order expired on August 4, 1996.  All of the offences 
  were alleged to have occurred after that date except for one count of living 
  on the avails in relation to S.  The only evidence is that S. had a date with 
  one client in July 1996.  At that time, she ate dinner with him and there was 
  no sexual activity.  The prosecution failed to prove that the appellant committed 
  any act that would constitute a breach of her probation order.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>The sentence appeal</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge imposed a sentence of ten months’ imprisonment 
  concurrent on all of the charges except for the breach of probation.  On that 
  charge, she imposed a sentence of two months consecutive.  At the time of sentencing, 
  the appellant was 42 years of age.  Her prior criminal record consisted of convictions 
  in 1993 for fraud, forgery and personation, theft under $5,000 and failing to 
  appear.  In imposing a custodial sentence, the trial judge particularly relied 
  upon this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Bowlby</i>, [1987] O.J. No. 1191 and 
  the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Foster</i> (1984), 13 
  C.C.C. (3d) 435.  In <i>Bowlby</i>, this court held that “save in exceptional 
  cases” a custodial sentence is necessary for the offence of living on the avails 
  of prostitution and particularly where “the sexual services have been rendered 
  as part of a commercial enterprise well organized and publicly advertised”.  
  The court therefore allowed a Crown appeal and imposed a custodial sentence, 
  but of only six months bearing in mind that the accused was a first offender, 
  that no threats or coercion were used and that the women were of a mature age.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Foster</i>, the Alberta Court of Appeal adopted the range 
  of sentence for the living on the earnings of prostitution offence in England 
  as described by D.A. Thomas in <i>Principles of Sentencing</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  ed. (1979).  Thomas describes three categories of cases, the third being as 
  follows, as quoted at p. 441 of <i>Foster</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Sentences in the lowest bracket, between twelve and eighteen months' 
      imprisonment, are likely to be found where the offender receives money from 
      the woman concerned but the relationship cannot be characterized as one 
      of exploitation.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge in the case at bar rejected a conditional sentence 
  because she did not think that the appellant would be deterred from future criminal 
  activity by such a sentence especially in view of her record, that she was on 
  probation at the time of the offences and the substantial financial gain.  The 
  trial judge found that the appellant’s business generated over $167,000 in gross 
  revenue during the seventeen months of its operation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There are a number of reasons why, in my view, the sentence imposed 
  by the trial judge must be reviewed.  First, I have set aside two of the convictions, 
  including the conviction for breach of probation.  Thus, an important aggravating 
  factor no longer exists.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, I agree with counsel for the appellant that the trial 
  judge erred in taking into account the gross revenue generated by the appellant’s 
  operation.  The appellant was charged in the indictment in relation to offences 
  over a three-month period.  During that period, the Crown proved that the appellant 
  obtained about $2,500 from the three women named in the living on the avails 
  counts.  In effect, the trial judge punished the appellant for offences for 
  which she had never been charged, or convicted.  See <i>R. v. Fogarty</i>, [1974] 
  O.J. No. 785 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Third, the trial judge placed undue emphasis on the decision 
  of this court in <i>Bowlby</i> and the decision of the Alberta Court of Appeal 
  in <i>Foster</i>, in view of the circumstances of this case.  First, it is apparent 
  from the tape-recorded conversations with the undercover officers that the appellant 
  believed that she was acting legally.  This explains why she was operating openly 
  and advertising in local newspapers.  Her mistake of law is a relevant mitigating 
  factor.  Second, not only was there no coercion by the appellant but, in fact, 
  she offered support and advice to the escorts.  She placed no pressure on the 
  escorts and left it entirely to them whether and when they wished to take on 
  jobs.  Finally, <i>Bowlby</i> and <i>Foster</i> were decided before the conditional 
  sentence regime came into force.  This court’s statement that save in exceptional 
  circumstances a custodial sentence must be imposed for this offence must be 
  read in that light.  In my view, a conditional sentence can be an appropriate 
  disposition in cases such as this.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant has now been on bail pending appeal for approximately 
  two and one-half years, apparently without incident.  She served about five 
  days in jail before being given bail.  At trial, Crown counsel’s primary submission 
  was that the accused be sentenced to a term of imprisonment or a substantial 
  fine.  I do not think that any purpose would now be served by a custodial sentence, 
  either as immediate imprisonment or as a conditional sentence.  In my view, 
  a substantial fine would be an appropriate disposition at this point.</p>

  </span></span> Accordingly, I would allow the appeal from conviction in part 
  as follows.  I would set aside the convictions on counts 2 and 4, relating to 
  Sergeant Rollin, and enter acquittals.  I would set aside the conviction on 
  count 3, relating to Constable Urajnik, and enter a conditional stay of that 
  count.  I would set aside the conviction on count 9, breach of probation, and 
  enter an acquittal on that count.  I would otherwise dismiss the appeal from 
  conviction.  I would grant leave to appeal sentence, set aside the sentence 
  of imprisonment and substitute a fine of $2,000 on each of counts 1, 5, 6, 7 
  and 8 for a total fine of $10,000.  There will also be a victim fine surcharge 
  of $1,500.  The appellant will have sixty days to pay the fine and the victim 
  fine surcharge.</p>
