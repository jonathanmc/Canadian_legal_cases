<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John R. Jennings dated January 12, 1999.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>DOHERTY J.A.:</p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>I</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> What began as a dispute in a Florida court over an $8,000 (U.S.) land 
  transaction has now come to this court as an appeal from the dismissal of an 
  action to enforce a Florida judgment worth some $800,000 (Can.).<span>  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants (the “Beals”) sued the respondents (the “Saldanhas” and 
  “Thivys”) seeking to enforce a judgment obtained in Florida (the “Florida judgment”).<span>  
  </span>The Beals, along with Mr. William Foody and his wife, Barbara, were plaintiffs 
  in the Florida action.<span>  </span>They alleged that they had been induced 
  by fraudulent misrepresentations made by the respondents and their Florida real 
  estate agent to purchase a lot in a Florida subdivision.<span>  </span>The respondents 
  owned the lot.<span>  </span>The Beals and Foodys obtained default judgment 
  and, after an assessment of damages by a jury in December 1991, were awarded 
  damages in the total amount of $260,000 (U.S.) plus post-judgment interest at 
  12% per year.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Foodys assigned their interest in the judgment to the Beals who 
  commenced this action in Ontario in 1993.<span>  </span>By the time the action 
  reached trial in 1998, the Florida judgment was worth approximately $800,000 
  (Can.).<span>  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Saldanhas and Thivys defended the action in Ontario on several grounds, 
  including claims that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> the Florida court did not have jurisdiction;</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> they were denied natural justice in the Florida proceedings;</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> the enforcement of the Florida judgment in Ontario was contrary 
      to public policy;<span>  </span>and</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> the Florida judgment was obtained by fraud in the Florida 
      court.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondent, Rose Thivy, also contended that she had made an assignment 
  in bankruptcy in 1994 after the Ontario action had been commenced and that she 
  had subsequently been granted an absolute discharge.<span>  </span>She alleged 
  that the discharge relieved her of any liability she may have had to the Beals.<span>  
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Saldanhas made a third party claim against their Ontario solicitor, 
  William Kelly.<span>  </span>They claimed full contribution and indemnity for 
  any amount owing on the Florida judgment and for the costs associated with the 
  Ontario action.<span>  </span>The Saldanhas alleged that they had not challenged 
  the Florida judgment in Florida after it was made because Mr. Kelly told them 
  that the judgment was not enforceable in Ontario.<span>  </span>They contended 
  that the advice was wrong and that Mr. Kelly acted negligently and in breach 
  of his contract with them in giving that negligent advice.<span>  </span>The 
  Saldanhas took the position that had they contested the Florida judgment in 
  Florida, it would have been set aside.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge dismissed the main action, holding that the Florida 
  judgment had been obtained by fraud and that public policy precluded enforcement 
  of the Florida judgment in Ontario.<span>  </span>He went on to hold that had 
  he found in favour of the Beals on the main action, he would have held that 
  Mr. Kelly was negligent in the advice he gave to the Saldanhas and was required 
  to indemnify them for any amount they owed to the Beals.<span>  </span>However, 
  having concluded that the main action should fail, the trial judge dismissed 
  the third party claim.<span>  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Saldanhas and Thivys also cross-claimed against each other.<span>  
  </span>The trial judge did not reach the cross-claims given his findings on 
  the main action.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Beals appeal and seek judgment in the amount of the Florida judgment 
  against the Saldanhas and Thivys.<span>  </span></p>

line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Saldanhas appealed from the order dismissing the third party claim.<span>  
  </span>Obviously, this appeal would become relevant only if the Beals were successful 
  in their appeal in the main action.<span>  </span>During oral argument, the 
  court was advised that the Saldanhas’ appeal in the third party claim had been 
  settled and that the court need not address that appeal.<span>  </span></p>

  lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After discussion with the Saldanhas

  </span>He said that he had been sold the wrong lot and that he had intended 
  to purchase Lot #1.<span>  </span>After discussing the matter with Mr. Beals,

  </span> The outcome of the action turned on whether the respondents could establish 
  grounds on which the Ontario court should refuse to enforce the judgment of 
  the Florida court, despite the fact that the Florida court had jurisdiction 
  to entertain the action and render the judgment.  The respondents’ primary submission 
  was that the Beals had deliberately misled the Florida court in obtaining the 
  Florida judgment.  Much of the trial was occupied with submissions as to the 
  meaning of “fraud” in the context of an action to enforce a foreign judgment 
  and with attempts to distinguish allegations of fraud from efforts to retry 
  the merits of the Florida action in Ontario.  All parties agreed that the Ontario 
  court could not simply retry the merits of the Florida action.  </p>

  </span> After a review of the relevant authorities, the trial judge concluded 
  that he could not consider allegations of fraud as they related to the merits 
  of the factual allegations on which liability was based, but that he could consider 
  allegations of fraud as they related to the assessment of damages.  He held:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Accordingly I conclude that it is possible to apply the defence of fraud 
      to the facts of this case.  Liability of the defendants is accepted, because 
      of the domestic policy on default judgments.  However, on the question of 
      the assessment of damages, the plaintiff gave at the very least, misleading 
      evidence.  That evidence was not considered by the Florida court in the 
      context of fraud and so it is open to the Ontario Court to adjudicate upon 
      it.  Having considered it, I have found it to be fraudulent.  In my opinion, 
      the defence of fraud in the context that I have described, must succeed.  
      The Florida judgment will not be enforced by this Court.</p>

  </span> The trial judge then turned his attention to the “public policy” defence 
  to the enforcement of foreign judgments.  He observed that the defence had traditionally 
  been a very narrow one, reaching only situations in which the enforcement of 
  the foreign judgment would violate some fundamental principle of justice deeply 
  rooted in our legal tradition.  The trial judge noted that the mere fact that 
  the damages awarded by the foreign court were much larger than would have been 
  awarded in Ontario was no basis upon which to refuse to enforce the foreign 
  judgment.  He went on to opine that the broadened basis for the recognition 
  of foreign judgments adopted in <i>Morguard Investments Ltd. v. De Savoye</i> 
  (1990), 76 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 256 (S.C.C.), called for the development 
  of “some sort of judicial sniff test in considering foreign judgments.”  In 
  the trial judge’s view, the enforcement of some foreign judgments, even where 
  the fraud exception was not available, worked an injustice.  He concluded his 
  analysis of the public policy defence with these words:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>To give effect to this thinking, the parameters of the public policy defence 
      must be broadened to cover a situation where conduct which triggers neither 
      the traditional defence of public policy nor the defence of natural justice 
      is yet so egregious as to raise a negative impression sufficient to stay 
      the enforcing hand of the domestic court.</p>
    <p>I recognize the inherent danger of importing palm tree justice into an 
      arena properly designed to recognize the reality of global commercial transactions, 
      and accordingly I would expect the widened defence to be rarely available 
      and only in very limited circumstances.  I find however, that those circumstances 
      are present in this case.  If required to do so, I would have found enforcement 
      of the Florida judgment would contravene the public policy of Ontario and 
      accordingly I would have declined to enforce it.  </p>

  </span> I cannot agree with the trial judge’s analysis of either the fraud or 
  the public policy defences to the enforcement of foreign judgments.  Neither 
  defence had application on the facts of this case.  In addition, even if the 
  trial judge properly fixed the scope of the fraud defence, there was no evidence 
  to support his finding that the Florida judgment was obtained by fraud.  The 
  Beals were entitled to succeed in the main action.</p>

  (1988), 65 O.R. (2d) 551 at 563 (H.C.J.).  As the correctness of the decision

  </span> There is a potential tension between the admonition against retrying 
  the merits of a foreign action in a proceeding to enforce that judgment in Ontario 
  and the recognition that fraud in the obtaining of the foreign judgment is a 
  defence to its enforcement in Ontario.  The wider the scope of the fraud defence, 
  the more likely it is that the Ontario court will be drawn into a re-examination 
  of the merits of the claim adjudicated upon in the foreign court.  If a defendant 
  can resist enforcement of the foreign judgment by demonstrating that the foreign 
  court was misled on facts relevant to the merits of the claim, then the merits 
  of the claim must be examined by the court which is asked to enforce the foreign 
  judgment.  As I understand it, this is the English position:  <i>Abouloff v. 
  Oppenheimer</i> (1882), 10 Q.B.D. 295 at 300-301;  <i>Owens Bank Ltd. v. Bracco</i>,

  <i>Roglass Consultants Inc. v. Kennedy</i> (1984), 65 B.C.L.R. 393 at 396-7

  the fraud defence to an action to enforce foreign judgments in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The fraud relied on must be something collateral or extraneous, and not 
      merely the fraud which is imputed from alleged false statements made at 
      the trial, which were met by counter-statements by the other side, and the 
      whole adjudicated upon by the Court and so passed on into the limbo of estoppel 
      by the judgment.  <u>This estoppel cannot, in my opinion, be disturbed except 
      upon the allegation and proof of new and material facts, or newly discovered 
      and material facts which were not before the former Court and from which 
      are to be deduced the new proposition that the former judgment was obtained 
      by fraud.</u>  The burden on that issue is upon the defendant, and until 
      he at least gives <i>prima facie</i> evidence in support of it, the estoppel 
      stands. …  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> “New facts” refers to facts which have come into existence after the 
  foreign judgment was obtained.  “Newly discovered facts” refers to facts which 
  existed at the time the foreign judgment was obtained but were not known to 
  the defendant.  In my view, “newly discovered facts” must be limited to those 
  facts which could not have been discovered prior to the granting of the foreign 
  judgment through the exercise of reasonable diligence.  If reasonable diligence 
  is not required, defendants can choose to ignore the proceedings in the foreign 
  court, remain blissfully ignorant of all relevant facts, and then advance their 
  version of the facts under the guise of a fraud defence to the enforcement of 
  foreign judgments when the plaintiff attempts to enforce that judgment in Ontario.  
  Unless “newly discovered facts” means facts that the defendant could not have 
  discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence prior to the obtaining of 
  the foreign judgment, defendants who choose not to participate in the foreign 
  proceedings, unlike those who do participate, will be able to relitigate the 
  merits of the foreign proceedings in the action to enforce the foreign judgment.</p>

  </span> A due diligence requirement is consistent with the policy underlying 
  the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments.  In the modern global 
  village, decisions made by foreign courts acting within Canadian concepts of 
  jurisdiction and in accordance with fundamental principles of fairness should 
  be respected and enforced.  That policy does not, however, extend to protect 
  decisions which are based on fraud that could not, through the exercise of reasonable 
  diligence, have been brought to the attention of the foreign court.  Respect 
  for the foreign court does not diminish when a refusal to enforce its judgment 
  is based on material that could not, through the exercise of reasonable diligence, 
  have been placed before that court.  </p>

  of the fraud defence to the action for the enforcement of a judgment.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… So, the only facts that have been adjudicated on the damages assessment

  </span> The trial judge’s conclusion that the Florida proceedings were tainted 
  by fraud was based on the following five findings:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Any claim for lost profits did not belong to the Beals personally, 
      but to the company, which was owned by the Beals and Foodys.  It was that 
      company that was to engage in the construction business.  The company was 
      not a party to the Florida proceedings and had been dissolved before the 
      Florida trial and, therefore, could not recover damages.  </p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> Construction on the model home ceased before the Beals and 
      Foodys learned that they were building on the wrong lot and ceased because 
      Mr. Beals and Mr. Foody had a “falling out” when Mr. Foody decided to pursue 
      other employment.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The factual allegations in the complaint made out a case 
      for rescission of the contract, but were not sufficient to establish fraud.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> There could be no justifiable reliance on the representations 
      made by the respondents as to ownership of the lot since ownership of the 
      lot was a matter of readily accessible public record.</p>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> The original offer submitted by the Beals and Foodys to the 
      respondents through Mr. O’Neil and attached to the amended complaint was 
      not the “amended offer” accepted by the respondents and returned to Mr. 
      O’Neil.</p>

  </span> Assuming for the moment that there was an evidentiary basis for these 
  findings, they could only be advanced by the respondents in support of their 
  fraud claim if they could not have been known to the defendants by the exercise 
  of reasonable diligence.  There can be no doubt that all of these facts would 
  have been easily ascertainable by the respondents had they chosen to participate 
  in the Florida proceeding.  Indeed, some of the findings made by the trial judge 
  are based entirely on the documents filed in the Florida action.  A perusal 
  of those documents would have revealed those facts.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Those facts which are not discoverable by reference to the court documents 
  could certainly have been discovered through the pre-trial discovery process 
  in Florida.  I do not understand the respondents to suggest otherwise.  Rather, 
  it is their position that due diligence is irrelevant.  For the reasons set 
  out above, I cannot accept that position.  None of the facts relied on by the 
  trial judge qualifies as a “newly discovered fact”.  He erred in law in relying 
  on those facts to find that the respondents had established fraud.</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although I would hold that even in the facts as found by the trial judge, 
  the fraud defence was not established by the respondents, I will address those 
  findings of fact on the assumption that the trial judge has correctly stated 
  the law.  In my opinion, there is no evidence that the Florida jury was deliberately 
  misled on the damage assessment.  The trial judge’s finding that the jury was 
  misled is unreasonable and cannot stand.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents had the onus of establishing fraud in the proceedings 
  before the Florida jury.  The exhibits filed at that proceeding and the legal 
  submissions made in support of the lost profits claim were before the Ontario 
  court.  Mr. Groener, the Florida lawyer who acted for the Beals and Foodys at 
  trial, testified in the Ontario proceedings.  He was the only person present 
  at the Florida trial who gave evidence in the Ontario proceedings.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
  [4] </span></a>  Mr. Groener described the Florida damage assessment trial in 
  some detail during his examination-in-chief.  He was not asked one question 
  in cross-examination that hinted that anything had been done in the Florida 
  proceedings which could have misled the jury in their assessment of the damages, 
  much less deliberately misled them.  I find it very difficult to see how the 
  respondents could establish fraud in the Florida proceedings when they declined 
  to even broach that issue with the one witness who could speak directly to what 
  had occurred in those proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Instead of producing direct evidence going to the question of fraud 
  or cross-examining Mr. Groener, the respondents attempted to establish their 
  fraud claim by reading parts of Mr. Beals’ discovery into the trial record.  
  They also relied on the opinion evidence of Mr. Muloch, a Florida lawyer.  As 
  I understand the respondents’ position, they contend that Mr. Beals’ evidence 
  on his discovery was true and because that evidence was inconsistent with the 
  claims made in Florida, the Beals and Foodys must have deliberately put different 
  and false material before the jury in Florida so as to obtain the damage award 
  given by the jury.  This very indirect approach to the question of whether the 
  Florida jury was misled carried the day with the trial judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have outlined the five factual findings relied on by the trial judge 
  above (see para. 47).  I will address each of those findings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge concluded that any claim for lost profits rested with 
  the corporation that would have built the homes it was hoped would have been 
  generated by the viewing of the model home.  That corporation was owned equally 
  by Mr. Beals and Mr. Foody.  The trial judge reasoned that as the jury awarded 
  lost profits, they must have been misled into believing that the Beals and Foodys 
  were entitled to those lost profits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot accept the trial judge’s reasoning.  First, it is premised 
  on certain conclusions as to the right of an individual under Florida law to 
  recoup lost corporate profits.  This was not an issue to be decided by the Ontario 
  court under the guise of an allegation of fraud.  Even if the trial judge was 
  entitled to decide as a matter of Florida law whether the Beals and Foodys could 
  recover lost profits suffered by their corporation, the scant evidence adduced 
  by the parties on that issue would not permit any conclusion as to the applicable 
  Florida law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, whatever the state of Florida law, there is no evidence that 
  the jury was misled on the question of the Beals’ and Foodys’ entitlement to 
  claim damages for lost profits.  Mr. Groener was not asked what position he 
  took on that issue, or what instructions, if any, the trial judge gave the jury 
  as to personal entitlement to lost profits.  There is no evidence from Mr. Groener 
  or anyone else that the jury was misled as to the existence of the company, 
  its status at the time of trial, its connection to the transaction, its connection 
  to the Beals and Foodys, or the entitlement of the Beals and Foodys to damages 
  based on anticipated lost profits.  The exhibits filed in the Florida proceedings 
  clearly identified the corporation as the payor of certain expenses claimed 
  by the Beals and Foodys.  Those documents hardly suggest an attempt to mislead 
  the jury as to the role of the corporation in the transaction or the claim advanced 
  by the Beals and Foodys.  At most, it could be said that if the trial judge’s 
  view of Florida law is correct, then the jury erred in awarding damages for 
  lost profits.  Errors in the Florida proceedings are no bar to the enforcement 
  of the Florida judgment in Ontario.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Lastly, and I hesitate to make this point in that it does lead one into 
  an assessment of the merits of the Florida claim, there was evidence before 
  the trial judge which offers a valid explanation for the entitlement of the 
  Beals and Foodys to damages based on the lost profits of the corporation.  On 
  the evidence before the trial judge, the Beals and Foodys intended to rent the 
  model home to the corporation.  As the corporation was owned entirely by the 
  Beals and Foodys, they could charge the corporation whatever rent they deemed 
  appropriate.  There was nothing to stop the Beals and Foodys from charging the 
  corporation rent for the use of the model home equal to the corporation’s profits 
  from its construction operations.  A claim for lost rents properly brought by 
  the Beals and Foodys would be equal to the corporation’s lost profits.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s second finding, that construction of the model home 
  ceased before the Beals and Foodys were aware that they were building on the 
  wrong lot and because the Beals and Foodys had decided to abandon their joint 
  venture, did not assist the respondents in establishing fraud.  There is no 
  evidence as to what the jury was told about these matters.  Neither finding 
  precluded the damage award made by the jury.  Even if construction stopped before 
  the Beals and Foodys knew they were building on the wrong lot, the costs associated 
  with the purchase of  the lot and the construction of the home were properly 
  recoverable in the action for fraudulent misrepresentation.  Further, as the 
  trial judge himself observed, when Mr. Beals and Mr. Foody decided not to proceed 
  together, Mr. Beals still intended to proceed with the project on his own.  
  There is no suggestion that he had abandoned the project before he learned that 
  he had purchased the wrong lot. Consequently, a claim for lost profits could 
  still be advanced, at least by Mr. Beals, despite the termination of the joint 
  venture with Mr. Foody.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s third conclusion, that the factual allegations in 
  the Florida complaint were insufficient to establish fraud, appears to have 
  been based on the opinion evidence of Mr. Muloch, the Florida lawyer called 
  by the respondents.  There are several difficulties with this finding as a basis 
  for concluding that the Florida judgment was obtained by fraud.  First and foremost, 
  the conclusion that the Florida pleadings did not properly allege fraud is surely 
  a matter for the Florida court to decide.  It was not for the trial judge to 
  question the adequacy of those pleadings.  Secondly, even assuming the pleadings 
  were inadequate, that inadequacy could hardly support a finding that the Florida 
  judgment was obtained by fraud.  There is no suggestion that the Florida court 
  was somehow misled as to the contents of the pleadings.  The pleadings were 
  before that court and were presumably read by it.  If that court made a legal 
  mistake in proceeding on the basis of those pleadings, that error did not constitute 
  a fraud on the court and had no relevance to the Ontario action.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Lastly, the trial judge’s conclusion that the allegations in the complaint 
  were insufficient to support a fraud claim flows from a misapprehension of Mr. 
  Muloch’s evidence.  Mr. Muloch explained that the respondents could have appealed 
  after receiving the Florida judgment.  In that appeal, they could have raised 
  the sufficiency of the allegations of fraud in the complaint as a ground of 
  appeal.  Mr. Muloch said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I think there was a basis to appeal from the judgment after default, 
      based on insufficient allegations of all of the elements of fraud.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having indicated that an appeal based on the pleadings was possible, 
  Mr. Muloch went on to say, however, that he did not think the appeal would succeed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I think it is a less likely than not that the Saldanhas could have taken 
      a successful appeal from the judgment after default.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Muloch’s conclusion that the respondents could have challenged the 
  pleadings on appeal but probably would have failed tells me that whatever deficiencies 
  there may have been in the pleadings, they were not sufficient to invalidate 
  the finding of fraud.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Muloch also referred to the merits of the fraud allegation in the 
  Florida complaint in his evidence concerning the respondents’ opportunity to 
  bring a motion before the trial judge to set aside the judgment.  He testified 
  that if the respondents had moved with reasonable speed after receiving notice 
  of the judgment, they likely could have had it set aside.  His opinion was based 
  in part on his view that the respondents had a good defence on the merits to 
  the Florida action.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… They could have beaten the fraud claim, they could have beaten the treble 
      damages claim and they would have, had rescission been requested, I think 
      that probably would have been awarded.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not read Mr. Muloch’s evidence as a suggestion that the allegations 
  in the complaint could not support a finding of fraud by misrepresentation.  
  I understand Mr. Muloch to be saying that the defence which the respondents 
  could have advanced had they chosen to do so was a valid defence to the fraud 
  allegation but not to a rescission claim.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fourth finding made by the trial judge in support of his conclusion 
  that the Florida judgment had been obtained by fraud was the finding that no 
  justifiable reliance on any representation made by the respondents as to ownership 
  of the land could be made out.  This finding involves a direct assessment of 
  the merits of the claim made in the Florida proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Muloch testified that the claim made by the Beals and Foodys that 
  they were deceived by the respondents’ misrepresentation as to ownership of 
  the lot was “a very weak and curious one”.  Mr. Muloch explained that ownership 
  of land was a matter of easily ascertainable public record and that as a matter 
  of course, purchasers or their agents determined title based on a search of 
  those public records and not by relying on representations as to ownership made 
  by vendors.  Mr. Muloch found it absurd that the Beals and Foodys would simply 
  act on the respondents’ representation that they owned the land.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I can accept that the Beals and Foodys would have had a very difficult 
  time convincing anyone that they relied on the respondents’ representations 
  as to ownership.  Had the respondents chosen to take part in the Florida proceedings, 
  they could have advanced the position put forward by Mr. Muloch in the Ontario 
  proceedings.  They may well have been successful.  Unfortunately, they chose 
  not to take part in the Florida proceedings.  The Beals and Foodys were spared 
  the need to convince a jury that they relied on the respondents’ representation.  
  The respondents cannot now advance a defence through the evidence of Mr. Muloch 
  that they could have advanced in the Florida proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is also no basis upon which to assume that the Beals and Foodys 
  misled the jury on the question of whether they relied on the representation 
  made by the respondents.  Indeed, there was no need to mislead the jury, as 
  they were concerned only with the assessment of damages.  Reliance goes to liability.  
  That issue was not before the jury.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s conclusion that there could be no justifiable reliance 
  on the representation made by the respondents as to ownership was a reassessment 
  of the merits of the liability finding made in the Florida court.  His further 
  conclusion that the Florida jury was misled on that issue is not supported by 
  the evidence, and is untenable given that the jury was not concerned with liability. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fifth fact which led the trial judge to conclude that the Florida 
  jury was “deliberately misled” relates to the document that was attached to 
  the complaint in the Florida proceedings.  According to paragraph 8 of the complaint, 
  the offer to purchase sent to the respondents and signed by Mr. Foody was attached 
  to the complaint.  The complaint referred to that document as the “contract”.  
  This allegation was consistent with the other paragraphs in the complaint which 
  alleged that an agreement had been made to purchase Lot #1 before the agreement 
  was sent to the respondents.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge concluded that the Florida jury had been misled because 
  the document attached to the complaint was not “the amended offer (or counter-offer) 
  returned by the Defendants [respondents] and accepted by the Plaintiffs”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are three difficulties with this finding as a basis for concluding 
  that the Florida jury was misled.  First, like some of the other findings I 
  have discussed above, the question of which document constituted the agreement 
  between the parties was a matter going to liability and not to damages.  It 
  was not something that would have concerned the jury.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s description of the documents signed by the respondents 
  as “the amended offer (or counter-offer)” is another indication that he retried 
  the merits of the allegation made in the Florida proceedings.  By describing 
  the document returned to Mr. O’Neil by the respondents as an “amended offer” 
  or a “counter-offer”, the trial judge effectively accepted Mrs. Thivy’s version 
  of the relevant events.  She gave that version only in the Ontario proceedings.  
  The trial judge was wrong to characterize the documents based on evidence adduced 
  before him and to conclude that the failure to so characterize the documents 
  in Florida proceedings, constituted a fraud on that court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The fifth finding by the trial judge also implies that the document 
  signed by the respondents and returned to Mr. O’Neil was somehow kept from the 
  Florida court.  This is not so.  Both the initial offer signed by Mr. Foody 
  and sent to the respondents by Mr. O’Neil and the document as altered by Mrs. 
  Thivy, signed by the respondents and returned to Mr. O’Neil were before the 
  jury.  There is nothing in the evidence adduced before the trial judge upon 
  which one could conclude that the Beals and Foodys withheld relevant documents 
  from the Florida court.  The Foodys and Beals characterized the various documents 
  in a manner that supported their allegation.  The respondents chose not to put 
  their characterization of the documents before the Florida court.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> None of the findings relied on by the trial judge in support of his 
  conclusion that the Florida judgment was obtained by fraud is supported by the 
  evidence.  The evidence comes down to this:  the Beals and Foodys made a claim 
  based on fraudulent misrepresentation;  that claim may well have failed on its 
  merits had the respondents defended the action in Florida, but they chose not 
  to defend the claim.  Furthermore, once judgment was obtained, the respondents 
  may well have been able to set aside that judgment in part because of the dubious 
  merits of the claim.  Acting on legal advice, they chose not to follow that 
  course.  An Ontario court cannot come to the rescue of these respondents and 
  save them from the dire consequences of the course of action they chose to follow 
  by allowing the respondents to relitigate the merits of the claim decided by 
  the Florida court under the guise of allegations of fraud on the Florida court.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to the findings I have reviewed above, the trial judge seems 
  to have come to his conclusion that the Florida judgment was obtained by fraud 
  in part because of the amount of the award made by the Florida jury.  He quoted 
  Mr. Muloch as describing the award as “bizarre”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Muloch did not say that the award was “bizarre”.  When asked whether 
  he thought the Florida judgment was “bizarre”, Mr. Muloch said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The judgment itself, the procedure is not bizarre, but the facts out 
      of which it arose, in my judgment, are strange and wonderful.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I take this to be a reference to Mr. Muloch’s often repeated assertion 
  that no reasonable purchaser would ever rely on a vendor’s representation as 
  to title, but would instead retain competent assistance to search the title 
  through the readily available public records.  While I can easily agree with 
  Mr. Muloch’s observation, it has no relevance to either the question of fraud 
  or the quantum of damages.  The fact of the matter is the respondents chose 
  not to go to court in Florida and demonstrate just how “strange and wonderful” 
  the allegations in the complaint were.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I could find only two observations by Mr. Muloch concerning the quantum 
  of damages awarded by the jury.  He testified that treble damages were not available 
  under the Florida law quoted in the complaint.  This evidence goes to the merits 
  of the claim and does not suggest fraud.  In any event, treble damages were 
  not requested before the jury.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Muloch also testified that the quantum of the award for lost profits 
  (about $200,000 (U.S.)) seemed “extraordinary, based on the fact that I was 
  asked to assume that this was a brand new startup corporation”.  Mr. Muloch 
  acknowledged that he knew nothing about the construction or sales experience 
  of the two principals of the company, Mr. Beals and Mr. Foody.  In my view, 
  their experience would be more relevant to the quantum for a claim for lost 
  profits than the age of the particular corporate vehicle being used by them.</p>

  </span> Even if there is merit to Mr. Muloch’s somewhat uninformed opinion as 
  to the quantum of the award for lost profits, that opinion provides no basis 
  for a finding that the jury was misled.  Certainly there is no evidence that 
  anything was placed before the jury that misstated the background of the corporation 
  or any other fact relevant to the lost profits claim.  The legal memorandum 
  filed in support of that claim relies on legal principles which are not dissimilar 
  to those that would apply to such claims in Ontario. </p>

  </span> An award in the amount of some $800,000 arising out of what was initially 
  an $8,000 (U.S.) land transaction seems disproportionate.  Most of that $800,000, 
  however, is accounted for by the exchange rate applicable when American funds 
  are converted to Canadian funds and by the post-judgment interest which has 
  accumulated at the rate of 12% a year for almost 10 years.  Apart from the exchange 
  rate and pre-judgment interest, the bulk of the award is for lost profits (about 
  $200,000 (U.S.)).  There is no evidence as to the factual material placed before 
  the jury in support of the lost profit claim.  Without any evidence of what 
  material was before the jury, I cannot come to the conclusion that they were 
  somehow misled or that the award was determined in a manner that offends principles 
  of fairness and fundamental justice.  Depending on what information the jury 
  had, the award may or may not have been inordinately high.  Even if it was excessive, 
  that is no basis upon which to refuse to enforce it in Ontario.  </p>

  </span> The trial judge’s finding that the enforcement of the Florida judgment 
  would contravene public policy cannot be upheld.  I do not share his conclusion 
  that the substantial connection approach to jurisdiction compels a broader public 
  policy defence to the enforcement of foreign judgments.  To the contrary, the 
  rationale underlying <i>Morguard, supra</i>, is entirely consistent with the 
  narrow application of the public policy defence as set out in <i>Boardwalk Regency 
  Corp. v. Maalouf</i> (1992), 6 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.).</p>

  </span> Even if what the trial judge described as “some sort of judicial sniff 
  test” should be applied in considering whether public policy precludes enforcement 
  of a foreign judgment, I can see no reason not to enforce this judgment.  The 
  Beals and Foodys launched a lawsuit in Florida.  Florida was an entirely proper 
  court for the determination of the allegations in that lawsuit.  The Beals and 
  Foodys complied with the procedures dictated by the Florida rules.  There is 
  no evidence that they misled the Florida court on any matter.  Rather, it would 
  seem they won what might be regarded as a very weak case because the respondents 
  chose not to defend the action.  I find nothing in the record to support the 
  trial judge’s characterization of the conduct of the Beals and Foodys in Florida 
  as “egregious”.  They brought their allegations in the proper forum, followed 
  the proper procedures, and were immensely successful in no small measure because 
  the respondents chose not to participate in the proceedings.</p>

  of all of his or her creditors, the failure to do so will not prevent the bankrupt 
  from obtaining a discharge if that failure was not intentional or fraudulent: 
  Houlden and Morawetz, <i>supra</i>, at p. 6-140.1, 6-1.41.  There is no suggestion

  </span> Since preparing a draft of my reasons, I have read a draft of the reasons 
  of Weiler J.A.  She would hold that the respondents were denied natural justice 
  in the Florida proceedings.  In her view, the Florida complaint did not alert 
  the respondents to “the extent of their jeopardy”.  As I understand her reasons, 
  there are two fatal flaws in the complaint:  it claimed damages of “over $5,000” 
  rather than claiming a specific amount; and the complaint failed to advise the 
  respondents that Mr. Beals and Mr. Foody “would be seeking damages for loss 
  of opportunity by a company owned by them”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> My colleague reasons that as Canadian pleading rules require that plaintiffs 
  specify the amount of damages claimed, a failure to so plead in a foreign jurisdiction 
  where the rules do not require that the amount claimed be specified, denies 
  defendants the right to know the case against them and the full extent of their 
  jeopardy.  I disagree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Specific pleading rules cannot be confused with the rules of natural 
  justice, and a particular pleading rule cannot be viewed in isolation.  While 
  rule 25.06(9) requires <i>that</i> damage claims specify “the amount claimed 
  for each claimant in respect of each claim”, the wide powers of amendment found 
  in rule 26.01 demonstrate that the failure to comply with rule 25.06(9) does 
  not mean that a defendant has been denied the opportunity to know the extent 
  of its jeopardy or the case it has to meet.  Under rule 26.01, a court can refuse 
  to make amendments, including amendments increasing the amount of the damages 
  claimed, only where the defendant can demonstrate on the balance of probabilities 
  that the amendment would cause prejudice that could not be compensated for by 
  costs or adjournment.  The mere fact that an amendment substantially increases 
  the quantum of the plaintiff's damages claim and therefore the defendant’s potential 
  liability is not a basis upon which to deny the amendment.  The amending power 
  in rule 26.01 has been invoked to substantially increase the quantum of damages 
  claimed after judgment is granted, and even on appeal:  see <i>Hill v. Church 
  of Scientology of Toronto</i> (1992), 7 O.R. (3d) 489 at 496 (Gen. Div.), aff’d. 
  without reference to this point (1994), 114 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 1 (Ont. 
  C.A.), aff’d. without reference to this point (1995), 126 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)

line-height:normal'> [99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The approach dictated by rule 26.01 to motions that seek to amend pleadings 
  to substantially increase the damages claimed no matter when in the proceeding 
  that motion is brought, is inconsistent with the argument that knowledge of 
  the amount claimed by the plaintiff at the time the defendant is called upon 
  to reply to the statement of claim is essential to the defendant’s ability to 
  know the extent of its jeopardy and to make an informed decision as to how to 
  respond to the claim.  If knowledge of the amount claimed was essential to the 
  defendant’s ability to effectively respond to the claim, motions to significantly 
  increase the amount of the claim as late as the appellate stage would be rejected 
  out of hand.  Rule 26.01 takes the opposite approach.  It requires the court 
  to make those amendments unless the defendant can show prejudice that cannot 
  be cured by costs or an adjournment. </p>

  a similarly framed complaint.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  Florida complaint made it clear that the damages claimed were potentially significant.  
  The heads of damages were set out and a claim for treble damages under three 
  of the heads of damages was advanced.  It was also well known to the respondents 
  that any amount awarded would be in American funds and subject to a substantial 
  increase if converted to Canadian funds for the purpose of enforcing the judgment 
  in Ontario.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  is also significant that the respondents took no steps to set aside the Florida 
  judgment even when they knew the exact amount awarded against them.  Once the 
  respondents had notice of the Florida judgment, they knew precisely “the nature 
  of their jeopardy”.  And yet, they still did nothing.  My colleague suggests 
  that the respondents’ ability to move to set aside the Florida judgment was 
  tied to their knowledge of “the circumstances of the damage assessment”.  However, 
  that was not the evidence of the defence expert, Mr. Muloch.  He testified that 
  the respondents could have set aside the Florida judgment by demonstrating “excusable 
  neglect” and a meritorious defence on the issues going to liability.  Neither 
  factor turned on anything that happened at the damage assessment.</p>

  second alleged deficiency in the pleadings identified by my colleague assumes 
  that the “loss profits” claim refers to corporate profits and not profits properly 
  recoverable by Mr. Beals or Mr. Foody.  I do not think that this has anything 
  to do with the adequacy of the notice in the Florida complaint relating to the 
  nature of the claim made against the respondents or the extent of their jeopardy.  
  The complaint is clear.  It is a claim for damages suffered by Mr. Beals and 
  Mr. Foody.  If the damages alleged were not in law damages suffered by Mr. Beals 
  and Mr. Foody, they were not entitled to recover those damages.  Their claim 
  would have failed on the merits.  </p>

  the respondents defended the Florida action, they may have been able to show 
  that some entity other than Mr. Beals or Mr. Foody suffered whatever loss may 
  have flowed from the alleged misrepresentation.  The respondents chose not to 
  participate in the Florida proceedings.  The jury awarded damages to Mr. Beals 
  and Mr. Foody for the lost profits.  It was not for the trial judge or this

  belief that any Florida judgment obtained against them could not be enforced

  256 (SCC), the Supreme Court provided the framework for deciding whether a foreign 
  judgment should be enforced in a domestic court.  Throughout the decision, the 
  Supreme Court was conscious of the need to strike a balance between the plaintiffs’ 
  interest in having a foreign judgment in their favour recognized and enforced 
  and the local defendants’ interest in fair process and to defend themselves 
  from a judgment that operates unfairly.  This case requires us to strike that 
  balance.  I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of Doherty J.A. and 
  I respectfully disagree with his conclusion.  In my opinion, two of the defences

  upon s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> in their amended 
  statement of defence.  They pleaded that, “the acceptance of the process employed 
  by the Florida Court and permitted recognition and enforcement of the judgment 
  therein contravenes said section.” </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  say that the defence of denial of natural justice is applicable because the 
  Ontario defendants were never given notice that the Florida plaintiffs were 
  claiming loss of profit for the loss of their company’s opportunity to build 
  an undefined number of homes in the future.  The purpose of notice is to enable 
  defendants to appreciate the extent of their jeopardy.  The cumulative effect 
  of the Florida plaintiffs’ conduct is that the Ontario defendants were not in 
  a position to appreciate the extent of their jeopardy prior to the judgment 
  for damages against them.  Several factors contributed to this.  The amount 
  claimed was not stated in the claim.  The pleadings only claimed “loss of revenue 
  from the inability to construct a model home”.  Although the Florida plaintiffs’ 
  counsel possessed information concerning the nature and extent of the damages 
  claim in the form of Mr. Beals’ deposition prior to the assessment of damages, 
  this information was never given to the Ontario defendants.  The Ontario defendants 
  were not notified that an expert witness as to loss of future profit was being 
  called nor given his name as required by the Florida rules.  At the hearing 
  to assess damages, damages were assessed beyond the pleadings.  In addition, 
  the Florida plaintiffs did not order a copy of the transcript of the proceedings 
  before the jury to assess the damages.  As a result of the lack of transparency 
  with respect to the damages, the Ontario defendants were unaware that the major 
  portion of the jury’s assessment of damages related to the Florida plaintiffs’ 
  company’s loss of opportunity to build an undefined number of homes in the future 
  until the Florida plaintiffs sought to enforce the judgment in Ontario.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  would uphold the trial judge’s finding of fraud because, as the trial judge 
  found, the Florida plaintiffs concealed from the jury the fact that the reason 
  they discontinued building the model home had nothing to do with their purchase 
  of the wrong lot.  The Florida plaintiffs stopped building because Mr. Beals’ 
  partner, Mr. Foody, took a job with another company and Mr. Beals decided not 
  to continue the business alone in that area. Consequently the jury were misled 
  into assessing damages for loss of profit for lost opportunity to build an indefinite 
  number of homes. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> My 
  reasons also differ from those of Doherty J.A. as to the effect to be given 
  to the failure of the Ontario defendants to take proceedings before the Florida 
  courts once they knew the amount of the award against them.  While their failure 
  to move before the Florida courts to set aside the judgment is an important 
  factor to consider, it is not, in my opinion, the only consideration.  A more 
  flexible approach that takes into account other factors is required.  The reasons 
  why no proceedings were taken are an equally important consideration.  One reason 
  is that upon receiving the Florida judgment for damages, the Ontario defendants 
  sought legal advice and were told that the Florida judgment could not be enforced 
  in Ontario.  Another reason is that the Ontario defendants had no reason to 
  make further inquiries until the Florida judgment was sought to be enforced 
  in Ontario.  It was at this time that the Ontario defendants learned that damages 
  had been assessed beyond the pleading and of the circumstances relating to the 
  Florida plaintiffs’ fraud.  By this time it was too late to move before the 
  Florida courts to set aside the default judgment.  The Ontario defendants would 
  likely have been successful in setting aside the judgment both as to liability 
  and damages had they moved to do so.  These considerations lead me to the conclusion 
  that the failure of the Ontario defendants to move to set aside the proceedings 
  before the courts in Florida should not prevent them from successfully raising 
  the defences of denial of natural justice and fraud before the enforcing court 
  in Ontario.  In the result, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  view of my conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with the third defence that 
  has been raised, namely, that enforcement should be denied on grounds of public 
  policy.  My reasons begin by briefly outlining the principles in <i>Morguard</i>.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>II.         The <i>Morguard</i> Principles  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Morguard</i> 
  sets out four considerations for a court to consider when deciding whether to 
  enforce a foreign judgment:  1)&nbsp;whether comity applies; 2) whether the 
  foreign court’s jurisdiction was reasonable based on a real and substantial 
  connection; 3) whether the foreign court’s exercise of jurisdiction was fair 
  to the defendant; and 4) whether there are reasons such as fraud, public policy, 
  or conflict with the law of the foreign state, for refusing to enforce the foreign 
  judgment. </p>
<p class=heading3subtitle>1)  <i>The principle of comity</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  is accepted that the principle of comity applies to decisions of U.S. federal 
  and state courts:  see, for example, <i>Moses v. Shore Boat Builders Ltd</i>. 
  (1993), 106 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 654 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. 
  refused (1994), 109 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) vii; <i>Arrowmaster Inc. v. Unique 
  Forming Ltd.</i> (1993), 17 O.R. (3d) 407 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)); <i>United 
  States of America v. Ivey</i> (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 533 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), 
  aff’d (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 370 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1996] 
  S.C.C.A. No. 582 (Q.L.).  Comity is, however, not a matter of absolute obligation.  
  It includes due regard for the rights of foreign defendants.  (See the definition 
  of comity in <i>Hilton v. Guyot</i>, 159 U.S. 113 (1895) accepted by Estey J. 
  in <i>R. v. Spencer</i> (1985), 21 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>), 756 at 759 and adopted 
  by La Forest J. in <i>Morguard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 269 for a unanimous court.) 
</p>
<p class=heading3subtitle>            2)  <i>The real and substantial connection 
  test</i> </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> If 
  a real and substantial connection with the foreign state exists, the foreign 
  court’s assumption of jurisdiction will be considered reasonable.  If, in similar 
  circumstances, the enforcing court would assume jurisdiction, it will be reasonable 
  for the enforcing court to recognize the assumption of jurisdiction by the foreign 
  court.  In <i>Hunt v. T &amp; N  plc.</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289 at 325-26, the 
  Supreme Court emphasized, however, that the decision in <i>Morguard</i> does 
  not propose a rigid test for the recognition of the assumption of jurisdiction 
  by a foreign court.  Rather, recognition of the foreign court’s assumption of 
  jurisdiction, “must ultimately be guided by the requirements of order and fairness, 
  not a mechanical counting of contacts or connections” (p. 326).  The concern 
  of La Forest J. for the rights of the defendant faced with a foreign judgment 
  is also illustrated by his comment that the requirement of a real and substantial 
  connection to the originating jurisdiction affords some protection to the defendant.  
  He then states at p. 279: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whether the Canadian counterpart to the due process clause [of the United 
      States Constitution], s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, though not made expressly 
      applicable to property, might at least in certain circumstances, play a 
      role is also unnecessary to determine. </p>
    <p>There are as well other discretionary techniques that have been used by 
      courts for refusing to grant jurisdiction to plaintiffs whose contact with 
      the jurisdiction is tenuous or where entertaining the proceedings would 
      create injustice, notably the doctrine of <i>forum non conveniens</i> and 
      the power of a court to prevent an abuse of its process. </p>
    <p>3)  <i>Whether the way in which the judgment was obtained was fair to the 
      defendants</i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> La 
  Forest J. holds that concerns for the security of transactions, and the unfairness 
  in forcing a plaintiff to go through the expense and inconvenience of bringing 
  an action all over again where the defendant resides must, however, be weighed 
  against fairness to the defendant.  Justice La Forest explains at p. 274:  “Thus, 
  fairness to the defendant requires that the judgment be issued by a court acting 
  through fair process and with properly restrained jurisdiction.” </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  understand the comment of La Forest J. concerning fair process to be a reference 
  to the rules of natural justice.</p>
<p class=heading3subtitle>4)  <i>Other defences</i> </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> La 
  Forest J. notes that, besides the question of the proper assumption of jurisdiction 
  and fair process, there will still be some defences available to a defendant 
  which might preclude recognition and enforcement.  He proposes the following 
  at p. 279:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There may also be remedies available to the recognizing court that may 
      afford redress to the defendant in certain cases such as fraud or conflict 
      with the law or public policy of the recognizing jurisdiction.  Here, too, 
      there may be room for the operation of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> [principles 
      of fundamental justice].</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the question of available defences to preclude enforcement was not 
  relevant to the case before him, La Forest J. did not give the issue further 
  consideration.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  considerations enunciated by La Forest J. in <i>Morguard </i>demonstrate a concern 
  at each stage for fairness to the defendant.  He also raises the question of 
  the extent to which the principles of fundamental justice contained in s.&nbsp;7 
  of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> should inform the enforcing court’s 
  decision to enforce a foreign judgment.  With these considerations in mind I 
  now turn to my analysis of this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Before 
  a foreign judgment will be recognized and enforced, the enforcing court must 
  ask itself whether the judgment meets the basic requirements of natural justice.  
  To ask whether a foreign judgment has been obtained in accordance with natural 
  justice is to ask whether the way in which the judgment was obtained was procedurally 
  fair to the defendant.  The defence of natural justice is limited to the procedure 
  by which the foreign court arrived at its judgment:  see J. O’Brien,<i> Conflict 
  of Laws</i>,<i> </i>2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (London: Cavendish, 1999) at 275-277.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  defence of natural justice is commonly understood to mean that the defendants 
  must be given notice of the claim made against them and an opportunity to present 
  their defence.  It is not, however, to the letter of the procedural requirements 
  that a court will look in deciding whether there has been a breach of natural 
  justice.  For example, procedural irregularity with respect to service of the 
  claim will not be considered a denial of natural justice if the defendant had 
  actual notice of the claim:  see  <i>Pemberton v. Hughes</i>,<i> </i>[1899] 
  1 Ch. 781; <i>Minister of State of the Principality of Monaco v. Project Planning 
  Associates (International) Ltd.</i> (1980), 32 O.R. (2d) 438 (Div. Ct.).  Natural 
  justice requires that there be substantial justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  <i>Morguard</i>, La Forest J. makes reference to s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> 
  recognizing that the section is not concerned with property but with life, liberty 
  and security of the person.  The reference suggests the underlying principles 
  of fundamental justice contained in s. 7 may be a consideration for the enforcing 
  court.  It is important to note that natural justice is a subset of these principles:  
  <i>Reference re s. 94(2) of the Motor Vehicle Act (British Columbia)</i>,<i> 
  </i>[1985] 2 S.C.R. 486.  Courts are required to decide cases in a manner consistent 
  with <i>Charter</i> principles although the <i>Charter</i> does not directly 
  apply:  see <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 1130 at para. 
  95.  Principles of fundamental justice encompass more than notice and an opportunity 
  to be heard.  The comment of La&nbsp;Forest J. that the foreign judgment must 
  have been obtained through “fair process” is also indicative that more than 
  notice and an opportunity to be heard is at stake.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  question of what natural justice embodies was more explicitly answered in <i>Adams 
  v. Cape Industries plc. </i>(1990), [1991] 1 All E.R. 929 (C.A.) leave to appeal 
  to the House of Lords refused [1991] 1 All E.R. 1054.  In <i>Adams</i>, the 
  English Court of Appeal specifically held that natural justice is not limited 
  to notice and an opportunity to defend the action.  Rather, because procedure 
  is but the formal manifestation of commonly held fundamental principles of justice, 
  the Court of Appeal held at pp. 1042-43 that it is to these underlying fundamental 
  principles that regard must be had in deciding what is encompassed by natural 
  justice.  The Court of Appeal held that there had not been a hearing to determine 
  the damages in the real sense of that word and that damages had not been determined 
  in a judicial manner.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  <i>Adams</i>, a Texas State court had given a default judgment in a class action 
  by seventy-six plaintiffs injured from exposure to asbestos.  The trial judge 
  facilitated the amount the plaintiffs agreed to settle for in conferences with 
  their lawyers but he did not assess damages on the evidence.  At the invitation 
  of plaintiffs’ counsel, the judge indicated, based on his knowledge of the case 
  and of national average settlement figures, that the recovery for each plaintiff 
  should be an average of $75,000 U.S.  The trial judge left it to the lawyers 
  to work out the actual figure each plaintiff should receive.  There was no “judicial” 
  assessment of damages because the judge did not hear evidence in respect of 
  the injuries of the individual plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs submitted that natural 
  justice was limited to notice and an opportunity to be heard and the court rejected 
  that argument.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  plaintiffs also submitted that the defendants were not entitled to raise the 
  defence of natural justice to remedy the alleged procedural defect.  It was 
  the plaintiffs’ position that the defendants were required to resort to the 
  jurisdiction of the originating court, either by applying to set aside the judgment 
  or by way of appeal, before they could raise the defence of natural justice 
  – but they had not done so.  The Court of Appeal recognized that the enforcing 
  court should not sit on appeal from the originating court. However it refused 
  to give effect to the plaintiffs’ argument and adopted a more flexible approach 
  instead.  The court held at 1052-53:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The court must, in our judgment, have regard to the availability of a remedy 
      in deciding whether in the circumstances of any particular case substantial 
      injustice has been proved.  However, the relevance of the existence of the 
      remedy and the weight to be attached to it must depend on factors which 
      include the nature of the procedural defect itself, the point in the proceedings 
      at which it occurred and the knowledge and means of knowledge of the defendants 
      of the defect and the reasonableness in the circumstances of requiring or 
      expecting that they make use of the remedy in all the particular circumstances.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Having 
  regard to the factors it had mentioned, the Court of Appeal considered that 
  the defendants were served with notice of the proceedings but chose not to defend 
  them.  They were also given notice of the application for the default judgment 
  and, after judgment was granted, they were served with the default judgment.  
  Upon being served, the defendants knew the amount of the award against them.  
  They could have obtained access to the plaintiffs’ medical records referred 
  to in the judgment and legal advice as to whether the foreign court’s award 
  for each plaintiff appeared to be excessive.  By not attending the application 
  for the default judgment the defendants deprived themselves of information as 
  to what occurred before the foreign court.  It would have been open to the defendants 
  to apply to set aside the foreign judgment and it was probable that the application 
  would have succeeded if it had been brought promptly.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When 
  the judgment was served on the defendants, they could not and did not know the 
  method by which damages had been assessed from reading the judgment.  The facts 
  as to what happened in the Texas court appear to have become known at the time 
  when a claim to enforce the judgment was made on the defendants and they investigated 
  the circumstances.  The Court of Appeal was critical of the foreign plaintiffs’ 
  counsel for not advising the defendants that they intended to invite the judge 
  to make an average award from his knowledge of the case and national average 
  settlement figures as opposed to an assessment of actual damages.  Counsel induced 
  the judge to depart from the standard method for assessing damages.  Counsel 
  then drafted a judgment for the judge’s signature that contained false and misleading 
  recitals, implying that a hearing had been held.  While the Court of Appeal 
  was critical of plaintiffs’ counsel’s conduct , the Court of Appeal stated there 
  was no dishonest purpose to the conduct.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  Court of Appeal found that the effect of the actions by plaintiffs’ counsel 
  on the defendants was that the defendants had no knowledge of any basis for 
  seeking relief from the Texas court in respect of the procedural defect when 
  the judgment for damages was served on them.  The court refused to impute constructive 
  knowledge of the procedural defect to the defendants simply because they had 
  not attended the proceedings.  In the Court of Appeal’s opinion at p. 1054, 
  “[the fact the defendants did not attend the proceedings] is not an acceptable 
  basis for considering proof of procedural injustice.  Plaintiffs can, we think, 
  fairly be left to avoid such procedural errors as will prevent enforcement of 
  a judgment in this country.”  The court further held that the defendants were 
  not to be treated as having information concerning the procedural defect since, 
  if they had made an application to set aside the default judgment (that they 
  had no reason to make), they could then have obtained information as to the 
  procedural irregularity.  In other words, upon being served with the judgment, 
  the defendants had no reason to exercise due diligence and therefore no duty 
  to do so. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  decision in <i>Adams</i> is consistent with the approach suggested in <i>Morguard</i>:  
  the ultimate guidepost in deciding whether the defence of natural justice may 
  be raised is procedural fairness based on underlying fundamental principles 
  of justice.  Although defendants ignore the proceedings in the foreign court 
  at their peril, they still have a right to expect fair process in the making 
  of the decision.  A rule that objection to procedure must always be taken before 
  the originating court would subordinate the premise of fairness where it was 
  no longer possible or practicable to go before the originating court.  What 
  the Supreme Court had in mind in <i>Morguard</i> was not a rule, but a flexible 
  approach requiring a judge in the enforcing jurisdiction to balance competing 
  considerations.  These considerations include the nature of the procedural defect, 
  the stage of the proceedings when the procedure complained of occurred; when 
  the defendants became aware of the procedural difficulty; and the practicality 
  of seeking a remedy in the originating court. </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  understanding that natural justice requires notice to be given to the defendants 
  of the claim rests on the underlying fundamental principle of justice that defendants 
  have a right to know the case against them and to make an informed decision 
  as to whether or not to present a defence.  Making an informed decision respecting 
  whether, and to what extent to defend an action, requires an appreciation of 
  the extent of one’s jeopardy.  For example, depending upon the amount claimed, 
  a defendant would make a conscious choice as to whether the amount in issue 
  justifies the expense of defending the action.  Thus, notice of the amount claimed 
  is part of the disclosure required in a pleading in order for defendants to 
  make an informed decision to answer and defend a claim.  Another aspect of notice 
  is that any hearing that is held must conform to the pleadings.  This is because 
  pleadings are the formal allegations by the parties to a lawsuit of their respective 
  claims.  The intended purpose of pleadings is to provide notice of what is to 
  be expected at trial:  <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 6<sup>th</sup> ed., s.v. 
  “pleadings”.  If the assessment of damages takes place beyond the pleadings, 
  notice in the true sense of the word will not have been given.  The right of 
  the defendants to make an informed decision whether or not to defend the proceedings 
  will have been undermined.  Depending upon the circumstances, the defendants 
  may not have been able to appreciate the extent of their jeopardy.  There will 
  be a denial of natural justice to the defendants. </p>

  examination of whether the Ontario defendants were able to appreciate the extent 
  of their jeopardy and to make an informed decision whether or not to defend 
  the proceedings begins with the Florida Complaint.  The Florida Complaint against 
  the Ontario defendants claims “damages in excess of $5000”.  The claim does 
  not set forth the amount claimed as unliquidated damages.  As Doherty J.A. notes 
  in his reasons, this manner of pleading is not unusual in Florida.  The simple 
  purpose of this type of pleading is to establish the jurisdiction of the court 
  in which the action is to be brought. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> In Canada, 
  the amount claimed must be stated: see Federal Court Rules, 1998, SOR/98-106, 
  r. 182; Rules of Court, Alta. Reg. 390/68, r. 606; Rules of Court, B.C. Reg.

  Civil Procedure, R.S.Q. 1977, c. C-25, arts. 76 - 77: The Code is interpreted 
  as requiring that the amount claimed be stated.) In some circumstances, no prejudice 
  will result from the fact that the amount claimed is not stated, or even from 
  an amendment to increase the amount of the claim after a trial. The circumstances 
  of the case dictate whether there has been substantial due process in the sense 
  that the defendants have been sufficiently alerted to the extent of their jeopardy. 
  For this reason, I shall examine all of the circumstances leading up to the 
  award of damages and consider the cumulative effect of these circumstances.</p>

  no notice of the amount claimed was included in the Complaint, substantial notice 
  would have been given had the lawyers for the Florida plaintiffs informally 
  advised the Ontario defendants of the amount being claimed.  This was not done.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The 
  Ontario residents filed a defence to the second action by the Florida plaintiffs 
  which was commenced in September 1986.  The Florida plaintiffs amended their 
  pleading in May 1987 and again in May 1990.  The Florida rules of civil procedure 
  provide that if no response is made to a complaint each time it is amended a 
  defendant is deemed not to have defended the action at all.  Although the amended 
  pleadings were served on the Ontario defendants, there is no suggestion that 
  the amended pleadings contained any notice of this consequence or that the Florida 
  plaintiffs’ lawyers advised the Ontario defendants of this important fact.  
  Because the Ontario residents had filed an initial response, the Florida rules 
  required that the Ontario defendants be served with a copy of the Florida plaintiffs’ 
  motion for default for failure to answer the third amended complaint and a notice 
  of hearing of the motion for default.  This notice was given.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  Ontario defendants did not respond to the notice of hearing for default.  They  
  were given notice of the judgment respecting liability and notice of a hearing 
  to assess the damages.  They did nothing.  At that time, however, they were 
  not in a position to appreciate the extent of their jeopardy relating to damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At 
  the time the Florida plaintiffs’ lawyer sent the Ontario defendants notice of 
  the damages hearing, Mr. Beals had given a deposition.  In his deposition, Mr. 
  Beals deposed that he, and Mr. Foody, planned to build a model home and to rent 
  it to their company Fox Chase Homes.  Fox Chase Homes hoped to use the model 
  home to obtain contracts to build other houses in the same subdivision.  The 
  profit on another house built in the same subdivision on Regina Crescent was 
  $10,000.  Had the Florida plaintiffs’ provided this information in their amended 
  pleading or had their attorney given Mr. Beals’ deposition to the Ontario defendants 
  they would have had some idea of the extent of their jeopardy with respect to 
  damages.  The Florida plaintiffs’ attorney could easily have provided Mr. Beals’ 
  deposition to the Ontario defendants but chose not to do so.  The Ontario defendants 
  lack of knowledge as to the extent of their jeopardy continued through to the 
  jury hearing to assess the damages.</p>

  from damages being claimed “in excess of $5,000”, the allegations in the Florida 
  pleadings relating to the issue of damages are contained in the following paragraphs 
  of the complaint.  Paragraph 6 states: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Plaintiffs informed Defendant’s agent at the office of O’Neill’s Realty, 
      Inc. in Sarasota County, Florida that they were interested in purchasing 
      [Lot 1] for the construction of a model home to be used in Plaintiffs’ construction 
      business.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Paragraph 
  10 of the Complaint goes on to state that the Ontario defendants fraudulently 
  “changed the lot number on the contract to Lot 2 without informing the Plaintiffs.”  
  Paragraph 16 of the Complaint indicates that the defendants’ failure to advise 
  the plaintiffs of the change, “induced them to deliver” to the defendants a 
  cheque in the amount of $7,877.39.  Paragraph 17 then states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As a result of Defendants’ wilfully false and fraudulent misrepresentation 
      that they owned Lot 1 and would be conveying title to Lot 1 to the Plaintiffs, 
      Plaintiffs have not only been damaged to the extent of the purchase price 
      but have also been damaged as a result of the expenses incurred in preparing 
      the lot for construction and lost revenue as a result of an inability to 
      construct a model home on the corner lot.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  Florida jury trial with respect to the assessment of damages took place on December 
  11, 1991.  The Ontario defendants did not attend nor file any material for that 
  hearing.  Under the Florida rules of procedure, either the plaintiff or the 
  defendant may order a transcript prior to the hearing.  The Florida plaintiffs’ 
  attorney did not order a transcript and did not advise the Ontario defendants, 
  when they served them, that unless they ordered a transcript there would not 
  be one.  There is no transcript of the proceedings.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  appears from the record sheet that the trial lasted about an hour and included 
  the testimony of the Florida plaintiffs and an expert witness on business losses.  
  The name of this expert witness was not given to the defendants as was required 
  by the Florida rules of practice.  Had the fact that an expert witness would 
  be called with respect to future loss of profit, and the name of the witness 
  been provided to the Ontario defendants in accordance with the Florida rules 
  they may have been alerted to the nature and extent of the damages being claimed.

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  jury’s award was $210,000 U.S. plus punitive damages in the amount of $50,000.  
  The costs of purchasing Lot 2 and preparing Lot 1, the wrong lot, for building 
  come to approximately $13,000 in total.  Doherty J.A. states there is no evidence 
  as to the factual material placed before the jury in support of the lost profit 
  claim.  He concludes that, without any evidence of what material was before 
  the jury, he cannot come to the conclusion that the Florida plaintiffs misled 
  the jury or that the award was determined in a manner that offends principles 
  of natural justice.  I disagree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There 
  is evidence as to some of the material at the damages hearing.  Documentary 
  evidence was filed regarding the Florida plaintiffs’ cost of purchasing Lot 
  2 and the costs in preparing Lot 1, the wrong lot, for building.  Apart from 
  the purchase price of Lot 2, all bills were paid by cheques from the Florida 
  plaintiffs’ company, Fox Chase Homes.  In addition, documentation relating to 
  the cost of building another house on Regina Crescent in the same Charlotte 
  subdivision was filed.  Mr. Beals testified at the damages hearing.  It is a 
  reasonable inference that Mr. Beals testimony was in accordance with his earlier 
  deposition.  In his deposition, Mr. Beals stated that the profit derived from 
  building this other house was $10,000. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Although 
  the judge’s instructions to the jury are unknown, the memorandum of lost profit 
  respecting damages was filed.  At the trial before Jennings J., the Florida 
  plaintiffs’ attorney, Mr. Groener, testified that this memorandum was given 
  to the Florida judge at the damages assessment hearing in support of his request 
  for instructions to be given to the jury in assessing damages.  The memorandum 
  states in part that, “A business can recover loss (of) prospective profits regardless 
  of whether it is established or has any ‘track record’.”  Loss of revenue from 
  the inability to build a home and rent it to one’s company is one thing – the 
  implication is that damages relate to that house – loss of future profit by 
  one’s company from the inability to build an undefined number of homes is another.  
  While it can certainly be argued that the damages flow through the corporate 
  veil, knowledge that these damages are being claimed is required.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  claim by the Florida plaintiffs gave no indication that they would be seeking 
  damages for the loss of opportunity to build and sell an undefined number of 
  model homes.  The evidence before Jennings J., the exhibits respecting the construction 
  of the house on Regina Crescent, the lost profit memorandum, and the size of 
  the award indicate that this is what happened.  The vast majority of the damages 
  awarded by the jury related to lost profit for loss of opportunity to build 
  an undefined number of homes. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  Ontario defendants were at fault for not defending the action in Florida when 
  they could have done so on the many occasions they were given notice as is so 
  clearly set out by Doherty J.A.  The cumulative effect of the actions of the 
  Florida plaintiffs and their attorney, however, deprived the Ontario defendants 
  of notice of the claim for lost profit for the loss of the Florida plaintiffs’ 
  opportunity to build an undefined number of homes in the same subdivision.  
  Their actions also led to the jury to assess damages beyond the pleading.  The 
  actions of the Florida plaintiffs and their attorney amounted to a denial of 
  natural justice with respect to the bulk of the damages.</p>
<p class=MsoBodyText style='line-height:

  to appeal or to set aside the judgment prevent them from setting up the defence 
  of natural justice in the circumstances?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>The Ontario defendants were aware of the fact that the pleadings 
  did not state the amount claimed at the outset of the action.  The omission 
  was apparent on the face of the pleading.  However, because the pleading is 
  valid in Florida, they could not look to the Florida courts for a remedy.  The 
  only way in which the Ontario defendants could perhaps have ascertained the 
  amount in issue would have been if they had chosen to proceed with discovery 
  or if they had attended at the damages assessment.  Having to incur the costs 
  of a discovery or trial before being able to make an informed decision as to 
  whether and to what extent to defend an action is an infringement of the right 
  to make an informed choice as to whether or not to defend.  The Ontario defendants 
  did, however, defend the action.  While they were probably not aware that the 
  effect of not responding to each amendment of the Complaint meant that their 
  defence would not be considered, they were given notice of the application for 
  default judgment.  After judgment for liability was granted, they were served 
  with the default judgment and a notice of the damages hearing.  By not attending 
  the damages hearing, they deprived themselves of information as to what occurred 
  before the Florida jury.  Following the assessment of damages hearing, they 
  were served with the final judgment for damages.  They knew the amount of the 
  award against them.  Under Florida rules, the Ontario defendants had ten days 
  within which to appeal, and up to one year to bring a motion to set aside the 
  default judgment.  They did nothing.<b> </b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  deciding whether the fact the Ontario defendants took no steps to set aside 
  the judgment should prevent them from setting up the defence of natural justice 
  here, one consideration is the likelihood of success had steps been taken in 
  Florida.  If the Ontario defendants would likely have succeeded before the foreign 
  court, they will have suffered prejudice from the denial of natural justice.  
  The reasons why no steps were taken before the foreign court must also be considered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  proceeding in Florida was a bifurcated one.  First, there was a finding of liability.  
  Mr. Muloch, the experienced Florida litigator and practitioner, testified that 
  an appeal could have been taken on the basis that the Florida plaintiffs’ allegations 
  of the elements of fraud in the claim were insufficient but he did not think 
  that the Ontario residents would have succeeded on that basis.  He thought, 
  however, that had the Ontario residents brought a motion before the trial judge 
  to set aside the judgment they likely would have succeeded.  The Florida plaintiffs 
  were only entitled to judgment against the Ontario defendants if the plaintiffs 
  relied on the representation that the Ontario residents owned Lot 1.  Mr. Muloch 
  testified that the claim of reliance made by the Florida plaintiffs was “a very 
  weak and curious one.” At trial, Jennings J., found that the plaintiffs were 
  given closing documents referring to Lot&nbsp;2.  The deed and statement of 
  adjustments on the closing of the sale of the land, which were filed as exhibits, 
  all referred to Lot 2, which the Ontario defendants owned, not Lot&nbsp;1.  
  Furthermore, as explained by Mr. Muloch, ownership of land in Florida is a matter 
  of public record and purchasers or their agents determine title based on those 
  records, not on the representations by the defendants that they own the land.  
  His opinion, which the trial judge accepted, was that the Ontario defendants 
  had a good defence to the action for damages on the merits.<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>1</span></a>  The Ontario 
  defendants would likely have succeeded if they had moved to set aside the default 
  judgment for liability. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [151]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Secondly, 
  there was an assessment of damages.  If, having regard to the size of the award, 
  the Ontario defendants had decided to appeal, any appeal would have been on 
  the record.  As there was no transcript, the right of appeal was rather illusory.  
  They could, however, have moved to set aside the judgment in Florida. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When 
  served with the judgment for damages, the Saldanhas acted diligently in seeking 
  legal advice in Ontario as to whether the judgment was enforceable against them 
  here.  They were told that the judgment was not enforceable in Ontario.  This 
  advice was given subsequent to the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Morguard</i>.  
  The failure of the Ontario defendants to move to set aside the Florida judgment 
  for damages must be assessed from the point of view of the person who has to 
  bear the consequences.  Generally, a party will not be penalized for the fault 
  of counsel: <i>Pont Viau (Cité) v. Gauthier Mfg. Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1978] 2 S.C.R. 
  516.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Another 
  reason the Ontario defendants did not move to set aside the judgment for damages 
  is that, apart from the size of the award, they had no reason to expect that 
  damages had been assessed beyond the pleading.  The Ontario defendants’ ability 
  to move to set aside this vital part of the proceedings was tied to their lack 
  of knowledge of the circumstances of what took place at the hearing to assess 
  the damages.  (This was also the case in <i>Adams</i>,<i> supra.</i>)<i>  </i>It 
  was only when the plaintiffs tried to enforce the judgment in Ontario that the 
  defendants found out the circumstances of the damage assessment.  By then it 
  was too late to move to set aside the judgment in Florida.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Having 
  regard to the stage of the proceedings when the Ontario defendants were in a 
  position to appreciate the extent of their jeopardy, the likelihood of success 
  had they moved before the Florida courts for a remedy and the cumulative effect 
  of the reasons why they did not move before the Florida courts, I would allow 
  the Ontario defendants to raise the defence of denial of natural justice although 
  it was not raised before the Florida court.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  would be inappropriate to enforce this foreign judgment because the vast majority

  </span>Doherty J.A. allows the appeal of the Florida plaintiffs respecting the 
  trial judge’s finding that they committed a fraud on the Ontario defendants 
  at the Florida hearing to assess damages for two reasons.  The first reason 
  is based on a policy decision he makes concerning the manner in which <i>Jacobs 
  v. Beaver</i> (1908), 17 O.L.R. 496 (C.A.), should be interpreted.  The second 
  is that the trial judge’s finding that the Florida jury was misled is unreasonable 
  and cannot stand.  I disagree with both these reasons.<i></i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>i) Policy Reasons for Denying Enforcement of the Foreign 
  Judgment</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In<i> 
  Jacobs v. Beaver</i>,<i> </i>the Ontario defendants defended the action brought 
  against them in the “foreign” province of Québec and lost.  They then sought 
  to resist enforcement of the judgment in Ontario on the basis of fraud.  Garrow 
  J.A. stated at p. 506 that fraud cannot be raised after trial, “except upon 
  … proof of new and material facts or newly discovered and material facts…”.  
  Garrow J.A.’s reference to “new and material facts” refers to facts that did 
  not exist at the time of trial.  “Newly discovered and material facts” refers 
  to facts that were available at the time of trial but were only discovered after 
  the trial.  In <i>International Corona Resources Ltd. v. LAC Minerals Ltd.</i> 
  (1988), 66 O.R. (2d) 610 (H.C.J.), the defendants also sought to raise the issue 
  of fraud after there had been a fully defended trial of the action.  In <i>Whitehall 
  Development Corp. Ltd. v. Walker et al. </i>(1977), 15 O.R. (2d) 130 (H.C.) 
  appeal dismissed at (1977), 17 O.R. (2d) 241 (C.A.), the defendant sought to 
  set aside a summary judgment that had been obtained against him following cross-examination 
  on his affidavit of merits.  The rule proposed by Doherty J.A. with respect 
  to foreign judgments is the same as that for locally obtained judgments <i>where 
  the defendant has defended the action</i>.  In effect the policy is that the 
  lack of due diligence by the defendants in ascertaining the relevant facts is 
  blameworthy conduct which is penalized by refusing to allow the defendants to 
  raise these facts as their defence after judgment has been obtained.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [158]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  policy rule articulated by Doherty J.A. has no application to a local judgment 
  obtained by default.  The basis for moving to set aside a locally obtained default 
  judgment is contained in Rule 19.08.  This rule provides that a default judgment, 
  “may be set aside or varied by the court on such terms as are just.” There is 
  no time limit for moving to set aside a default judgment in Ontario.  Under 
  rule 19.08 the court exercises a broad discretion.  The factors to be considered 
  in deciding whether to set aside a judgment obtained by default are not, however, 
  rigid rules:  <i>Chitel v. Rothbart </i>(1988), 29 C.P.C. (2d) 136 (Ont. C.A.); 
  leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1989), 98 N.R. 132, 34 O.A.C. 399a.  When 
  moving to set aside a default judgment, one of the factors the court will consider 
  is the defendants’ explanation as to why they did not initially defend the action.  
  The test is not whether the defendants’ failure to contest the proceedings was 
  purposeful but whether it was blameworthy:  <i>Anderson v. Toronto-Dominion 
  Bank </i>(1986), 9 C.P.C. (2d) 179 (B.C.C.A.).  If the decision not to defend 
  was not blameworthy and the court is satisfied that the defendants’ have a valid 
  explanation for any delay in moving to set aside the default judgment, the court 
  will consider whether the defendants have a good defence to the action on the 
  merits.  Any prejudice to the plaintiffs in allowing the defendants to defend 
  the action that cannot be compensated for by costs will also be considered.  
  After balancing the competing interests of the plaintiffs and the defendants 
  the court will exercise its discretion as to whether or not to set aside the 
  default judgment and allow the defendants to defend the action. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  problem that arises in this case is whether to apply the local policy rule pertaining 
  to actions that have been defended to a foreign judgment that was obtained by 
  default.  If the decision not to defend was not blameworthy and the defendants 
  have no remedy in the foreign jurisdiction then it seems to me that they should 
  not automatically be precluded from defending the action here on the basis of 
  the “newly discovered facts” relating to fraud.  The policy of treating Ontario 
  defendants the same whether the judgment is a local judgment or a foreign judgment  
  has a disparate effect on the Ontario defendants because they do not have the 
  local remedy of moving to set aside the judgment obtained by default.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  could be argued that inasmuch as the Ontario defendants had a hearing on the 
  issue of damages, and the fraud raised by the Ontario defendants relates to 
  those damages, the policy respecting fraud in relation to a local judgment after 
  trial should apply.  This argument ignores two considerations.  The first is 
  the fact that the if the original decision not to defend was not blameworthy, 
  the hearing respecting damages was but the continuation of that decision.  Secondly, 
  the fraud is alleged to have been committed at the damages hearing itself.  
  While the Ontario defendants may have been able to discover the facts prior 
  to the damages hearing they would not have known the use that the Florida plaintiffs 
  would make of those facts until the damages hearing.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  position adopted by Doherty J.A. imputes constructive knowledge to a defendant 
  of information that existed prior to trial but that was misused at a trial in 
  a foreign jurisdiction where no transcript of the proceedings is available.

  law is deemed to be the same as local law unless the foreign law is specifically 
  proved:  <i>Canadian Fire Insurance Co. v. Robinson </i>(1901), 31 S.C.R. 488; 
  J&#8209;G. Castel, <i>Canadian Conflict of Laws </i>4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Toronto, 
  Butterworths, 1997) at 161-62.  Apart from certain procedural aspects, the law 
  of Florida was not specifically proved.  Jennings J. was therefore entitled 
  to consider the law relating to the assessment of damages as being the same 
  as Ontario law.  On an assessment of damages in Ontario, a judge is not entitled 
  to enter into an inquiry of the facts underpinning the action that a defendant 
  is deemed to admit by default:  <i>Umlauf v. Umlauf</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 1054 
  at para. 13 (Ont. C.A.) (QL).  However, although facts going to liability are 
  deemed to be true, the facts going to damages must be proven:  <i>Umlauf</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, at para. 9 (adopting <i>Family Trust Corporation v. Harrison</i> 
  (1986), 7 C.P.C. (2d) 1 at 6 (Ont. Dist. Ct.)).<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>2</span></a>  A plaintiff claiming unliquidated damages 
  must present evidence of a causal nexus between the breach and the claimant’s 
  alleged damages.  If the admitted facts do not establish a causal nexus to the 
  damages claimed, the plaintiff will not be entitled to judgment for damages.  
  With this background in mind I will now address the five findings by the trial 
  judge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [166]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> First, 
  the trial judge found that any claim for lost profits belonged to Fox Chase 
  Homes because Fox Chase would have built the homes.  Doherty J.A. states the 
  trial judge was not entitled to decide whether the Beals and Foodys could recover 
  lost profits suffered by their corporation because the evidence does not permit 
  any conclusion as to the applicable Florida law.  The trial judge was entitled 
  to assume that Florida law was the same as Ontario’s in the absence of proof 
  respecting the applicable Florida law. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [167]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second, 
  the trial judge found that construction on the model home ceased before the 
  Florida plaintiffs learned that they were building on the wrong lot and ceased 
  because they had a “falling out” when Mr. Foody decided to pursue other employment.  
  The trial judge found in effect that the causal nexus to damages had not been 
  proven.  The following question and answer read in from Mr. Beals discovery 
  indicates that the reason he stopped building was not because he learned he 
  was building on the wrong lot but because Mr. Foody left and he decided not 
  to carry on alone.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Q. All right. And so when Mr. Foody, who was related to you by —</p>
    <p>A. Marriage.</p>
    <p>Q. Marriage, took the job at Honeywell, you decided that you weren’t going 
      to pursue this venture in Charlotte County?</p>
    <p>A. Yes.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [168]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At 
  another point in his discovery, Mr. Beals indicated that Mr. Foody left in the 
  fall of 1984 to work for a large company.  But it was in January of 1985 that 
  Mr. Beals discovered he was building on the wrong lot.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [169]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Four 
  days prior to the commencement of the trial before Jennings J., in 1997, counsel 
  for Mr. Beals sent a letter “correcting” his client’s evidence.  That letter 
  stated that Mr. Foody started working in late April 1985 as a salesperson for 
  a large company and not in the fall of 1984.  The deposition by Mr. Beals at 
  the time of the Florida action in 1985 was filed at the trial of the Ontario 
  action.  It was evidence under oath that Jennings&nbsp;J. could consider with 
  respect to the credibility of Mr. Beals regarding the 1997 version of events.  
  The deposition was consistent with the uncorrected earlier evidence given by 
  Mr. Beals and it was open to Jennings J. to accept the original version of Mr.&nbsp;Beals 
  evidence read in on discovery.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [170]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Doherty 
  J.A. is of the opinion that there is no evidence “that the jury was misled as 
  to the existence of the company, its status at the time of trial, its connection 
  to the transaction, its connection to the Beals and Foodys or the entitlement 
  of the Beals and Foodys to damages based on anticipated lost profits.”  The 
  fact that the company is not mentioned in the pleadings and that the pleadings 
  make no mention of damages for lost profits by the company is a consideration.  
  While the exhibits filed at trial identified the company as the payor of certain 
  expenses, those expenses did not all relate to the lot in issue here.  Many 
  of the expenses, such as for air conditioning, appliances, etc., related to 
  another house built by Fox Chase Homes in the same subdivision on Regina Drive.  
  Those documents would have been irrelevant unless a claim for proof of damages 
  for anticipated lost profits by Fox Chase Homes was being advanced. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [171]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Furthermore, 
  the record of exhibits filed does not show that any certificate of dissolution 
  of the company was filed.  The memorandum of lost profit submitted by Mr.&nbsp;Groener 
  in support of his request as to how the jury should be instructed would be irrelevant 
  if a claim for future loss of profit by the company was not being advanced.  
  The memorandum states the prior experience of a party seeking lost profits may 
  aid in proving the likelihood of <i>achieving profits in the newer venture</i>; 
  the parties do not have to contemplate the precise injuries so long as they 
  could reasonably have been expected to flow from the breach; when there is evidence 
  of lost profits but the amount cannot be precisely and mathematically determined, 
  the trier of fact can determine the amount; and a business can recover <i>lost 
  prospective profits</i> <i>regardless of whether it is established or has a 
  track record</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Mr. 
  Beals was an experienced builder in another part of Florida.  Fox Chase Homes 
  was a relatively new company he formed with Mr. Foody in order to build homes 
  in Charlotte County.  Irrespective of whether the corporate veil can be pierced, 
  the tenor of the memorandum indicates that a claim for future loss of profit 
  was being advanced. The very fact that some $200,000 U.S. was awarded for loss 
  of profit, when Mr. Beals admitted on discovery he ceased building because his 
  partner took a job with another company and he decided not to carry on the business 
  alone, speaks for itself.  There was evidence that the Florida jury was not 
  told Mr. Beals decided to discontinue business because Mr. Foody left the company 
  and he decided not to carry on the business alone.  This omission led the jury 
  into error in assessing the damages and was a fraud on the jury.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [173]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  other three findings of the trial judge are: 1) that the factual allegations 
  in the complaint make out a case for recission of the contract but were not 
  sufficient to establish fraud on the part of the Ontario defendants; 2) that 
  there could be no justifiable reliance on the representations made by the Ontario 
  defendants as to ownership of the lot since ownership was a matter of readily 
  accessible public record; and 3) that the offer attached to the complaint did 
  not show the amendment to Lot 2.  These three findings all go to the issue of 
  liability.  It was not open to Jennings J., on the issue of damages, to make 
  these findings.  They underpin the default judgment that was entered.  The last 
  three findings of Jennings J. are not, however, an essential component to his 
  findings on the question of whether the Florida plaintiffs committed a fraud 
  on the Ontario defendants in relation to damages by withholding information.  
  I would uphold the conclusion of Jennings J. in this regard.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [174]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  my opinion, the Ontario defendants should be allowed to raise the defence of 
  fraud in respect of the damages as a defence to the enforcement of the Florida 
  judgment.  It was open to Jennings J. to come to the conclusion that the Florida 
  plaintiffs had committed a fraud on the Ontario defendants with respect to damages 
  and that consequently the Florida judgment is not enforceable.</p>
