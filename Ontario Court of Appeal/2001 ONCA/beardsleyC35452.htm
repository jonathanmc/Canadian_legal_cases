  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant appeals from an order of Lalonde 
  J. dated October 23, 2000 striking out a statement of claim.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant issued a statement of claim on 
  July 13, 1999 claiming damages against the Crown in right of Ontario, and two 
  Ontario Provincial Police constables, for false arrest, false imprisonment, 
  malicious prosecution, negligence and breach of his Charter rights; and against 
  those same defendants and his ex-wife, for conspiracy. He alleges that these 
  torts were committed when he was investigated, arrested, and prosecuted for 
  charges that included breaking and entering his ex-wife’s home, possession of 
  stolen property, and criminal harassment. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>All of the charges were withdrawn on April 6, 
  1999 after the appellant entered into a common law peace bond prohibiting him 
  from initiating contact or association with his ex-wife for a period of one 
  year.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On a motion brought pursuant to rule 21.01 (1) 
  (a) and (b) of the rules of Civil Procedure, the motions judge held that the 
  claims against the Crown and the police officers are void, having been instituted 
  without the appropriate notice under s. 7(1) of the <i>Proceedings Against the 
  Crown Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P-27; and that the six-month limitation period 
  under s. 7(1) of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. P-38 is a bar to the appellant’s claims against the O.P.P. officers for false 
  imprisonment, false arrest, and negligence. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The motions judge also determined that entering 
  the peace bond precluded satisfaction of two of the requirements for successful 
  prosecution of a malicious prosecution claim, first, that the proceedings were 
  instituted without reasonable cause, and second, that they were terminated in 
  his favour; and that it precluded the existence of a cause of action for breach 
  of Charter rights. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Finally, the motions judge held that the conspiracy 
  claim as pleaded disclosed no reasonable cause of action.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant raises several issues on appeal. 
  <b></b></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-GB>Did the 
  motions judge err in finding proceedings void for lack of notice under s. 7(1) 
  of the <i>Proceedings Against the Crown Act?</i></span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The statement of claim was silent on the issue 
  of whether notice had been given in compliance with s. 7(1) of the <i>Proceedings 
  Against the Crown Act.</i> The motions judge permitted the respondents to rely 
  on a formal notice letter sent by appellant’s counsel on July 14, 1999, after 
  the statement of claim was issued, to assert that s. 7(1) had not been complied 
  with, and that the claims against the Crown and the police officers were therefore 
  a nullity. The motions judge relied on <i>Montreal Trust Co. of Canada v. Toronto-Dominion 
  Bank</i>, (1992), 40 C.P.C. (3d) 389 (Ont. Ct.(Gen. Div.) as authority for the 
  proposition that the letter did not constitute evidence within the meaning of 
  the prohibition contained in rule 21.01(2) against adducing evidence on a rule 
  21.01(1)(b) motion.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We agree that the motions judge erred in ruling 
  that admission of the July 14, 1999 letter would not contravene the rule 21.01(2) 
  prohibition against adducing evidence. The letter was not referred to in the 
  statement of claim. Its contents could not therefore be viewed as an integral 
  component of that pleading. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Nevertheless, in our view, evidence of the notice 
  was properly admissible pursuant to the discretion contained in rule 21.01(2) 
  to permit evidence on a motion under rule 21.01(1)(a). Proper notice is a necessary 
  pre-condition to the right to sue the Crown. It would defeat the interests of 
  justice to restrict a defendant’s right to adduce evidence that proper notice 
  was not given. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant relies on the July 14, 1999 letter, 
  as well as a letter of complaint against the individual police officers sent 
  by his counsel soon after the charges were withdrawn, to assert that proper 
  notice was given. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We reject these submissions. None of the authorities 
  relied on by the appellant establish that the period of 60 days notice “before 
  the commencement of the action” set out in s. 7(1) can be abridged in any way. 
  The notice period must run <i>before the action is commenced</i>. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This court’s determination in <i>Mattick v. Ontario (Minister 
  of Health)</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> 
  that a potential claimant against the Crown need not expressly state in any 
  notice that he “intends to take legal action to recover damages or other relief” 
  does not mean that every letter of complaint delivered to a provincial agency 
  will fulfil the notice requirements under s. 7(1) of the <i>Proceedings Against 
  the Crown Act</i>. Rather, at page 228 this court explicitly stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Not every complaint to the Province must be treated as a s. 7(1) notice. 
      The complaint must be such that, in the circumstances, it could reasonably 
      be anticipated by the Crown that if not resolved, litigation could result.<a

  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The <i>Police Services Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, 
  c. P-15 provides a mechanism for citizens to file complaints against police 
  officers. However, its focus is on discipline of police officers rather than 
  providing remedies to aggrieved citizens. Accordingly, as a general matter, 
  a letter of complaint against a police officer should not be taken as notice 
  of a possible civil claim.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>Here, the existence of the earlier complaint against 
  the officers was not apparently before the motions judge. The actual letter 
  of complaint is not before us. Without determining whether a complaint against 
  a police officer could ever constitute compliance with s. 7(1) of the <i>Proceedings 
  Against the Crown Act</i> absent an express reference to the possibility of 
  litigation, we are not satisfied the motions judge erred in finding there had 
  been no sufficient notice in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The respondents do not contest the appellant’s 
  submission that the notice requirements of the <i>Proceedings Against the Crown 
  Act</i> do not extend to individual defendants. We agree. The motions judge’s 
  finding on this basis that the claims against the police officer defendants 
  are a nullity is accordingly set aside.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant’s contention that s. 7(1) does 
  not extend to claims for vicarious liability has no merit. S. 7(1) is clear 
  in requiring that “<i>no action </i>for a claim shall be commenced against the 
  Crown” [emphasis added] unless the appropriate notice is given. It is necessary 
  to name the Crown as a defendant to maintain an action for vicarious liability, 
  and the appellant’s claim on this ground fails. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-GB>Did the 
  motions judge err in finding the appellant is barred from proceeding with his 
  claims for false imprisonment, false arrest, and negligence because the six-month 
  limitation period had expired? </span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant pleaded that he was arrested on 
  July 28, 1998, and September 9, 1998, and held in custody immediately following 
  both arrests. He asserted, as an alternative pleading, that the police officers 
  actions were “such as to place them outside the scope and authority of their 
  duties as OPP Provincial Constables”. He also asserted that they prosecuted 
  him when they knew he had not committed a criminal offence, and that they participated 
  in the prosecution maliciously, with an intent to harm him, motivated by a sexual 
  relationship with his ex-wife in the case of one officer, and by a desire to 
  cover-up that relationship and protect his brother officer on the part of the 
  other officer. The appellant further alleged that the officers were negligent 
  in their investigation.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant concedes that causes of action 
  for false arrest and false imprisonment accrue as of the date of arrest or imprisonment 
  based on <i>Nicely v. Waterloo Regional Police Force</i> (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) 
  612 (Div. Ct.), but questions the policy rationale for this rule. We reject 
  his contention that we could somehow abrogate a standard rule pertaining to 
  accrual of those causes of action based on his hypothetical assertion that the 
  rule may give police officers, who have wrongfully arrested or detained an individual, 
  an incentive to persist in a wrongful prosecution.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In our view, however, the trial judge erred 
  in dealing with the motion to strike portions of the statement of claim based 
  on the expiry of a limitation period, prior to delivery of a statement of defence, 
  and prior to the appellant having an opportunity to reply.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motion to strike based on the expiry of a limitation period 
  could only be made pursuant to Rule 21.01(1)(a), which provides that a party 
  may move for the determination of a question of law “<i>raised by a pleading</i>”. 
  The expiry of a limitation period does not render a cause of action a nullity; 
  rather, it is a defence and must be pleaded. Although we agree that it would 
  be unduly technical to require delivery of a statement of defence in circumstances 
  where it is plain and obvious from a review of a statement of claim that no 
  additional facts could be asserted that would alter the conclusion that a limitation 
  period had expired<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a>, a plain reading of the rule requires 
  that the limitation period be pleaded in all other cases. See <i>Pollakis v. 
  Corner</i> (1975), 9 O.R. (2d) 691 (H.C.J.). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Plaintiffs would be deprived of the opportunity 
  to place a complete factual context before the court if limitation defences 
  were determined, on a routine basis, without being pleaded. Adherence to rules 
  that ensure procedural fairness is an integral component of an appearance of 
  justice. The appearance of justice takes on an even greater significance where 
  claims are made against those who administer the law. The limitation defence 
  to the claims for false arrest, false imprisonment, and negligence should not 
  therefore be determined, without being pleaded, and the pleadings being completed. 
  That portion of the order that dismisses the claims for false arrest, false 
  imprisonment, and negligence will accordingly be set aside.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In this case, we agree that the appellant’s 
  pleadings are sparse and vague, and we also agree that allegations he relies 
  on to justify these claims are in some instances, set out only in relation to 
  other torts. Nevertheless, this court’s decision in <i>Vaillancourt v. Watson</i> 
  (1994), 111 D.L.R. (4<sup>TH</sup>) 729 makes it clear that although allegations 
  such as malice or acting for an improper purpose, standing alone, would be insufficient 
  to deprive officers otherwise apparently acting within the scope of their duty 
  of the protection afforded by s. 7(1) of the <i>Public Authorities Protection 
  Act,</i> situations may exist where the protection will not apply to egregious 
  conduct by police. If necessary, the question of whether the bald pleading of 
  malice in the claim is enough to escape the limitation period in s. 7(1) can 
  be decided once the pleadings are complete.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-GB>Did the 
  motions judge err in striking the appellant’s claims for malicious prosecution 
  and for breach of his Charter rights?</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>As with the July 14, 1999 letter we agree that 
  the peace bond transcript was inadmissible on a rule 21.01(b) motion, however, 
  the motion was also made pursuant to rule 21.01(1)(a). Again, it would defeat 
  the interests of justice not to admit the transcript for the purpose of a motion 
  under that rule. The transcript provides an essential factual context, which 
  was omitted from the statement of claim, concerning the withdrawal of the criminal 
  charges.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant’s assertions that his comments 
  on entering the peace bond should colour its significance are without merit. 
  The order for a peace bond reflects a finding by the court that there was a 
  basis for apprehending that the appellant would commit a breach of the peace: 
  <i>R. v. White</i>, [1969] 1 C.C.C. 19 (B.C.S.C.). The appellant is not entitled 
  to challenge the validity of that finding, except by means of an appeal. Hence 
  this ground of appeal fails.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-GB>Did the 
  motions judge err in striking the appellant’s claim for conspiracy?</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The motions judge concluded that the appellant 
  failed to plead whatever agreement he says existed, the relationship between 
  the alleged conspirators, and any overt acts performed in furtherance of the 
  conspiracy. We can see no error in these findings. We would not interfere with 
  the motions judge’s exercise of discretion in determining the appropriate remedy.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>For the reasons given, the appeal is allowed in 
  part, and the order striking the statement of claim and dismissing the action 
  against all defendants is set aside with respect to the claims for false arrest, 
  false imprisonment, and negligence against the police officer defendants. This 
  order is without prejudice to any further motions which may be made, either 
  to strike, or for dismissal, once the pleadings are complete.</p>
