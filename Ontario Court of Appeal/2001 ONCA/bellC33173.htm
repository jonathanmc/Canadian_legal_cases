  </span> The appellant, Donald Bailey, and the respondent,  Paulette Bell, lived 
  together from March 1989 until September 1997.  After their separation, Ms. 
  Bell commenced an action against Mr. Bailey for compensation for unjust enrichment 
  and for spousal support.  The trial judge, Zelinski J., concluded that Ms. Bell 
  was entitled to a 45 per cent constructive trust interest in two of Mr. Bailey’s 
  assets, and converted that trust interest into a monetary award of $46,300 as 
  compensation for unjust enrichment.  He also held that Ms. Bell was entitled 
  to spousal support of $600 a month for 48 months.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Bailey appeals from that order.  There are three issues on his appeal.  
  First, is Ms. Bell entitled to spousal support under the <i>Family Law Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c.F.3?  Second, was the trial judge correct in finding that Mr. 
  Bailey had been unjustly enriched by the services and monetary contributions 
  of Ms. Bell during their co-habitation?  And third, if so, what is the appropriate 
  monetary remedy?</p>
<p class=headingsubtitle> <span

line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge ordered Mr. Bailey to pay support of $600 a month for 
  48 months.  Mr. Bailey submits that Ms. Bell is not entitled to support.  He 
  contends that she could obtain more remunerative employment, and that if she 
  did, she would be self-sufficient.  If Ms. Bell is entitled to support, he accepts 
  that the time limited $600 a month support order is reasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my opinion, the trial judge considered the appropriate factors in 
  finding that Ms. Bell was entitled to support.  In concluding that Ms. Bell 
  was entitled to support, he took into account the circumstances of her relationship 
  with Mr. Bailey, her needs and Mr.&nbsp;Bailey’s ability to pay.  By making 
  a time limited support order (not an issue on this appeal), he took into account 
  the prospect that Ms. Bell would obtain more remunerative employment at least 
  by the end of the 4-year spousal support period.  I see no basis upon which 
  to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that Ms. Bell was entitled to 
  support.  Since Mr. Bailey does not dispute the quantum or the duration of the 
  support order, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  </span> The trial judge concluded that both Ms. Bell and Mr. Bailey were credible 
  witnesses, evidenced by the fact that their testimony was “largely complementary.”  
  However, the evidence of who did what when the parties co-habited is somewhat 
  confusing.  I propose to limit my references to the evidence to its significant 
  features.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Immediately before the parties began to co-habit, Ms. Bell resided in 
  her parents’ basement.  During that time she was unemployed and living on public 
  assistance, and had less than $2,000 in assets.  Between January 1, 1989 and 
  January 1, 1991, Ms. Bell received spousal support from an earlier relationship 
  of $900 per month.  In March 1989, Ms. Bell and her son moved into Mr. Bailey’s 
  house in Thunder Bay.  At that time, Ms. Bell was 43 and Mr. Bailey was 46 years 
  old.  The understanding was that Ms. Bell would contribute about $450 per month 
  to the joint household expenses.  This is what she paid to her parents for rent 
  and utilities before she moved in with Mr. Bailey.  When she and Mr. Bailey 
  separated in 1997, she had assets valued at almost $40,000.  </p>

  </span> Ms. Bell was employed during most of the time she lived with Mr. Bailey.  
  She worked at a senior citizens’ home as a housekeeper until 1992, as a receptionist 
  in a dental office and as a receptionist and payroll clerk for one year.  In 
  1994, she took a 10-month course at Confederation College to upgrade her skills.  
  She worked in a real estate office for six months and in the cafeteria of a 
  forest products company for about two years.  She was also employed as an office 
  manager.  Her income in the years 1989 to 1997 was:</p>

  </span> When the parties began to co-habit, Mr. Bailey was employed at Great-West 
  Timber as a machinist.  He earned about $30,000 a year.  He changed jobs several 
  times during the period of co-habitation.  There is no evidence of his income 
  between 1989 and 1996, although there was some evidence that his income increased 
  after he left his job at Great-West Timber.  His income in September 1997 was 
  approximately $45,000 a year. Mr. Bailey took the position before and during 
  the trial that because he and Ms. Bell were not married, he was not required 
  by the <i>Family Law Act</i> to disclose his financial circumstances.  Instead, 
  he argued that Ms. Bell was required to establish unjust enrichment and the 
  compensation to be paid to her to remedy it.  He thus declined to file financial 
  information setting out the value of his net family property or his income when 
  he and Ms. Bell began to co-habit.   This undoubtedly prolonged the trial, made 
  any pre-trial less useful and made any settlement discussions less productive.</p>

  </span> There was some evidence of the value of Mr. Bailey’s house and his RRSPs 
  at relevant times.  His Thunder Bay property was appraised in 1988 (the year 
  before the parties began to live together) and valued at $78,000.  In 1997, 
  when the parties separated, his property was appraised at $110,000.  In March 
  1989 Mr. Bailey had RRSPs valued at about $49,000.  In September 1997 his RRSPs 
  had a value of about $121,000.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Generally, the parties’ 8-1/2-year co-habitation divides into two periods.  
  In the first period of almost four years, Mr. Bailey took out a $40,000 mortgage 
  on his Thunder Bay house to satisfy a $40,000 lump sum support obligation to 
  his former wife.    He paid the $40,000 lump sum spousal support to his former 
  wife in April 1989, that is shortly after he and Ms. Bell began to live together.  
  He used much of his take-home pay from his job as a machinist in Thunder Bay 
  to pay off his $40,000 mortgage.  During this period, Ms. Bell looked after 
  the day-to-day household expenses such as groceries, common utilities and whatever 
  expenses Mr. Bailey could not pay for, having regard to his other financial 
  commitments.  These commitments included “doubling-up” mortgage payments, which 
  became $400 bi-weekly, and paying off 10 per cent of the principal on mortgage 
  anniversary dates.  Mr. Bailey was able to pay off his $40,000 in three years 
  and 10 months by consistently taking advantage of accelerated prepayment rights 
  contained in the mortgage. The trial judge concluded that Mr. Bailey’s mortgage 
  payments and RRSP contributions permitted him to contribute “very little” to 
  household expenses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Bell presented cheques as evidence that she personally contributed 
  $6,000 to Mr. Bailey’s accelerated mortgage payments.  Mr. Bailey contended 
  that the cheques made out by Ms.&nbsp;Bell did not consist entirely of her money.  
  He submitted at trial that some of the funds came from their joint savings account.  
  He testified that he put funds into this joint account in order to make these 
  extra lump sum mortgage payments.  Ms. Bell testified that she did not know 
  about any such deposits by the appellant.  The trial judge found that Ms.&nbsp;Bell 
  did pay $6,000 from her own funds to assist Mr. Bailey in paying off the mortgage.  
  There is no basis upon which to interfere with that finding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>  Near the end of this first part of the co-habitation period, Ms. Bell 
  began to mistrust Mr. Bailey.  At the end of December 1993, she moved out of 
  their bedroom.  However, they continued to have sexual relations and to work 
  together when it came to household management matters. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After he paid off the house mortgage, with Ms. Bell’s encouragement 
  Mr. Bailey bought a new truck.  He repaid the loan on the truck within 30 months.  
  He then purchased a new boat and motor.  When the parties separated, the truck 
  and boat were valued at $10,000 and $5,000, respectively.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is evidence that in the 1989 to 1993 period Mr. Bailey made some 
  improvements to his Thunder Bay house.  These consisted of painting several 
  rooms, replacing the linoleum flooring in the bathroom and kitchen, refinishing 
  the bathtub, replacing the toilet, sink and vanity, replacing the kitchen countertops 
  and tiles behind the kitchen sink, refinishing the kitchen cupboard doors, installing 
  a new door on the linen cupboard, installing new living room and bedroom carpeting, 
  installing new bi-fold closet doors, painting the basement walls and floor and 
  installing a gas furnace. Ms. Bell assisted in paying for these improvements 
  to Mr. Bailey’s house and property, including the redecoration of several rooms 
  in the house, the installation of the new flooring, and the refurbishment of 
  the bathroom and kitchen.  In addition, Ms. Bell paid for a vanity suite and 
  improvements in the bathroom as well as a new stove, refrigerator and a sectional 
  dining room suite.  Mr. Bailey retained possession of these items after he and 
  Ms. Bell separated.  Ms. Bell produced cheques from her chequing account totalling 
  approximately $800 to represent her financial contribution to these improvements. 
  Other than the living room carpeting and the kitchen cupboard door refinishing, 
  which were done by paid contractors, all of the improvement work was done by 
  Mr. Bailey.  </p>

  </span> Once Mr. Bailey paid off the mortgage on his house, he and Ms. Bell 
  shared household and related expenses.  In this second part of the parties’ 
  co&#8209;habitation, Ms. Bell began to contribute to her own RRSP account.  
  The trial judge referred to the new set-up as a “pattern change”.  He found 
  that Mr. Bailey made a direct contribution of $13,100 to Ms. Bell, most of which 
  went into her RRSP account.  Ms.&nbsp;Bell was able to accumulate some modest 
  savings.  She admitted that after December 1993 she made no further payments 
  by cheque to pay for household expenses.  She said that she continued to pay 
  some of the household grocery expenses.</p>

  Both cooked, cleaned, dusted and did the gardening.  Ms. Bell testified that 
  they worked together “as a team” with respect to cooking, cleaning, gardening 
  and other household chores.  If she was at work, Mr. Bailey would cook or clean.  
  If he was at work, Ms. Bell would contribute.  Ms. Bell assisted in managing 
  the house and looking after the garden.  Mr.&nbsp;Bailey generally did the lawn 
  mowing, snow removal and outside work.  </p>

  has been enriched by the domestic services, sweat labour and direct financial 
  contributions of Ms.&nbsp;Bell … Mr. Bailey has been enriched by the financial 
  contributions of Ms. Bell who was, correspondingly, deprived”.  He found further 
  that there was no juristic reason for the enrichment and that there was a clear 
  causal connection between Ms. Bell’s contributions and identifiable assets in 
  respect of which she claimed a constructive trust.  These assets consisted of 
  Mr. Bailey’s house and his RRSP accounts.  He thus accepted Ms. Bell’s constructive 
  trust claim in respect of Mr. Bailey’s house and his RRSP account.  He rejected 
  Ms. Bell’s claim in respect of Mr. Bailey’s interest in a family cottage property.  
  No appeal is taken from that finding.</p>

  services and monetary contributions giving rise to his unjust enrichment finding, 
  except to the extent that he related the value of her services and contributions 
  to the increase in the value of Mr. Bailey’s Thunder Bay property and his RRSP 
  accounts during the period of co-habitation.  The trial judge recognized that 
  while she lived with Mr. Bailey, Ms. Bell was able to increase her asset base 
  from virtually nothing to almost $40,000.  However, beyond referring to this 
  evidence in the context of Mr. Bailey’s submission that the increase in Ms. 
  Bell’s net worth was cogent evidence that he was not unjustly enriched, the 
  trial judge made no further reference to it.</p>

  to the increase in the value of Mr. Bailey’s house and some of the increase 
  in his RRSPs “… were almost equal to those of Mr. Bailey but less than his contribution”.  
  He concluded that Ms. Bell was entitled to 45 per cent of the increase in the 
  value of Mr. Bailey’s house and an arbitrarily determined part of the increase 
  in the value of his RRSP accounts.  After first finding unjust enrichment and 
  then finding that Ms. Bell was entitled to a constructive trust, the trial judge, 
  relying on <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980, converted Ms. Bell’s 
  constructive trust interest into a monetary award of $46,300.  The breakdown

  that there was no evidence of any “domestic services” or “sweat labour” provided

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my opinion, the trial judge erred in dealing with the unjust enrichment 
  issue in two respects.  First, his broad finding of unjust enrichment over the 
  entire 8-1/2-year co&#8209;habitation period is not supported by the evidence 
  and is therefore unreasonable.  Until about January 1994, Ms. Bell’s direct 
  and indirect contributions assisted Mr. Bailey in paying off his $40,000 mortgage 
  and in purchasing a new truck, boat and motor.  In that period, Ms. Bell’s available 
  resources were committed to running the household and, as stated, helping Mr.&nbsp;Bailey 
  pay off his mortgage debt.  During this first part of her co-habitation with 
  Mr. Bailey, Ms. Bell was required to do more than her share in respect of household 
  management and related expenses.  Thus, I think that there was evidence to support 
  the trial judge’s finding of unjust enrichment, but only in respect of Ms. Bell’s 
  contributions in the first part of the 8-1/2-year co-habitation period.  Second, 
  the trial judge erred in determining the quantum of the monetary award of $46,300.  
  After finding that Ms. Bell’s unjust enrichment claim was established, he granted 
  Ms. Bell a constructive trust interest in two of Mr. Bailey’s assets and then 
  converted that interest into a monetary award.  In proceeding as he did, the 
  trial judge did not directly consider the value of Ms. Bell’s contributions 
  to the family enterprise.  Moreover,  this approach is inconsistent with McLachlin 
  J.’s judgment in <i>Peter v. Beblow, supra</i>. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I have noted, the parties’ circumstances, including their living 
  arrangements, changed at the end of 1993.  Mr. Bailey testified that by the 
  end of 1993 Ms. Bell had begun to mistrust him.  At that point he decided that 
  he “had enough of the relationship”.  Nevertheless, from January 1994 until 
  their separation in September 1997, Mr.&nbsp;Bailey and Ms. Bell continued to 
  work together in Mr. Bailey’s Thunder Bay home.  They cooked, cleaned, gardened 
  and travelled together.  As I have said, Ms. Bell observed in her evidence that 
  she and Mr.&nbsp;Bailey “worked together as a team”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, there is nothing in the evidence which supports the finding 
  that in the second part of their co&#8209;habitation Mr. Bailey was unjustly 
  enriched to Ms.&nbsp;Bell’s detriment.  Rather, their contributions in their 
  somewhat fractured relationship were proportional.  From January 1994 until 
  September 1997, when they separated, neither party was unjustly enriched by 
  the contributions of the other.  In that period, Ms. Bell admitted that she 
  made no further payments by cheque for household related expenses.  Nor did 
  she contribute to Mr. Bailey’s mortgage payments.  She said that she continued 
  to pay for some of the household groceries by cash.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Bell’s date of separation asset base was almost entirely accumulated 
  during the time she lived with Mr. Bailey.  The trial judge recognized that 
  somehow Ms. Bell was able to accumulate this “pool of assets”.  However, as 
  I have said, he did not do more than refer to it as a fact in his reference 
  to Mr. Bailey’ position at trial:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In part, Ms. Bell’s ability to increase her own assets to almost $40,000 
      was a consequence of Mr. Bailey’s contributions to her, direct and indirect.  
      Mr. Bailey does not argue that Ms.&nbsp;Bell, herself, has been unjustly 
      enriched but rather takes the position that contributions to her are in 
      the nature of compensation for her contributions to himself (sic) with the 
      result that no further liability exists.</p>

  </span> The trial judge found that Mr. Bailey made direct payments totalling 
  $13,100 to Ms. Bell.  He credited the $13,100 against Mr. Bailey’s obligation 
  to compensate Ms.&nbsp;Bell consequent upon his finding of unjust enrichment.  
  He made no further comment beyond that set out above about the fact that in 
  the co-habitation period the value of Ms. Bell’s assets increased from less 
  than $2,000 to almost $40,000.</p>

  </span> The trial judge’s broad finding of unjust enrichment extended beyond 
  the first part of the parties’ co-habitation.  Therefore, some adjustment has 
  to be made to the quantum of the monetary award which, as I have noted, was 
  based on the increase in the value of two of Mr. Bailey’s assets in the entire 
  period of co-habitation.  First, I will address the manner in which the trial 
  judge established the compensation to which Ms.&nbsp;Bell was entitled as a 
  remedy for unjust enrichment.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> Stated broadly, in reaching the conclusion that Ms. Bell was entitled 
  to a 45 per cent constructive trust interest in the increase in the value of 
  Mr. Bailey’s Thunder Bay property and in part of his RRSP accounts, I do not 
  think that the trial judge properly applied <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. Bell’s claim, properly construed, was based on unjust enrichment.  
  Constructive trust and its substitute, a monetary award, are alternative remedies 
  for unjust enrichment, not causes of action <i>per se</i>.  Unjust enrichment 
  requires a finding that Mr.&nbsp;Bailey was enriched to Ms. Bell’s detriment 
  and that there was no juristic reason for the enrichment.  As I have said, in 
  the first part of the parties’ co-habitation there was evidence to support the 
  trial judge’s unjust enrichment conclusion.  Thus, the next question to be answered 
  is – what is the appropriate remedy.  McLachlin J. plainly stated in <i>Peter 
  v. Beblow</i> that the first choice remedy for unjust enrichment is a monetary 
  reward.  The proprietary remedy of a constructive trust is limited to those 
  cases where a monetary award is inadequate.  McLachlin J. dealt directly with 
  this issue in <i>Peter v. Below</i> at pp. 333- 34 in this way:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>Where a monetary award is sufficient, there is no need for a constructive 
      trust.</u>  Where a monetary award is insufficient in a family situation, 
      this is usually related to the fact that the claimant’s efforts have given 
      him or her a special link to the property, in which case a constructive 
      trust arises.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>, McLachlin J. made it clear that where unjust 
  enrichment is established and a monetary award is adequate, the value of the 
  contributions giving rise to a finding of unjust enrichment should be determined 
  on a value received basis.  In other words, if a monetary award is adequate 
  (a non issue in this case), the increase in the value of Mr. Bailey’s house 
  and RRSPs is not an appropriate basis for assessing the compensation to which 
  Ms. Bell is entitled. McLachlin J. put it in this way at p. 334:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>One starts, of necessity, by defining the property.  One goes on to determine 
      what portion of that property is attributable to the claimant’s efforts.  
      This is the “value survived” approach.  For a monetary award, the “value 
      received” approach is appropriate;  <u>the value conferred on the property 
      is irrelevant</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus, if Mr. Bailey was unjustly enriched, in accordance with <i>Peter 
  v. Beblow</i> the question to be answered is what was the value of Ms. Bell’s 
  disproportionate contributions, including the services she provided.  Simply 
  determining the increase in the value of Mr. Bailey’s Thunder Bay property and 
  part of the increase in value of his RRSP accounts while the parties cohabited 
  and then awarding Ms. Bell a constructive trust interest, (here, 45 per cent 
  of the relevant increases) is not the proper route to follow in answering the 
  question posed above.</p>

line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge relied on <i>Clark v. Vanderhoeven</i> (1997), 28 R.F.L. 
  (4th) 152 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) as authority for the broad proposition that 
  on a finding of a constructive trust the value of the trust can be converted 
  into a monetary award and judgment issued accordingly.  I accept that Marshman 
  J. made a statement to that effect in <i>Clark</i>.  However, the monetary award 
  of $100,000 in that case was what the trial judge said was the value of the 
  services received by the defendant.  Thus, the trial judge’s comments about 
  directly valuing the constructive trust interest of the defendant and converting 
  it into a monetary award are <i>obiter</i>.  In any case, in my view, the trial 
  judge’s comments are not consistent with <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I should add that I accept that the value received calculation of a 
  monetary award may, to some degree, reflect the extent to which the value of 
  a particular asset was enhanced by the claimant’s direct and indirect contributions.  
  See <i>Nasser v. Mayer-Nasser</i> (2000), 130 O.A.C. 52 (C.A.) (leave to appeal 
  to S.C.C. dismissed, [2000] S.C.C.A. No. 206).  This, however, is part of the 
  value received analysis; it does not mean that a back-door route to a monetary 
  award by first finding a constructive trust and then valuing the claimant’s 
  constructive trust interest is justified.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Once the trial judge found unjust enrichment and accepted that a monetary 
  award was adequate, the issue of constructive trust should have left the table.  
  He should have valued Ms. Bell’s direct and indirect contributions (those contributions 
  supporting the unjust enrichment finding) on a value received basis. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In any case, in my opinion the assumptions underlying the trial judge’s 
  constructive trust analysis are suspect.  Merely because in a particular period 
  of co&#8209;habitation the value of certain assets (in this case Mr. Bailey’s 
  real property and his RRSPs) increases does not automatically lead to a finding 
  of unjust enrichment.  Furthermore, if unjust enrichment is found, these circumstances 
  do not automatically lead to the granting of a constructive trust interest in 
  the relevant assets.  The trial judge correctly observed, again after referring 
  to <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>, that there must also be a “clear causal connection”, 
  that is a link, between the contributions and the assets in respect of which 
  a constructive trust is sought.  In the circumstances of this case, this means 
  that there must be direct or circumstantial evidence that Ms. Bell’s contributions 
  to the family enterprise enhanced the value of the assets over which she claimed 
  and was granted a constructive trust.  Consistent with the value survived approach, 
  this generally, but not always, requires evidence of the difference between 
  the “going in” (the date of co-habitation) and the “going out” (the date of 
  separation) value of the assets over which a constructive trust interest is 
  sought.  It also requires a finding, supported by evidence accepted by the trier 
  of fact, that the increase in value can reasonably be linked to the contributions 
  of the claimant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In making his constructive trust finding with respect to Mr. Bailey’s 
  Thunder Bay property, the trial judge assumed that the increase in the value 
  of the property came from the direct and indirect contributions of Mr. Bailey 
  (55 per cent) and Ms. Bell (45 per cent).  Looked at in the abstract, this may 
  or may not represent a convenient split.  However, it ignores the probability 
  that in the period of co-habitation the value of Mr.&nbsp;Bailey’s Thunder Bay 
  property increased quite apart from anything either party did to enhance its 
  value.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Similarly, when the trial judge granted Ms. Bell a constructive trust 
  interest in Mr. Bailey RRSPs, he recognized that some of the increase in value 
  of Mr. Bailey’s RRSP accounts had nothing to do with Ms. Bell.  After he concluded 
  that Ms. Bell was entitled to a 45 per cent interest in some part of the increase 
  of Mr. Bailey’s RRSP accounts, he turned to consider how much of that increase 
  should be looked to in determining the appropriate monetary award.  He found 
  that the value of Mr. Bailey’s RRSP accounts increased by slightly more than 
  $72,000 over the co-habitation.  He recognized that some of that increase was 
  the result of the natural growth of the $38,000 in Mr. Bailey’s RRSP accounts 
  when he and Ms. Bell began to co-habit.  The trial judge concluded that the 
  increase in Mr. Bailey’s RRSP accounts, that is the total increase in the value 
  of Mr. Bailey’s RRSP accounts, “must be reduced arbitrarily”.  In the end, he 
  concluded that $60,000 was a fair, albeit arbitrary sum, to be used first to 
  establish Ms. Bell’s constructive trust interest and then to establish the RRSP 
  component of Ms. Bell’s monetary award.  All of this would have been unnecessary 
  had the trial judge simply assessed the value of those contributions of Ms. 
  Bell which gave rise to the finding of unjust enrichment.</p>

  </span> Since I think that the evidence supports a narrower finding of unjust 
  enrichment than that made by the trial judge, and since it is accepted that 
  a monetary award is adequate in this case, there remains to be considered what 
  adjusted monetary reward is reasonable in the circumstances.  One option is 
  to order a new trial to determine the appropriate monetary award.  In my opinion, 
  it would not be in the interest of either party to order a new trial.  Too much 
  time and money has already been invested in this dispute.  I will therefore 
  do my best to determine what monetary award will reasonably remedy the unjust 
  enrichment I have found to exist.  </p>

  </span> Ms. Bell’s entitlement to a monetary award as a remedy for unjust enrichment 
  necessarily focuses on that period ending in December 1993, during which she 
  contributed, in both a direct and indirect way, to the discharge of Mr. Bailey’s 
  $40,000 mortgage and his purchase of a truck, boat and motor.  She is entitled 
  to be compensated for her disproportionate contributions to the family enterprise 
  in that period.  It seems to me that a monetary award of $15,000 is appropriate 
  in all of the circumstances.  This will take into account the value that Mr.&nbsp;Bailey 
  received as a result of Ms. Bell’s contributions.  I see no need to specifically 
  deduct the $13,100 that the trial judge found Mr. Bailey paid to Ms.&nbsp;Bell.  
  This payment is nothing more than part of the evidentiary mix.</p>

  </span> I would, therefore, allow the appeal in part, and vary paragraph one 
  of the judgment by substituting a figure of $15,000 in place of the $46,300 
  found by the trial judge as an appropriate monetary remedy for unjust enrichment.  
  Since Mr. Bailey has achieved divided success on the appeal (he has succeeded 
  in reducing the monetary award for his unjust enrichment, but failed on the 
  spousal support issue), I would allow the appeal in part without costs.  Unless 
  there are settlement offers which might change the disposition of the trial 
  costs (no costs), I would not change the trial judge’s disposition of costs.</p>
