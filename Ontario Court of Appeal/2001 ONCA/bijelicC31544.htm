<p><b>On appeal from the conviction on November 30, 1998 and the sentence imposed 
  on January 29, 1999 by Justice H. Locke.</b></p>
<h4 align="center"><span style='font-size:14.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On January 10, 1996, the appellant was arrested and charged with 
  importing restricted weapons, namely handguns, possession of restricted weapons, 
  and delivery of restricted weapons to an unauthorized person.  He was also charged 
  with importing prohibited weapons, namely several large capacity cartridge magazines.  
  The indictment covered the period from October 1995 to January 1996.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On November 30, 1998, the appellant was found guilty of all four 
  charges by Mr. Justice Locke sitting alone.  The appellant was sentenced to 
  four years imprisonment on count 1 and three years concurrent on each of the 
  other three counts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The theory of the Crown was that the appellant purchased firearms 
  in Florida and transported them to Val Pavicevic in Hamilton who sold them to 
  undercover officers.  Mr. Pavicevic was convicted of charges arising out of 
  the investigation and sentenced to 3 years (plus one year pre-trial).  He was 
  deported shortly before the trial.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown introduced a number of statements Mr. Pavicevic made 
  to an undercover officer claiming that the statements were admissible against 
  the appellant in that they were made in furtherance of a common design to which 
  the appellant was a party to import illegal firearms into Canada.  The appellant 
  argues that the statements were inadmissible against him unless it could first 
  be shown on the balance of probabilities, using only evidence directly admissible 
  against him, that he was a member of the alleged common design.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We agree with the appellant’s statement of the applicable law, 
  but disagree with his contention that the evidence directly admissible against 
  him could not support a finding of probable membership in the scheme to import 
  the guns into Canada.  There was ample evidence upon which the trial judge could 
  reasonably base this conclusion.  Apart altogether from the hearsay statements, 
  there was clear evidence that the appellant purchased the guns in Florida which 
  were sold only a few days later by Mr. Pavicevic to the undercover officer and 
  that Mr. Pavicevic was an associate of the appellant.  The finding of the trial 
  judge could properly rest on this foundation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge also relied on the evidence of Bruno Silvestri 
  who testified that on November 23, 1995, he was working as an undercover police 
  officer and saw the appellant at Mr. Pavicevic’s house in Hamilton, Ontario.  
  The trial judge viewed the Silvestri evidence with great caution because the 
  witness had subsequently been convicted of theft and resigned from the police 
  force. However, the trial judge accepted the evidence because he found it supported 
  by the testimony of two other police officers.  One observed a car pass Mr. 
  Pavicevic’s residence on November 23, which had Florida licence plates and was 
  linked to a Florida house used by the appellant and owned by his father.  The 
  other saw Silvestri enter the residence on that day and another male later exit 
  the house.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the appellant argued that the evidence of the two officers 
  could not provide corroboration, in our view it was open to the trial judge 
  to conclude that the evidence of those officers did indeed provide support for 
  the Silvestri evidence.  Their evidence was capable of strengthening the trial 
  judge’s belief that the suspect witness was telling the truth.  Hence it was 
  open to the trial judge to accept the Silvestri evidence and use it as additional 
  support for his conclusion that on a balance of probabilities the appellant 
  was a member of the criminal enterprise.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, on the conviction appeal, the appellant argued that 
  his section 11(b) <i>Charter</i> right had been violated in this case.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was arrested on January 31, 1996.  Disclosure was 
  complicated by the fact that a good deal of it had to come from Florida and 
  involved individuals and organizations over which the Crown had no control.  
  Disclosure was completed to all intents and purposes by December 12, 1996, when 
  the date for a preliminary hearing was set. That hearing began on September 
  8, 1997, but insufficient time had been set aside and it was not completed until 
  January 22, 1998.  The trial then commenced on November 2, 1998.  Throughout 
  this time frame there were a number of court appearances, the transcripts of 
  which provide a firm foundation for the trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant 
  either consented to the majority of adjournments or acquiesced in them in view 
  of the reality of the challenge posed by disclosure.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the overall time lapse from arrest to trial cannot 
  be said to be unreasonable in all the circumstances of this case. The time taken 
  for disclosure was naturally affected by the nature of the case and the offshore 
  source of the information to be disclosed.  The appellant has not demonstrated 
  that ten months to assemble and distribute the necessary disclosure went beyond 
  the reasonable demands of a case like this one.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Much of the time taken to schedule and then complete the preliminary 
  hearing must be seen as simply part of the inherent time requirements of the 
  case.  Four days were scheduled for the preliminary and when it could not be 
  finished a further day had to be scheduled.  In these circumstances, it is not 
  unreasonable to expect some delay.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, the appellant’s claim of prejudice because Mr. Pavicevic 
  was unavailable to give evidence at trial does not withstand scrutiny. The appellant 
  gave no indication prior to trial of an intention to call Mr. Pavicevic.  Nor 
  did he supply the trial judge with any indication of what evidence Mr. Pavicevic 
  might have given, let alone how it might assist him, although his counsel had 
  taken a statement from Mr. Pavicevic.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In all the circumstances, the trial judge was correct in concluding 
  that the lapse of time had been sufficiently explained and the appellant had 
  not demonstrated prejudice.  The trial judge properly concluded that the appellant’s 
  s. 11(b) right had not been violated. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, as to sentence, we can find no error in principle.  
  Nor is the sentence demonstrably unfit.  These were serious crimes involving 
  15 to 20 handguns.  The trial judge found that the appellant was a front line 
  principal in a criminal enterprise.  He found that the appellant was motivated 
  by greed and had as his criminal purpose the selling of these weapons to criminals 
  who would use them to commit crimes against Canadian citizens.  In light of 
  these findings, all of which were open to the trial judge on this record, we 
  think the sentence imposed was fit.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The conviction appeal is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence 
  is granted and the sentence appeal is also dismissed. </p>
