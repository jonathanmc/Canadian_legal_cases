  </span></span> The principal issue in this appeal from the decision of Rutherford&nbsp;J. 
  concerns the treatment of what the appellant husband characterizes as <i>ex 
  gratia</i> payments by his former employer when he took early retirement.  The 
  husband submits that the payments are a gift and therefore should be excluded 
  entirely from matrimonial property accounting in accordance with s. 4(2) of 
  the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;F.3.  In the alternative, he 
  submits that most of the payments should be deducted from his net family property 
  (NFP)—namely, that portion that can be attributed to his employment before his 
  marriage to the respondent, his second wife.  I have concluded that the payments 
  cannot be properly characterized as a gift and that in the particular circumstances 
  of this case, the trial judge properly included the entire amount of the payments 
  in the husband’s NFP.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A second issue concerns the treatment of a survivor’s pension 
  to which the wife would become eligible should the husband predecease her.  
  The decision not to include the wife’s interest in the value of this pension 
  in the wife’s NFP was fact-driven and, in my view, the husband has not shown 
  any reason to interfere with the trial judge’s decision.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  </span></span> The appellant and the respondent were married in 1988.  This 
  was a second marriage for both parties.  The appellant previously married Maureen 
  Coons in 1959 and divorced her in 1987.  For convenience I will refer to the 
  appellant as the husband and the respondent as the wife and Ms. Coons as the 
  first wife.  The Divorce Judgment with the first wife provided that she would 
  get a certain percentage of his pension when he retired.  The judgment further 
  provided that these pension benefits would include “on a pro-rated basis … all 
  payments of every nature and kind paid to the husband from his employment as 
  a consequence of his retirement or disassociation with his employer”.  </p>

  </span></span> The husband retired from his employment with Bell Canada after 
  35 years of employment in December 1992.  The husband and wife had been married 
  for just over four years.  At the time, Bell was going through a period of “work 
  force adjustment”.  Bell gave certain employees the option to take early retirement 
  in return for certain payments referred to as the Paid Absence Prior To Retirement 
  (PAPP) and a Voluntary Termination Incentive Plan (VTIP).  The husband received 
  $19,220.85 under the PAPP and $123,132 under the VTIP.  Later in December, the 
  husband wrote to the first wife a letter that included the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>Any post retirement allowance as received over future years … is not 
      based in any way, shape or form on anything that accrued prior to today, 
      let alone prior to May 14, 1986.</span></u><span>  </span>In fact, the cost 
      of the work adjustment program is being charged to the Business Unit involved, 
      not the Pension Plan fund itself.  As such, I am simply receiving an allowance 
      in lieu of being on the payroll and Bell is in the process of saving expense 
      money… [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Similarly, counsel for the husband (who also acted for the husband 
  at trial and in this court) wrote counsel for the first wife in February 1993 
  that, “In our view, your client is not entitled to any of the termination allowance, 
  as previously discussed, as this arose after separation”.  A letter from Bell 
  introduced at the trial showed that the husband would not have been eligible 
  for these various payments when he married the wife in 1988.</p>

  </span></span> The husband and wife separated on August 6, 1997 after nine years 
  of marriage.  They are both 63 years of age.  The wife had abused alcohol for 
  many years and also has had a number of health problems including osteoarthritis 
  and cancer that resulted in the loss of one kidney.  She is in receipt of a 
  Canada Pension Plan disability pension and a small pension under the <i>Public 
  Service Superannuation Act</i> from her employment with the federal government.  
  She owns her own home and lives frugally.  The husband owns his own home, enjoys 
  good health, and is active in various sports.  The trial judge found that the 
  husband was not forthcoming in disclosing his financial records.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When he retired, the husband elected to provide for a survivor’s 
  pension for his wife.  Should the husband predecease the wife, she will receive 
  a survivor’s pension of $1,829.02 with cost of living adjustment.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At trial, the husband argued that the approximately $140,000 
  he received from Bell because of his early retirement under the VTIP and PAPP 
  were paid to him because of his 35 years of employment and should be treated 
  on a pro-rated basis.  Thus, only that proportion of the amounts that relate 
  to the years he was employed during the marriage should be included in his NFP.  
  The trial judge held that all of these amounts should be included in the husband’s 
  NFP, except for approximately $6,000 that the husband paid to his first wife 
  from the PAPP.  In reaching that conclusion, the trial judge principally relied 
  upon the position that the appellant and his counsel had taken with the first 
  wife.  However, he also took into account the letter from Bell indicating that 
  had the husband left the company at the time of his marriage to his wife in 
  1988 he would not have received any of these benefits.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The husband did not take the position at trial

  Act.</i></span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>The Survivor’s Pension</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge refused to include any amount for the survivor’s 
  pension in the wife’s NFP.  An expert testified that this future benefit had 
  a value of $22,419.  The expert arrived at this amount on the assumption, using 
  standard mortality tables, that the wife would survive the husband by 5.17 years.  
  The trial judge held that the assumption could not be relied upon in view of 
  the evidence that persuaded him that the wife would not outlive the husband.  
  He held that in light of the relative state of health of the parties,</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I do not think I can find on the evidence that she will outlive [the 
      husband].  In the circumstances of this case, I don’t think the contingencies 
      are sufficiently clear and predictable to justify the inclusion of anything 
      in [the wife’s] NFP statement for the possible benefit she [may] some day 
      enjoy from survivor’s benefits under [the husband’s] Bell pension plan, 
      if, in fact, she should outlive him.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have indicated, the husband’s principal position is that 
  none of the amounts paid to him by his former employer upon his early retirement 
  should be included in his NFP.  He argues that this is a gift and is therefore 
  excluded property under s. 4(2) of the Act.  Counsel for the wife submits that 
  this court should not entertain this submission since it was raised for the 
  first time on appeal.  He argues that had this issue been raised at trial he 
  might have introduced further evidence from Bell about the nature of these benefits.  
  Counsel for the husband submits that the treatment of these benefits was clearly 
  an issue at trial, albeit he did not expressly argue that they should be excluded 
  as a gift.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the wife’s position.  In my view, it would be unfair 
  to permit the husband for the first time on appeal to raise an entirely new 
  argument.  There was very little evidence, other than some documents from Bell, 
  about these benefits and nothing that expressly dealt with the gift argument.  
  See <i>Ross v. Ross</i> (2000), 4 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>) 134 (N.S.C.A.) at

  </span></span> In any event, on this record the husband has not met the burden 
  of showing that these payments were gifts.  The relevant provisions of the <i>Family 
  Law Act</i> are the following.  Subsection 4(1) defines “net family property” 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>“net family property” means the value of all the property, except property

  </span></span> The term “gift” is not defined in the Act.  In its usual meaning, 
  a gift is a voluntary transfer of personal property without consideration.  
  On the limited record in this case, the payments by the employer to the husband 
  cannot fairly be characterized as gifts.  They were paid to the husband as inducements 
  and in consideration for his taking early retirement.  They were a tool used 
  by Bell to reduce its work force and hardly fall in the same category as the 
  proverbial gold watch given by the employer to valued employees when they retire.  
  The fact that the payments were made according to a formula devised by the employer 
  and were non-negotiable does not in my view make them gifts from the employer.  
  I agree with Professor McLeod’s brief annotation to the decision in <i>Sutton 
  v. Davidson</i> (2000), 1 R.F.L. (5<sup>th</sup>) 157 (Alta. C.A.) at 160 where 
  he notes that an Ontario court would likely not treat such payments as gifts 
  but rather “as part of the consideration for an employee’s giving up his or 
  her employment and include the payment in the [NFP] accounting”.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Further, the documents in the record from Bell describing the 
  VTIP, in particular, are written in contractual terms of offer and acceptance 
  rather than in terms suggesting a gift.  For these reasons, I would not give 
  effect to this ground of appeal.</p>

  </span></span> In the alternative, the husband repeats the argument made at 
  trial that, although the early retirement benefits were received during the 
  marriage, only 4/35’s of the amount should be included in his NFP on the basis 
  that he was only employed for four of his 35 years with Bell while he was married 
  to the wife.  The treatment of these types of payments seems to be a matter 
  of first impression in this court.  As Professor McLeod points out in the Annotation 
  referred to earlier<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>, 
  the proper treatment of such payments will depend on a number of factors including 
  the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i)        whether the payment was made before or after separation;</p>
    <p>(ii)       whether the decision to take advantage of the inducement, and 
      hence entitlement to the inducement, was made before or after separation;</p>
    <p>(iii)     whether the payment is compensation for income that would have 
      been earned after separation;</p>
    <p>(iv)      whether the payment is compensation for income that would have 
      been earned before the parties were married.</p>

  agreed with the approach taken by Perras J. in <i>Read v. Read</i> (1993), 46 
  R.F.L. (3d) 426 (Alta. Q.B.).  He held based upon the evidence in that case 
  that there were two components to the severance package.  The first was recognition 
  for past services and was “distributable matrimonial property” as it was for 
  past service earned during cohabitation.  The second component was recognition 
  for loss of future income and was not distributable matrimonial property as 
  it was for wages the husband would have earned after the separation.  As such 
  it was not property acquired during the marriage.</p>

  </span></span> There is merit to the approach set out in <i>Sutton</i> and <i>Read</i><a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span> [3] </span></a> and on that approach only amounts of the incentive 
  payments that can be attributed to recognition for past services to the employer 
  during the marriage or for future income that would have been earned during 
  the marriage should be treated as property acquired during the marriage.  However, 
  it seems to me that each case will depend upon the facts and the nature of the 
  incentive payment, bearing in mind that in accordance with s. 4(3) of the Act, 
  the burden is on the spouse receiving the incentive payment to prove entitlement 
  to the deduction.  On the sparse record in this case, while the amount of the 
  payments was based upon the husband’s years of service and his position within 
  the company, his entitlement arose solely because in 1992 Bell was attempting 
  to reduce its work force.  I cannot say that it was unreasonable for the trial 
  judge to treat the husband’s letter to his first wife and his counsel’s letter 
  to his first wife’s counsel as admissions that these payments were unrelated 
  to recognition for past services.  To repeat, at that time the husband and his 
  lawyer both took the position that these payments were not based on anything 
  that accrued prior to 1992.  It was open to the trial judge to conclude in this 
  case that the husband  had  not  met  the onus to prove  the deduction or exclusion  
  in accordance  with s.&nbsp;4(3).  As such, the amounts were properly characterized 
  as property acquired during the marriage to the wife.</p>

  </span></span> In oral argument, counsel for the husband agreed that in law 
  the trial judge was entitled to exclude the value of the survivor’s benefit 
  from the wife’s NFP if he found as a fact that it was unlikely the wife would 
  outlive the husband.  Counsel argued, however, that this finding of fact was 
  unreasonable.  He noted that notwithstanding the wife’s previous health problems, 
  the trial judge described the wife as being in good health.  In my view, the 
  evidence supports the trial judge’s finding.  While at present the wife appears 
  to enjoy good health, she has had serious life-threatening illnesses.  Given 
  the relative medical histories of the parties, the standard mortality tables 
  used by the expert were of little value.  It was open to the trial judge having 
  heard the evidence of the wife’s medical history to find as a fact that it was 
  unlikely that she would survive the husband.  I would not give effect to this 
  ground of appeal.</p>

  </span></span> Accordingly, I would dismiss the husband’s appeal with costs.  
  The wife cross-appealed the decision of the trial judge to include the value 
  of her Canada Pension Plan disability pension in her NFP.  Prior to the hearing 
  of the appeal, she abandoned her cross-appeal.  Accordingly, the cross-appeal 
  is dismissed without costs.</p>

    note that Philp J. reached a different conclusion in <i>Dolman v. Dolman</i> 
    (1998), 38 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>) 362 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) at 369.  In 
    <i>Dolman</i> the husband, a firefighter, elected to take early retirement 
    and was given a “Retirement Cash Incentive” by the employer.  Philp J. characterized 
    the payment as “purely voluntary and discretionary on the part of the City 
    of Hamilton”, although the amount was calculated using the husband’s salary 
    and length of service.  He concluded that the payment “was not compensation 
    for employment but rather a gift from the City for taking early retirement”.  
    While I have some concern with this reasoning, the result in <i>Dolman</i> 
    may be explained by the fact that the trial judge accepted the husband’s evidence 
    that he had intended to retire in any event.</p>

    may, of course, be difficult to determine the proportion of the payment attributable 
    to past service and to recognition for loss of future income.  In <i>Cameron 
    v. Cameron</i> (1995), 9 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>) 358 (B.C.S.C.) and <i>Pretty 
    v. Pretty</i> (1996), 16 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>) 122 (Nfld. U.F.C.) the trial 
    judges found that the whole amount of the early retirement incentive was offered 
    for purchase of future service rather than a reward for past service.  A different 
    result was reached in <i>Christian v. Christian</i> (1995), 10 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
    302 (N.S.S.C.) where the wife was held to be entitled to a pro-rata share 
    of the separation pay based on the number of years the husband was employed 
    during the marriage.</p>
