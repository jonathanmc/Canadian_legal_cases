  </span> The appellant was convicted of first degree murder.  The homicide occurred 
  in the course of an armed robbery.  It was the position of the Crown that the 
  appellant and Andrew Samuels, who were both armed, entered the deceased’s apartment 
  under the pretence of purchasing some clothing, and with the intention of robbing 
  him.  In the course of that robbery, the deceased was shot in the back of the 
  head.  The forensic evidence indicated that the gun was against the deceased’s 
  head when it was fired.  The Crown contended that the appellant was the shooter 
  and that the murder was first degree murder by virtue of s. 231(5)(e) of the 
  <i>Criminal Code</i> (murder in the course of an unlawful confinement or attempting 
  to commit an unlawful confinement).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Samuels, who was shot in the course of the robbery, pled guilty to manslaughter 
  and received a 4 year sentence in addition to almost 2 years pre-trial custody.  
  He testified for the Crown.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was overwhelming evidence, apart entirely from Samuels’ evidence, 
  indicating that the appellant and Samuels were involved in the armed robbery 
  of the deceased and that the deceased was killed in the course of that robbery.  
  There was also strong evidence that the deceased and Samuels were shot with 
  the same weapon.  While it was possible that Samuels’ wound was self-inflicted 
  in the course of a struggle, it was more likely that it was not.  If Samuels 
  did not shoot himself, then in all likelihood he did not shoot the deceased.</p>

  </span> We do not accept that defence counsel intended to bring a “<i>Corbett</i>” 
  application and was dissuaded from doing so by the trial judge’s indication 
  as to the practice he followed when “<i>Corbett</i>” applications were brought 
  before him.  That practice is wrong given the subsequent decision in <i>R. v. 
  Underwood</i> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 117 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the end of the Crown’s case, Crown counsel suggested to the trial 
  judge that defence counsel would be bringing a “<i>Corbett</i>” application.  
  Defence counsel said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Maybe my friend will allow me to speak for myself. … Rather than indicating 
      to the court what I may or may not be doing.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Defence counsel then immediately asked for the jury to be brought into 
  the courtroom.  The trial judge asked him whether there would be a “<i>Corbett</i>”<i> 
  </i>application and counsel replied “not at this point”.  The jury entered the 
  courtroom and defence counsel elected to call no evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel’s conduct and his statements to the court are entirely consistent 
  with the absence of any intention to bring a “<i>Corbett</i>” application.  
  Nothing said by the trial judge had any impact on counsel’s  conduct.</p>

  The trial record is clear and there is no reason to admit fresh evidence to

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s instruction considered in its entirety alerted the 
  jury to the danger inherent in relying on the unconfirmed evidence of Samuels, 
  explained the reasons for that danger particular to this case, explored the 
  specific factors impacting on Samuels’ credibility, reminded the jury of some 
  of the potential confirmatory evidence, and also alerted the jury to the respective 
  positions of the parties.  We think the instruction was satisfactory.  </p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b>III</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel contends that Crown counsel improperly commented on the appellant’s 
  exercise of his right to silence upon arrest and that the trial judge did not 
  give a clear and sharp direction to rectify that improper comment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Crown counsel made no comment on the appellant’s exercise of his right 
  to silence upon arrest.  Rather, Crown counsel made a submission that was directed 
  to the appellant’s failure to speak to certain officers that he passed on the 
  street prior to his arrest.  The trial judge misapprehended Crown counsel’s 
  submission as a reference to post-arrest silence.  In any event, the trial judge 
  immediately and expressly told the jury that the appellant had a right to remain 
  silent on arrest and that no adverse inference could be drawn.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b>IV</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge outlined the position of the defence at a specific point 
  in his instructions.  He spent several pages summarizing that position and reviewing 
  the arguments advanced in support of it.  No complaint is made with this part 
  of his charge.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also instructed the jury, as he was required to do, 
  on the various bases upon which the appellant could be convicted of first degree 
  murder, second degree murder, or manslaughter either as the shooter or as a 
  party to the homicide.  In the course of this part of his instructions, the 
  trial judge referred to defence “concessions” and to defence “positions”.  In 
  fact, these were not concessions made by the defence or positions taken by the 
  defence, but were descriptions of the appellant’s legal liability under the 
  various scenarios if the jury made certain findings of fact.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge should have avoided references to defence “concessions” 
  and defence “positions” in this part of his instructions.  We are satisfied, 
  however, that considered in their totality, these instructions would not have 
  misled the jury.  The jury would have understood that the so called “concessions” 
  and “positions” were merely acknowledgements by the defence that certain results 
  would flow in law depending on the findings of fact made by the jury.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We come to this conclusion in no small measure because trial counsel 
  raised no objection.  While the failure to object is not determinative of any 
  issue raised on appeal, it may be important.  It will be particularly significant 
  where appellate counsel argues that the trial judge fundamentally misstated 
  the position taken by the defence at trial.  If the trial judge’s instructions 
  could possibly have been understood in the way appellate counsel now argues, 
  trial counsel would surely have raised an objection.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is also important to consider the meaning of instructions in the 
  context of the trial.  The jury were at the trial and would have listened to 
  those instructions bearing in mind what had gone on in the weeks before.  The 
  jury knew full well that the appellant was not conceding any form of liability.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b>V</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant acknowledges that there was after-the-fact 
  conduct by the appellant from which the jury could infer that the appellant 
  was involved in the armed robbery of the deceased.  She contends, however, that 
  the trial judge should have told the jury that the evidence could not assist 
  in determining whether the appellant was guilty of murder.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge told the jury that the evidence could not assist in 
  determining whether the appellant was guilty of first degree murder.  He also 
  told the jury that the evidence could not assist in determining whether the 
  accused had the intent necessary for second degree murder.  Finally, he also 
  told the jury that the evidence could assist in determining whether the appellant 
  was “the killer or participant in the killing or the death of the deceased”.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge went on to tell the jury that it was the position of 
  the Crown that the after-the-fact evidence could be used to prove that the appellant 
  “participated in the killing” of the deceased but that the Crown conceded that 
  the evidence could not be used to prove that the appellant was the shooter.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It would have been wrong to tell the jury that the evidence had no relevance 
  to the appellant’s potential liability for murder.  To the extent that the evidence 
  implicated him in a planned armed robbery, it had relevance to his potential 
  liability for second degree murder as a party to that offence.  We, therefore, 
  reject counsel for the appellant’s submission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence of the after-the-fact conduct was circumstantial evidence 
  of the accused’s participation in the events that culminated in the killing 
  of the deceased.  We agree with the Crown that it was evidence from which participation 
  in a murder could be inferred but it was not evidence from which it could be 
  inferred that the appellant was the shooter.  To the extent that the trial judge’s 
  reference to the evidence being relevant to whether the accused was “the killer” 
  refers to the appellant as being the shooter, his instructions overstate the 
  potential probative value of the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are satisfied, however, that this imperfection in the instruction 
  could not have affected the result.  We reach that conclusion for two reasons.  
  First, as the trial judge told the jury, it was not part of the Crown’s position 
  that the evidence tended to prove that the appellant was the shooter.  Second, 
  this evidence was of little significance when considered in the context of the 
  totality of the evidence adduced against the appellant.  We are satisfied that 
  had the jury been told that this evidence could not assist in determining the 
  identity of the shooter, their verdict would inevitably have been the same.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><b>VI</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> During defence counsel’s argument for a directed verdict of acquittal 
  on the first degree murder charge, the trial judge indicated that in his view 
  the evidence supported the inference that the deceased was on his knees when 
  the fatal shot was fired.  The trial judge drew that inference from the location 
  of the wound on the deceased’s head, the fact that the wound was a contact wound 
  and the downward trajectory of the bullet.  None of the factors referred to 
  by the trial judge, or others which may have been relevant to the position of 
  the body when the shot was fired, were explored in the course of the Crown’s 
  case.  It was not part of the Crown’s case that the deceased was on his knees 
  when shot.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the course of his instructions on the appellant’s potential liability 
  for first degree murder, and after defining unlawful confinement, the trial 
  judge went on to say:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In this case, on the evidence of Andrew Samuels, which is unconfirmed in 
      part on this point, the deceased, Grant, was forced at gunpoint to lie face 
      down on the floor while the accused, Biscombe, started to cut cords with 
      which to tie Grant up.  Samuels took the deceased’s wallet, and the deceased 
      leapt up and started to struggle with Samuels and eventually with Biscombe.  
      At no time did the deceased regain his unrestrained freedom from the two 
      robbers before he was shot to the back of his head by Biscombe.  <u>In fact, 
      it may well be that the deceased was on his knees when shot because he was 
      taller than both the accused and Samuels and because the shot to the back 
      of his head travelled in a slightly downward trajectory.</u>  Assuming that 
      you find this scenario to be credible, it would be open to you to find that 
      the accused, Biscombe, caused the accused’s death while committing or attempting 
      to commit unlawful confinement.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge’s reference 
  to the deceased being on his knees when shot introduced a new theory of liability 
  for first degree murder not advanced by the Crown and not referred to in the 
  evidence.  Counsel submits that this resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We do not accept this characterization.  The Crown’s theory was that 
  the appellant was engaged in the unlawful confinement, or the attempt to unlawfully 
  confine the deceased from the moment he entered the apartment and that when 
  the deceased resisted those attempts, the appellant chased him, put a gun to 
  the back of his head and shot him.  That was also the theory on which the trial 
  judge instructed the jury.  He suggested to the jury that the inference that 
  the deceased was on his knees could be drawn in support of the Crown’s position 
  that there was an unlawful confinement when the murder occurred.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While it might have been possible to infer from the evidence that the 
  deceased was on his knees when shot, there was no direct evidence to that effect, 
  and the Crown did not advance that theory.  The trial judge should not have 
  pushed the inferences available on the evidence beyond those ever suggested 
  by the Crown.  He should not have suggested to the jury that “it may well be 
  that the deceased was on his knees”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, no prejudice flowed from this error.  The jury was clearly 
  satisfied that the appellant shot the deceased.  That finding was not tainted 
  by the trial judge’s speculation as to the deceased’s position when that shot 
  was fired.  Whether the deceased was on his knees, standing, falling or in some 
  other position, the appellant was still engaged in at least an attempt to unlawfully 
  confine the appellant when he put a gun to his head and shot him.  Consequently, 
  the deceased’s exact position when he was murdered by the appellant was of no 
  consequence in so far as the appellant’s liability for first degree murder was 
  concerned.</p>
