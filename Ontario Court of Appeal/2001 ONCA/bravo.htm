    </span>This action required an accounting as between the parties arising out 
    of a joint venture involving various travel agencies.  The scheme operated 
    for about 9 months in 1988.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The financial records of all the parties were incomplete.  They agreed 
    that the accounting process should begin with figures arrived at by the accountants, 
    Deloitte &amp; Touche.  It was agreed that the parties would advance their 
    respective positions in relation to the adjustments that each claimed should 
    be made in the figures arrived at by the accountant.  Each party had the onus 
    of proving any adjustment which it claimed should be made in the accountant’s 
    figures.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The trial went on for about 19 days.  In some instances, the difference 
    between the figures claimed by the parties was relatively small.  In a few 
    instances, there were substantial differences between the positions advanced 
    by the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The trial judge went through each and every figure that was disputed 
    in the accounts.  Sometimes he accepted the appellants’ position, sometimes 
    he accepted the respondent’s position, and quite often he arrived at a position 
    somewhere between the positions advanced by the parties.  The trial judge 
    gave reasons for each and every decision he made.  For example, on several 
    occasions the trial judge rejected the appellants’ position because there 
    were no financial records or business documents that could offer any support 
    for that position.  The trial judge also rejected certain claims made by the 
    appellants because he concluded that the funds in issue were advanced by way 
    of capital contribution to Bravo Tours Limited and were, therefore, not properly 
    considered as part of the accounting process.  These reasons for rejecting 
    the appellants’ position and the others set out by the trial judge are not 
    unreasonable and reveal no failure to consider relevant evidence or misapprehension 
    of evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The trial judge also said the following:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Credibility is in issue.  I find Mr. Di Blasi to be more 
    credible than the two defendants.  Generally, I prefer his testimony.  Where 
    the evidence of Mr. Fodero or Mr. DiMartino conflicts with that of Mr. Di 
    Blasi I accept the evidence of Mr. Di Blasi unless I state otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>This general finding of credibility is clearly supported by the other 
    findings of fact the trial judge made that are properly linked to the assessment 
    of DiMartino’s credibility.  The trial judge found that Mr. DiMartino had 
    falsified certain documents for tax purposes to assist customers and he also 
    found that Mr. DiMartino had made certain improper charges against the account 
    of Bravo Tours Limited.  These findings supported the trial judge’s determination 
    that where there was a conflict in the evidence, he could not rely on Mr. 
    DiMartino’s evidence absent supporting documentation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>It must be stressed, however, that the trial judge did not simply reject 
    the appellants’ position based on some broad-based finding of credibility.  
    He carefully went through each and every explanation advanced on behalf of 
    the appellants, rejecting some and accepting others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>We can find no reversible error in the trial judge’s findings.  To 
    the contrary, those findings reflect a detailed and even-handed assessment 
    of the extensive evidence placed before the trial judge in the course of this 
    long trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The appeal is dismissed with costs.</p>
