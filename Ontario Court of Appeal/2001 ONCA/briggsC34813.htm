  the <i>Criminal Code</i> authorizing the taking of a bodily sample from his 
  person to be submitted to the national DNA data bank.  The appellant pleaded 
  guilty to robbery (s. 344), unlawful use of an imitation firearm (s. 85), and 
  possession of stolen property (s.355).  After the appellant was sentenced to 
  30 months imprisonment, the Crown made the application that resulted in the 
  DNA order.  The appellant appeals on the basis that the trial judge misinterpreted 
  s.&nbsp;487.052 and that he should not have made the order for the taking of 
  a bodily sample. </p>

  </span></span> Section 487.04 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> designates two categories 
  of offences that are subject to DNA orders:  primary and secondary offences.  
  DNA databank orders (and DNA search warrants)<i> </i>can only issue when an 
  offender has been convicted of a designated offence listed in s.&nbsp;487.04. 
  Primary offences are the most serious offences in the <i>Criminal Code</i> and 
  include murder and sexual offences.  Secondary offences, such as robbery, are 
  less serious than primary offences, but are serious on their own. Pursuant to 
  s. 487.051, if a person is convicted of a primary designated offence, and no 
  order has previously been made for the taking of a bodily sample of DNA, a judge 
  “shall” make the order unless the court is satisfied that the person has established 
  that the impact on the person’s “privacy and security of the person is grossly 
  disproportionate to the public interest in the protection of society and the 
  proper administration of justice, to be achieved through the early detection 
  arrest and conviction of offenders.”  If a person is convicted of a secondary 
  designated offence, the court “may” make an order authorizing the taking of 
  samples of DNA “if the court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of 
  the administration of justice to do so.”  Thus, a judge has a discretion to 
  make an order authorizing the taking of a sample of DNA with respect to both 
  primary and secondary offences although that discretion would appear to be more 
  limited with respect to primary offences.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The section in issue here, s.&nbsp;487.052, is concerned only 
  with the situation where a person was charged with a crime prior to the coming 
  into force of the legislation and convicted after it came into force.  The appellant’s 
  offence was committed on October&nbsp;9, 1999; the legislation came into force 
  on June 30, 2000 and he was convicted afterwards on July 21, 2000.  Pursuant 
  to s.&nbsp;487.052(1), a judge has a discretion to make an order authorizing 
  the taking of samples of DNA with respect to both primary and secondary designated 
  offences, “if the court is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the 
  administration of justice to do so.”  Section&nbsp;487.052(2) contains a number 
  of factors which the court must consider in deciding whether to make the order.<span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:11.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The real crux of this case lies in the proper role of the phrase 
  “the best interests of the administration of justice” in deciding whether to 
  make an order for the taking of DNA.  The appellant submits that the trial judge 
  failed to consider the appropriate factors in deciding that it was “in the best 
  interests of the administration of justice” to make an order for the taking 
  of DNA.  In particular, the appellant submits that the trial judge could not 
  make the order unless the evidence satisfied him that the appellant’s DNA profile 
  would be of future evidentiary value. In other words, the judge must have reasonable 
  and probable grounds to believe that the offender has committed or will likely 
  commit a crime in the future where his DNA will be of assistance in proving 
  the crime.  Otherwise, the appellant submits that the statutory requirement 
  the trial judge must consider, namely, the interests of the administration of 
  justice is overly broad or vague and offend s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The 
  appellant also submits that there are unreasonable search and seizure concerns 
  under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> in relation to the use of the DNA information 
  obtained and stored in the national data bank. Finally, the appellant submits 
  that the trial judge should have exercised his discretion to refuse to make 
  the order in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Because the interpretation of the phrase, “the best interests 
  of the administration of justice” and the meaning to be given to s. 487.052 
  cannot be undertaken in isolation, these reasons necessarily make some reference 
  to the legislative scheme as a whole.  I wish to make it clear, however, that 
  my comments are for the purpose of interpreting s. 487.052.  <span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:
11.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The basic principle of statutory interpretation is that “the 
  words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical 
  and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the 
  Act and the intention of Parliament.” (E.A.&nbsp;Driedger, <i>Construction of 
  Statutes</i>,<i> </i>2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983) at 87, 
  as applied in <i>R. v. Araujo</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at 463).  
  The context of this case requires that the interpretation of the phrase, “the 
  best interests of the administration of justice” as used in s.&nbsp;487.052 
  (1), be done with the competing interests of the state and the individual in 
  mind.  The people of this country have a right to go about their daily lives 
  without fear of harm to their person.  To this end, it is in the interests of 
  everyone that serious crime be effectively investigated and prosecuted.  At 
  the same time, respect for the privacy of individuals is an equally important 
  value deserving of protection.  Each of  these values is protected in s. 7 of 
  the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  </i>There is no issue, nor can there 
  be, that the discretion granted in s. 487.052 to order the taking of a sample 
  of DNA must be exercised in a manner consistent with the <i>Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms</i>: <i>Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v. Canada (Minister 
  of Justice) </i>(2000), 150 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 53.  The issue is whether 
  the standard proposed by the appellant, which is derived from the standard with 
  respect to the issuance of search warrants, must be applied in order for the 
  legislation to be consistent with ss. 7 and 8 of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
<p class=headingtitle>Background to the <i>DNA Identification Act</i>   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before 1995, the <i>Criminal Code</i> did not authorize the taking 
  of bodily substances for analysis from individuals accused of a crime.  Nevertheless, 
  police officers took samples of bodily substances from some accused persons 
  until the practice was challenged under s.8 of the <i>Charter</i> as contravening 
  the right to be secure from unreasonable search and seizure: see <i>R. v. Borden</i> 
  (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 404 (S.C.C.).<i>  </i>In that case, hair and blood samples 
  were taken from an accused charged with sexual assault.  Since no legislative 
  provision authorized the seizure and the accused’s consent had not been validly 
  obtained, the Supreme Court declared the seizure illegal.  In so doing, the 
  Court recognized the interest of an accused in information pertaining to his 
  or her bodily substances.  <b></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The decision in <i>Borden</i>,<i> supra</i>, led Parliament to 
  amend the <i>Criminal Code</i> in 1995 to provide in ss.&nbsp;487.04 to 487.09 
  for a DNA search warrant.  That legislation was recently held to be constitutional 
  in <i>R. v. F. (S.) </i>(2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.).  In that case, 
  this court held that the principle against self-incrimination<i> </i>was not 
  a free-standing constitutional right but was qualified by the requirement of 
  due process.  Thus, the rules of fundamental justice do not prohibit the Crown 
  from compelling the production of evidence but rather control the manner in 
  which this evidence may be obtained.  The court also held that the DNA search 
  warrant legislation does not violate s.&nbsp;8 of the <i>Charter</i> because 
  it is not unreasonable.  The taking of bodily substances as prescribed by the 
  legislation and on the evidence resulted in a minimal interference with the 
  suspect’s body while fostering a valid government objective in enforcing the 
  criminal law. <b></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With this context in mind, in 1997, Parliament introduced further 
  legislation.  This legislation authorized a judge to order persons found guilty 
  of certain offences to provide a sample of their DNA to a national DNA data 
  bank.  The <i>DNA Identification Act</i>, S.C. 1998, c.37 (hereinafter “the 
  <i>Act</i>”)<i> </i>came into force on June 30, 2000.  The <i>Act</i> governs 
  the creation, operation and maintenance of a national DNA data bank, which is 
  administered by the Commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (“R.C.M.P”).  
  The <i>Act </i>effected consequential amendments to the <i>Criminal Code </i>and 
  added ss. 487.051 to 487.055<i>.  </i>Similar amendments were also made to the 
  <i>National Defence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. N-5,<i> </i>to include those in 
  the military. </p>

  (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at 108,114-15 in support of the proposition that the appropriate

  </span>In <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

  the constitutionality of a statute that authorizes a search or seizure must 
  focus on its reasonable or unreasonable impact on the subject of the search 
  or seizure and not simply on its rationality in furthering some government objective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
  </span>He explained that s. 8 protects a person’s reasonable expectation of 
  privacy and at p. 108 he further explained:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>… an assessment must be made as to whether in a particular 
      situation the public’s interest in being left alone by government must give

lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This balancing of interests is to be conducted, where feasible, 
  in advance of the search or seizure by an individual who is capable of acting 
  judicially.  Dickson J. described the guiding principles at pp. 114-15:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The purpose of an objective criterion for granting prior authorization 
      to conduct a search or seizure is to provide a consistent standard for identifying 
      the point at which the interests of the State in such intrusions come to 
      prevail over the interests of the individual in resisting them.  To associate 
      it with an applicant’s reasonable belief that relevant evidence <i>may</i> 
      be uncovered by the search, would be to define the proper standard as the 
      <i>possibility</i> of finding evidence.  This is a very low standard which 
      would validate intrusion on the basis of suspicion, and authorize fishing 
      expeditions of considerable latitude.  It would tip the balance strongly 
      in favour of the State and limit the right of the individual to resist to 
      only the most egregious intrusions.  I do not believe that this is a proper 
      standard for securing the right to be free from unreasonable search and 
      seizure.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingQUOTE align=center style='text-align:center;'><span
lang=EN-US>...</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The State’s interest in detecting and preventing crime begins to prevail 
      over the individual’s interest in being left alone at the point where credibly-based 
      probability replaces suspicion.  History has confirmed the appropriateness 
      of this requirement as the threshold for subordinating the expectation of 
      privacy to the needs of law enforcement.  Where the State’s interest is 
      not simply law enforcement as, for instance, where State security is involved, 
      or where the individual’s interest is not simply his expectation of privacy 
      as, for instance, when the search threatens his bodily integrity, the relevant 
      standard might well be a different one.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In assessing whether legislation authorizing a search or seizure 
  is reasonable, one of the requirements is that the authorization must be obtained 
  in advance.  The legislation in this case complies with that requirement.  A 
  second requirement is that the legislation contain a consistent standard.  Here, 
  the standard is the “best interests of the administration of justice”.  The 
  appellant submits that, on the basis of <i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>,<i> supra</i>, 
  that standard includes reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence 
  has been or will be committed.  In his concluding comments, Dickson J. acknowledged 
  that the standard of reasonable and probable grounds might not always be appropriate 
  and he specifically mentioned two contexts in which the standard might not apply:  
  1) where the state’s interest is not simply law enforcement, or 2) where the 
  search threatens bodily integrity. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, the state’s interest is not simply one of law enforcement 
  vis-à-vis an individual – it has a much broader purpose.  The DNA data bank 
  will: <span> </span>(1) deter potential repeat offenders; (2) promote the safety 
  of the community; (3) detect when a serial offender is at work; (4) assist in 
  solving cold crimes; (5) streamline investigations; and most importantly, (6) 
  assist the innocent by early exclusion from investigative suspicion (or in exonerating 
  those who have been wrongfully convicted). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s submission assumes that there is only one context 
  or purpose for obtaining a DNA order, the likelihood that an offender has committed 
  or will commit an offence in the future and that a sample of his DNA will afford 
  evidence of commission of that crime.  Acceptance of the appellant’s submission 
  would negate other broader purposes of the legislation, such as deterring an 
  offender from committing crimes in the future.  The appellant’s submission if 
  accepted would also negate the early exclusion of innocent persons from investigation.  
  Weeding out wrongful suspects early in an investigation serves as a benefit 
  to the state by saving resources to apply to other suspects and as a benefit 
  to the wrongfully accused who are spared the emotionally taxing and financially 
  costly ordeal of protecting their innocence.  One of the core principles of 
  our criminal justice system has always been to ensure that innocent persons 
  are not convicted.  The DNA data bank legislation supports this principle.  
  The broader purposes of the DNA data bank legislation are one indication that 
  the standard used for search warrants ought not to apply.  I will discuss bodily 
  integrity shortly, but before doing so it is appropriate to point out some further 
  differences between search warrant legislation and the DNA data bank legislation.</p>

  </span></span> The underlying purpose of a search warrant is result-oriented, 
  namely, obtaining information with which to prosecute a suspect.  The underlying 
  purpose of taking DNA is the identification of offenders.  The state’s interest 
  in their identification is clearly expressed in s. 3 of the <i>Act</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><u><span lang=EN-US>Purpose</span></u></b></p>
    <p>3.  The purpose of this Act is to establish a national DNA data bank to

  </span></span> <span> </span>With the utilization of modern technology and science, 
  the collection of DNA from the scene of a crime is much like the collection 
  of fingerprints except that it is on a genetic level.  In many cases where an 
  ordinary fingerprint may not have been left at the scene of a crime, a genetic 
  fingerprint will be present.  DNA technology has advanced significantly in recent 
  years, to the point where a DNA profile can now be derived from objects that 
  one would not ordinarily think to be the source of DNA.  While blood and semen 
  remain excellent sources of DNA, a profile can also be derived from numerous 
  other sources.  For example, in Canadian case law alone, forensic DNA typing 
  has been performed on cigarette butts,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup> 
  [2] </sup></a> mucous ridden tissues,<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup> [3] </sup></a> licked envelopes,<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

title=""><sup> [9] </sup></a> and an electrical cord (used to strangle the victim).<a
href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup> [10] </sup></a>  In addition to 
  blood and semen, other sources of DNA include skin, bone, teeth, hair roots, 
  nasal secretions, ear wax, saliva, urine, feces, vomitus, nail clippings and 
  dandruff.  As the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized, a DNA profile can 
  be derived if a person blew his nose, smoked a cigarette, chewed gum, used the 
  toilet or ate from a spoon.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><sup> 
  [11] </sup></a>  Thus, the potential to solve the identity of the perpetrators 
  of crimes through DNA analysis extends far beyond those instances where fingerprints

  no need to show reasonable grounds exist  that the prints will provide evidence 
  with respect to the offence for which the individual has been arrested or will 
  provide evidence of some future or past offence.  This onerous standard was 
  rejected by La Forest J. in <i>R. v. Beare </i>(1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 57 (S.C.C.) 
  at 76:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The judges in the Court of Appeal thought their objections to the discretionary 
      features of the legislation could be met if the following conditions were 
      satisfied:  a peace officer, in addition to having reasonable and probable 
      grounds for believing the accused had committed an offence, had reasonable 
      and probable grounds for believing that fingerprinting would likely provide 
      evidence relating to the offences, or reasonably doubted the identity of 
      the accused, or believed on reasonable and probable grounds that fingerprinting 
      would provide evidence of the subject’s identity … I am by no means sure 
      this does not ignore the wide variety of reasons for which fingerprints 
      may legitimately be used.  Nor am I convinced these additional steps would 
      afford any significant protection to an accused, and if more stringent requirements 
      were imposed they could unduly limit the police in the exercise of their 
      duty to investigate crime. … Assuming such procedures … would constitute 
      some improvement to the present unstructured system, I do not think it is 
      constitutionally mandated.  As the court stated in<i> </i>[<i>R. v. Lyons</i> 
      (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 46], s.&nbsp;7 of the <i>Charter</i> 
      guarantees fair procedures but it does not guarantee the most favourable 
      procedures that can possibly be imagined.  In my view, the requirements 
      necessary to issue and confirm an appearance notice offer a sufficient safeguard 
      to meet the requirements of fundamental justice for the taking of fingerprints.

  </span></span> A DNA profile obtained after conviction, like fingerprints, is 
  an identification marker.  The standard of reasonable and probable grounds is 
  not mandated for the taking of fingerprints.  To import the standard suggested

  </span></span> The context in which the authorization to take DNA under s.&nbsp;487.052 
  is requested is different from the context in which a search warrant is sought.  
  A search warrant is generally an <i>ex parte</i> procedure: <i>R. v. F.(S.)</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, at 244.  The application occurs prior to prosecution when the 
  accused is still presumed innocent and is entitled to all the rights associated 
  with an innocent person. In the search warrant context, because the procedure 
  is generally <i>ex parte</i> and the targets of the investigation are still 
  presumed innocent, the authorizing judge must act as “the guardian of the law 
  and of the constitutional principles protecting privacy interests”:  <i>Araujo</i>, 
  <i>supra</i> at 462.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The DNA order under s.&nbsp;487.052 occurs in a post-conviction 
  context after the offender has been convicted (of specific designated offences), 
  after the prosecution makes the request for a DNA order, and after a court has 
  heard submissions from both the defence and the Crown.  An order authorizing 
  the taking of a sample of DNA is made only after the Crown <i>and</i> the defence  
  have had opportunities to present their positions. </p>

  </span></span> If reasonable grounds exist to believe that the offender has 
  committed a particular offence in the past <i>and</i> that the DNA profile will 
  provide evidence of the offence,  a DNA search warrant could be obtained and 
  there would be no need to make an application for an order under s.&nbsp;487.052. 
  Indeed, the DNA warrant legislation provides the best indication that Parliament 
  did not intend that reasonable grounds be a consideration.  Section 487.05 states:</p>

      in Form 5.02 authorizing the taking, from that person, for the purpose of 
      forensic DNA analysis, of any number of samples of one or more bodily substances 
      that is reasonably required for that purpose, by means of the investigative

    <p><span lang=EN-US>(<i>b</i>) whether there is</span></p>

    <p><span lang=EN-US>(3) Where a peace officer believes that it would be impracticable

  </span></span> In s.&nbsp;487.05, Parliament specified that in order to issue 
  a DNA warrant, the provincial judge must first be satisfied that there are reasonable 
  grounds to believe that an offence has been committed in addition to other factors 
  before considering whether it is in the best interests of the administration 
  of justice to issue the DNA warrant.  It is apparent that in this section, the 
  phrase “the best interests of the administration of justice” means something 
  other than reasonable and probable grounds to believe that an offence has been 
  committed because this is a separate pre-condition.  It is a basic principle 
  of statutory interpretation that the same phrase should be given the same meaning 
  respecting the same subject matter.  With respect to the subject matter of DNA, 
  Parliament specified the standard of reasonable and probable grounds separately 
  from “the best interests of the administration of justice”.  The logical inference 
  is that the omission of the words reasonable and probable grounds from s.&nbsp;487.052 
  was deliberate.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Again, the appellant’s argument proceeds as if only one interpretation 
  – reasonable grounds to believe that a seized item will afford evidence – will 
  satisfy s.&nbsp;8 <i>Charter </i>concerns in the DNA context.  This is not so.  
  As Dickson J. recognized, the reasonableness standard under s.&nbsp;8 of the 
  <i>Charter</i> fluctuates with the context.  The specific wording of a section 
  is informed by its history, purpose, structure and function. Section 8 of the 
  <i>Charter</i> does not require that each and every search and seizure be done 
  only on the basis of the existence of reasonable grounds.  See:  <i>R. v. Monney 
  </i>(1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 129 at 146-47 (S.C.C.); and  ss. 492.1 and 492.2 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Thus, the reasonableness of a search and the surrounding 
  standards of belief must be assessed in the context of each case.  As Wilson 
  J. noted in <i>R. v. McKinlay Transport Ltd.</i> (1990), 55 C.C.C. (3d) 530  
  at 542-543 (S.C.C.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Since individuals have different expectations of privacy 
      in different contexts and with regard to different kinds of information 
      and documents, it follows that the standard of review of what is “reasonable” 
      in a given context must be flexible if it is to be realistic and meaningful.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The effect of the interpretation proposed by the appellant 
  would be to impose an inflexible standard that would undermine the broader purposes 
  and effectiveness of the data bank. </span><span>            </span></p>
<p><i>Privacy and bodily integrity </i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second exception to the reasonable and probable grounds standard 
  mentioned by Dickson J. in <i>Hunter v. Southam</i>,<i> supra</i>, is when an 
  individual’s bodily integrity is affected.  The extent to which state intrusion 
  with bodily integrity will be tolerated under the <i>Charter</i> is linked to 
  the reasonable expectation of privacy that an individual has. There is a significant 
  difference in the reasonable expectation of privacy and, hence, the protection 
  from interference with bodily integrity afforded to a person who is a suspect 
  but has not been charged, a person who has been arrested and charged, a person 
  who has been convicted, and a person who is subject to a custodial sentence.  
  See <i>Beare</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>at 77; <i>Conway v. A.G. (Canada) </i>(1993), 
  83 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 4.  In <i>Stillman</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>at 
  pp. 342-43, the Court held that the taking of DNA samples was state interference 
  with the accused’s bodily integrity, a breach of his privacy and an affront 
  to human dignity.  At the time that the samples of DNA were obtained, <i>Stillman</i> 
  had not been convicted of a crime and it is in that context that the court’s 
  comments must be considered.  The Court held that a higher justification for 
  state interference was necessary than the common law power of search incident 
  to arrest and mentioned the new legislative provisions respecting DNA search 
  warrants.  A person who has been convicted of a designated offence, unlike an 
  accused person, no longer has the benefit of the presumption of innocence.  
  Persons convicted of serious crimes may be subject to sentences of incarceration 
  in prison or in jail.  Such persons are subjected to strip searches, body cavity 
  searches and constant supervision.   An offender serving a sentence in the community 
  is  also subject to supervision and the imposition of terms and conditions limiting 
  the conduct of the offender’s life. <span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Human dignity is closely aligned with an individual’s freedom 
  of choice.  A person convicted of a crime has a lesser expectation of privacy 
  not because that person’s worth as a human being is less, but because the person’s 
  right to make choices about his or her life is curtailed. <span style='letter-spacing:
-.15pt'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Human dignity will also be impacted by the methods used to obtain 
  the sample of DNA and the sites from which the samples are obtained.  Dental 
  impressions were taken from Stillman and the court held that this was a lengthy 
  and intrusive process.  By contrast, one of the methods for taking DNA provided 
  for in the <i>Code</i> is the relatively quick and less discomfiting procedure 
  of swabbing the lips, tongue and inside the cheeks of the mouth.  Stillman had 
  pubic hairs removed as well as hair from his scalp.  The  <i>Code</i> provides 
  for the plucking of individual hairs including the root sheath but does not 
  specify the location on the body from which the hair may be taken.  However, 
  the <i>Code</i> requires that the person who is authorized to take samples of 
  bodily substances do so in a manner that respects the offender’s privacy and 
  that is reasonable in the circumstances (s.&nbsp;487.07(3)).  Thus, a person 
  would not ordinarily be required to expose a part of the body that is not ordinarily 
  exposed to view.  If, as in <i>F.(S.)</i>,<i> supra</i>, the hair is plucked 
  from the head, the intrusion on the individual’s privacy will be minimal.  Finally, 
  the <i>Code</i> provides for the taking of a drop of blood by pricking the surface 
  of the skin.  This may be done by pricking a finger.  The person who is to take 
  the sample must be a person with training or experience (s. 487.056(3)).  A 
  judge may specify the manner in which the sample is to be taken (s. 487.06(2)).  
  The legislation therefore proposes a contextual approach to the making of an 
  order authorizing the taking of a sample of a bodily substance to be used to 
  conduct a DNA analysis.  The legislative scheme is sensitive to the privacy 
  interests of the offender and the requirement that any seizure be reasonable 
  in the circumstances.  It aims at compliance with s. 8 of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Another  real concern is the privacy interest arising out of 
  the use of the offender’s DNA profile.  In this regard, the principles of the 
  <i>Act</i> must be borne in mind in relation to the seizure of  samples.  Section 
  4 of the <i>Act</i> states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b><u><span lang=EN-US>Principles</span></u></b></p>
    <p>4.            It is recognized and declared that </p>
    <p><span> </span>(a)      the protection of society and the administration 
      of justice are well served by the early detection, arrest and conviction

    <p><span> </span>(b)      the DNA profiles, as well as the samples of bodily 
      substances from which the profiles are derived, may be used only for law 
      enforcement purposes in accordance with this Act, and not for any unauthorized 
      purpose; </p>
    <p><span> </span>(c)      to protect the privacy of individuals with respect 
      to personal information about themselves, safeguards must be placed on </p>

lang=EN-GB>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The offender has a residual interest in the use 
  that will be made of the sample taken.  The legislation meets the concern expressed 
  by La Forest J. in <i>R. v. Dyment </i>(1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 244 (S.C.C.) that 
  the <i>use</i> to which the information is put must conform to the purpose for 
  which the information was taken.  In that case, a doctor took a blood sample 
  from the accused for medical purposes and later handed it over to the police.  
  The Court stated that a contextual analysis was appropriate and, following this 
  analysis, concluded that the appellant had a reasonable expectation that the 
  blood sample would be used only for the medical purposes for which it had been 
  given.  For the state to use the blood sample for a different purpose, that 
  is, evidence that he had committed an offence constituted a seizure that violated 
  s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The following passage by La Forest J. at 255-256 
  encapsulates the reasoning of the court:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Finally, there is privacy in relation to information.  This too is based 
      on the notion of the dignity of the individual.  … ‘This notion of privacy 
      derives from the assumption that all information about a person is in a 
      fundamental way his own, for him to communicate or retain for himself as 
      he sees fit.’ In modern society, especially, retention of information about 
      oneself is extremely important.  We may, for one reason or another, wish 
      or be compelled to reveal such information, but situations abound where 
      the reasonable expectations of the individual that the information shall 
      remain confidential to the persons to whom, and restricted to the purposes 
      for which it is divulged, must be protected<i>.</i>  Governments at all 
      levels have in recent years recognized this and have devised rules and regulations 
      to restrict the uses of information collected by them to those for which 
      it was obtained:  see for example, the <i>Privacy Act</i>,<i> </i> S.C. 
      1980-81-82-83 c.111 (Sch. II.).</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The DNA legislation addresses the concern in <i>Dyment</i> with 
  respect to the use of information in the following ways.  The convicted offender’s 
  DNA profile is tested in a way that does not reveal intimate details about the 
  individual.  The penalties for the misuse of information obtained as a result 
  of an order to provide DNA recognize that an offender has the right not to have 
  the information contained in the sample used for a purpose other than that authorized 
  by law.  The <i>Criminal Code</i> restricts the uses to which the results of 
  the analysis of the sample may be put.  The results of the analysis cannot be 
  used except to transmit them to the Commissioner of the R.C.M.P. (s.&nbsp;487.08).  
  The <i>Act </i>also controls the use to which the information can be put.  As 
  I have indicated in the portion of this judgment dealing with the background 
  structure of the DNA data bank, the DNA profile is placed in a convicted offenders 
  index.  The profiles from the convicted offenders index are compared to those 
  in the crime scene index.  If a match is obtained, the fact that there is a 
  match may be used in an application by a police officer to obtain a DNA warrant 
  for a fresh sample of a bodily substance from the named individual.  Non-compliance 
  with the <i>Act</i> by inappropriate use of the sample obtained is a punishable 
  offence under s. 11 of that Act.  The privacy concern in the use to which information 
  may be put is addressed in the legislation by the limitation as to the use of 
  the information and by the penalties attached to misuse of DNA information.  
  In addition, if an offender’s conviction is quashed and a final acquittal is 
  entered or a conditional or absolute discharge is obtained, the sample must 
  be destroyed.<i></i></p>
<i>Implication</i> 
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The interpretation of s. 482.052 suggested by the appellant is 
  unwarranted and unnecessary.  It is unwarranted because the purposes, context 
  and expectations of privacy when a DNA order is made are all different from 
  those of a search warrant.  To read in the words “reasonable and probable grounds 
  to believe that an offence will be committed in the future”, as suggested by 
  the appellant, would result in giving the legislation a meaning that would undermine 
  some of its purposes and that would not be in the public interest.  It is  unnecessary 
  to apply the search warrant standard of reasonable and probable grounds to s. 
  487.052 to give it an interpretation that is consistent with the <i>Charter</i>.  
  While there is an interference with bodily integrity, that interference is required 
  by the legislation to be reasonable in the circumstances and is a proportionate 
  response to the objectives of the legislation.  The uses to which the sample 
  obtained pursuant to court order may be put are also limited in recognition 
  of the individual’s privacy interests. Both the taking of the sample pursuant 
  to s. 487.052 and its use are consistent with the <i>Charter</i> without adopting 
  the interpretation proposed by the appellant.  A careful case-by-case consideration 
  of the issue of whether a sample should be taken is preferable to the blanket 
  standard proposed by the appellant. </p>

  relation to its objectives and that one of the criteria in the legislation, 
  the interests of the administration of justice, is a standardless sweep.  For 
  this reason, the appellant submits that, although the requirement of reasonable 
  and probable grounds to make the order are not contained in s. 487.052, it is 
  necessary to import them into the phrase, “best interests of the administration 
  of justice”.  In support of its position, the appellant relies on decisions 
  in which the constitutionality of legislation was challenged such as <i>R. v. 
  Heywood </i>(1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 516; <i>R. v. Morales </i>(1992),

  23 C.C.C. (3d) 48 (Ont. C.A.).  Although the court has not been asked to declare

  J. in <i>Eaton v. Brant County Board of Education </i>(1996), 142 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  385 (S.C.C.) at 400.  He stated that the power to declare legislation invalid 
  that contravenes the <i>Charter</i> and that is not saved under s. 1 can only 
  be exercised after a full opportunity has been given to the government to support 
  its validity.  In making that decision, it is also important that the court 
  have the benefit of a record that is the result of a thorough examination of 
  the constitutional issues.  Here, notice of a constitutional question was not 
  given until after the appeal was filed and the court does not have the benefit 
  of an examination of the constitutional issues in the court of first instance.

  </span></span> As I understand the appellant’s position, it is that by using 
  the language, “in the best interests of the administration of justice”, Parliament 
  has conferred an imprecise discretion on judges.  An imprecise discretion must 
  be interpreted by not allowing <i>Charter</i> rights to be infringed:  <i>Slaight 
  Communications Inc. v. Davidson </i>(1989), 59 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 416 (S.C.C.).  
  In the context of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, the analysis is two-fold.  First, 
  there must be a finding that there has been a deprivation of life, liberty or 
  security of the person.  Secondly, there must be a finding that that deprivation 
  is contrary to principles of fundamental justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the phrase “best interests of the 
  administration of justice” must be read as importing reasonable and probable 
  grounds to believe that  a further offence will be or, alternatively, I would 
  add, has been committed.   If this is done the standard will not be imprecise 
  but clear in accordance with s.&nbsp;7.  In support of this submission, the 
  appellant relies on the decision of this court in<i> R. v. Finlay and Grellette</i>, 
  <i>supra</i> at 70-72, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1986] 1 S.C.R. ix, 
  where Martin J.A. did exactly that.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s submission, however, again ignores the context 
  with which Martin J.A. was dealing.  In <i>Finlay and Grellette</i>,<i> </i>the 
  court was dealing with an application to intercept a private communication and 
  the court was sensitive to the potential that the legislation not be interpreted 
  in a way that authorized fishing expeditions based on mere suspicion.  Martin 
  J.A. held that countenancing fishing expeditions on the basis of mere suspicion 
  would not <i>further </i>the best interests of the administration of justice 
  but would bring them into disrepute.  Consequently, he interpreted the legislation 
  as requiring reasonable grounds to believe that an offence had been or was being 
  committed.  Martin&nbsp;J.A. was careful to state that his interpretation was 
  made  “… in the context of the legislative scheme”.  He stated at pp. 70&#8209;71:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Thus, it appears to me that the prerequisite that the judge must be satisfied 
      that it would be in the best interests of the administration of justice 
      to grant the authorization <i>in the context of the legislative scheme </i>imports 
      as a minimum requirement that the authorizing judge must be satisfied that 
      there are reasonable grounds to believe that that a particular offence or 
      a conspiracy, attempt or incitement to commit it has been, or is being, 
      committed.”  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> Although the phrase “best interests of the administration of 
  justice” cannot be precisely defined, it takes its meaning from the context 
  in which it is found.  In <i>Finlay and Grellette</i>, the court was dealing 
  with a pre-prosecution situation that dealt with the rights of innocent persons.  
  In the DNA context the court is assessing a post-conviction context as it impacts 
  on offenders convicted of serious crimes who might be a concern to the safety 
  of the community. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The comments of Martin J.A. in <i>Finlay and Grellette</i>,<i> 
  supra</i>,<i> </i>are nevertheless instructive.  At p.&nbsp;70, he stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Although the term “in the best interests of the administration of justice” 
      is incapable of precise definition it imports, in my view, in the context, 
      two readily identifiable and mutually supportive components.  The first 
      component is that the judge must be satisfied that the granting of the authorization 
      will <i>further or advance</i> the objectives of justice.  The second component 
      imports a balancing of the interests of law enforcement and the individual’s 
      interest in privacy. [Emphasis in original.]</p>

lang=EN-GB>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The exercise of discretion after balancing competing interests 
  is a role that judges are frequently called upon to perform.  For example, a 
  judge may make an order appointing counsel to assist an appellant with an appeal 
  pursuant to s. 684(1) of the <i>Code</i>, if to do so is in the “interests of 
  justice”.  In <i>R. v. Bernardo </i>(1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 123 at 131 (Ont. 
  C.A.), Doherty J.A. held that the use of the phrase, “interests of justice”, 
  is found throughout the <i>Criminal Code</i> and denotes the existence of a 
  judicial discretion to be exercised on a case-by-case basis by balancing the 
  interests of society against the specific interests of a particular accused.  
  The balancing of competing interests is required in many other contexts as well, 
  such as in deciding whether a conditional sentence should be imposed.  The discretion 
  to exclude evidence contained in s.&nbsp;24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> where its 
  admission “would bring the administration of justice into disrepute” also involves 
  the exercise of discretion and consideration of circumstances that detract from, 
  as opposed to furthering, the administration of justice.  Judges are well situated 
  to engage in these balancing exercises, to determine what promotes the interests 
  of the administration of justice:  <i>R. v. Proulx </i>(2000), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 
  449 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is another important difference between the interpretation 
  of the phrase, “best interests of the administration of justice” as it is used 
  with respect to the issuance of an authorization to intercept private communications 
  and s. 487.052.  In enacting legislation authorizing the interception of a private 
  communication, Parliament did not give guidance as to how the judge’s discretion 
  was to be exercised in determining the “best interests of the administration 
  of justice.”  Once the prerequisite that other investigative procedures have 
  either been, or would likely be, unsuccessful or impracticable, a judge may 
  make the order if  it “would be in the best interests of the administration 
  of justice to do so”.  By contrast, in s. 487.052 (2), Parliament has given 
  some general interpretative guidance to the phrase, “best interests of the administration 
  of justice”.   For convenience, I will repeat s.&nbsp;487.052(2):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In deciding whether to make the order, the court shall consider the criminal 
      record of the person or young person, the nature of the offence and the 
      circumstances surrounding its commission and the impact such an order would 
      have on  the person’s or young person’s privacy and security of the person 
      and shall give reasons for its decision.</p>
    <p>The portion of the section requiring that the impact of the order on the 
      offender’s privacy be assessed echoes the sentiments of Martin J.A.  In 
      addition, the court is given further specific guidance in the legislation 
      to consider the criminal record of the offender, the nature of the offence 
      and the circumstances of the crime.</p>

  </span></span> By enacting s. 487.052(2), Parliament has provided a basis on 
  which to review the exercise of a judge’s discretion respecting whether the 
  making of an order is in “the best interests of the administration of justice”.  
  See, by analogy, <i>R. v. Hall </i>(2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 257 (Ont. C.A.), leave

  Toronto Shiatsu massage parlour.  After entering the massage parlour, the appellant 
  produced an imitation sawed-off shotgun, which had been concealed inside his 
  coat.  The appellant’s accomplice produced a knife.  While brandishing the imitation 
  firearm at the victim, the appellant removed $590.00 in cash from the till and 
  took the victim’s watch, chain and cell phone (the total value of which was 
  $400.00).  The appellant and his accomplice then fled the premises.  There were 
  no injuries to any of the parties involved.  The incident was investigated by 
  the Toronto Police Service Hold-Up Squad.  The appellant was identified from 
  images recorded by a surveillance video camera located at the scene and a warrant 
  for his arrest was issued.  This incident gave rise to the charges of robbery 
  and use of an imitation firearm in the commission of an indictable offence.</p>

  The appellant fled but was apprehended a short distance away.  The appellant 
  was  found in possession of a key for a stolen car.  That vehicle was parked 
  in the driveway of the residence that was the target of the break and enter.  
  The appellant was arrested in relation to this incident but was not charged 
  with breaking and entering, a secondary designated offence.  He was instead 
  charged with possession of property over $5,000 obtained by crime.  The appellant 
  initially gave a false name to the police but upon being identified through 
  his fingerprints he was arrested on the outstanding warrant for the October 
  9, 1999 robbery, a secondary designated offence.  In argument before us, the 
  appellant’s counsel laid great stress on the fact that the robbery was the appellant’s 
  only conviction for a designated offence. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge’s reasons for making the order 
  are as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>… I am going to order the taking of the sample.  The legislation that underlies 
      the sections in the Code which allow me to make that order is the <i>DNA 
      Identification Act</i>, which sets out certain principles in s. 4, the first 
      of which is that the protection of society and the administration of justice 
      are well-served by the early detection, arrest, and conviction of offenders 
      which can be facilitated by the use of DNA profiles, and I have taken that 
      principle into consideration in assessing whether I should make the order 
      here.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>I have also looked at the section of the Code, 
      s.&nbsp;487.05(2), which governs your situation.  Of course it sets out 
      that the considerations which I need to look at are your criminal record, 
      the nature and circumstances of the offence in question, and the impact 
      that the order would have on your privacy and security of the person.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>With respect to the offence and the circumstances, 
      it’s obviously a very serious one, which involved your co-accused using 
      a knife, and you being in possession of an imitation sawed-off shotgun, 
      and the – I needn’t elaborate, I think, on the seriousness of the offenses.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>With respect to your record, there’s a 1998 entry 
      for possession of a weapon, and a 1999 entry for possession of an unregistered 
      restricted weapon, and those are serious, as well, especially in view of 
      the fact that this new offence involved weapons.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>Now, with respect to the third criteria, namely 
      your right to privacy and security, in my view, the Code is suggesting that 
      a balance be struck between the consideration of the offence in the circumstances, 
      and your record, and your right to privacy and security, and I don’t agree 
      that the test is that the State, through the Crown, should have reasonable 
      and probable grounds as your lawyer has suggested.  I’m not sure how to 
      articulate the test, other than to say that, in my view, it’s a balancing 
      of the different interests that are set out.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>Here, because of the severity of the offence, 
      the fact that there were weapons involved, and coupled with the fact that 
      your record contains those two prior weapons offenses, I conclude that balancing 
      those factors, with your right to privacy and security of the person, it’s 
      appropriate for me to make the order for the taking of the DNA sample, and 
      I am going to do that.</p>

  offence prior to the coming into force of the legislation is a consideration

  provided for the judge to exercise his discretion to make an order in the present 
  circumstances.  In addition, one of the purposes of s. 3 the <i>Act</i> is to 
  assist law enforcement agencies in identifying persons alleged to have committed

  the offender’s privacy is disproportionate to the public interest.  The appellant 
  submits that a judge should be more reluctant to make an order requiring the 
  offender to give a sample of  DNA with respect to a secondary designated offence 
  than with respect to a primary designated offence. Each case must turn on its 
  own facts.  I would simply note that with respect to primary designated offences 
  the onus is on the offender to show that an order for the taking of a sample

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant’s record indicates that he had 
  never been convicted of a primary or secondary designated offence prior to the 
  date he was convicted of robbery. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant has submitted that the authorizing judge ought 
  not to have made a DNA data bank order unless he was satisfied that there are 
  reasonable and probable grounds that the appellant would likely commit a  crime 
  in the future.  I have already given my reasons for rejecting this argument.  
  Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, the argument is simply inapplicable.  
  At the time the offender pleaded guilty to the offence of robbery, he also pleaded 
  guilty to the offence of possession of stolen property in excess of $5,000, 
  an offence committed several months after the robbery offence.  Thus, at the 
  time that the authorizing judge made the DNA data bank order relative to the 
  offence in respect to which the Crown sought the order, he did not have to consider 
  whether the offender was likely to commit a future offence.  He knew that the 
  offender had already committed a further offence and that this offence was again 
  a property related offence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I appreciate, in considering the criminal record of an accused 
  person with respect to sentence, that a judge is only entitled to look to the 
  record of offences prior to the date of the offence for which the offender is 
  being sentenced: <i>R. v. Garcia and Silva</i>, [1970] 1 O.R. 821 at 823 (C.A.).  
  A DNA data bank order is not, however, a sentence and does not require the same 
  safeguards to be in place.  A DNA order is not a punishment and should not be 
  treated as one: see <i>R. v. McIntyre</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 3939 (C.J.).  Consequently, 
  an authorizing judge may take into consideration the entire criminal record 
  of the offender, including whether the offender has been convicted of further 
  offences committed after the date of the offence on which the application is 
  based and the nature of those offences. </p>
<p>(2)            The nature of the offence</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Secondary designated offences can be roughly grouped into five 
  categories which are not intended to be hierarchical.  These are:  (1) offences 
  related to violence or the threat of violence to the person:  assault, torture, 
  assaulting a peace officer, hostage taking, robbery, arson and using explosives 
  (depending on the circumstances); (2) other offences against the person:  causing 
  death or harm by criminal negligence, dangerous operation of a motor vehicle 
  causing bodily harm or death, mischief that causes actual danger to life; (3) 
  sexual offences mostly relating to children not included as primary designated 
  offences:  bestiality in the presence of or by a child, child pornography, parent 
  or guardian procuring sexual activity, indecent acts; (4)&nbsp;offences relating 
  to public safety:  hijacking, endangering safety of aircraft or airport, seizing 
  control of ship or fixed platform; and (5) property offences:  piratical acts, 
  breaking and entering with intent, committing offence of breaking out, and arson 
  (respecting one’s own property.)  With one exception, all of the offences are 
  either indictable offences or hybrid offences.  The exception is the commission 
  of an indecent act for a sexual purpose by exposure of one’s genitals to a person 
  under 14 years of age, an offence that is only punishable by summary conviction. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The nature of the offence here relates to that group of offences 
  that involve violence or the threat of violence to the person.  The offence 
  of robbery is also related to those in the category of property offences. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant submitted that the nature of the offence 
  was not the type of offence where DNA would be left behind.  The trial judge 
  commented that he did not see the relevance of the submission. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Whether or not there is evidence at the scene of a crime that 
  would likely yield a DNA profile of the perpetrator of the crime if subjected 
  to analysis is a relevant consideration in the decision whether or not to issue 
  a search warrant.  Inasmuch as the purpose of a DNA search warrant is the gathering 
  of evidence for use in a particular prosecution, whether there is DNA at the 
  scene of  the crime is a relevant consideration.  The underlying purpose of 
  a DNA data bank warrant is, as I have indicated, much broader and the existence 
  of DNA at the scene of the crime may, but will not necessarily be, a relevant 
  consideration.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In most of the early cases in which forensic DNA evidence was 
  used to solve crimes, the crime scene DNA was derived from either blood or semen 
  clearly present at the scene or upon the victim.  Technology has now developed 
  to the point where microscopic deposits of biological substances can yield a 
  DNA profile.  See G.M. Chayko et al., <i>Forensic Evidence in Canada</i>, (Aurora: 
  Canada Law Book, 1999) at  297. In addition, there is a wide variety of situations 
  in which an offender may leave a sample of DNA that is unrelated to the nature 
  of the crime (chewing gum, used Kleenex tissue, sweat on objects touched, etc.).  
  The trial judge did not err in ignoring the fact that no DNA appears to have 
  been left at the scene of the robbery.</p>

  </span></span> There was no gratuitous violence committed during the robbery.  
  While the appellant did not himself wield the knife used in the robbery to which 
  he was a party, included in the appellant’s record are two weapons offences.  
  The trial judge noted the weapons convictions in the appellant’s record and 
  related them to the fact that the robbery of which the appellant had been convicted 
  involved the use of a weapon.  The trial judge is entitled to look at the appellant’s 
  entire record, not just the crimes that may be designated offences.  I cannot 
  say it was inappropriate for the trial judge to relate the criminal record of 
  the appellant concerning the weapons convictions to the robbery in considering 
  whether to make a DNA data bank order.  One of the purposes of the DNA data 
  bank is to promote the safety of the community.  The trial judge’s approach 
  indicates that he did not consider each of the factors in isolation but rather 
  that he considered them together and related them to one another.  It was appropriate 
  for him to take this approach.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>In </span><i><span lang=EN-GB>R. 
  v. F.(S.)</span></i>, this court upheld the constitutionality of the DNA search 
  warrant provisions.  In doing so, Finlayson&nbsp;J.A. agreed with the trial 
  judge, Hill&nbsp;J., that the individual’s interests of bodily integrity, dignity 
  and privacy were considerations in assessing the reasonableness of a seizure 
  under s.&nbsp;8.  In regard to the individual’s privacy interest, Finlayson&nbsp;J.A., 
  at p.&nbsp;240, adopted the findings of Hill J. that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>On the evidence, the seizure procedures are of short duration and involve 
      no or minimal discomfort.  There [are] neither inhumane nor abusive tactics.  
      The legislation does not authorize state conduct which is brutal, humiliating 
      or psychologically offensive.  The seizure methodology leaves no lasting 
      impression and does not risk the health of the subject.  In short, there 
      is minimal intrusion with no unacceptable affront to human dignity. </p>

  </span></span> There is no evidence here to suggest that the result would be 
  any different.  <span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>If, for example, a buccal 
  swab is taken, or hairs from the head are plucked, the taking, like</span> fingerprinting, 
  would ordinarily be of short duration, would not involve an undue incursion

  </span></span> The offender has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 
  18 months for the robbery and an additional consecutive term of 12 months for 
  the use of an imitation weapon in relation to the same offence, for a total 
  sentence of 30 months in the penitentiary.  It is likely that routine searches 
  of the appellant when he enters the prison or if he leaves it on a pass will 
  result in his being subjected to greater and more intrusive bodily interference 
  than that involved in the taking of a sample of bodily substance for DNA analysis.

lang=EN-GB>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The authorizing judge realized that he had to weigh the impact 
  of the DNA data bank order on the appellant’s right to privacy against his criminal 
  record, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding the offence.  
  While he may not have articulated all of the considerations that he could have, 
  he concluded that balancing those factors the DNA data bank order should be 
  made.  In particular, having regard to the fact that weapons were involved in 
  the robbery, and that the appellant had previously been convicted of two weapons 
  offences, he concluded that the appellant’s privacy interests were outweighed 
  and that it would be appropriate to make the order.  I cannot say that he erred 
  in principle in doing so.  </p>
