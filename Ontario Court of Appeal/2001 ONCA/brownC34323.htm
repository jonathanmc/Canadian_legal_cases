<h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h3>
<p>RE:                              HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. PARNELL 
  BROWN (Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE:                   DOHERTY, ROSENBERG and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL:                Andras Schreck for the appellant</p>
<p>                                    Rick Visca for the respondent</p>
<p>HEARD:                     July 11, 2001</p>
<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice R. Bigelow dated January 28, 
  2000.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant submits that Mr. Broome, an employer of Purolator, acted 
  as agent for the police when he opened the package containing cocaine and that 
  the search contravened s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Counsel does not argue that 
  if the opening of the package did not contravene s. 8, the officer’s subsequent 
  seizure of the contents from Mr. Broome did violate that section.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It was clear from his evidence [Mr. Broome] that he had no intention of 
      allowing the package to either be shipped further or to be returned to the 
      sender without further inspection.  I have no doubt that he would have opened 
      the package whatever the police officer indicated to him.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Broome’s evidence supports this finding.  Mr. Broome had concluded 
  that the package fit the profile of a package containing contraband.  In his 
  opinion, and the correctness of this opinion is irrelevant for the purposes 
  of this argument, Mr. Broome had “an obligation not to let this sort of stuff 
  go through our system”.  The police officer declined to open the package and 
  advised Mr. Broome that the police did not have reasonable and probable grounds 
  to obtain a search warrant.  Mr. Broome in the presence of the police officer, 
  but acting on what he perceived to be his company’s obligation, proceeded to 
  open the package, discover the cocaine and turn that cocaine over to the police.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge specifically rejected the argument that the officer 
  encouraged Mr. Broome to open the package.  The officer’s conduct, as found 
  by the trial judge, far from creating any agency relationship between the officer 
  and Mr. Broome, left Mr. Broome to make his own decision as to what to do with 
  the package.  Mr. Broome acted in what he perceived to be his company’s best 
  interest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On this record, there is no basis upon which it could be said that the 
  officer’s failure to stop Mr. Broome from opening the package somehow made Mr. 
  Broome his agent, or that Mr. Broome’s conduct amounted to the crime of mischief.</p>
