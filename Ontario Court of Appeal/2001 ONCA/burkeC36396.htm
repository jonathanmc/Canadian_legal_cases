<p><b>On appeal from the sentence imposed by Justice B. M. Kelly dated April 25, 
  2001.</b></p>
<h2 align="center"><span style='font-size:16.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>
<h3 align="center"><span style='font-weight:normal'>Released Orally August 9, 
  2001</span></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant appeals his sentence of nine months 
  plus three years probation in addition to six months of pre-trial custody, which 
  the trial judge treated as equivalent to a sentence of one year. The Crown had 
  sought a sentence of 12 months imprisonment in addition to the pre-trial custody, 
  while the position of the defence was that the appropriate sentence was one 
  of time served plus probation.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant was 19, and had a single prior 
  conviction, registered a year earlier, for failing to comply with a recognizance, 
  for which he had been sentenced to one day imprisonment in addition to 14 days 
  of pre-trial custody. As well he had a prior discharge for possession of marijuana.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The agreed-upon facts were that the appellant 
  had been found hiding in a closet in a vacant Metro Housing apartment, where 
  a party had been in progress with at least fifty people in attendance. He was 
  in possession of a loaded .22 calibre handgun. There were nine bullets in the 
  chamber. A live bullet and a spent cartridge were also in his possession.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Emphasizing the dangerous circumstances surrounding 
  the possession of the loaded handgun, the trial judge concluded that the overriding 
  principle in determining the appropriate sentence was that of general deterrence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We have heard fresh evidence on the appeal, 
  in the form of an affidavit from the appellant’s mother, which asserts, among 
  other things, that he is remorseful for his actions, and confirms that he intends 
  to return to school in October to continue his education. In order to do so, 
  he must register in person on September 14.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Sentence was imposed on April 25, and the appellant 
  has therefore served about three and one-half months of his nine-month sentence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We are all of the view that had the trial judge 
  had the additional information before him, he would have placed greater emphasis 
  upon the rehabilitation of the appellant. Accordingly, we are of the view that 
  the interests of justice would be served if the sentence were reduced so that 
  the appellant can return to his studies in the fall. Leave to appeal is granted, 
  and the sentence is reduced to six months imprisonment in addition to the six 
  months of pre-trial custody. The probation order will stand.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The respondent concedes that the lifetime weapons 
  prohibition was imposed without jurisdiction. It is therefore set aside, and 
  a ten year weapons prohibition is substituted, pursuant to s.110(2) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code.</i></span></p>
