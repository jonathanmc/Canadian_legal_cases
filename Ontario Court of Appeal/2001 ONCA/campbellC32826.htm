<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice James C. MacPherson, 
  with a jury, dated May&nbsp;21, 1999.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>WEILER J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant appeals his conviction on one count of second-degree 
  murder.  The grounds of appeal are that the verdict is unreasonable and that 
  the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury in three respects: (1) the instruction 
  on circumstantial evidence; (2) the omission to charge the jury on the included 
  offence of manslaughter; and (3) the omission to charge the jury on cross-racial 
  identification.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In order to appreciate the submissions with respect to the omission 
  to charge the jury on cross-racial identification and the reasonableness of 
  the verdict, a brief summary of the evidence is helpful.  Ross Pardy and his 
  brother, Jeff, purchased crack cocaine from a group of young black men in a 
  residential area of Toronto known as Parma Court. Jeff Pardy argued that he 
  had not been given enough crack whereupon the drug dealer knocked the crack 
  that had been purchased out of Jeff’s hand with a double-edged knife.  The brothers 
  left, shouting insults at the group.  Two of the group members chased the brothers, 
  who ran off in different directions.  The brothers reunited near the corner 
  of O’Connor Drive and Wakunda Place and continued to run south on O’Connor.  
  During the pursuit, Jeff looked back and saw Ross on the ground with a man wearing 
  a fisherman’s hat standing near him.  Jeff came up to the man, recognized him 
  as being the drug dealer, and told him not to do anything stupid.  Without responding, 
  the man jogged off.  Ross stood up and the two brothers continued to run.  Shortly 
  thereafter, Ross fell to the ground again and died.  The cause of death was 
  a single stab wound to the heart from a single-edged knife. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Jeff Pardy identified the appellant in a photo line-up as the 
  person with whom he had done the drug deal and the person who was standing near 
  Ross when he was on the ground.  Two other witnesses testified about the drug 
  transaction.  Troy Bradshaw testified that he, Tunji Balogun, Jason Carmichael, 
  and the appellant were at Parma Court when two white men approached them looking 
  for crack.  Balogun and the appellant ran after the men.  At trial, Carmichael 
  testified that he was not at Parma Court that night.  In a KGB statement admitted 
  at trial, Carmichael said the brothers purchased drugs from the appellant that 
  night.  In cross-examination, Carmichael said the dealer could have been Balogun.  
</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Balogun testified and said that he was at the Palace that night 
  and later at a barbecue.  He denied any knowledge of the events in question 
  until brought in by the police for questioning.  Both Bradshaw and Carmichael 
  testified that Balogun returned to the Parma Court area and told them to make 
  up a lie in case the police questioned them. Campbell did not return to the 
  Parma Court complex afterwards. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The identity of the murderer was vigorously contested at trial, 
  the position of the defence being that it was Balogun who had done the killing.  
  The appellant did not testify at trial.  There was no objection to the charge 
  on identification evidence at trial.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s position is that Jeff Pardy’s identification 
  evidence was flawed, there is no forensic evidence linking the appellant to 
  the killing, and the weight of the evidence points away from the appellant and 
  towards Balogun.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the course of his charge, the trial judge highlighted the 
  weaknesses in Jeff Pardy’s identification evidence, and specifically pointed 
  out the defence’s contention that the description of the perpetrator was generic 
  in that “many of the features described by Mr. Pardy are features that would 
  be shared by a great many people in the population of Toronto.” It would have 
  been appropriate for the trial judge to have given the jury an explicit instruction 
  with respect to the risks of cross-racial identification.  However, having regard 
  to the very thorough charge respecting the weaknesses in the identification 
  evidence and the caution respecting identification based on generic characteristics, 
  the fact that the trial judge did not specifically charge the jury on the risks 
  of cross-racial identification was not an error.  Pardy did not pick out just 
  anyone in the photo line-up; he picked out a person who, on the evidence of 
  independent witnesses, was present during the drug transaction and ran after 
  him and his brother.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It was open to the jury to find that the person standing over 
  Ross Pardy had just stabbed him and that the person was the appellant.  While 
  this was not an overwhelming case for the Crown, it was one that a properly 
  instructed jury acting judicially could reasonably have rendered.  The verdict 
  was not unreasonable.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I shall now turn to the instruction respecting circumstantial 
  evidence.  The trial judge instructed the jury that circumstantial evidence 
  is evidence that “proves a fact from which an inference of existence of another 
  fact may be drawn.” Defence counsel at trial objected to the adequacy of the 
  charge on circumstantial evidence.  The trial judge declined to give further 
  instructions to the jury.  The appellant submits that such an explanation dilutes 
  the instruction on reasonable doubt as it precludes the jury from drawing inferences 
  favourable to the counsel unless the facts from which such inference are drawn 
  are “proved”. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The definition of circumstantial evidence is 
  discussed by Sopinka, Lederman, and Bryant in <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>, 
  2<sup>nd</sup> Ed. (1999), at p. 38:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>A fact in issue cannot always be proved by direct evidence.  ….The facts 
      in issue must, in many cases, be established by proof of other facts….If 
      sufficient other facts are proved, the court may “from the circumstances” 
      infer that the fact in issue exists or does not exist.  In such a case, 
      proof is said to be circumstantial.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Circumstantial evidence in the criminal context is any 
      circumstance which may or may not tend to implicate the accused in the commission 
      of the offence for which the accused is charged.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>The Law of Evidence</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> 
  Ed. (1999) at 21, Paciocco and Stuesser state:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Testimony of a witness that “the accused is the man who robbed my store” 
      is direct evidence that the accused is the robber.  Circumstantial evidence, 
      by contrast, requires inferences to be drawn before it is of use in resolving 
      material issues.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with counsel for the appellant that, although a verdict of guilty 
  must be based on accepted facts, a verdict of not guilty need not be based on 
  any facts.  The jury need only have a reasonable doubt on the evidence.  It 
  would have been preferable for the trial judge to adopt an instruction to the 
  jury that did not make reference to proving facts such as that found in Paciocco 
  and Stuesser.  If reference was to be made to facts in defining circumstantial 
  evidence, the approach adopted in Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant should have been 
  used.  In addition to telling the jury that circumstantial evidence could lead 
  to an inference that a fact does exist, the trial judge should have told the 
  jury that circumstantial evidence may also lead to an inference a fact does 
  not exist.  I would note, however, that in <i>R. v. Tombran </i>(2000), 142 
  C.C.C. (3d) 380 at 392, this Court rejected a formulaic approach to circumstantial 
  evidence in favour of one that deals with all evidence in terms of reasonable 
  doubt.  The essential point is to convey to the jury the necessity to find the 
  guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The context in which the trial judge’s instruction was given is important.  
  In defining direct evidence, the trial judge told the jury that if they accepted 
  what a witness saw or heard “that in itself is proof of the fact as to what 
  the witness saw or heard if you accept it.”  The trial judge followed this by 
  telling the jury that direct evidence was subject to human frailty particularly 
  with respect to remembering things exactly and that they must bear this in mind 
  when examining the direct evidence in the case.  The trial judge then told the 
  jury, “… the testimony of a single witness whom you believe is [sic] proof of 
  any fact to which he or she testified.”  At this point the trial judge defined 
  circumstantial evidence for the jury.  It was in the context of discussing with 
  the jury the evidence that they believed that the impugned passage in the charge 
  was made.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The impugned passage should not be taken out of context and in 
  isolation.  Shortly before the instruction on direct and circumstantial evidence, 
  the trial judge had carefully explained the concept of reasonable doubt for 
  the jury, including telling them that a reasonable doubt could be based on the 
  evidence or the absence of evidence.  In my opinion, the jury could not have 
  been misled with respect to the burden of proof as a result of the trial judge’s 
  comments.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal is dismissed.<span lang=EN-US> 
  </span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The final issue is whether the trial judge erred in not charging 
  the jury with respect to the availability of the included verdict of manslaughter.  
  Defence counsel did not request any such instruction at the brief pre-charge 
  conference nor object to the lack of any instruction afterwards.  The appellant 
  submits that it was nevertheless incumbent on the trial judge to instruct the 
  jury on manslaughter.  I agree that where there is evidence on which a jury 
  could convict of an included offence, the trial judge is under a duty to properly 
  instruct the jury on that included offence even if that issue is not raised 
  by the accused.  If there is evidence on which a properly instructed and reasonable 
  jury could have convicted of manslaughter, the jury should have been instructed 
  on the included offence.  However, there must be some evidence sufficient to 
  give an air of reality to a defence before the obligation to put the defence 
  arises:  <i>R. v. Osolin</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595; <i>R. v. Brisson</i>, [1982] 
  2 S.C.R. 227.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s submission is based on the evidence of Dr. Sepp, 
  the forensic pathologist who performed the autopsy on Ross Pardy.  He found 
  the cause of death to be a single stab wound to the heart.  In answer to the 
  question as to the amount of force that would be required to cause that type 
  of injury, he replied:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Not much force, depends on the sharpness of the object, 
      how sharp the cutting edge is, how sharp the tip is and so on, but not much 
      force is required because it went through the soft tissues and in terms 
      of the rib it went through the cartilage part which there is no bone there 
      and it will go through rather easily.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that, because there was no evidence as 
  to how the stabbing occurred, the facts are equally consistent with unlawful 
  assault manslaughter.  In other words, the jury could have had a reasonable 
  doubt that the killer meant to cause the appellant serious bodily harm that 
  he knew was likely to cause his death and was reckless whether death ensued 
  or not. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The stab wound that killed Ross Pardy penetrated thirteen centimetres 
  into his body, piercing the sack that surrounds the heart, the left ventricle 
  of the heart, the heart itself, and the back part of the sack around the heart.  
  As the trial judge stated, “In short, the stab wound received by Mr. Pardy was 
  both pronounced and deep.”  In my opinion, in the circumstances of this case, 
  there was no air of reality to the included offence of manslaughter, and the 
  trial judge did not err in omitting to charge the jury on it.  The main issue 
  at trial was identity.  This ground of appeal is also dismissed. </p>
