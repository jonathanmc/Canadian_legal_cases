<p class=headingtitle>On appeal from the judgment of the Divisional Court dated 
  July 4, 2000 (Justice Douglas Coo and Justice William Somers for the majority,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the fall of 1996, the appellant, Canada Post Corporation (Canada 
  Post), received complaints from customers alleging widespread theft from the 
  mail at its Gateway facility in Mississauga, Ontario.  Covert video surveillance 
  provided the only effective means of investigating these complaints.  Hidden 
  cameras were installed at the Gateway facility in February 1997 by Canada Post 
  security personnel and remained in operation until June 7, 1997.  During that 
  surveillance, a number of employees were captured on videotape apparently stealing 
  from the mail and engaging in other criminal activity involving the mail.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The employees who were allegedly involved in these criminal activities 
  were identified from the videotape at various times throughout the four-month 
  period during which video surveillance was conducted.  No steps were taken to 
  fire these employees, or to notify them of their alleged misconduct until after 
  the video surveillance was terminated on June 7, 1997.  Disclosure to individual 
  employees prior to the termination of the video surveillance would obviously 
  have compromised the ongoing covert investigation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Canada Post’s investigation was completed on June 7, 1997 and the results 
  were turned over by the Canada Post security personnel to the Peel Regional 
  Police on June 8, 1997.  Charges were laid against numerous employees on or 
  about June 12, 1997.  Within a few days those employees who were charged were 
  suspended and fired.  They were advised in writing that their dismissals related 
  to the circumstances giving rise to the charges laid against them.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Twenty-nine of the discharged employees grieved their dismissals.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  Their grievances were held in abeyance pending 
  the outcome of criminal proceedings.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  The grievance procedures 
  were commenced before Arbitrator Burkett in 1999.  By way of preliminary ruling 
  he held that Article 10.02 of the Collective Agreement between Canada Post and 
  the respondent, Canadian Union of Postal Workers (the Union), required that 
  an employee receive notice of any alleged misconduct relied on as a basis for 
  firing that employee within 10 days of Canada Post learning of the misconduct.  
  Arbitrator Burkett held that if proper notice was not given, Canada Post could 
  not rely on the alleged misconduct to justify the dismissal of an employee.  
  Based on this interpretation of Article 10.02, Arbitrator Burkett ordered 19 
  of the 29 grievors reinstated.  He further directed that the arbitrations with 
  respect to the remaining 10 grievors proceed on their merits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Canada Post moved for judicial review.  The majority of the Divisional 
  Court (Coo and Somers JJ.) in reasons reported at (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 448 dismissed 
  the application.  Molloy J. dissented, holding that the arbitrator’s interpretation 
  of Article 10.02 led to an absurdity and was patently unreasonable in that there 
  were at least two other interpretations of the provision that did not yield 
  an absurd result.  She would have quashed the award of Arbitrator Burkett and 
  directed that the arbitrations proceed on their merits before a different arbitrator.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'> [6]<span

<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the reasons that follow, I agree with the conclusion reached by 
  Molloy J. and would allow the appeal and direct that the arbitrations proceed 
  on their merits.  However, I see no reason why the court should order that arbitrations 
  proceed before a different arbitrator.</p>

  </span> Arbitrator Burkett’s decision turned on his interpretation of Article 
  10.02 of the Collective Agreement.  There are two aspects to that interpretation.  
  First, he held that absent compliance with the requirements of Article 10.02, 
  Canada Post could not lead evidence of the alleged criminal activities of the 
  employees.  Compliance with Article 10.02 demanded that a report relating to 
  the alleged misconduct be placed in the employee’s personal file and that the 
  employee receive a copy of that report.  Both requirements had to be met within 
  10 days of the alleged infraction coming to the attention of Canada Post.  Second, 
  Arbitrator Burkett held that the employee’s “alleged infraction” (the criminal 
  activity captured on videotape) “came to the attention” of Canada Post when 
  it identified an individual employee from the videotape.  The 10-day notice 
  period referred to in Article 10.02(b) therefore began to toll as of that date.  
  Consequently, if an employee was identified from the videotape as having engaged 
  in criminal activity more than 10 days before the video surveillance was terminated, 
  that employee could not be fired for that misconduct because notice was not 
  given to him until after the video surveillance was stopped in June 1997.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is common ground that Arbitrator Burkett’s interpretation of Article 
  10.02, whereby compliance with that provision became a prerequisite to proof 
  of the misconduct relied on to justify the dismissal, is the same interpretation 
  that has been given to that provision by various arbitrators for the last 20 
  years.  Article 9.103 of the Collective Agreement provided that Canada Post 
  and the Union were bound by those prior decisions in “identical or substantially 
  identical circumstances”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Arbitrator Burkett further held that the circumstances did not justify 
  any delay in the commencement of the 10-day notice period set out in Article 
  10.02(b) beyond the date when individual employees were identified on the videotape 
  as being involved in criminal activity in relation to the mail.  He distinguished 
  prior decisions which had held that the 10-day period did not begin to run until 
  an investigation was complete and/or criminal charges laid on the ground that 
  none of those cases involved situations in which individuals had been positively 
  identified as having committed an alleged infraction.  Arbitrator Burkett also 
  distinguished the cases in which the 10-day period did not begin to run until 
  criminal charges were laid on the ground that those cases involved police investigations, 
  whereas this case involved an internal investigation conducted by  Canada Post.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Arbitrator Burkett’s interpretation of Article 10.02 left Canada Post 
  in a most difficult position when faced with allegations of widespread theft 
  from the mail that could only be effectively investigated by a covert operation 
  of some duration.  Canada Post could comply with Article 10.02 and give notice 
  to the first employee identified as engaging in criminal activity within 10 
  days of that identification, thereby destroying the effectiveness of the covert 
  investigation and forfeiting any opportunity to uncover the full scope of the 
  misconduct.  Or Canada Post could maintain the secrecy of the operation by not 
  giving notice to the employee until the end of the investigation.  If it chose 
  this option, Canada Post would forfeit its right to fire employees who were 
  caught stealing from the mail, if they were identified more than 10 days prior 
  to the completion of the investigation.  In short, Canada Post could fully investigate 
  the alleged thefts only if it was prepared to continue to employ at least some 
  of the thieves.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Arbitrator Burkett was alive to what he referred to as the “predicament 
  faced by the Corporation”.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… While the decision of the Corporation is understandable from a security 
      perspective, it was made in the face of article 10.02 and in the absence 
      of a single award upholding an exemption from the 10 calendar day notice 
      requirement of article 10.02 in any situation where an individual has been 
      identified as having committed alleged acts of misconduct.  </p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the predicament faced by the Corporation, I am required 
      to give effect to the terms of the collective agreement.  <u>On the facts 
      here, considered in light of all the article 10.02(b) jurisprudence, there 
      is no basis to exempt the Corporation from the requirements of that article.  
      Having identified individual acts of misconduct and having identified individual 
      suspects and having considered these to be infractions warranting a disciplinary 
      response, the Corporation, pursuant to article 10.02, was required to provide 
      each identified suspect with a copy of a report in respect of each incident 
      placed in his/her personal file within 10 calendar days of becoming aware 
      if it wished to discipline in respect of these incidents.</u>  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

  </span> The majority in the Divisional Court found that the arbitrator’s interpretation 
  of Article 10.02 was not patently unreasonable.  The majority stressed that 
  deference was owed to the arbitrator and the long history of arbitration decisions 
  that had followed the same interpretation.  In the view of the majority, the 
  <i>stare decisis</i> clause in the Collective Agreement (Article 9.103) compelled 
  Arbitrator Burkett to follow the interpretation of Article 10.02 laid down in 
  the previous cases.</p>

  10-day notice period referred to in Article 10.02(b) began to run from the time 
  individual employees were identified as being involved in alleged misconduct 
  was not patently unreasonable.  The majority said at p. 452:</p>

      permits an interpretation that would postpone its obligations in the case 
      of a broad-based investigation of a number of employees.  </p>

  </span> The majority realized that the arbitrator’s interpretation of Article 
  10.02 presented serious difficulties for Canada Post but said at p. 453:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The applicant’s [Canada Post] remedy lies in the collective bargaining 
      process.  Its obligations under s. 5(2)(c) of the <i>Canada Post Corporation 
      Act</i> to have regard to the security of the mail are not inconsistent 
      with the provisions of the collective agreement.  Limits on its managerial 
      authority accepted in the collective agreement should not result in court 
      action contrary to the principles under which judicial review must take 
      place.</p>

  </span> Molloy J., in dissent, began from the premise that words in a collective 
  agreement like words in any contract should be given their plain meaning unless 
  context demands otherwise or the plain meaning would yield an absurdity.  By 
  absurdity I take her to mean a result which could not have been intended by 
  the parties to the Collective Agreement.  Molloy J. was of the opinion that 
  the arbitrator’s interpretation led to an absurdity in that it effectively prevented 
  Canada Post from maintaining the security of the mail.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the view of Molloy J., the arbitrator’s interpretation of Article 
  10.02 of the Collective Agreement did not accord with the plain and ordinary 
  meaning of the words used in Article 10.02, particularly when those words were 
  read in conjunction with Article 10.01.  She opined that Article 10.01 and not 
  Article 10.02 dealt with notices of discharge, and that the 10-day time limit 
  in Article 10.02(b) did not apply to notices of discharge.  She further held 
  that Article 10.02(a) which precluded the use of “reports” in grievance proceedings 
  where the notice requirements of 10.02(b) were not complied with did not affect 
  Canada Post’s entitlement to lead evidence, other than “reports” to establish 
  the misconduct relied on to justify the discharge.  The essence of her analysis 
  is found at pp. 461-62:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… The plain and ordinary meaning of this provision is that the report itself 
      cannot be used at the arbitration.  This does not mean that no other evidence 
      with respect to an incident giving rise to discipline is admissible at an 
      arbitration.  The section deals only with the admission of reports from 
      the personal file.  In particular, there is no provision in the agreement 
      that prohibits disciplinary action unless a “report” was served on the employee 
      within ten days and then placed in the personal file.  Thus on a literal 
      (or plain meaning) interpretation of Articles 10.01 and 10.02 the failure 
      of Canada Post to give notice under Article 10.02 with respect to the criminal 
      activity it discovered in its investigation would not be an impediment to 
      proceeding to discipline against an employee with respect to that incident 
      (provided that reasonable notice under Article 10.01 is given).  Although 
      the “report” itself would not be admissible evidence unless the Article 
      10.02 notice provision was observed, the employer would be entitled to call 
      other evidence to prove its case.</p>

  </span> Molloy J. also addressed the effect of Article 9.03, the <i>stare decisis</i> 
  provision in the Collective Agreement.  After observing, at p. 469, that Arbitrator 
  Burkett was bound by Article 9.103 to apply the interpretation given in previous 
  cases, Molloy J. went on to state:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… It is also clear that Article 9.103 does not restrict, or purport to 
      restrict, the review powers of this court…  If the interpretation is a patently 
      unreasonable one, it remains patently unreasonable notwithstanding the fact 
      that it has been applied by other arbitrators.  A decision is either patently 
      unreasonable or it is not.  It doesn’t become reasonable because others 
      have done the same thing.  …</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Molloy J. concluded that Arbitrator Burkett’s interpretation of Article 
  10.02 was patently unreasonable in that it yielded an absurd result and was 
  inconsistent with the plain meaning of the words of Article 10.02.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Molloy J. also considered the reasonableness of Arbitrator Burkett’s 
  decision on the assumption that he was correct in holding that Article 10.02 
  was applicable to a notice of discharge and that Canada Post could not rely 
  on the misconduct revealed by the videotapes unless it complied with the notice 
  requirements in Article 10.02(b).  Molloy J.’s review of previous arbitration 
  decisions led her to conclude that those cases favoured a flexible approach 
  to a determination of when the 10-day notice period in Article 10.02(b) began 
  to run.  That flexible approach took cognizance of both the employee’s right 
  to timely notice of the reason for discharge and Canada Post’s obligation to 
  maintain the security of the mail.  In her view, the previous arbitration decisions 
  directed that the commencement of the 10-day notice period in Article 10.02(b) 
  should depend on what was reasonable having regard to the totality of the circumstances.  
  In some circumstances it was reasonable to commence the 10-day time period when 
  an investigation was complete and/or charges had been laid by the police.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Molloy J. determined that the circumstances in this case made it reasonable 
  to commence the 10-day period either on the termination of the investigation 
  or on the date charges were laid.  She reasoned that this interpretation of 
  Article 10.02(b) gave full effect to both the employees’ right to timely notice 
  and Canada Post’s right to maintain the security of the mail.  In coming to 
  this conclusion, Molloy J. referred to a number of factors, including the nature 
  and extent of the alleged misconduct, the number of employees involved in the 
  alleged misconduct, the threat posed by that misconduct to the security of the 
  mail, the nature of the investigative process required to uncover the full extent 
  of the misconduct, and the significance of the laying of the criminal charges 
  to Canada Post’s decision to fire the employees.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Molloy J. was satisfied that her interpretation of when the 10-day time 
  period should begin to run was open on the prior authorities and avoided the 
  absurd result arrived at by the arbitrator.  She said at p. 475:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [I]f there is a reasonable interpretation, that protects the interests 
      of the parties and their reasonable expectations under the agreement and 
      which does not unduly strain the language of the agreement, it is to be 
      preferred over an interpretation that produces an absurd result.  This is 
      even more the case with respect to determining when the company had knowledge 
      since it does not require overriding, or even distinguishing, existing precedent.<b></b></p>

  I will follow the same course.  Although I agree with her ultimate conclusion, 
  I reach that result for somewhat different reasons.</p>

  </span> The analysis of Molloy J. concerning the plain meaning of Article 10.02 
  is persuasive.  I need not, however, decide whether that interpretation is the 
  correct one, or more to the point whether the interpretation favoured by Arbitrator 
  Burkett is patently unreasonable.  I do not think it matters whether that interpretation 
  was correct, incorrect or even patently unreasonable.  As Molloy J. observed, 
  Arbitrator Burkett was obliged by Article 9.103 of the Collective Agreement 
  to apply the interpretation given to the clause in previous arbitration cases.  
  I cannot understand how it can be said at one and the same time that Arbitrator 
  Burkett was obliged to apply that interpretation, but that a decision which 
  flowed from that interpretation was patently unreasonable.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given the presence of Article 9.103 in the Collective Agreement, the 
  question on judicial review was not whether the established interpretation of 
  Article 10.02 adopted by Arbitrator Burkett was patently unreasonable, but rather 
  whether his decision that he was bound to apply that interpretation was patently 
  unreasonable.  Canada Post does not argue that in so far as the interpretation 
  of Article 10.02 is concerned, Arbitrator Burkett should have distinguished 
  this case from the previous decisions.  Instead, Canada Post argues that the 
  interpretation arrived at in the earlier cases is wrong.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think it was open to the arbitrator to consider the correctness 
  of the interpretation of Article 10.02 provided in the previous cases.  Article 
  9.103 compelled him to accept that interpretation.  That Article reflects a 
  considered decision by Canada Post and the Union to avoid the costs, uncertainty 
  and labour strife associated with never-ending interpretation and re-interpretation 
  of the same provisions of the Collective Agreement through the grievance process.  
  Canada Post and the Union preferred to live with the certainty of a fixed interpretation 
  of the agreement and to leave alteration to the collective bargaining process.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In holding that the reasonableness of the interpretation of Article 
  10.02 adopted by Arbitrator Burkett is not relevant to whether his decision 
  was patently unreasonable, I do not think that I am restricting the powers of 
  judicial review accorded to the courts.  In the present context, judicial review 
  refers to the court’s authority to review the arbitrator’s interpretation of 
  the Collective Agreement, applying a patent unreasonableness standard.  The 
  Collective Agreement includes both Article 10.02 and Article 9.103.  The question 
  on judicial review must, therefore, be whether Arbitrator Burkett’s interpretation 
  of Article 10.02 is patently unreasonable in the light of Article 9.103.  Any 
  consideration of the reasonableness of Article 10.02 without having regard to 
  Article 9.103 would amount not to judicial review, but to a judicial amendment 
  of the Collective Agreement entered into between Canada Post and the Union.</p>

  <blockquote>

  </span> This provision of the Collective Agreement is designed to ensure that 
  employees who face disciplinary action will receive prompt notice of the reason 
  for that action so that they might fully defend themselves.  That purpose must, 
  however, be balanced against Canada Post’s need to have the information required 
  to make a decision which promotes and protects Canada Post’s statutory mandate 
  and is also fair to the employees caught up in the disciplinary process:  <i>Canada 
  Post Corp. v. C.U.P.W. re Seifried</i>, March 13, 1989 (Weatherill);  <i>Canada 
  Post Corp. v. C.U.P.W. re G. Joong</i>, March 7, 1994 (Burkett)<i>.</i>  </p>

  </span> A host of arbitrators, recognizing that Article 10.02(b) balances these 
  interests, have held that an alleged infraction cannot be said to have “come 
  to the attention” of Canada Post until Canada Post is, or reasonably should 
  have been, in a position to make an informed and fair decision as to whether 
  an infraction had occurred and, if so, whether that infraction warranted a report:  
  eg. see <i>Williams v. Treasury Board (Post Office Department)</i>, unreported

  </span> <i>Williams v. Treasury Board (Post Office Department), supra</i>, is 
  the seminal case on the interpretation of Article 10.02(b).  In <i>Williams</i>, 
  an employee was observed destroying Canada Post property and committing other 
  criminal offences in the course of an illegal strike.  The employee’s supervisor 
  prepared a report detailing the employee’s actions on the day they occurred.  
  Several weeks later the employee was advised that he would be discharged because 
  of his conduct during the illegal strike.  He grieved contending that Canada 
  Post had failed to comply with the notice requirement in Article 10.02(b) and 
  could not, therefore, rely on his alleged misconduct during the strike as a 
  reason for firing him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Deputy Chairman Mitchell rejected the grievor’s interpretation of the 
  Article.  Speaking generally, at p. 16 he described Article 10.02(b) in these 
  terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>An infraction cannot reasonably be alleged against an employee without 
      prior investigation by the employer regarding the circumstances surrounding 
      the alleged misconduct.  It is only after the completion of an investigation 
      that an employer may reasonably conclude whether grounds exist for alleging 
      that an infraction had occurred.</u>  It is that date on which the alleged 
      infraction can be said to have come to the attention of the employer as 
      contemplated by 10.02(b).</p>
    <p>Once an employer has come to the conclusion that an infraction which warrants 
      discipline has occurred it is its duty to so inform the employee within 
      the ten days referred to in Article 10.02(b) to constitute a report which 
      may properly become part of the employee’s personal file referred to in 
      Article 10.02(a).  The report to the employee that such an infraction occurred 
      may be sent within ten days after its occurrence or within ten days after 
      the employer has concluded that an infraction warranting discipline has 
      occurred.  <u>Therefore, the period in which the employee is entitled to 
      receive a report pursuant to 10.02(b) runs either from the date of the occurrence 
      of the incident or from the date the employer was able to reasonably conclude 
      that an infraction warranting disciplinary action had occurred.  The establishment 
      of that date is a matter of evidence to be adduced by the employer during 
      the hearing if the admissibility of any document is the subject of an objection.</u>  
      [Emphasis added.]</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Turning from the general to the specific case at hand, Deputy Chairman 
  Mitchell said at p. 29:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is important to note that in the circumstances of this illegal strike 
      and illegal picketing activity by many hundreds of employees it was reasonable 
      for the employer in such a situation to require a high degree of centralization 
      of the decision-making process.  <u>It was necessary to review and analyze 
      each incident to determine whether an infraction had in fact occurred and 
      if so whether or not a report should be made and indeed whether discipline 
      should be imposed.  If discipline was to be imposed in a fair manner it 
      was also necessary to centralize decision-making as to the severity of the 
      discipline to be imposed in each case in an effort to avoid discriminatory 
      results.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Applying this contextual approach to Article 10.02(b), Deputy Chairman 
  Mitchell held that the alleged infraction did not come to the attention of Canada 
  Post until reports concerning that alleged infraction had worked their way up 
  the chain of command, had been considered and analyzed by those responsible 
  for deciding what action, if any, should be taken, and the employee had been 
  given a chance to respond to the allegations.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The approach to Article 10.02(b) taken by Deputy Chairman Mitchell recognized 
  that the nature of the investigation required and the context in which the alleged 
  misconduct occurred had to be taken into consideration in deciding when the 
  alleged infraction came to the attention of Canada Post for the purposes of 
  Article 10.02(b).  In some circumstances, a reasonable period of time had to 
  be allowed to permit Canada Post to gather the necessary information, place 
  that information before the appropriate decision-maker and permit that decision-maker 
  to make a considered assessment of what steps, if any, should be taken by Canada 
  Post.  Importantly, this process served the interests of both Canada Post and 
  the employees in that it allowed for decisions which protected Canada Post’s 
  interests, but also avoided unfairness to individual employees.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The interpretation of Article 10.02(b) put forward in <i>Williams v. 
  Treasury Board (Post Office Department), supra</i>, has been repeatedly applied 
  in arbitration cases.  In <i>Canada Post Corp. v. C.U.P.W. re Ortman, supra</i>, 
  an employee was seen hitting a replacement employee with a rock during an altercation 
  that occurred in the course of a strike.  The employee was arrested on the scene 
  and charged with serious criminal offences.  Canada Post had knowledge of the 
  incident and the arrest on the day it happened.  About two weeks later, Canada 
  Post fired the employee.  He grieved arguing that he had not received notice 
  within the 10 days contemplated by Article 10.02(b).  Arbitrator Norman held 
  that in the circumstances it was “entirely understandable” that local management 
  would want to consult with more senior persons before deciding what disciplinary 
  steps should be taken.  He said, at p. 6:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Canada Post was dealing with many acts of violence both to persons and 
      property on a daily basis, across this country.  I very much endorse Mr. 
      Mitchell’s point in <i>Williams</i> [<i>supra</i>] that “if the employer 
      decides to impose disciplinary penalties on a hundred or more employees 
      much more time is required to avoid discriminatory results in such circumstances 
      than in isolated cases warranting discipline”.  Accordingly, I find that 
      the alleged infraction cannot, in fairness, be deemed to have come fully 
      to the attention of the corporation until some days following June 23 [the 
      date of the alleged incident].  Therefore I find no violation of Article 
      10.02(b).</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Arbitrator Burkett was certainly aware of <i>Williams v. Treasury Board 
  (Post Office Department), supra</i>, and the cases which had followed it.  Indeed, 
  at least one of those cases was authored by Arbitrator Burkett.  After a review 
  of some of these decisions, he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [<u>A]n investigation is sometimes required in order to obtain the knowledge 
      necessary to confirm the existence and extent of the misconduct and/or the 
      identity of the individual(s) responsible and that where, on the facts, 
      such an investigation is required to obtain such information, the article 
      10.02 time limit for notification to the affected individual(s) does not 
      commence to operate until the investigation is complete.</u>  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having accurately identified the fact-sensitive approach to the commencement 
  of the 10-day time period in Article 10.02(b) dictated by the previous cases, 
  Arbitrator Burkett then departed from that approach in at least five ways.  
  First, rather than considering the nature of the investigation required to “confirm 
  the existence and extent” of the misconduct, he recast the issue in terms of 
  Canada Post’s entitlement to an exemption from the notice requirement to avoid 
  compromising an ongoing investigation.  Canada Post did not seek any exemption 
  from the notice requirement.  It did maintain, however, that it was entitled 
  to conduct an investigation which would allow it to uncover fully the nature 
  and extent of each employee’s misconduct.  By the nature and extent of the misconduct, 
  I refer to such matters as the type of misconduct engaged in by an employee, 
  the frequency of the misconduct by individual employees and the connection, 
  if any, among the various employees involved in the misconduct.  These matters 
  could be assessed only upon the completion of a covert investigation of reasonable 
  duration.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For example, an employee might have been videotaped apparently discarding 
  a piece of bulk mail on the first day of the investigation.  The significance 
  of that conduct could only be accurately and fairly evaluated for disciplinary 
  purposes when viewed in the context of the entire investigation.  If that employee 
  continued on a regular basis to discard mail, the disciplinary ramifications 
  might be very different than if the conduct on the initial day turned out to 
  be a single isolated act for which there was some explanation.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, Arbitrator Burkett failed to consider that the misconduct under 
  investigation was ongoing and involved many employees.  This was not an investigation 
  into past misconduct by one or two employees.  As observed in <i>Williams, supra</i>, 
  where acts of misconduct occur in the course of ongoing illegal activity involving 
  many employees, Canada Post must have the opportunity to assess the action of 
  individual employees in the context of the entirety of the illegal activity.  
  That assessment cannot be made until Canada Post has an opportunity to fully 
  investigate the entirety of the activity and consider the acts of the individual 
  employees in the context of that activity.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Third, Arbitrator Burkett rejected the contention that Canada Post did 
  not have knowledge of the alleged infractions until those responsible for determining 
  whether disciplinary action should be taken had that knowledge.  He found that 
  knowledge of the security personnel sufficed.  I accept as correct his refusal 
  to compartmentalize Canada Post for the purpose of determining the requisite 
  knowledge of Canada Post.  Arbitrator Burkett’s approach, however, ignores the 
  holding in <i>Williams, supra</i>, and <i>Ortman, supra</i>, to the effect that 
  where numerous acts of misconduct involving many employees are involved, the 
  time period in Article 10.02(b) does not begin to run until those responsible 
  for making the relevant disciplinary decisions have had a reasonable opportunity 
  to consider the conduct of individual employees in the context of the entire 
  investigation.  Arbitrator Burkett focused exclusively on Canada Post’s knowledge 
  and ignored Canada Post’s need to consolidate the information available to it 
  and to co-ordinate and centralize its decision-making process.  On the facts 
  of this case, those processes were properly viewed as part of the necessary 
  investigation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Fourth, Arbitrator Burkett held that since the investigation was an 
  internal one, the laying of criminal charges was irrelevant to the operation 
  of the 10-day time period.  The laying of the criminal charges was in fact the 
  ultimate event which precipitated the decision by Canada Post to discharge the 
  employees.  Canada Post discharged those employees against whom the police laid 
  criminal charges.  Where, as here, an employer discharges on the basis of alleged 
  criminal conduct, it seems to me entirely reasonable and indeed fair to the 
  employees to act only against those who the police, who are after all the “experts” 
  when it comes to determining whether crimes have occurred, determine there are 
  reasonable and probable grounds to believe have committed criminal offences.  
  The decision by the police to lay criminal charges against certain employees 
  was an essential prerequisite to Canada Post’s decision to proceed with disciplinary 
  action.  All of the facts relevant to the employees’ “alleged infraction” were 
  not in place until the police had made that decision.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The decision by the police to lay criminal charges was also relevant 
  in a second way.  By virtue of Article 41.02, Canada Post could rely on the 
  video surveillance in discipline proceedings only if the employees were engaged 
  in “a criminal act”.  Without the video surveillance, Canada Post had no grounds 
  upon which to believe that any employee had committed an infraction.  Canada 
  Post took the position that it was only after the police decided to charge particular 
  employees that it had grounds to believe that the video surveillance would be 
  admissible on discipline proceedings.  While Arbitrator Burkett eventually held 
  that this interpretation of Article 41.02 was incorrect, I agree with Molloy 
  J. that the ultimate correctness of Canada Post’s interpretation of the Article 
  was not crucial.  What is important is Canada Post’s <i>bona fide</i> determination 
  that the laying of criminal charges by the police was a prerequisite to its 
  ability to determine that an employee had committed a “criminal act” for the 
  purposes of Article 41.02.  This was a reasonable if incorrect interpretation 
  of Article 41.02.  In fact, this interpretation enhanced the fairness of the 
  discipline process by limiting disciplinary action to those employees who, in 
  the view of the police, there were reasonable and probable grounds to believe 
  had committed a criminal offence.  In my view, it was entirely appropriate for 
  Canada Post to view the police assessment of the conduct of the individual employees 
  as a relevant consideration in its determination of whether an employee had 
  engaged in a disciplinable infraction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, in arriving at his interpretation of when the 10-day period 
  should operate, Arbitrator Burkett said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… While the decision of the Corporation is understandable from a security 
      perspective, it was made in the face of article 10.02 and <u>in the absence 
      of a single award upholding an exemption from the 10 calendar day notice 
      requirement of article 10.02 in any situation where an individual has been 
      identified as having committed alleged acts of misconduct.</u>  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect, this is not an accurate description of the authorities.  
  In both <i>Williams, supra</i>, and <i>Ortman, supra</i>, the 10-day notice 
  period did not run from the date on which the individuals were identified as 
  committing alleged acts of misconduct, but rather from the date on which those 
  responsible for making discipline decisions had a reasonable opportunity to 
  assess the individual acts of misconduct in the context of the activities revealed 
  by a much broader investigation involving many employees.  </p>
<p class=headingblank align=center style='text-align:center;
line-height:normal'><b>VI</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Like Molloy J., I come to the conclusion that the established authorities 
  call for a fact-specific determination of when the 10-day time period in Article 
  10.02(b) begins to run.  That inquiry allows the arbitrator to consider both 
  an employee’s right to timely notice of the basis for disciplinary action and 
  Canada Post’s obligations to both fulfil its statutory mandates and act fairly 
  towards its employees in disciplinary matters.  Arbitrator Burkett focused on 
  one factor, the identification of the individuals on the videotape, to the exclusion 
  of all other relevant factors in determining when the 10-day time period should 
  run.  In doing so, he arrived at a conclusion which sacrificed entirely Canada 
  Post’s legitimate interests.  Had he considered all of the factors, in my view, 
  he would have concluded that the alleged infraction came to the attention of 
  Canada Post when the criminal charges were laid.  That interpretation would 
  have permitted Canada Post to fulfil its obligations to its clients and its 
  employees without in any way compromising the employees’ right to timely notice.  
  By departing from the approach announced in previous cases and taking an approach 
  which ignored Canada Post’s interests and obligations, Arbitrator Burkett rendered 
  a patently unreasonable decision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would allow the appeal, quash the decision of Arbitrator Burkett and 
  direct that the arbitrations proceed on their merits.  I see no reason why Arbitrator 
  Burkett should not conduct those arbitrations if he is prepared to do so.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'> [52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Canada Post is entitled to its costs in the Divisional Court, on the 
  leave application to this court and on the appeal. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Doherty 
  J.A. and I agree with his conclusion on the first issue, namely, that Arbitrator 
  Burkett's interpretation of Article 10.02(a) cannot be said to be patently unreasonable. 
  In so concluding, I find it unnecessary to focus, as my colleague has, on the 
  significance of Article 9.103. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As for the second issue regarding the commencement of the ten-day notice 
  period specified in Article 10.02(b), I am respectfully unable to agree with 
  my colleague's conclusion that Arbitrator Burkett “rendered a patently unreasonable 
  decision”. While I agree that the result arrived at by the arbitrator may be 
  difficult to swallow, I have not been persuaded that the decision under review 
  is patently unreasonable, a label reserved for decisions that are “evidently 
  not in accordance with reason” or “clearly irrational”. (See <i>Canada (Attorney-General) 
  v. Public Service Alliance of Canada</i> (1993), 101 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  673 per Cory J. for the majority at pp. 690 and 691.)</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> No doubt, as my colleague points out, Arbitrator Burkett could have 
  approached the matter differently and arrived at what some would consider to 
  be a more palatable and sensible result. But an unpalatable result does not 
  necessarily translate into a patently unreasonable decision. This case illustrates 
  the point, especially when one considers that as a result of prior arbitral 
  decisions of which Canada Post was aware, the outcome arrived at by Arbitrator 
  Burkett is precisely the one that Canada Post foresaw and took steps to avoid 
  from the outset. Those steps included:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      </span></span> Canada Post's unsuccessful attempt to have the police take 
      the necessary steps to convert its “in-house” investigators into special

      </span></span> The conscious decision by Canada Post's lead investigator 
      to keep line management and labour relations personnel in the dark about 
      the nature and results of the investigation until shortly before or immediately 
      after the laying of criminal charges on June 12, 1997.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>While not dispositive, I find 
  it somewhat disingenuous for Canada Post to now argue that Arbitrator Burkett's 
  decision is patently unreasonable when it is precisely the one that Canada Post 
  foresaw and anticipated, based on its knowledge and understanding of the existing 
  arbitral jurisprudence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To be sure, Canada Post had good cause to be concerned. Of the many 
  previous arbitral decisions of which it was aware, three in particular foreshadowed 
  the result which it feared. They are: <i>Canada Post v. CUPW Re: Joong</i>, 
  [March 7, 1994 (unreported)], in which Arbitrator Burkett ordered the reinstatement 
  of an employee, allegedly guilty of theft from the corporation, by reason of 
  the corporation's failure to comply with the ten-day requirement in Article 
  10.02(b); <i>Canada Post v. CUPW Re: Marini</i> (1987) 26 L.A.C. (3d) 403 in 
  which Arbitrator Swan, at p. 423 observed that: “there may be circumstances 
  where, by waiting until the administration of the criminal law has run its course, 
  the employer will simply have lost the opportunity to discipline an employee 
  who would otherwise be disciplinable”; and <i>Purolator Courier v. Canada Council 
  of Teamsters, Local 938 Re: Iafrate</i>, [1999] C.L.A.D. No. 215 in which Purolator 
  Courier, a wholly owned subsidiary of Canada Post, negotiated in its collective 
  agreement an exemption from the notification time limits as follows: “in the 
  case of criminal investigation (for example theft, drugs, fraud), the time period 
  does not commence until all conclusions have been drawn from the investigation”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In sum, as a result of these three decisions, Canada Post knew or should 
  have known that failure to comply with the notice requirements of Article 10.02(b) 
  could lead to the reinstatement of an employee otherwise guilty of theft, that 
  conducting a criminal investigation in a certain way could result in an inability 
  to discipline, and that Article 10.02(b) did not contain exempting language 
  similar to that found in the Purolator agreement. More importantly, for present 
  purposes, those decisions paved the way for Arbitrator Burkett to decide the 
  case as he did. At very least, they lay waste to the submission that his decision 
  must be found to be clearly irrational.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As my colleague points out, Arbitrator Burkett was familiar with the 
  arbitral decisions surrounding the commencement of the ten-day time period in 
  Article 10.02(b). In particular, he accepts that Mr. Burkett was fully aware 
  of the “contextual” or “fact-sensitive” approach that previous arbitrators had 
  applied in determining when an alleged infraction could be said to have “come 
  to the attention” of Canada Post within the meaning of that provision. My colleague 
  however contends that Arbitrator Burkett “departed from that approach” and rendered 
  a patently unreasonable decision by “taking [instead] an approach which ignored 
  Canada Post’s interests and obligations”. With respect, I disagree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To begin, it must be emphasized that no matter how one chooses to label 
  the approach for determining the commencement of the ten-day time period, in 
  the last analysis, the question boils down to one of fact for the arbitrator. 
  See <i>Canada Post v. CUPW Re: Dennie</i>, [June 23, 1999, (Von Veh) (unreported)] 
  and <i>CUPW and Canada Post Corporation Re: Horton</i>, [January 18, 1983 (Outhouse) 
  (unreported)].</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here, Arbitrator Burkett found as a fact that the alleged infractions 
  came to the attention of Canada Post on the date that its investigators were 
  able to identify by name an employee whom they had previously identified from 
  video tape as having engaged in misconduct. That finding was firmly founded 
  on the evidence and unless it was one that Arbitrator Burkett could not make 
  as a matter of law without crossing the “clearly irrational” line, the appeal 
  must, in my view, fail. Expressed somewhat differently, to succeed, Canada Post 
  must establish that Arbitrator Burkett had no choice but to find, as my colleague 
  has, “that the alleged information came to the attention of Canada Post when 
  the criminal charges were laid” and that any other finding must, in the circumstances, 
  be viewed as patently unreasonable.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the matter is framed that way, as I believe it should be, the weakness 
  in Canada Post’s argument becomes apparent. Specifically, Canada Post cannot 
  show that Arbitrator Burkett's finding is one that he was foreclosed as a matter 
  of law from making. The best it can do is argue that on the basis of earlier 
  decisions, it was open to him to find that this was a case of special circumstances 
  and that Canada Post was therefore correct in its position that the ten-day 
  notice period did not begin to run until the laying of the criminal charges. 
  But as Arbitrator Burkett pointed out: “none of these cases [the earlier decisions] 
  can be relied upon in support of the proposition that notwithstanding the positive 
  identification of an individual employee as having engaged in disciplinable 
  conduct, the corporation, <i>in the interest of maintaining the secrecy of an 
  ongoing covert investigation</i>, is not bound by the requirement in article 
  10.02 to put the employee on notice within ten days”. [Emphasis added]. Canada 
  Post has provided no authority to the contrary and none, to my knowledge, exists.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To be sure, Arbitrator Burkett could have gone the other way and emphasized 
  the interests of the employer over those of the employees. But in my view, he 
  was not obliged to do so, especially in light of the primary purpose of Article 
  10.02(b) which Arbitrator Burkett identified in his reasons at p. 22 as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Before proceeding to apply the article 10.02 requirements to the facts 
      here, <i>it is important to emphasize that article 10.02 is designed to 
      benefit individual employees by requiring notice of intended disciplinary 
      action within a stipulated time</i>. The clause is designed to regulate 
      employer action as it applies to individual employees in a manner that it 
      would not otherwise be regulated and to provide consequences for breach 
      that would not otherwise exist. <i>The clause speaks to individual conduct 
      and to the placing of a report on the individual's file and the requirement 
      that the individual employee be provided with a copy of the said report 
      within 10 calendar days of the “employee's” alleged infraction</i>. <i>The 
      focus is upon the individual employee</i>. It is with this purpose in mind 
      that article 10.02 must be interpreted and applied. [Emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his thorough and detailed analysis, my colleague refers to five instances 
  in which Arbitrator Burkett allegedly went wrong and departed from the “fact-sensitive 
  approach to the commencement of the ten-day time period in Article 10.02(b) 
  dictated by the previous cases”. In summary form they are:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> 1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> He 
      failed to consider the nature of the investigation required to “confirm 
      the nature and extent” of the misconduct and instead, recast the issue in 
      terms of Canada Post’s entitlement to an exemption from the notice requirement 
      to avoid compromising an ongoing investigation.</p>
    <p> 2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> He 
      failed to consider that the misconduct under investigation was ongoing and 
      involved many employees.</p>
    <p> 3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
      rejecting Canada Post’s contention that it did not have knowledge of the 
      alleged infractions until those responsible for determining whether disciplinary 
      action should be taken had that knowledge, he focused exclusively on Canada 
      Post’s knowledge and ignored Canada Post’s need to consolidate the information 
      available to it and to coordinate and centralize its decision-making process.</p>
    <p> 4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Having 
      determined that the investigation undertaken by Canada Post was an internal 
      one, he erred in holding that the laying of criminal charges was irrelevant 
      to the operation of the ten-day time period.</p>
    <p> 5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> He 
      misconstrued the arbitral authorities in stating that “the decision of the 
      corporation … was made … in the absence of a single award upholding an exemption 
      from the s.10 calendar day notice requirement of article 10.02 in any situation 
      when an individual has been identified as having committed alleged acts 
      of misconduct”.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Beginning with the last of these alleged errors, a fair reading of the 
  arbitrator’s reasons makes it clear that he was referring to the absence of 
  an award upholding an exemption from the s. 10 calendar day notice requirement, 
  <i>in the interest of maintaining the secrecy of an ongoing covert investigation</i>, 
  where an individual has been identified as having committed alleged acts of 
  misconduct. In this, he was entirely accurate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to the alleged errors in items 1 and 2, I am respectfully 
  of the view that Arbitrator Burkett did not miscast the issue before him, nor 
  did he fail to appreciate that the conduct under investigation was ongoing and 
  involved many employees. His reasons make it clear that the issue at hand, as 
  he perceived it, was a novel one, namely:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whether or not the corporation could sit on the identification of an individual 
      suspect without moving to discipline in the interest of maintaining the 
      secrecy of an ongoing investigation …. (p. 23)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, far from miscasting the issue, that is precisely the issue 
  raised by the evidence and argued by the parties. With respect, I do not understand 
  Canada Post to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As for the nature and extent of the misconduct under investigation, 
  it is clear from his reasons that Arbitrator Burkett was aware that the misconduct 
  was ongoing and involved many employees. The following excerpt is but one example:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I have a full understanding of the predicament faced by the corporation 
      in this matter; a predicament which, on the evidence, was concerning to 
      those in charge of this investigation. <i>On the one hand, the corporation, 
      governed by its statutory mandate to protect the integrity of the mail, 
      was required to respond to what appeared to be a widespread theft problem 
      at the Gateway facility and to do so by the only effective means available; 
      covert video surveillance</i>. [Emphasis added] (p. 35)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In short, I am satisfied that when Arbitrator Burkett’s reasons are 
  read fairly as a whole, it is apparent that he was alive to both the type of 
  investigation required to confirm the nature and extent of the misconduct and 
  the fact that the misconduct under investigation was ongoing and involved many 
  employees.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Turning to the third of the alleged errors, if Arbitrator Burkett “ignored 
  Canada Post’s need to consolidate the information available to it and to coordinate 
  and centralize its decision-making process”, it was because this was a non-issue 
  on the evidence. Senior management did not suggest that time was needed to coordinate 
  or centralize the decision-making process. Rather, the evidence indicates that 
  senior management was not informed of the nature and results of the investigation 
  until shortly before or immediately after the laying of criminal charges. This 
  was a product of a conscious decision on the part of Mr. Swedish, Canada Post’s 
  lead investigator, to keep senior management in the dark so as to avoid triggering 
  the ten-day rule. Accordingly, Arbitrator Burkett cannot be faulted for failing 
  to consider an issue not raised by the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Turning to the fourth alleged error, in view of the evidence before 
  him, I do not agree that Arbitrator Burkett erred in placing little or no relevance 
  on the laying of criminal charges in assessing when Canada Post had the requisite 
  knowledge needed to trigger the ten-day rule in Article 10.02(b). As Arbitrator 
  Burkett stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is not a case where, because of an ongoing police investigation, the 
      corporation can be deemed to lack the knowledge necessary to trigger the 
      article 10.02 requirements until advised of the results of the police investigation. 
      Rather, this is a case where the corporation itself carried out the investigation 
      and positively identified those who it considered to have engaged in criminal 
      misconduct based on the evidence that it gathered. (p. 28)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> That finding was clearly open to the arbitrator and in view of it, I 
  cannot accept my colleague’s assertion that “the laying of criminal charges 
  against certain employees was an essential prerequisite to Canada Post’s decision 
  to proceed with disciplinary action”. No evidence to that effect was led and 
  the suggestion is at odds with the express finding of the arbitrator.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons, unpalatable though the arbitrator’s decision may 
  be, I am not persuaded that it is patently unreasonable. Based on the existing 
  arbitral decisions, it was open for Arbitrator Burkett to come to the conclusion 
  he did. The fact that this court might consider his decision to be incorrect 
  or even unreasonable is of no moment. The decision must stand unless it can 
  be found to be clearly irrational. Close though this case may be, in my view, 
  the decision under review does not cross that line. To the extent that Canada 
  Post is unhappy with the outcome, its remedy lies in the bargaining process, 
  not the judicial process.</p>
