  </span> The appellant limited his submissions to his application to admit fresh 
  evidence.  He had previously sought leave to adduce the same proposed fresh 
  evidence before the panel which dismissed his appeal from the trial judgment 
  of Browne J.  The panel which heard the appellant’s appeal and dismissed it, 
  later refused to reconsider its decision in light of the fresh evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having lost the fresh evidence issue in this court, the appellant sought 
  leave to resurrect the same issue in the Superior Court.  His motion to admit 
  the fresh evidence came before Killeen J. who sensibly determined that Browne 
  J., the trial judge, should deal with the issue.  On December 11, 2000, after 
  hearing submissions, Browne J. endorsed the record, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The trial is over.  The appeal to the Court of Appeal is over.  The Court 
      of Appeal would not hear further submissions on the fresh evidence.  Motion 
      to adduce fresh evidence as identified dismissed.  Having said that I am 
      not satisfied that there is jurisdiction to bring this motion at this time.  
      Order to go that there be no further proceedings in these issues without 
      leave.  Costs to the responding parties fixed at $1,000.00.</p>
  </blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We have reviewed the fresh evidence which the appellant seeks leave 
  to file.  Quite apart from the fact that the admissibility of this evidence 
  was determined by this court on September 21, 2000, at which time the panel 
  which heard the appeal refused to reconsider the appeal in light of the fresh 
  evidence in question, we are of the view that the proposed fresh evidence does 
  not meet the requirements for the admission of fresh evidence.  Among other 
  things, it could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result at trial 
  when considered with the other trial evidence.  Another way of putting it is 
  to ask the question – if this evidence had been before the trial judge would 
  it have affected the result?  In our view, the answer to that question is no.  
  The proposed fresh evidence is but a small part of a reasonably extensive picture.  
  When considered in isolation and as part of the entire picture, it could not 
  reasonably be expected to have affected the result of this case.  </p>
