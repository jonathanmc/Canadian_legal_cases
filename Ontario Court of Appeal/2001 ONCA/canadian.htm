<p class=headingblank style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (1)       <u>The
Conspiracy Claims</u></span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>CCRP contends that the motions judge
failed to apply the proper onus for assessing a claim of conspiracy on a
summary judgment motion, misconstrued the requirements of s. 45 of the <i>Competition Act</i>, and improperly made
findings of fact and drew inferences when the evidence was contested.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I do not agree with the first of these
contentions.  In my view, at a general
level the motions judge had a proper understanding of her role on a Rule 20
motion.  She said, correctly in my view:
“My role as a motions judge is narrow: to assess the threshold issue of whether
a genuine issue exists as to material facts requiring a trial”.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it is not necessary on
this appeal to consider the motions judge’s interpretation of s. 45 of the <i>Competition Act</i>.  CCRP contends that the motions judge failed
to distinguish between the civil action in conspiracy at common law and a
conspiracy action under the <i>Competition
Act</i>.  I do not think that this
distinction made any difference to the motions judge’s analysis.  Her central point was that one of the
essential components of a conspiracy claim, whether under the common law or the
<i>Competition Act</i>, is “[a]n agreement
must be established in the sense of a joint plan or common design”.  The motions judge found that there was no
evidence of an agreement.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>It is this conclusion that leads me to
CCRP’s third contention, with which I agree. 
In my view, the record before the motions judge should have led her to
the conclusion that there were sufficient contested material facts to require
that the conspiracy claims proceed to trial.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge engaged in a review
of the evidence, dealing separately with the Maclean Hunter, QSP and Telemedia
defendants.  Her conclusion with respect
to each group of defendants was that there was <i>no</i> evidence of common design or agreement.  Typical of the way she expressed her
conclusions was her final paragraph relating to the Maclean Hunter defendants:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>There is no evidence that would support a finding of a common design
or agreement.  The threshold on an
important element of conspiracy has not been met.  The evidence relied on by the plaintiffs could not create an
inference of a combination or lead a “rational trier of fact to find for the
non-moving party”. Absent evidence, direct or circumstantial, of this element
of the conspiracy claim, there is no genuine issue for trial against Maclean Hunter
and Howard Adams.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In my view, there is some evidence
that, if accepted by a trier of fact, could support a finding of common design
or agreement.  By way of illustration, I
would highlight the following relationships among the defendants and their
alleged conduct.  </span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the distributor QSP was owned
by the publishers Maclean Hunter and Reader’s Digest at the relevant time.  QSP had Maclean Hunter representatives on
its board.  It is arguable that in the
marketplace the role of a magazine distributor is to sell magazines, presumably
from as many publishers as possible. 
QSP’s ownership by two publishers raises the obvious spectre of whether
its distribution function might be narrowed to focus on the magazines produced
by those publishers.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, there is evidence, <i>from Maclean Hunter</i>, that it tried to
discourage CCRP from entering the school magazine market.  It is at least arguable that a publisher
would want more, not fewer, distributors, so that more of its magazines could
be sold and so that distributors would compete to secure the publishers’
accounts.  Yet Leslie Zold, a Maclean
Hunter employee responsible for dealing with distributors, stated (in
cross-examination on his affidavit) that he told Howard Shannon, the President
of CCRP, that Maclean Hunter would not permit CCRP to sell its magazines
because “I just told them that while we are owners of QSP it would be difficult
to grant authorization to CCRP”.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, there is, on the record,
conflicting evidence about QSP’s role in Telemedia’s decision to terminate its
relationship with CCRP in May 1994.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 1993, Telemedia agreed to permit
CCRP to sell its magazines in Canadian schools.  QSP had been doing this for Telemedia magazines for many
years.  From Telemedia’s perspective,
two competing distributors selling its magazines made good economic sense.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In April 1994, QSP and Telemedia
renegotiated their contract.  It appears
that they reached an agreement.  There
was no hint that one of the terms of the agreement was an exclusivity
arrangement between them.  Indeed, in an
internal office memorandum on April 8, 1994 announcing successful
renegotiations with QSP, Gloria MacDonald, the vice-president of circulation at
Telemedia, stated: “We will continue to work with Quality School Plan and <i>each of the other agencies</i> we currently
do business with to increase remits for F95.”<a

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>A short time later, on May 27, 1994,
QSP and Telemedia finalized their arrangement, but with an important new term –
an exclusivity arrangement.  Telemedia
immediately took steps to terminate its relationship with CCRP.  Three days later, on May 30, Les Editions
Télémédia (“Télémédia”), the Quebec division of Telemedia, also ended its
relationship with CCRP.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In a letter to CCRP on June 10, 1994,
Ms. MacDonald explained Telemedia’s decision in this fashion:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>We have specifically decided to try to hold the circulation of TV
Guide down as close to 800,000 as possible, and are trying to manage

<p class=MsoFooter style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
6.0pt;margin-left:0cm;text-align:justify;'><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
MacDonald did not mention that Telemedia had entered into an exclusivity
arrangement with QSP.  Pierre Mathieu, a
former vice-president of circulation at Télémédia, stated in his affidavit that
“I am aware of no business reason why Telemedia Communications would have
entered into an exclusive relationship with QSP” or “would have terminated its
relationship with CCRP”.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, Telemedia gave a copy of its
letter terminating its relationship with CCRP <i>to QSP</i>.  Indeed, Mr. Ring,
the President of QSP, had specifically requested a copy of this letter at the
May 27, 1994 meeting where QSP and Telemedia had agreed to an exclusivity
arrangement.  It is difficult to see why
Telemedia would have agreed to this request. 
Mr. Ring stated that he told Ms. MacDonald that he wanted it so that he
could show customers that CCRP was not authorized to sell Telemedia
magazines.  Ms. MacDonald said that she
would not have given QSP a copy of the letter if she had known how QSP intended
to use it:  “Absolutely not.  If he [Mr. Ring] had I wouldn’t have
authorized it”.  Moreover, Mr. Mathieu
states in his affidavit:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>I am aware of no business reason why Telemedia would have given to
QSP the Telemedia letter terminating its relationship with CCRP, assuming that
it did so.  Certainly, it was not normal
business practice for any publisher to give a letter terminating a relationship
with a circulation agent to that agent’s competition.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, there is evidence
contradicting Ms. MacDonald’s stated reason for Telemedia’s decision to
terminate its relationship with CCRP, namely to lower circulation levels for TV
Guide and other magazines.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  In QSP’s Fall 1994 catalogue, Telemedia
magazines were displayed prominently, and students were invited to compete to
win a trip to Disney for selling more of those magazines, including,

lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fifth, the conduct of QSP USA and its
relationship to some of the other defendants potentially lend support to CCRP’s
conspiracy claims.  QSP USA was faced
with similar litigation in the United States. 
A class action settled after QSP USA and Reader’s Digest lost a summary
judgment motion and agreed to pay $42 million. 
In the present action, Peter Reifsnyder, a former vice-president
responsible for the Magazine and Music Division of QSP USA, has stated in an
affidavit that there was a close relationship between QSP and QSP USA and that
QSP USA used exclusivity arrangements to drive competitors from the field.  Reifsnyder offers the opinion that “[b]ased
on my experience with QSP USA and QSP including Jim Ring, I believe the
principal reason why QSP entered into this exclusive agreement with Telemedia
was to make it impossible for CCRP to compete with QSP”. John Flavin, another
former vice-president of QSP USA, has signed an affidavit in these proceedings
to similar effect.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The motions judge considered the
evidence about the relationship between QSP and QSP USA and said that “if the
evidence is accepted, the trial judge could infer that the so-called ‘tactics’
of the US parent were copied in Canada and used as a scheme to unduly lessen
competition”.  However, she continued:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>There remains, however, an important piece of the conspiracy puzzle
that is lacking: the evidence that, if these motives existed by QSP, they were
part of a plan or design with the other defendants, in particular, Telemedia.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>With respect, there is some evidence
that potentially links at least one other defendant to those so-called
‘tactics’.  Both Reifsnyder and Flavin
have stated that Howard Adams, admittedly a director of QSP but also a senior
officer of Maclean Hunter, attended QSP USA meetings in the United States.  In Reifsnyder’s words, “Ring and Adams
attended many QSP functions where the importance of exclusive arrangements with
publishers was discussed”.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This evidence can be put no higher
than that it potentially gives rise to an inference that both QSP and Maclean
Hunter engaged in, to use the motions judge’s description, “a scheme to unduly
lessen competition”.  However, in a
conspiracy case evidence by way of inference is often crucial.  As expressed by Rinfret J. in <i>Paradis v. The King</i>, [1934] S.C.R. 165
at 168:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Conspiracy, like all other crimes, may be established by inference
from the conduct of the parties.  No
doubt the agreement between them is the gist of the offence, but only in very
rare cases will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence.  Ordinarily the evidence must proceed by
steps.  The actual agreement must be
gathered from “several isolated doings” . . . having possibly little or no
value taken by themselves, but the bearing of which one upon the other must be
interpreted; and their cumulative effect, properly estimated in the light of
all surrounding circumstances, may raise a presumption of concerted purpose
entitling the jury to find the existence of the unlawful agreement.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:6.0pt'><span lang=EN-US>Although <i>Paradis</i> was a case dealing with a
criminal conspiracy, in my view Rinfret J.’s observations about the role played
by inferences is equally apposite in a civil conspiracy context.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover, with respect to conspiracy
to unduly limit competition contrary to the <i>Competition
Act</i>, s.45(2.1) specifically provides that a court “may infer the existence
of a conspiracy … from circumstantial evidence, with or without direct evidence
of communication between or among the alleged parties thereto”.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In each of these five illustrations, I
have highlighted statements and conduct by the defendants.  I have made no reference to the allegations
and documentation advanced by CCRP which, not surprisingly, conflict with the
defendants’ positions in virtually every respect.  My conclusion is that, looking only at the defendants’ side of
the record, it cannot be said that there is <i>no</i>
evidence of a common design or agreement among the defendants to injure CCRP or
to unduly lessen competition.  In my
view, given the interrelationship between the various corporate defendants, the
evidence potentially implicates all of them. 
Accordingly, the conspiracy claims advanced by CCRP should proceed to
trial as against the corporate defendants. 
However, there is no evidence that the individual defendants acted other
than in their respective representative capacities throughout.  The claims against them personally were
properly dismissed.</span></p>

O.R. (3d) 157 (C.A.).</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>CCRP made a claim against all
defendants other than Telemedia for wrongful interference with economic
relations between CCRP and Telemedia. 
The motions judge permitted the claim against QSP to proceed to
trial.  She found that there was some
evidence that QSP had disparaged CCRP in the marketplace in a sufficiently
serious way to potentially ground a successful claim in defamation.  She held that this potential conduct by QSP could
also serve to establish the three components of the tort of wrongful
interference with economic relations.</span></p>

claims, the conspiracy to unduly lessen competition contrary to the <i>Competition Act</i>  or to injure CCRP contrary to the common law
could also serve as the ‘intention to injure’ and ‘interference with business
by illegal means’ components of the tort of interference with economic
relations.  The third component of the
tort, economic loss caused thereby, would be subject to evidence at trial and,
presumably, would relate to any business that CCRP lost as a result of the

therefore, that these claims should also proceed to trial with respect to those

Adams but seeks to pursue the claim against the other concerned
defendants.  This claim relates to the
contract concluded by QSP and Telemedia on May 27, 1994.  The exclusivity term of that contract led
Telemedia to terminate its relationship with CCRP.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>Telemedia’s contract with CCRP was not breached, but was terminated

procurement of a “breach” of a contract is an essential element of the tort of
“inducing breach of contract”, there can be no tort where the contract contains
a termination clause and is properly terminated.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>CCRP claims that the motions judge
erred in her interpretation of the renewal and termination clause.  CCRP contends that the clause is
ambiguous.  One interpretation, adopted
by the motions judge, is that the contract could be terminated at any time,
provided that 120 days notice was given. 
A second interpretation, advanced by CCRP, is that termination could be
effected by giving the 120 day notice <i>only</i>
on the anniversary date of  the contract<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>.  This ambiguity, asserts CCRP,  should have led the  motions judge </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>to refer this issue to trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I disagree.  The issue is a straightforward one of interpreting contractual
language.  There are no material facts
in dispute.  Hence it was appropriate
for the motions judge to determine the issue.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>On the merits, I agree with the
motions judge’s interpretation of the clause. 
CCRP drafted the contract.  If it
had wanted to limit Telemedia’s right to terminate the contract to a single day
each year (a far-fetched proposition, in my view) it could have done so by
inserting the words “on the anniversary date” after the words “unless written
notice is given” in the first sentence of the clause.  It did not do so.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Cobban
v. Pacific Forest Products Ltd.,</i> [2000] B.C.J. No. 954 (S.C.), the British
Columbia Supreme Court interpreted a similar provision, albeit in an employment
contract.  Shabbits J. interpreted the
relationship between the renewal and termination language in the contract in
this fashion, at paras. 44-45:</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>However, I do not agree that the 15 day clause relates to renewal,
or that there could have been any confusion or misunderstanding as to the
meaning of the 15 day clause.  This
clause, which reads: “Either party can exercise the option to terminate this
agreement by delivering 15 days prior notice to the other party” could not have
been meant to relate to renewal being associated with funding.  That suggestion flies in the face of the
clear wording of the provision.</span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>The 15 day clause can mean nothing else but that at any time during
the duration of the agreement, whether that was within the initial one year
term, or within a renewal period, either party could exercise the option to
terminate the agreement by delivering 15 days prior notice to the other
party.  In my opinion, the clause is
unambiguous and straightforward and the plaintiff is bound by it.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with this analysis and think
it equally applicable to the contractual term in issue in this action.  That term is also, in my view, “unambiguous
and straightforward”.  Accordingly, the
motions judge was correct in finding that the contract permitted Telemedia to
terminate its relationship with CCRP, provided it gave 120 days notice at any
time during the life of the contract. 
She was also correct in concluding that Telemedia had complied with this
contractual term.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US>CCRP further argues that, because the
contract was ambiguous, the motions judge erred in failing to consider the
parole evidence of a collateral agreement by Telemedia not to enter into an
exclusive relationship with QSP. CCRP’s claim against the defendants for
inducing a breach of contact extends to this alleged oral agreement.  In my view, the motions judge was correct in
concluding that this evidence was inadmissible.  This issue is discussed more fully below.  Hence, since the contract had not been breached,
it would be impossible to establish the tort of inducing breach of contract
against any of the defendants. </span></p>

<p class=headingQUOTE style='margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-indent:0cm'><span
lang=EN-US>The plaintiffs seek to import this alleged representation into the
agreement. The difficulty is that it is inconsistent with the clear wording of
the agreement.  If Telemedia could, as

QSP an exclusive is meaningless to CCRP and conflicts with the clear wording of
the contract.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US>I agree with this reasoning.  Moreover, I note that CCRP drafted its
contract with Telemedia.  Exclusivity
arrangements were well-known in the industry; indeed Mr. Shannon admitted that
he had a good deal of experience with them. 
Accordingly, if CCRP had wanted to protect itself from the possibility
that Telemedia might enter into an exclusivity arrangement with another
distributor, it could have addressed this in its contract.</span></p>

sometimes economically desirable: “It is common in the magazine sales industry
for a publisher to withdraw a sale authorization as a means of managing

mean more revenue”.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>               I note in
passing a third potential interpretation of the renewal and termination clause,
namely that the notice of termination had to be given at least 120 days before
the next renewal date for the contract: see <i>Hi-Tech
Group Inc. v. Sears Canada Inc.</i> (Ont. C.A., unreported, January 11,
2001).  In my view, the third potential
interpretation does not arise in the present appeal, for at least two reasons.</span></p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>                First, Telemedia terminated its
contract with CCRP on May 27, 1994 by providing notice that “as of May 30,
1994” CCRP was not to sell Telemedia’s magazines “after the 120 day notice our
contract specifies”.  Thus the contract
concluded at the end of September 1994. 
The renewal date for the contract for all Telemedia magazines, except
Canadian Living, was December 2, 1994. 
Accordingly, Telemedia’s cancellation of the contract was effective
before the renewal date.  It follows
that the third interpretation of the clause considered in <i>Hi-Tech Group</i> was not available to CCRP in this action.  (This point does not apply to the magazine
Canadian Living which had a renewal date of August 19.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>                Second, there is nothing in
CCRP’s pleadings, affidavit evidence or legal argument suggesting this third
interpretation.  Indeed the pleadings
and legal argument are expressly inconsistent with it; they assert that the
contract could be terminated <i>only</i> on
its anniversary date, in other words <i>only</i>
on August 19 for Canadian Living and <i>only</i>
on December 2 for all other magazines. 
The third interpretation, on the other hand, would permit termination on
any day during the first eight months in each contractual year.</span></p>

<p class=MsoFootnoteText style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>                In summary, there are only two
potential interpretations of the renewal and termination clause relevant to
this appeal.  They are the two
interpretations identified  by the
appellant and dealt with by the motions judge.</span></p>
