<p><b>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Colin McKinnon dated January 12, 
  2000.</b></p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>ENDORSEMENT</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>This is an appeal from the judgment of McKinnon 
  J. dated January 12, 2000. His reasons for judgment are thorough and comprehensive. 
  In our view, his findings of fact are well founded on the evidence and his conclusions 
  of law are correct.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>On the issue of liability, the appellant first 
  challenges as too broad his finding as to the scope of the duty resting on the 
  appellant. In our view, given the relationship between the parties in this case, 
  the appellant’s professional obligation clearly included those factors referred 
  to at paragraph 235 of the judgment and, in particular, the duty to warn the 
  respondent of the significant weaknesses within its Loans Department. This ground 
  of appeal fails.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Second, the appellant challenges the finding 
  of causation made by the trial judge. In our view, determination of the consequences 
  flowing from the appellant’s breach of duty is a finding of fact and there was 
  ample evidence upon which the trial judge could reach the conclusion which he 
  did.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>As to contributory negligence, the appellant’s 
  complaint is that the trial judge understated the adverse consequences flowing 
  from the respondent’s own conduct. Again, in our view, this is a matter of fact 
  and we can find no palpable error in the conclusion the trial judge reached.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant argues three points as to damages.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>First, it says that the trial judge erred in 
  selecting a reaction time of eleven months in making his damage calculation. 
  We disagree that this is an error. The trial judge found that the effective 
  response of the respondent to the Seguin Report took 11 months. He applied the 
  same time line as the likely response time to the advice the respondent should 
  have received in February 1986. In our view, this is an entirely reasonable 
  finding.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Second, the appellant challenges the use of 
  1.5% in calculating the inevitable losses that the respondent would have suffered. 
  Again, in our view, this is a finding of fact, which on the record is entirely 
  defensible.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Finally, the appellant says that the trial judge 
  ignored any tax benefit to the respondent when he fixed damages. This argument 
  is at best faintly outlined in the appellant’s material. We agree with Mr. Scott 
  that there is simply no sufficient evidentiary basis on which the trial judge 
  could have determined the tax consequences to the respondent of the appellant’s 
  negligence. He did not err in declining to do so. We would dismiss this ground 
  of appeal.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>As to the cross-appeal, the respondent first 
  raises the question of dividends. In our view, it was open to the trial judge 
  to decline to include an amount for dividends wrongly paid on the basis that 
  these dividends were effectively saved by the respondent in subsequent years 
  when it was unable to pay the dividends which it would have had to pay absent 
  the appellant’s negligence. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Secondly, as to prejudgment interest, in our 
  view, the award made was entirely within the trial judge’s discretion and we 
  would not interfere with it.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Third, as to inevitable losses, it is our view 
  that the trial judge did not err. Given the evidence about the respondent’s 
  lending practices, it was open to the trial judge to apply a factor of 1.5% 
  even though the industry standard may have been less.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In the result, the appeal and the cross-appeal 
  must both be dismissed with costs.</span></p>
