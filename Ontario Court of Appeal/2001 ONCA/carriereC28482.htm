  </span> The appellant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced to 
  life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 23 years.  He was also 
  convicted of robbery and received a concurrent life sentence.  He appeals his 
  murder conviction.</p>

  </span> Counsel’s submissions were directed to three aspects of the trial judge’s 
  instructions to the jury.  He alleges error in the intoxication instruction, 
  the reasonable doubt instruction and the instruction as to how the jury should 
  approach its task.</p>

  </span> The deceased was shot and killed in the course of the robbery of his 
  convenience store.  It was the Crown’s position that the appellant, armed with 
  a .357 magnum handgun, entered the deceased’s store with an accomplice, Marc 
  Dubois.  The appellant chased the deceased to the back of the store while Dubois 
  remained near the front.  The appellant struggled with the deceased and fired 
  three shots.  Two shots hit the deceased and one struck the appellant in the 
  finger and eventually lodged in the ceiling.  The appellant, who was bleeding, 
  and Dubois completed the robbery and fled the scene.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The defence position came from the evidence of the appellant.  He testified 
  that after drinking most of the day, he and Dubois agreed to rob a convenience 
  store.  The appellant said he was not armed and did not know that Dubois was 
  armed at the time of the robbery.  The appellant did not anticipate that there 
  would be any violence in the course of the robbery, much less a shooting.  He 
  anticipated a quick “boost”.  Based on his prior experience as a robber, the 
  appellant did not think that the proprietor would offer any resistance.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to the appellant, while the robbery was in progress, the deceased 
  and Dubois became involved in a struggle at the back of the store.  The deceased 
  was attempting to strike Dubois with a stick.  The appellant went to Dubois’ 
  assistance and in the struggle which followed, Dubois fired the weapon, hitting 
  the appellant in the finger.  The appellant ran from the store taking the cash 
  register as he left.  He said that he did not hear any further shots fired.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Forensic evidence confirmed that the appellant was shot while in the 
  back of the store.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown’s case rested largely on the evidence of Derek Day, the deceased’s 
  son.  He was working in the store when the robbery occurred.  According to him, 
  two masked robbers entered the store shortly before closing.  One robber was 
  armed with a gun.  That robber chased his father into the back of the store 
  while the other robber remained at the counter near the front.  Mr. Day heard 
  three shots and saw his father fall to the floor.  The robbers fled the scene.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Day did not see the face of either robber.  He later picked out 
  the appellant as the armed robber based on his build and the way he moved.  
  This evidence had little probative value.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On Mr. Day’s version of the events, the deceased was struggling with 
  only one robber when the shots were fired.  If there was only one robber involved 
  in that struggle, it had to be the appellant, as it was conceded that one of 
  the three shots fired during that struggle struck the appellant in the finger.  
  If the appellant was the shooter he was guilty of either murder or manslaughter.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the appellant’s version, he was not armed, did not shoot the deceased, 
  and did not anticipate that the deceased would be shot.  The trial judge instructed 
  the jury that on the appellant’s version he could not be convicted of murder 
  but could be either acquitted or convicted of manslaughter depending on the 
  application of s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  No objection is taken 
  to this instruction.</p>
<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>III</p>
<p class=headingtitle>The Intoxication Instruction</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant testified that in the 10 hours prior to the robbery, he 
  consumed about 12 beers and 6 ounces of whiskey.  He said that he was very drunk 
  at the time of the robbery and did not think of the consequences of what he 
  was doing.  There was expert evidence that assuming the appellant consumed the 
  amount of alcohol that he said he did, his blood alcohol level would have been 
  three or four times the legal limit.  At those amounts, the expert said there 
  could well be signs of gross impairment.  In cross-examination, that expert 
  indicated that he could not comment on the appellant’s ability to form any particular 
  intention.  Against this evidence was the appellant’s own testimony that despite 
  his intoxication, he planned the robbery and contemplated the consequences, 
  believing that the victim would offer no resistance.  It is accepted that the 
  evidence made the appellant’s state of intoxication a legitimate issue at trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant alleged three discrete errors in the instruction 
  on intoxication.  While there is merit in each argument, I see the instruction 
  as containing a single overriding error.  The trial judge treated the evidence 
  of intoxication as giving rise to a separate and distinct defence instead of 
  relating that evidence, in combination with the other relevant evidence, to 
  the question of whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that 
  the appellant had one of the requisite intents for murder set out in s. 229(a) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge introduced the notion of intention to the jury and indicated 
  that they must consider “the whole of the evidence” in determining the intention 
  of the appellant.  He made no reference to intoxication.  The trial judge then 
  referred to the relevant sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and instructed 
  the jury that the Crown had to prove one of the required mental states beyond 
  a reasonable doubt.  He then said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There was a question of alcohol as well – I am going to deal with that 
      – <u>and an allegation that intoxication would be a defence in this particular 
      matter.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Having set up the “defence” of intoxication as a separate issue from 
  intent, the trial judge then returned to the question of intent telling the 
  jury:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In many, if not most of the criminal cases, the person said to be responsible 
      for the crime doesn’t speak or doesn’t write directly of his or her intention.  
      He or she may, however, say or do certain things from which inferences as 
      to their state of mind at the relevant time may be drawn.  In other words, 
      you can infer the intent or state of mind of an accused from his or her 
      words, actions, conduct or demeanour, viewed in the light of the circumstances 
      of the crime that is alleged to have been committed.</p>
    <p>It is a reasonable inference that a sane and sober person intends the natural 
      consequences of his or her acts.  That is an inference that may be drawn, 
      not a conclusion that inevitably follows or that must be drawn in all cases.  
    </p>
    <p>Second degree murder is committed when the person who causes the death 
      of the deceased means to cause his death – that is one aspect of it – or 
      means to cause him bodily harm that he knows is likely to cause death and 
      is reckless whether death ensues or not.  So that is what it is.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At no stage in the instruction did the trial judge link the common sense 
  inference described above to the evidence of intoxication.  He did not tell 
  the jury that in deciding whether that inference should be drawn they should 
  take into consideration all of the evidence, including the evidence of intoxication.  
  The failure to make this link will in many cases amount to reversible error:  
  <i>R. v. Seymour</i> (1996), 106 C.C.C. (3d) 520 at 529-30 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. 
  v. Robinson</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 122-23 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Peavoy</i> 
  (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 at 235-36 (Ont. C.A.).  However, even if the failure 
  to draw the link is not <i>per se</i> error, it contributes significantly to 
  the erroneous distinction drawn by the trial judge between the question of intent 
  and the “defence” of intoxication.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In a subsequent portion of his instruction, where the trial judge dealt 
  specifically with intoxication, he did say that the evidence of intoxication 
  should be considered along with the other facts in determining whether the accused 
  had the intent necessary for murder.  Unfortunately, this connection between 
  intoxication and intent was severed in three subsequent parts of the instruction 
  where the trial judge referred exclusively to intoxication when he should have 
  been referring to intent.  For example, after telling the jury that if they 
  were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the shooter, 
  the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I would think that the only verdict that you have is to bring the verdict 
      of guilty against Mr. Carrière, and <u>it would be murder in the second 
      degree, except that, of course, you still have to deal with the matter of 
      the intoxication that he has spoken about.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Still later in his instruction, the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… If he – if you find that scenario one was beyond a reasonable doubt, 
      that that is what happened, then, of course, this means that this accused 
      person had fired the gun and had been the cause of the death of Mr. Dai.  
      <u>If that is the case then, well then, it is murder in the second degree, 
      subject, of course, to the matter of intoxication.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree that if the jury found that the appellant was the shooter, it 
  would inevitably find him guilty of either murder or manslaughter.  The choice 
  between the two verdicts did not, however, turn on the question of intoxication, 
  but rather on the question of intent.  Intent had to be determined by reference 
  to all of the relevant evidence including, but not limited to, the evidence 
  of intoxication.  The trial judge misdirected the jury by treating the issues 
  of intent as distinct from intoxication and failing to relate the latter to 
  the former.  That error is fatal to the conviction for murder unless the Crown 
  can show that the error occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Crown counsel vigorously argued that the <i>curative proviso</i> could 
  be applied to any error in the intoxication instruction.  She submitted that 
  on the instructions given to the jury, it could only have convicted of murder 
  if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the shooter.  
  She argues, correctly in my view, that any error in the intoxication instruction 
  does not undermine this finding by the jury.  She goes on to contend that the 
  jury must have rejected the appellant’s evidence in its entirety, including 
  his evidence going to the issue of intoxication.  I cannot agree with this assertion.  
  In my view, a finding that the appellant was the shooter does not imply a rejection 
  of his evidence concerning his alcohol consumption.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I think that the appellant’s evidence in its entirety offers little, 
  if any, support for the contention that he did not have the capacity to form 
  one of the requisite intents for murder in s. 229(a).  I do think, however, 
  on the entirety of the evidence, including the circumstances in which the shots 
  were fired and the evidence of the appellant’s intoxication that a properly 
  instructed jury could have had a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant 
  had either of the requisite intentions for murder.  The <i>curative proviso</i> 
  cannot be applied.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>The Reasonable Doubt Instruction</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is yet another appeal in which the court must assess the adequacy 
  of a reasonable doubt instruction given prior to the decision in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> 
  (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>  The trial judge said two things in the course of his reasonable 
  doubt instruction which after <i>R. v. Lifchus, supra</i>, he should not have 
  said.  He told the jury that a reasonable doubt was a doubt for which they could 
  ascribe a reason.  He also referred to the “timid juror” who might use reasonable 
  doubt to acquit as a means of avoiding an unpalatable duty.  The trial judge 
  also did not tell the jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was more than 
  proof of probable guilt and was much closer to certainty than to probable guilt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel submitted that the trial judge’s instruction that a reasonable 
  doubt was one for which a juror could ascribe a reason is wrong in law.  He 
  contends that several decisions from this court have identified this instruction 
  as misdirection, which in and of itself constitutes reversible error:  <i>R.

  </span> In describing reasonable doubt to the jury, the trial judge said in 
  part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… It has been described as a real doubt, a genuine doubt, an honest and 
      a sensible doubt.  It is one founded on reason.  <u>There has to be a reason, 
      I would think, for a person to feel, “Well, I have a reasonable doubt and 
      it’s because of this particular reason.”</u>  There may be – and that reason 
      might arise from evidence or maybe from the lack of evidence. …  [Emphasis

  supra</i>, at p. 469:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… This court is of the view that such an instruction tends to shift the 
      burden of proof to the accused.  It directs jurors to subject any doubt 
      they may have to further evaluation and yet it does not contain any standards 
      for determining what kind of reason may suffice.  Most important, jurors 
      may have a reasonable doubt but not be able to articulate a reason.  …</p>

  </span> Although I agree with the submission that it was wrong to tell the jury 
  that a reasonable doubt was one for which a juror could ascribe a reason, I 
  cannot agree that this defect standing alone necessarily requires reversal.  
  Even if prior decisions of this court support that position, it cannot be sustained 
  after the recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court of Canada:  <i>R. v. Russell</i> 
  (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 66 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Beauchamp</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 58 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Avetysan</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 77 (S.C.C.);  
  <i>R. v. Pan</i> (2001), 155 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 149-50 (S.C.C.).</p>

line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to those recent authorities, it is wrong to find error in 
  the reasonable doubt instruction based on isolated passages in that instruction.  
  The adequacy of the instruction depends on whether, after an assessment of the 
  entirety of the charge relating to reasonable doubt, the appellate court concludes 
  that there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the proper 
  burden of proof.  As Iacobucci J. put it in <i>R. v. Russell, supra</i>, at 
  p. 76:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The appellate assessment of substantial compliance with the <i>Lifchus</i> 
      principles in cases where the trial judge did not have the benefit of that 
      decision, and may have used, in parts of the charge, language that will 
      likely be discontinued in the future or omitted parts recommended in <i>Lifchus</i>, 
      is not a mechanical task.  <u>Rather, it is a judgment call on whether the 
      deficiencies in the charge fall below the <i>Lifchus</i> standard such as 
      to cause serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead 
      to the conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial.</u>  [Emphasis

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In light of those authorities, it cannot be said that a single error 
  in the reasonable doubt instruction automatically requires reversal.  Indeed, 
  in two of the cases, <i>R. v. Russell, supra</i>, and <i>R. v. Beauchamp, supra</i>, 
  the trial judge told the jury that a reasonable doubt was a doubt for which 
  they could articulate a reason.  Despite this instruction and other instructions 
  which, after <i>Lifchus</i>, should not be given, the Supreme Court of Canada 
  upheld the provincial appellate courts’ holdings that the instructions were 
  in substantial compliance with the principles set down in <i>R. v. Lifchus, 
  supra</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I turn next to the question of whether the appellant has demonstrated 
  that the three defects identified above were such as to compel the conclusion 
  that the instruction was not in substantial compliance with the principles in 
  <i>R. v. Lifchus, supra</i>.  In making that “judgment call” (<i>R. v. Russell, 
  supra</i>), <i> </i>I consider the defects in the instruction in the context 
  of the entire charge on reasonable doubt.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the trial judge did not expressly tell the jury that probable 
  guilt was insufficient, he also did not tell the jury that reasonable doubt 
  had an ordinary everyday meaning.  To the contrary, he stressed the importance 
  and onerous nature of the decision that the jury had to make.  There was no 
  possibility that the jury would confuse this decision with the kind of decision 
  they made in their everyday lives.  I think they would have understood that 
  the verdict must reflect a much higher level of certainty than would be required 
  in day-to-day decision making.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also told the jury on no less than three occasions that 
  if it did not believe the accused, it must still acquit him if his evidence 
  left it with “a doubt”.  The instruction clearly told the jury that the case 
  was not to be decided based on who was more likely to be telling the truth, 
  but had to be decided in the appellant’s favour if the jury had any doubt about 
  the veracity of his version.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, in considering whether the jury properly understood the heavy 
  onus on the Crown, I note that the trial judge told the jury that they could 
  convict only if they had an “abiding assurance” of the appellant’s guilt.  This 
  phrase suggests to me a high standard of proof.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Taking all of these factors into consideration, I am satisfied that 
  the jury understood the heavy onus placed on the Crown. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I also do not think that the trial judge’s reference to a reasonable 
  doubt being a doubt for which there was a reason is fatal.  The trial judge 
  did not suggest that a juror should be able to articulate a reason for any doubt 
  he or she had, but rather said there must be a reason for the juror “to feel, 
  well I have a reasonable doubt and it’s because of this particular reason”.  
  The trial judge then went on to indicate that the reason might arise from the 
  evidence or the lack of evidence.  I think the trial judge was trying to make 
  the point to the jury that a reasonable doubt must flow from the presence or 
  absence of evidence and could not be based on something else, such as speculation 
  or prejudice.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Lastly, while the reference to “a timid juror” is inappropriate, I do 
  not think it would have led the jury to misapply the burden of proof.  The trial 
  judge made two references to the “timid juror”.  The first was neutral in the 
  sense that it suggested that the timid juror could convict or acquit for improper 
  reasons.  The second reference was directed at an improper acquittal.  This 
  reference was prefaced, however, by the trial judge’s indication that “of course” 
  the “timid juror” approach was not an appropriate one.  I do not think that 
  this reference would cause a juror to depart from his or her oath.  The trial 
  judge read that oath to the jury at the outset of his instructions and stressed 
  its importance.  While it may be that one or more jurors may have taken some 
  offence to the “timid juror” instruction, I do not think there is any realistic 
  possibility that any juror was misled by it.  </p>

  </span> Applying the standard described in <i>R. v. Russell, supra</i>, I would 
  describe the reasonable doubt instruction as flawed, but in substantial compliance 
  with the principles identified in <i>R. v. Lifchus, supra</i>.</p>

  </span> Counsel for the appellant contends that the trial judge erroneously 
  instructed the jury to look first at the Crown’s case, and in particular Mr. 
  Day’s evidence, and if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based on that evidence, 
  to convict the appellant.  Counsel submits that on this direction the jury may 
  never have reached the appellant’s evidence in the course of their deliberations.  
  He points to the conduct of the jury after their deliberations commenced as 
  offering some support for this position.  The jury wanted the evidence of several 
  witnesses read to them.  They indicated that they would like to hear Mr. Day’s 
  evidence first.  After an overnight adjournment, the jury heard Mr. Day’s evidence 
  in-chief.  They then indicated that they had no need to hear the rest of the 
  evidence they had requested.  They retired to deliberate and returned with a 
  verdict about fifty minutes later.  Counsel suggests that the jury followed 
  the erroneous instruction given to them by the trial judge, considered Mr. Day’s 
  evidence first, accepted it, and convicted.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Alternatively, counsel submits that the charge to the jury compels the 
  conclusion that the jury was told to consider the Crown’s evidence first and 
  if satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt, then and only 
  then should the jury consider the defence evidence.</p>

  </span> Crown counsel responds that while some of the passages in the instruction 
  lend credence to the appellant’s position, the charge when read in its entirety 
  does not bear that interpretation.  She contends that read in its entirety, 
  the charge directed the jury to consider all of the evidence and to determine 
  first whether the appellant was the shooter (referred to as scenario 1 in the 
  charge) and, if not, whether he was a party to the homicide under s. 21(2) (referred 
  to as scenario 2 in the charge).  She submits that given the position of the 
  parties and the evidence adduced at trial, this instruction was appropriate 
  and would have assisted the jury in applying the relevant legal principles to 
  the facts as it found them.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These submissions require a detailed review of the entire charge.  Parts 
  of the charge do support the position taken by counsel for the appellant.  Other 
  parts are somewhat confusing.  It is important, however, to put these parts 
  of the charge in the context of the entire charge and in the context of the 
  issues raised at trial, the positions taken by the parties, and the evidence 
  heard by the jury:  <i>R. v. Cooper</i> (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 301 (S.C.C.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is equally important to bear in mind that jurors are intelligent 
  people who do not park their brains outside the jury room when they begin to 
  deliberate:  see <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 at 411 (S.C.C.).  
  It seems to me that unless clearly told to do so, a jury would not readily understand 
  that it should ignore an accused’s evidence in arriving at a verdict.  Nor, 
  as a matter of common sense, would a jury readily understand how it could determine 
  whether it should come to any conclusion as to the veracity of the Crown’s evidence 
  without also considering the veracity of the contradictory evidence tendered 
  by the defence.  </p>

  </span> The trial judge told the jury at the outset of his instructions that 
  they must assess the entirety of the evidence and the arguments of counsel.  
  Shortly afterwards, he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>You are going to have to deal with the testimony or the evidence given 
      by each witness.  Often in a criminal case, the evidence is disputed by 
      witnesses on the opposite sides.  We have that in the present case.  <u>Obviously, 
      the two versions of what transpired inside the store cannot be reconciled.  
      You are going to have to take a good look at these two versions and then 
      make your decision about what you should be doing about that.</u>  [Emphasis

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The two versions referred to are the version of Mr. Day in which his 
  father was struggling with a single robber when he was shot, and the version 
  of the accused in which the deceased was struggling with both robbers when he 
  was shot.  I see nothing wrong with the trial judge’s introduction of the concept 
  of two versions of the relevant events.  This provided an apt shorthand description 
  of the crucial evidentiary conflict raised in this case.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In explaining reasonable doubt, the trial judge again reminded the jury 
  that their verdict must turn on an assessment of the entire case.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… You sit back for a moment and examine the whole situation and, once you 
      have the whole case in front of you, then it is that burden.  …</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Immediately after this instruction, the trial judge turned to the accused’s 
  credibility.  He instructed the jury in accordance with <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, 
  on three occasions.  This instruction is important to the validity of this submission 
  because in my view the instruction makes it clear that before the jury could 
  convict the appellant, it had to not only reject his evidence totally, but also 
  be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of his guilt based on the rest of the 
  evidence.  The approach outlined in <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, and repeated 
  on three occasions by the trial judge, is inconsistent with the contention that 
  the jury was instructed to consider the Crown’s case first and to convict if 
  satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt based only on the Crown’s case.  It is also 
  equally inconsistent with the alternative submission made by the appellant that 
  the jury was told that the appellant’s evidence should be considered only after 
  the Crown’s case was assessed and determined to have established the appellant’s 
  guilt.</p>

  </span> I pause in my review of the trial judge’s instructions to address a 
  submission made by counsel in oral argument.  If I understand him correctly, 
  he argues that the decision in <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, mandates that where 
  the accused testifies, the jury must first consider the appellant’s evidence 
  and decide whether that evidence is believed or raises a reasonable doubt before 
  going on to the rest of the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think that <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, stands for that proposition.  
  As a matter of common sense, a jury could not assess an appellant’s evidence, 
  except in the context of the rest of the evidence.  A jury’s verdict must flow 
  from an application of the burden of proof to the entirety of the evidence.  
  The jury must apply the legal principles given to them by the trial judge.  
  The trial judge must also provide certain instructions as to how the jury should 
  assess credibility.  <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, is one such instruction.  The 
  trial judge must not, however, tell the jury how to deliberate.  The order in 
  which a jury chooses to approach the evidence, like the other mechanics of deliberation, 
  is for the jury.  As Sopinka J. said in <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1988), 44 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 193 at 211 (S.C.C.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The reason we have juries is so that lay persons and not lawyers decide 
      the facts.  To inject into the process artificial legal rules with respect 
      to the natural human activity of deliberation and decision would tend to 
      detract from the value of the jury system.</p>

  </span> <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, has nothing to do with how the jury should 
  proceed with its deliberations, but is directed to how the jury should apply 
  the burden of proof when considering the evidence of the accused.  In <i>R. 
  v. W.(D.), supra</i>, Cory J., applying earlier authority (eg. <i>R. v. Morin, 
  supra</i> and <i>R. v. Challice</i> (1979), 45 C.C.C. (2d) 546 (Ont. C.A.)), 
  observed that it is wrong to tell the jury that it must choose between the competing 
  versions of events advanced by the Crown and defence.  He said, at p. 409:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ideally, appropriate instructions on the issue of credibility should be 
      given, not only during the main charge, but on any recharge.  <u>A trial 
      judge might well instruct the jury on the question of credibility along 
      these lines:</u></p>
    <p><u>First, if you believe the evidence of the accused, obviously you must 
      acquit.  </u></p>
    <p>Secondly, if you do not believe the testimony of the accused but you are 
      left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, even if you are not left in doubt by the evidence of the accused, 
      you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the evidence which you do 
      accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt by that evidence of 
      the guilt of the accused.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> The instruction suggested by Cory J. does not advise the jury to begin 
  with the evidence of the accused.  Rather, it tells them that when assessing 
  the credibility of the accused, they should approach it in the three stages 
  outlined in the model charge.  Properly understood, <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, 
  does not impose any limits on how the jury proceeds with its deliberative process.

  the “two versions” he had described earlier in his instructions.  He described 
  the first version, in which the deceased struggled with only one robber, as 
  supported by the evidence of Mr. Day.  He described the second version in which 
  both robbers were involved in the struggle with the deceased as supported by 
  the evidence of the appellant.  The trial judge explained that on the first 
  version, the appellant would be a principal in the homicide and would be guilty 
  of either murder or manslaughter.  On the second version, the appellant’s liability, 
  if any, depended on s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and was limited to 
  manslaughter.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

  </span> After a detailed review of the evidence, the trial judge cautioned the 
  jury against becoming bogged down in the minutiae of some of the exhibits.  
  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>You have got to at least go back and decide which of the two versions – 
      these are the only two areas in which we have <i>viva voce</i> evidence, 
      that is, the witness evidence about what transpired at that time.  That 
      is, Mr. Derek Day, who has given us one aspect of what he thinks happened, 
      and we have Mr. Carrière, the accused, who, of course, went into detail 
      on what actually – what he says actually did happen.  And so, you are going 
      to have to get down to these two versions at one time or another. …</p>

  </span> He then referred to what he called the version of Derek Day, that is, 
  the version advanced in the case for the Crown.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [I]f it’s Mr. Carrière that goes in there, because of the fact that the 
      bullet hit his finger, went up in the ceiling and put blood on the ceiling, 
      that is exactly like a signature, if nothing more.  <u>What happens then, 
      in a case like that, you have to consider, if you accept that kind of evidence, 
      and it is beyond a reasonable doubt.  I am going to go back over the way 
      that you treat the evidence by Mr. Carrière.  He has to be given – I think 
      there are three ways of dealing with his case – with this case then, when 
      he has testified.</u>  But, if that evidence stands up beyond a reasonable 
      doubt to your satisfaction, then, I would think that the only verdict that 
      you have is to bring the verdict of guilty against Mr. Carrière, and it 
      would be murder in the second degree, except that, of course, you still 
      have to deal with the matter of the intoxication that he has spoken about.

  </span> This instruction may well have sounded better when heard in the context 
  of the full charge than it reads taken in isolation.  I take it to be an instruction 
  that in considering the first version, whereby the appellant would be the principal 
  in the homicide, the jury had to consider Mr. Carrière’s evidence and apply 
  the three-step approach mandated in <i>R. v. W.(D.), supra</i>, as described 
  to the jury earlier by the trial judge.  The trial judge repeated this three-step 
  approach immediately after this instruction.</p>

  </span> The trial judge then referred to the “other scenario” whereby the appellant’s 
  liability, if any, would be as a party under s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  and told the jury that it must give the evidence in support of that scenario 
  “equal consideration to that of Mr. Day’s evidence”.  The trial judge repeated 
  his instruction that both versions had to be given “equal consideration” later 
  in his charge.  </p>

  </span> Having said all this, the trial judge gave the instruction which is 
  most heavily relied on by the appellant.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>I think you should look at the scenario with respect to Mr. Derek Day’s 
      evidence and deal with that first.  Because, if it is – if you are convinced 
      about that beyond a reasonable doubt, then, of course, that is the end of 
      it.  You don’t need to consider the other matter of the second scenario,</u> 
      because you would have, in effect, believed everything that happened.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

  </span> This passage read alone is troubling.  I think, however, that read in 
  the context of the instructions that preceded it, the jury would have understood 
  the reference to “the scenario with respect to Mr. Derek Day’s evidence” as 
  a reference to the Crown’s contention that the appellant was the shooter and 
  not a reference to the evidence of Mr. Day exclusively.  I think the jury would 
  have understood that it was being told to first decide whether it was satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was the shooter.  I do not understand 
  the trial judge to be telling the jury that it could make this assessment based 
  only on Mr. Day’s evidence.  I am strengthened in this conclusion by the trial 
  judge’s brief summary of the pertinent evidence following this instruction.  
  In that summary, he outlined not only the Crown evidence, but also the evidence 
  of the appellant.  If, as I would hold, the trial judge was telling the jury 
  that it should first decide whether the appellant was the shooter, there can 
  be no quarrel with his direction that if it was so satisfied, it need not consider 
  the second scenario wherein the appellant was not the shooter.  </p>

  </span> Counsel did not raise this objection at trial.  Where a ground of appeal 
  depends on the overall impression conveyed by jury instructions, parts of which 
  are problematic, I think that trial counsel’s reaction to that instruction is 
  a helpful barometer as to the meaning conveyed by the entirety of the instruction.  
  If this instruction had conveyed the meaning counsel for the appellant suggests, 
  trial counsel would certainly have raised an objection to what would have been 
  a fundamental error in the charge.  The absence of any objection lends some 
  support to the Crown’s interpretation of the passage.</p>

  </span> In the normal course, reversible error in the jury instruction results 
  in a new trial.  Counsel for the appellant and the Crown took the position in 
  oral argument that if the verdict was quashed because of misdirection relating 
  to intoxication, this court should dismiss the appeal and enter a conviction 
  on the included offence of manslaughter.  The court’s power to make that order 
  is found in s. 686(1)(b)(i) which provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>686.(1) On the hearing of an appeal against a conviction or against a verdict 
      that the appellant is unfit to stand trial or not criminally responsible 
      on account of mental disorder, the court of appeal</p>
    <p>(b) may dismiss the appeal where</p>
    <p>(i)  the court is of the opinion that the appellant, although he was <u>not 
      properly convicted on a count or part of the indictment, was properly convicted</u> 
      on another count or part of the indictment.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> If the court dismisses an appeal under s. 686(1)(b)(i), its remedial 
  powers are found in s. 686(3):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>686(3)  Where a court of appeal dismisses an appeal under subparagraph 
      (1)(b)(i), <u>it may substitute the verdict that in its opinion should have

  </span> The scope of the power of the appellate court to substitute a conviction 
  for an included offence pursuant to s. 686(1)(b)(i) is the subject of some debate 
  in the authorities:  <i>R. v. Popoff</i> (1960), 129 C.C.C. 250 (B.C.C.A.);  
  <i>R. v. Nantais</i>, [1966] 4 C.C.C. 108 (Ont. C.A.);  <i>R. v. Morris</i> 
  (1975), 29 C.C.C. (2d) 540 at 556-57 (N.B.C.A.), leave to appeal to the Supreme 
  Court of Canada refused January 27, 1976;  <i>R. v. Kent</i> (1986), 27 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 405 at 436-37 (Man. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is clear from these authorities that where the court is asked to 
  substitute a manslaughter conviction on a murder appeal it can do so only if 
  a properly instructed jury could not have returned a verdict that was more favourable 
  to the accused than a manslaughter conviction:  <i>R. v. Kent, supra</i>, at 
  pp. 437-38.  That requirement is met here.  The jury was satisfied beyond a 
  reasonable doubt that the appellant was the shooter.  Had they been properly 
  instructed with respect to intoxication, the appellant could have done no better 
  than a manslaughter verdict.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Some of the cases suggest that if, on a proper instruction, the jury 
  could have convicted of murder, the court of appeal cannot substitute a conviction 
  for manslaughter:  <i>R. v. Morris, supra</i>.  It is said in these cases that 
  where a reasonable jury could have convicted of murder, the appellate court 
  cannot be satisfied that a manslaughter conviction is the proper verdict.  There 
  is merit to this contention absent a concession by the Crown that manslaughter 
  is the appropriate result.  Where, however, as here, the Crown makes that concession, 
  I think it is open to the appellate court to conclude that while the appellant 
  was not properly convicted of murder, given the misdirection, manslaughter is 
  the proper conviction given the Crown’s concession that it does not seek a retrial 
  on the murder charge.  This was the course followed by the Supreme Court of 
  Canada in <i>R. v. Wigman</i> (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 109 (S.C.C.).  In 
  so holding, I do not suggest that the appellate court is bound by the Crown’s 
  concession, but only that such a concession enables the court, if it deems it 
  appropriate, to exercise its powers under s. 686(1)(b)(i).</p>

  </span> The appellant’s evidence of his alcohol consumption stands uncontradicted.  
  The circumstances in which the homicide occurred also lend some support to the 
  contention that the appellant did not have the intention necessary to commit 
  murder.  In these circumstances, I would accede to the position taken by both 
  counsel and substitute a conviction for manslaughter rather than ordering a 
  retrial on the murder charge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel also take the position that this court should impose the appropriate 
  sentence.  While generally speaking, I think sentences should be imposed in 
  the trial court, there is a special circumstance here.  The appellant is serving 
  a concurrent life sentence on his robbery conviction.  That sentence may have 
  to be varied depending on the appropriate sentence for manslaughter.  Only this 
  court can vary the sentence imposed on the robbery conviction.  Consequently, 
  I agree with counsel that this court should sentence the appellant on the manslaughter 
  conviction.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel should contact the Registrar to make arrangements to discuss 
  with me the manner in which the sentencing should proceed.</p>
[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
</span> I would dismiss the appeal pursuant to s. 686(1)(b)(i), quash the conviction 
for second degree murder and enter a conviction for manslaughter.  I would further 
direct that the appellant be sentenced at a time to be fixed.
