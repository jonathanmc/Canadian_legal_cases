</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants are a group of highly reputable media organizations.
They appeal from the order of Roberts&nbsp;J., dated November 1, 2000,
upholding the validity of search warrants issued by Dobney J. (O.C.J.) on July
11, 2000 and executed at their respective business premises between July 11 and
July 14, 2000. The warrants were obtained by the Toronto Police Service in the
course of an investigation into a wide range of criminal offences arising out
of a demonstration organized by the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty and
carried out at Queen's Park and elsewhere in Toronto on June 15, 2000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants bring this appeal out of a collective concern that the
procedures governing the authorization and review of search warrants, which are
based on a model of prior <i>ex parte</i>
authorization followed by a right of judicial review, fail to provide adequate
safeguards to ensure that the media is able to carry out its constitutionally
protected role as a gatherer and disseminator of news, free from unwarranted
state intrusion.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>To that end, the appellants submit that the decision of the Supreme
Court of Canada in <i>Canadian Broadcasting
Corp. v. New Brunswick (Attorney-General)</i> (1991), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 544 should
be revisited. In that case, Cory J., for the majority, identified seven factors
that a justice, acting under s. 487 of the <i>Code</i>,
must consider before issuing a warrant to search the premises of a news media
organization. The primary issue in this appeal is whether that list should be
augmented to include an eighth factor. The appellants say that it should. In
particular, they submit that when, as in this case, the four circumstances
identified below exist, before issuing a search warrant, a justice must afford
the media notice and a right to make submissions, failing which, the issuance
of a warrant will constitute jurisdictional error:</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>the media is not the target of the search but an innocent third party;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>the destruction, alteration or concealment of the material sought is
not a realistic possibility;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>there is no urgency in the application; and</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>the media has valid concerns bearing directly on whether the warrant
should issue and if so, on what terms and conditions.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The second issue raised by the appellants calls into question the
integrity of the affidavit to obtain the warrants (the Information) and
specifically, whether the warrants were rendered invalid by reason of the affiant's
failure to disclose pertinent information to the issuing justice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>For reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal. That said, let me
make it clear at the outset that my rejection of the appellants' primary
submission is dependent in large measure upon the particular facts and
circumstances of this case. These reasons should not be taken as an outright
rejection of the concept of <i>inter partes</i>
authorization hearings in the context of media searches. Moreover, although I
consider the prospect remote in the extreme, I do not foreclose, at least in
theory, the possibility that in some instances, the failure on the part of the
issuing justice to provide notice could amount to jurisdictional error.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>By the same token, I do not want to leave the impression that I
consider the traditional model of <i>ex
parte</i> applications to be inadequate and in need of change. Indeed,  I am inclined to the view that with the
added safeguards enumerated in <i>CBC v. New
Brunswick (Attorney-General), supra</i>, the traditional model provides
adequate protection to ensure a strong, vibrant and independent media, free to
carry out its important role in our society without unwarranted state
intrusion.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Bearing in mind what it is the appellants seek to accomplish in this
appeal, namely, the addition of an eighth factor to the list of factors a
justice must consider before issuing a warrant to search media premises under
s. 487 of the <i>Code</i>, I think it would
be useful, before summarizing the facts, to set out the seven factors that must
now be considered. They are identified by Cory J. in <i>CBC v. New Brunswick (Attorney-General), </i>at pages 560-61:</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is essential that all the requirements set out in s.&nbsp;487(1)(b)

of a search warrant be met.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On June 15, 2000, the Ontario Coalition Against Poverty
(&quot;OCAP&quot;) held a demonstration to protest the policies of the current
Ontario government. The avowed purpose of the demonstration, which began at
12:00 p.m. at Allan Gardens in the City of Toronto, was to march to Queen's
Park and once there, to enter and address the Ontario Legislature.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The demonstration was well publicized and the Toronto Police Service
had ample advance notice of it. From previous knowledge and experience with
OCAP, and bearing in mind the demonstrators' intention to gain unauthorized
entry into the Legislature, the Police expected a confrontation.  As a result, extensive security measures
were put in place by both the Ontario Legislative Security Personnel and the
Toronto Police Service.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The police presence at Queen's Park was very large and well planned.
Several hundred officers were present, including members of the mounted unit,
the public order unit,  and uniformed
and undercover officers. Extensive measures, including the use of two perimeter
barricades, were taken to secure the Legislature. In addition, many undercover
police officers were equipped with video and still cameras.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>By 2:00 p.m., approximately 500 demonstrators had assembled at Queen's
Park. Shortly thereafter, violent confrontations began to break out between
some of the demonstrators and the police. The confrontations lasted for
approximately one and a half hours, after which the demonstrators dispersed
from the vicinity of Queen's Park. By this time, a number of demonstrators had
already been arrested. Others marched back to Allan Gardens where they
reassembled. Further arrests were made at that location. </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The demonstration and the ensuing violent confrontations received
extensive media coverage. Journalists, still photographers and video camera
operators from many local and national news organizations were present and
covered the event. All of the appellant television stations broadcast images of
the demonstration that evening, while the Globe and Mail published still
photographs the next day.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The search warrants were sought on the basis of Detective Irwin's
belief that the media cameras had captured images of individuals involved in
criminal acts which police and legislative surveillance had failed to capture;
or, if images were otherwise available to the police, then those from the media
cameras were of superior quality. </span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The Information to obtain the warrants is lengthy and very detailed. In
it, Detective Irwin refers specifically to the <i>Lessard </i>decision from the Supreme Court of Canada<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>
and he went so far as to include as appendix I the relevant passages from that
decision which outline the factors that must be considered by a justice under
s. 487 of the <i>Code</i> before issuing a
warrant to search media premises. </span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Detective Irwin addressed those factors in considerable detail. In
particular, with one possible exception, he disclosed the extensive collection
of photographs and video tapes already in the possession of the police. He went
on to explain that the material being sought from the various media
organizations was needed because in his view, based on the information
available to him, as outlined, the images available to the police did not
capture all available images and in some instances, they were not of equal quality
to the images in the possession of the media.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Mindful of the need to ensure that the proposed searches be conducted
in a reasonable manner, Detective Irwin included a heading in the Information
entitled &quot;Conditions for Media&quot;. The conditions he proposed, which
ultimately found their way into the warrants, served the following four
purposes:</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>they ensured that the seizures would be conducted in a manner that
would interfere as little as possible with the ongoing operations of the media
premises to be searched; </span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>they allowed the media to retain possession of the original video tapes
and photos being sought;</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>they mandated that the police avoid, to the extent possible, examining
any material unconnected with the items being sought;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:18.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>they provided that the materials seized would, upon request by anyone
on the premises, be sealed for a period of time pending an application to the
Superior Court for judicial review.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants take issue with the fact that in the Information to
obtain the warrants, Detective Irwin did not disclose that the police had
utilized their Video Service Section, to record off-air, all television
coverage of the demonstration broadcast by the major media outlets in Toronto.
Let me put this issue to rest now. I acknowledge that Detective Irwin did not
specifically state that he had such footage in his possession. However, when
the Information is read fairly as a whole, I am satisfied that this fact is
implicitly stated and the issuing justice would not have been misled into
thinking otherwise.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Apart from that, the only other allegation of non-disclosure relates to
Detective Irwin's admitted failure to mention the existence of a security
camera system in operation at Queen's Park on June 15, 2000. The amplified
record discloses that on July 14, and July 19, 2000, video tapes from that
system capturing the demonstration were turned over to the Toronto Police
Service. The Information to obtain the warrants makes no mention of these tapes
or any efforts on the part of the police to obtain them.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Immediately after the demonstration, Detective Irwin or one of his
colleagues contacted representatives from each of the fourteen media
organizations upon which the warrants were ultimately executed. The purpose of
the calls was to inform the various organizations that the police would be
executing search warrants in the near future. Through these contacts, Detective
Irwin confirmed that each organization was in possession of the items to be
searched for and seized under the authority of a search warrant. </span></p>

for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, wrote to Murray Segal, Assistant
Deputy Attorney General, Criminal Law Division, requesting an opportunity to
appear before the issuing justice if a warrant was sought. Similar
correspondence was directed to the Crown or the police by counsel for Global
Television, CTV and the Globe and Mail.</span></p>

issuing justice, Detective Irwin identified the concerns of counsel under a
separate heading in the Information entitled &quot;Issues Raised by Counsel

the same time, he deposed that it was his belief, based on his understanding of
s. 487 of the <i>Code</i> and the Supreme
Court's decision in <i>Lessard</i>, that
&quot;search warrant applications are <i>ex

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:36.0pt;'><b><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Issue One: Did the issuing justice commit

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Section 487 of the <i>Code</i> makes
no mention of a hearing on notice. Rather, on its face, it appears to
contemplate an <i>ex parte</i> procedure in
which the issuing justice is required to determine, based on an Information on
oath in Form 1, whether a warrant should issue. That said, Ms. Fairburn for the
Crown concedes, correctly in my view, that the issuing justice retains a
discretion to proceed on notice.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Indirect support for this conclusion is found in <i>R. v. F. (S.)</i> (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 225, a recent decision of
this court dealing with s. 487.05(1) of the <i>Code</i>.
In summary form, s. 487.05(1) authorizes a provincial court judge &quot;on <i>ex parte</i> application&quot; to issue a
warrant to obtain a bodily substance for DNA analysis. One of the issues to be
determined was whether, in light of the specific language used, the provision
should be interpreted to mean that the issuing judge could only proceed <i>ex parte</i>. On behalf of a unanimous
court, Finlayson J.A. rejected that interpretation. Instead, he viewed the
language as permissive and concluded that the issuing judge retained a
discretion to proceed on notice. Given that s. 487(1) does not speak to the
nature of the proceeding, in my view, the case for holding that a residual
discretion to proceed on notice lies with the issuing justice under that provision
is all the more compelling.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Before Roberts J., the appellants argued that Dobney J. erred in
failing to exercise her discretion in favour of a hearing on notice. Roberts J.
rejected that argument. In his view, having regard to the Information to obtain
the warrants, Dobney J. would have been alive to the request by some of the
appellants for a hearing on notice and there was no reason to believe that in
refusing their requests, she exercised her discretion improperly. I agree
entirely with that conclusion. </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Before this court, the appellants have framed the issue somewhat
differently. As indicated, it is now their position that in the circumstances
of this case, Dobney&nbsp;J., in effect, had no discretion to exercise. Rather,
the only course open to her was to provide the affected parties with notice and
her failure to do so constituted jurisdictional error, thereby rendering the
warrants invalid. </span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In support of their position, the appellants rely on several unrelated,
but in their view analogous authorities from the Supreme Court of Canada that
post-date the Court's decisions in <i>CBC v.
New Brunswick (Attorney-General) </i>and <i>Lessard</i>.
Specifically, they rely on <i>Dagenais v.
Canadian Broadcasting Corp. </i>(1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), a case
involving common law publication bans in which the Supreme Court held that
notice should be given to the media when such bans are sought. (See also <i>CBC v. New Brunswick (Attorney-General)</i>
(1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) in which the Court expressed the same view
with respect to applications under s.&nbsp;486 of the <i>Code</i> for an in camera hearing.)</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants submit that <i>Dagenais</i>
lends support to their position that in proceedings where the rights of the
media under s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>
are implicated, the media should be given prior notice.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect, I think that the analogy is inapt. Unlike applications to
obtain search warrants, which have traditionally been conducted in private on
an <i>ex parte</i> basis, the cases referred
to relate to criminal proceedings in which the principle of openness and the
right to attend and report are firmly rooted in common law and now
constitutionally enshrined.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Looked at contextually, I see a world of difference between depriving
the media of notice in criminal proceedings, where openness has traditionally
been the rule, not the exception, and where a publication ban or an in camera
order will have a direct and immediate impact on the media's ability to gather
and disseminate news in a timely fashion, if at all; and depriving the media of
notice of an investigatory proceeding that has traditionally been conducted in
private on an <i>ex parte</i> basis and
which contains built-in safeguards designed to protect and preserve the media's
ability to carry out its important function. This is especially so in cases
like the one at hand, where the material being sought is similar to that
already published by the media and where there is no suggestion that it
emanates from a confidential source or is otherwise the product of media
research or investigation.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Secondly, the appellants rely on cases such as <i>R. v. O'Connor</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), <i>R. v. Mills</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 321
(S.C.C.) as well as the statutory scheme in ss.&nbsp;278.1 to 278.9 of the <i>Code</i> in support of their position. In
essence, they submit that because notice must be given to third party
complainants or witnesses when a non-state actor is attempting to seek access
to personal records that may, and often do contain confidential information,
notice should also be given to the media when the state is seeking photos and
videos of a public and publicized event.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Again, in my view, the analogy is inapt especially in the context of
this case. Apart from the nature of the material being sought, in one case
private and in the other predominantly public, it is important to recognize
that in the case of complainants and witnesses, if notice is not provided at
the outset and the private information is disclosed to non-state actors or the
public at large, the harm cannot be undone on review. This is very different
from situations like the one at hand, where, under the terms of the warrant,
the media is entitled to request that the seized material be sealed and is then
given the opportunity on review to amplify the record and to make submissions
before the state actors gain meaningful access to the material.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In sum, having particular regard to the facts and circumstances of this
case, I am of the view that the link the appellants seek to draw from
authorities that post-date <i>Lessard </i>and
<i>CBC v. New Brunswick (Attorney-General)</i>
is tenuous at best and unhelpful in resolving the issue at hand<i>.</i></span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants also rely on various statutory schemes in the United
States and Great Britain which provide the media, in certain circumstances,
with a right to be heard from the outset when the state seeks material in its
possession. Once again, I find these references to be of little assistance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The situation in the United States is by no means uniform and many
states employ the same model as the one traditionally used in Canada.
Significantly, if regard is to be had to the American experience, it must be
emphasized that in <i>Zurcher v. The
Stanford Daily</i>, (1978) 436 U.S. 547, the United States Supreme Court, in a
case similar to the one at hand, specifically rejected the media's argument
that it had a constitutional right to a hearing on notice. Instead, Justice
White, for the majority, endorsed as constitutionally permissible a model of
prior <i>ex parte</i> judicial authorization
similar to the traditional model used in this country.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>As for the experience in Great Britain, suffice it to say that in
circumstances similar to those at hand, where the material in question consists
of videos and photos of public and publicized events, prior notice or not, the
police have invariably succeeded in obtaining the material sought. Admittedly,
that is not a full answer to the argument put forward by the appellants. It
does, however, bring me back to the focal point of this appeal, namely, whether
in the particular circumstances of this case, the issuing justice committed
jurisdictional error by failing to provide the media with notice and a right to
be heard on the application for the search warrants.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Given my rejection of the appellants' arguments to this point, to
conclude that Dobney J. committed such an error, I would first have to be
satisfied that there is some other basis for distinguishing <i>Lessard</i> and <i>CBC v. New Brunswick (Attorney-General) </i>from the present case.
Failing that, I would have to be persuaded of the possibility raised by the
appellants that the majority in those cases simply failed to consider the issue
of <i>inter partes</i> authorization
hearings.</span></p>

record, as amplified before Roberts J., to distinguish this case from the two
earlier Supreme Court decisions. In particular, they point to the extensive
affidavit evidence from various media personnel which identifies the short and
long term harmful effects that police search and seizure can have on the media's
ability to fulfill its constitutionally protected function. For convenience,
the alleged harmful effects are repeated:</span></p>

the appellants rely adds nothing to what was considered by the Supreme Court in
the earlier cases. One need only refer to the dissenting reasons of McLachlin

realize this.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In <i>Lessard</i>, McLachlin J.
expressed the view that the search of media premises in circumstances akin to
those at hand amounts to an infringement of the rights guaranteed to the media
under s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. As the
following passage at pp. 539-40 of her reasons indicate, in coming to this
conclusion she placed considerable emphasis on the harmful effects, both short
and long term, that police search and seizure can have on the media's ability
to perform its constitutionally protected function:</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>            The ways in which police search and
seizure may impinge on the values underlying freedom of the press are manifest.
First, searches may be physically disruptive and impede efficient and timely
publication. Secondly, retention of seized material by the police may delay or
forestall completing the dissemination of the news. Thirdly, confidential
sources of information may be fearful of speaking to the press, and the press
may lose opportunities to cover various events because of fears on the part of
participants that press files will be readily available to the authorities.
Fourthly, reporters may be deterred from recording and preserving their
recollections for future use. Fifthly, the processing of news and its
dissemination may be chilled by the prospect that searches will disclose
internal editorial deliberations. Finally, the press may resort to
self-censorship to conceal the fact that it possesses information that may be
of interest to the police in an effort to protect its sources and its ability
to gather news in the future.  All this
may adversely impact on the role of the media in furthering the search for
truth, community participation and self-fulfillment.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In my view, the harmful effects identified by McLachlin J. are
virtually identical to those relied upon by the appellants in support of their
submission that had the majority in <i>Lessard</i>
been aware of them, they might have required mandatory <i>inter partes</i> hearings in certain circumstances. To accept that
submission, I would have to assume that the majority did not read McLachlin
J.'s dissenting opinion, a proposition that I reject out of hand.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The same applies to the alternate position put forward by the
appellants, namely, that the majority in the earlier cases may simply have
failed to consider the added safeguard of <i>inter
partes</i> hearings. Once again, in my view, McLachlin J.'s dissenting opinion
in <i>Lessard</i> forecloses that
possibility. After concluding that the searches like the one at hand violate
the rights guaranteed to the media under s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, McLachlin J. turned her attention to s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i> and identified the conditions
that must be met to justify the issuance of a warrant to search and seize
materials from media premises. In the context of that analysis, at p.&nbsp;542
she stated:</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:72.0pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:72.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>            The requirement that the
infringement go no further than is necessary to achieve the desired object
demands like particularity. The justice should cast the warrant in terms which
reduce as far as possible the effects of the infringement. Matters such as
timing, specificity of the items to be seized, and conditions protecting the
identity  of informants may fall to be
considered, as may the manner in which the warrant is to be executed. For
example, where there is no reason to believe the press will destroy the
material or refuse to surrender it, it might be reasonable for the warrant to
require that the information be surrendered rather than allowing the police to
search the premises and seize the materials. (This appears to be a common
practice at present.)</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:72.0pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:72.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:36.0pt;'><u><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In some cases a
justice concerned to minimize impact or concerned as to whether the warrant
should issue at all may wish to receive representations from the press organ in
question, especially in circumstances where the need for the suspected evidence
is not particularly urgent and there is no reason to suspect that the evidence
in question will be concealed or destroyed</span></u><span lang=EN-US

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The emphasized portion is instructive for two reasons. First, it puts
to rest the notion that the majority may have failed to consider the
possibility of <i>inter partes</i> hearings.
Second, and perhaps of greater significance, it points out that even if one
starts from the premise that in certain circumstances, the search of media
premises constitutes a s. 2(b) infringement and must be justified, something
the majority did not accept, the failure on the part of the issuing justice to
provide notice will not necessarily constitute jurisdictional error. To the
contrary, McLachlin J. went no further than to state that the issuing justice
retains a discretion to provide notice.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In sum, nothing in <i>Lessard</i> or
<i>CBC v. New Brunswick (Attorney-General)</i>
leads me to believe that the majority envisaged the need for <i>inter partes</i> hearings in circumstances
like those in the present case. Indeed, I read the majority as implicitly
eschewing the notion. In the last analysis, the most that can be said is that
the issuing justice retains a discretion to provide notice. In this case,
Dobney J. chose not to provide notice and I see no basis for interfering with
her decision.</span></p>

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Before leaving this issue, I wish to comment briefly on the overarching
concern that underlies the appellants' dissatisfaction with the traditional
model of <i>ex parte</i> authorization
followed by judicial review.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants concede that on the review hearing before Roberts J.,
they were entitled to and did lead all the evidence they would have led before
the issuing justice had notice been provided. They further agree that had they
received notice, the submissions before the issuing justice would not have
differed from those made to Roberts J. on the review hearing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>To this extent, the appellants take no issue with the review process
that forms part of the traditional model. Their difficulty lies with the test
to be applied by the reviewing justice in determining whether a search warrant
has or has not been validly issued. That test, they submit, is overly
restrictive because it does not permit the reviewing justice to engage in a <i>de novo</i> hearing. Rather, the reviewing
judge is simply entitled to consider the record before the issuing justice, as
amplified on review, in order to decide whether the issuing justice <u>could</u>
have granted the authorization. If that question is answered in the
affirmative, then even if the reviewing judge would not have issued the warrant
in the first instance, he or she cannot interfere.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Although I appreciate the concern raised by the appellants, in the
context of this case, I am inclined to think that the existing regime provides
adequate protection to the media. On judicial review, as Cory J. observed at p.
554 of <i>CBC v. New Brunswick
(Attorney-General)</i>, the judge is required to consider all of the facts and
circumstances, including those identified in the amplified record, against the
backdrop of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, with
a view to determining whether the issuance of the warrant constituted
jurisdictional error. In the case of the media, as Cory J. explained at pp.
560-61, apart from satisfying the statutory preconditions in s. 487 of the <i>Code</i>, special conditions apply when a
warrant is sought to search media premises. While more will be said about this
in the context of the second ground of appeal, for the moment, suffice it to
say that in deciding whether a warrant to search media premises should issue
and if so, upon what conditions, the issuing justice must weigh a number of
factors, including the effects of the search and seizure on the media's ability
to fulfill its function as a news gatherer and news disseminator. If the
reviewing judge concludes that the issuing justice, in exercising his or her
discretion, failed to give adequate or any consideration to a pertinent factor
and/or the amplified record discloses information that was not before the
issuing justice and that could well have affected the decision to issue the
warrant, this may result in a finding that the warrant was invalid and should
not have been issued.</span></p>

Brunswick. During the protest, several protestors threw molotov cocktails at
the company's guardhouse, setting it on fire. At the time of the incident, a

</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In his reasons on behalf of the majority, Cory J. recognized the
significance of the role of the media in our society and he concluded that
special concerns must be addressed when a warrant is sought to search media
premises. He went on, however, to observe that the constitutional guarantee
afforded to the media in s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter
</i>does not import any new or additional requirements for the issuance of
search warrants involving media premises. Rather, it provided a backdrop
against which the reasonableness of the search was to be evaluated. In
particular, it required that careful consideration be given not only to whether
a warrant should issue but also the conditions that might properly be imposed
upon a search of media premises. At pp. 560-61, Cory J. summarized the factors
that a justice must consider before issuing a warrant to search media premises.
Those factors are found at paragraph 7 above and need not be repeated, except
for the fifth factor, which I consider to be of singular importance to the
issue at hand:</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:72.0pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:108.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-36.0pt;'><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Although it is not a constitutional requirement, the affidavit material
should ordinarily disclose whether there are alternative sources from which the
information may reasonably be obtained and, if there is an alternative source,
that it has been investigated and all reasonable efforts to obtain the
information have been exhausted.</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>This factor is important because although Cory J. notes that the
Information to obtain the warrant should ordinarily disclose whether alternate
sources exist from which the information may reasonably be obtained, he was
clear that this did not reach the level of a constitutional requirement. At pp.
556-57, in the passage reproduced below, Cory&nbsp;J., at least indirectly,
identified the circumstances in which the failure to disclose alternate sources
might well be fatal to the validity of the warrant:</span></p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:72.0pt;margin-bottom:
0cm;margin-left:108.0pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;'><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Whether the
search of a media office can be considered reasonable will depend on a number
of factors including the nature of the objects to be seized, the manner in
which the search is to be conducted and the degree of urgency of the search. It
is of particular importance that the justice of the peace consider the effects
of the search and seizure on the ability of the particular media organization
in question to fulfil its function as a news gatherer and news disseminator. <u>If
a search will impede the media from fulfilling these functions and the
impediments cannot reasonably be controlled through the imposition of
conditions on the execution of the search warrant, then a warrant should only
be issued where a compelling state interest is demonstrated. This might be
accomplished by satisfying the two factors set out by Nemetz C.J.B.C. in <i>Pacific Press</i>: namely, that there is no
alternative source of information available or, if there is, that reasonable
steps have been taken to obtain the information from that source.
Alternatively, the search might be justified on the grounds of the gravity of
the offence under investigation and the urgent need to obtain the evidence
expected to be revealed by the search</u>. (Emphasis added)</span></p>

circumstances surrounding the impugned search with a view to determining
whether it impeded the media in its function. In doing so, he took into account
all of the possible short and long term effects that searches of this nature
might have on the ability of the media to perform its constitutionally
protected function. Given that the facts and circumstances of that case are
very similar to those in the present case, I am of the view that Cory J.'s
statement at p.&nbsp;561 of his reasons is dispositive of the issue raised by
the appellants:</span></p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The <i>Criminal Code</i>, by means of s. 487, does
no more than require that a justice of the peace, before issuing a search warrant,
be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that something which
will afford evidence with respect to the commission of a crime will be found in
the described building, receptacle or place. In the present case, Officer
Ouellette's information was sufficient to meet these requirements. <u>There is
no evidence in this case that the search impeded the media in their function of
gathering and disseminating the news. In these circumstances, the search was a
reasonable one under s. 8 of the Charter, notwithstanding any deficiencies in
the information with respect to alternate sources</u>. (Emphasis added)</span></p>

think that the issuing justice might not have authorized the warrants had she
been aware of the missing information. I say this because there is no basis to
infer, let alone conclude, that the images obtained from the second security
system could realistically have been of the same or better quality than the
images captured by the media personnel on scene. That being so, it follows that
the second security system could not reasonably be characterized as an
alternate source for the material being sought.</span></p>
