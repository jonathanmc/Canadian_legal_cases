<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>FINLAYSON J.A.:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These two motions were heard together.  They are motions to quash 
  the appeals in two class proceedings under the <i>Class Proceedings Act,</i> 
  1992, S.O. 1992, c.6 (“<i>CPA</i>”) from an order of Mr. Justice Cumming relating 
  to both proceedings.  In what is sometimes referred to as the Royal Trust action, 
  the prospectus class action plaintiffs are shareholders of YBM Magnex, International 
  Inc. (“YBM”) who purchased or acquired common shares in YBM distributed by a 
  prospectus dated November 17, 1997 that they allege contained material misrepresentations 
  and suffered a loss as a result thereof.  In what is sometimes referred to as 
  the Mondor action, the general class action plaintiffs are shareholders who 
  dealt in shares of YBM in the secondary market between March 10, 1996 and May 
  10, 1998 and suffered a net loss as a result.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The defendants who are the appellants in these proceedings were 
  the auditors of YBM and underwriters of the prospectus financing.  YBM has been 
  in receivership since December 1998, when Ernst &amp; Young YBM Inc. was appointed 
  receiver (“Receiver”).  On June 7, 1999, YBM pleaded guilty in the United States 
  to a multi-object conspiracy to commit fraud relating to the purchase or sale 
  of YBM securities and the filing of reports containing material misrepresentations 
  and omissions.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Receiver’s counsel prepared a report, called a s. 3(o) Report, 
  analyzing the causes of action YBM may have against all or some of YBM’s advisors, 
  including the appellants.  A copy of the s. 3(o) Report was provided to certain 
  shareholders of a group called the “innocent shareholders”, who are not connected 
  with YBM’s fraud, for the purpose of instructing the Receiver’s counsel concerning 
  causes of action which YBM may have.  Both the prospectus class action plaintiffs 
  and the general class action plaintiffs regard themselves as innocent shareholders 
  and have requested that a copy of this report be made available to their solicitors.  
  The Receiver is not averse to making the report available but only in the event 
  that a court has determined that there is a common interest privilege in the 
  report and that there would be no waiver of that privilege by such release.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In response to motions by both the Royal Trust 
  class action plaintiffs and the Mondor class action plaintiffs, Cumming J. ordered 
  and declared that the prospectus class action plaintiffs and the general class 
  action plaintiffs are in common interest with the Receiver of YBM on common 
  issues as against the appellants and, therefore, that the Receiver may provide 
  a copy of the s. 3(o) Report to their respective solicitors and to other members 
  of the potential class, without waiver of any privilege which may attach to 
  it.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The defendants in those two class actions have 
  appealed this order to the Court of Appeal. The prospectus class action plaintiffs 
  and the general class action plaintiffs move to quash those appeals on the basis 
  that the order under appeal is interlocutory and, therefore, an appeal lies 
  only to the Divisional Court, with leave.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The reasons of the motions judge set out some helpful findings 
  that can be related to the issue as to whether his order is final or interlocutory.  
  First of all, he declares that there is a shared mutual interest between the 
  Receiver and the class action plaintiffs that should facilitate judicial economy 
  through shared expenses and research in assisting the Receiver to determine 
  what derivative actions to bring on behalf of YBM.  As he put it:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[38]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Receiver and the plaintiffs in the 
      class actions share a common interest and accordingly, the Receiver ought 
      to be able to share the 3(o) Report with the class action plaintiffs without 
      waiving privilege.  The 3(o) Report may provide the class action plaintiffs 
      with facts and legal analysis to assist them in their pleadings and conduct 
      of the class actions.  At the same time, allowing the class action plaintiffs 
      to make use of the 3(o) Report will enable the “innocent shareholders” to 
      assist the Receiver in determining what derivative action to bring on behalf 
      of YBM.  The shared, mutual interests of the Receiver and the class action 
      plaintiffs should facilitate judicial economy through shared expenses and 
      research.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Secondly, there is an express finding that there is no prejudice 
  to the defendants in the action at large.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>[34]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view, the defendants are not prejudiced 
      by the granting of this motion.  The motions at hand do not relate to production 
      from the defendants.  The 3(o) Report was produced for the Receiver.  No 
      right of the defendants is affected.  As stated above, the 3(o) Report will 
      be listed, at the least, in the affidavit of documents of the [prospectus 
      class action plaintiffs].  The defendants can, if so advised, then challenge 
      the Receiver’s claim for privilege and, if successful, gain production of 
      the 3(o) Report.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Third, he described the order sought as being 
  appropriate to the conduct of a class proceeding.</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[40]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 12 of the <i>CPA</i> enables 
      the court to make any order it considers appropriate respecting the conduct 
      of a class proceeding to “ensure its fair and expeditious determination”.  
      In my view, the plaintiffs’ motion is properly brought at this time.  Moreover, 
      the relief requested is appropriate and necessary at this time to ensure 
      a fair and expeditious determination of the class actions.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>And finally, the motions judge makes it clear 
  that he is not making any finding as to whether the s. 3(o) Report is privileged 
  but restricts his finding to stating that compliance with his declaration does 
  not constitute a waiver of privilege.</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[43]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Receiver has indicated that it is 
      prepared to share the 3(o) Report with the counsel for the class action 
      plaintiffs, as authorized by the Alberta Court, but only in the event that 
      a court has determined that there is a common interest privilege and that 
      there is no waiver of the Receiver’s claimed privilege.  The class action 
      plaintiffs were placed in the position of being unable to gain access to 
      the 3(o) Report unless they brought the motion now before the court for 
      the requisite determination of common interest privilege and that there 
      would be no waiver of the Receiver’s claimed privilege.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The effect of the declaration of common intent simply permits 
  the Receiver, if it wishes to do so, to release the s. 3(o) Report to the class 
  action plaintiffs.  The issue of whether the s. 3(o) Report is privileged is 
  not addressed.  In our view, the order in appeal does not resolve any substantive 
  issue in the proceedings.  It is clearly procedural and interlocutory.  The 
  fact that it is in the form of a declaratory order does not change its substance. 
  While admittedly an interlocutory declaration on purely procedural matters is 
  unusual, it has been done and recognized as interlocutory: see Prowse J.A. in 
  <i>Gitanyow First Nation v. Canada</i> (1999), 127 B.C.A.C. 261.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The arguments made against the declaration in this court were 
  largely directed to the motions judge making it at all.  The suggestions that 
  it amounted to a waiver of privilege and other dark consequences are directed 
  to the merits of the appeal, not the form of the order.  On this motion to quash 
  the appeals, we are restricted to determining whether this court or the Divisional 
  Court should hear the appeal. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The responding parties also argue that the order is final because 
  it involves a stranger to the proceedings, namely the Receiver.  While the Receiver 
  may not be a party to these class actions in the strict legal sense, it is scarcely 
  a stranger to them having regard to the history of the proceedings here and 
  in other jurisdictions: see <i>Bank of American Canada v. Willan Investments 
  Ltd.</i>, a judgment of the Ontario Court of Appeal, delivered April 7, 1993,<i> 
  </i>[1993] O.J. 770.  More significantly, it has taken no part in challenging 
  the declaration in appeal. There is no authority to support the suggestion that 
  an order or declaration that is otherwise interlocutory becomes final simply 
  because it is directed to an entity that is not a party to the proceedings.  
  If the stranger to the proceedings seeks to quash or set aside the order, the 
  case law recognizes that in that circumstance the order assumes a different 
  status: it is final.  However, if the person to whom the order is directed responds 
  to it or is even passive with respect to it, I can think of no reason why the 
  order does not remain interlocutory <i>vis a vis </i>parties to the proceeding.  
  The declaration before the court is not a case where the only avenue of leave 
  for those who feel aggrieved by the order to appeal is on the basis of the finding 
  that it was a final order.  All of these respondents who find difficulty with 
  the order can challenge the propriety of it by proceeding with leave to the 
  Divisional Court.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The responding parties rely on <i>Smerchanski v. Lewis</i> (1980), 
  30 O.R. (2d) 370 (C.A.) for the proposition that where an order affects a non-party 
  or “stranger to the action”, the order will be considered to be final for the 
  purposes of appeal.  Arnup J.A. stated at p. 377-78:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Furthermore, it is my view that the appealability of an order is determined 
      by the nature of the order made and not by the identity of the successful 
      party.  If a stranger to the action who has been unsuccessful in an application 
      made to the trial Judge has an immediate right of appeal, it seems to me 
      clear that where the stranger succeeds before the trial Judge, the party 
      to the action who failed in the issue with the stranger should have an immediate 
      right of appeal.  In short, an order made in an issue between a party and 
      a stranger is either appealable or it is not, and if it is appealable, the 
      party who lost in the issue has a right of appeal.</p>

  </span></span> The judgment in <i>Smerchanski v. Lewis, supra</i>, has been 
  the subject of critical commentary.  In particular, it has been explained that 
  the comments made in the judgment do not sit well with the prior jurisprudence, 
  according to which the finality of an order may indeed depend on the identity 
  of the successful party:  Sopinka and Gelowitz, <i>The Conduct of an Appeal</i>, 
  2d. ed. (2000), at p. 18.  Furthermore, as stated in Watson and Perkins, <i>Ontario 
  Civil Procedure</i> at p. 62-30:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In a number of respects the <i>Smerchanski </i>decision is unsatisfactory.  
      At a minimum the decision was simply unnecessary.  There are strong policy 
      arguments against any rule which allows for an immediate appeal from rulings 
      or orders made in mid-trial. When the person adversely affected by the order 
      is a non-party, and hence cannot appeal from the final judgment in the action, 
      other considerations come into play, particularly where a claim of privilege 
      is denied and the stranger is ordered to produce. … That, however, was not 
      the situation in S<i>merchanski</i>.  … The court should have addressed 
      itself to the question it has asked in other contexts:  did the decision 
      finally determine the appellant’s rights?  The answer is that it did not.  
      Applied literally, <i>Smerchanski</i> would make all orders involving non-parties’ 
      [<i>sic</i>] final orders.</p>

  </span></span> <span> </span>In <i>Sun Life Assurance Co. v. York Ridge Developments 
  Ltd.</i> (1998), 28 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 16 (Ont. C.A.), this court distinguished 
  <i>Smerchanski v. Lewis, supra</i>.  Weiler J.A. stated at p. 19:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The decision in <i>Smerchanski, supra</i>, dealt with a subpoena which 
      had been issued to a stranger to an action during the course of a trial.  
      Arnup J.A. held that the trial judge’s decision to quash the subpoena had 
      the same effect as if a motion had been unsuccessful and that the decision 
      was final and determined the rights of the parties in the issue raised between 
      them.  The context of the decision makes it plain that the information sought, 
      namely disclosure of certain statements, would not have been available at 
      all but for the subpoena.  The trial judge did not, prior to quashing the 
      subpoena, make an evidentiary ruling respecting the admissibility of the 
      proposed evidence.  Thus, on an appeal, the matter could not have been dealt 
      with as an evidentiary question.  Nor would it have been possible to raise 
      the issue in an appeal from the final decision if the order was considered 
      to be interlocutory:  <i>Schiowitz v. I.O.S. Ltd.</i>, [1972] 3 O.R. 262 
      (Ont. C.A.).  The only way in which the order in <i>Smerchanski, supra</i>, 
      could be reviewed was if it was found to be a final order.</p>
    <p>That is not the situation before us.  At this stage of the proceedings, 
      Cullity J. was not satisfied at the time that the application was made before 
      him that the information sought could not be obtained from other employees 
      of Sun Life….</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>If, after examining the parties, counsel for York Ridge 
      feels it has been frustrated in its pursuit of information it would be able 
      to bring a further motion to obtain the information. … The order quashing 
      the subpoena to Mr. Swartz was therefore an interlocutory order because 
      it did not finally dispose of the issue between Swartz and the party seeking 
      to examine him.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>Therefore, despite the fact that the order in <i>Sun Life Assurance 
  Co. v. York Ridge Developments Ltd.</i>,<i> supra</i>, was directed to a person 
  not party to the action, the court found that the order quashing the subpoena 
  was an interlocutory order.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When given its broadest interpretation, the principle in <i>Smerchanski 
  v. Lewis, supra</i>, does not fit comfortably with the general test for determining 
  whether an order is interlocutory or final, as set out in <i>Hendrickson v. 
  Kallio</i>, [1932] O.R. 675 (C.A.) and clarified in subsequent cases such as 
  <i>Ball v. Donais</i> (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 322 (C.A.).  <i>Smerchanski</i> was 
  not intended to mean that all orders directed to a non-party must be final, 
  and the principle expressed therein should not be further expanded in that way.</p>
