  </span></span> In the domain of employment law, a fundamental common law principle 
  is that “a contract of employment for an indefinite period is terminable only 
  if reasonable notice is given”:  see <i>Machtinger v. HOJ Industries Ltd.</i>, 
  [1992] 1 S.C.R. 986 at 997 (per Iacobucci J.) (<i>“Machtinger”</i>).  The principle 
  is not an absolute one; in <i>Machtinger</i>, Iacobucci J. described it as a 
  “presumption, rebuttable if the contract of employment clearly specifies some 
  other period of notice, whether expressly or impliedly.” (p. 998).  Moreover, 
  as Iacobucci J.’s statement of the general principle clearly indicates, it applies 
  only to employees engaged for an indefinite period.  The principle does not 
  apply to fixed term contracts.  An employee whose contract is not renewed at 
  the conclusion of a fixed term is not dismissed or terminated; rather her employment 
  simply ceases in accordance with the terms of the contract:  see <i>Chambly 
  (City) v. Gagnon</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 8.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The present appeal requires consideration  of both the line between 
  fixed and indefinite term employment contracts and the requirements for successfully 
  rebutting the common law presumption of reasonable notice.  These issues arise 
  in the context of a 16 year employment relationship between a non-profit athletic 
  association and one of its senior managers which the association terminated, 
  it concedes, without cause.</p>

  is an incorporated non-profit athletic association.  It is an amateur sport 
  governing body for the sport of gymnastics in Ontario, consisting of about 160 
  clubs and 60,000 individual members.  The activities of the Federation include 
  educational programs, training programs, coaching, certification and judging.  
  These activities are carried out by several hundred volunteers throughout the

  </span></span> In the late fall of 1996, there were 14 employees at the Federation’s 
  head office.  On December 3, a staff meeting was called and Harold Sanin, the 
  Vice-President (Administration), presented all of the employees with a written

  </span></span> In the spring of 1997, most of the senior managers were informed 
  that the Federation would not renew their contracts after June 30.  For Ceccol 
  (and for Joe Rabel, the Executive Director), the axe fell on May 9, 1997:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

      which notice was confirmed by letter dated December 3, 1996, that the Ontario 
      Gymnastic Federation (“O.G.F.”) was undergoing a review of all service contracts 
      and that some contracts would not be renewed.  We hereby re-affirm the notice 
      of termination and expiry you received at that meeting.  With this letter, 
      we confirm that your contract as Administrative Director of the O.G.F. will 
      not be renewed at the end of its one year term on June 30, 1997.  Effective 
      today, you will no longer be required to provide services to O.G.F.</p>

  </span></span> The Federation paid Ceccol her salary and relevant benefits until 
  June 30, 1997.  It also offered her <i>ex gratia</i> severance payments potentially 
  totalling three months salary if she signed a release.  Ceccol declined this 
  offer and commenced a wrongful dismissal action.</p>

  </span></span> The action proceeded to trial before Pitt J. who heard four days 
  of evidence and argument from December 14 – 18, 1998.  In written reasons released 
  on February 15, 1999, the trial judge held that Ceccol was an indefinite term, 
  not a fixed term, employee and that she was entitled to reasonable notice, not 
  the statutory notice in the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 
  E.14 (<i>“ESA”</i>).  He fixed the reasonable notice at 16 months but reduced 
  it by four months because of Ceccol’s failure to properly mitigate her damages.  
  Pitt J.’s decision is reported at (1999), 41 C.C.E.L. (2d) 312.</p>

  Each contract contained, in article 1.1, a specific final date, June 30 from 
  1992 onwards.  However, the trial judge concluded that Ceccol was not a fixed 
  term employee:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>I find as fact that the plaintiff and all her immediate 
      superiors prior to Sanin, who came on the scene in 1996, believed and acted 
      as if the plaintiff were, what the plaintiff and her witnesses described 
      as a “full-time” permanent employee.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge gave effect to this shared perception 
      because, in his words, “[i]n the final analysis, in these cases the decision 
      to be made is what are the reasonable expectations of the parties”.</span></p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the trial judge’s conclusion.  His observation about 
  the importance of the parties’ reasonable expectations is a faithful application 
  of one of the leading decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in the contract 
  law domain.  In <i>Consolidated Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery 
  Insurance Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888 at 901, Estey J. said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he normal rules of construction lead a court to search for an interpretation 
      which, from the whole of the contract, would appear to promote or advance 
      the true intent of the parties at the time of entry into the contract.  
      Consequently, literal meaning should not be applied where to do so would 
      bring about an unrealistic result or a result which would not be contemplated 
      in the commercial atmosphere in which the insurance was contracted.  Where 
      words may bear two constructions, the more reasonable one, that which produces 
      a fair result, must certainly be taken as the interpretation which would 
      promote the intention of the parties.</p>

  </span></span> In this passage, Estey J. linked the factors of the parties’ 
  intention and unrealistic or fair results with contractual words that “bear 
  two constructions”.  Is it fair to conclude that article 1.1 of the Federation-Ceccol 
  contract  admits of more than one construction?  In my view, it is.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Article 1.1 sets a term of 12 months for the contract.  However, 
  article 1.1. also specifically contemplates that the contract may operate either 
  shorter or longer than 12 months:  “”unless sooner terminated or extended as 
  hereinafter provided”.  The <i>longer</i> life of the relationship is then dealt 
  with in article 1.2 which provides that the contract is “subject to renewal” 
  if the employee has received acceptable performance reviews and if the parties 
  can agree on the terms and conditions of renewal.  The <i>shorter</i> life of 
  the relationship is dealt with in article 5 of the contract which covers various 
  termination scenarios, including (for sure) termination for cause, termination 
  of probationary employees and termination by the employee, and (possibly) termination 
  without cause.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] </span></a></p>

  </span></span> In my view, this is not a case like <i>Chambly, supra</i>, where 
  the contract was for a single fixed term and contained no clause dealing with 
  renewal.  Rather, there is a renewal provision (article 1.2) and it is explicitly 
  linked to the term provision (article 1.1) by the closing words of article 1.1 
  (“unless . . . extended as hereinafter provided”).  Moreover, it is arguable 
  (I put it no higher) that renewals are not optional.  There is a fair amount 
  of language in the contract that contemplates automatic renewal, including the 
  linking of renewals to “acceptable performance reviews” (article 1.2), the requirement 
  that performance reviews “shall be considered in annual salary negotiations” 
  (article 12.1), and the requirement that the employee’s salary be negotiated 
  by a specified date before the end of the contract (article 4.2).</p>

  </span></span> The Federation relies on <i> Lambert v. Canadian Assn. of Optometrists 
  </i>(1994), 6 C.C.E.L. (2d) 129 (Ont. Gen. Div.), aff’d. (1996), 19 C.C.E.L. 
  (2d) 315 (C.A.) (“<i>Lambert”</i>), to support its contention that its contract 
  with Ceccol is a clear fixed term contract.  In that case, the plaintiff was 
  employed by the defendant as Executive Director pursuant to a series of written 
  employment contracts.  The final one stated a term from January 1, 1989 to December 
  31, 1992.  The defendant provided the plaintiff with proper notice that his 
  contract would not be renewed and his employment would end on December 31, 1992.  
  The plaintiff brought a wrongful dismissal action, contending that his term 
  of employment was not fixed.  He submitted that his employment was subject to 
  the performance appraisal process in the defendant’s Personnel Policy Manual 
  and that there was a link between the continuing employment and the appraisal 
  process.  This link gave rise to an express or implied term that the termination 
  clause in the contract would not be invoked unless the plaintiff was given notice 
  of the reasons for his dismissal and an opportunity to be heard.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Bell J., in reasons expressly adopted by this court, dismissed 
  the plaintiff’s action.  She found, at a factual level, that the Personnel Policy 
  Manual did not apply to the Executive Director position, and that the plaintiff 
  had never received a written performance appraisal in his nine years of employment.  
  Bell J. also held that there was no link in the contract between the termination 
  clause and the performance appraisal process in the manual.  </p>

  </span></span> The present appeal is distinguishable from <i>Lambert </i>on 
  both bases.  Ceccol was subject to a formal appraisal process and received detailed 
  written appraisals each year.  More importantly, the Federation-Ceccol employment 
  contract contains wording in articles 1.1 and 1.2 that not only contemplates 
  renewal, but also explicitly links a potential renewal to acceptable performance 
  reviews.</p>

  </span></span> In summary, in my view the relationship between articles 1.1 
  and 1.2 in the contract is not entirely clear.  In particular, the words “subject 
  to renewal” in article 1.2 are not self-defining and cast doubt on the Federation’s 
  argument that article 1.1 is effective in creating a clear fixed term contract.</p>

  </span></span> This ambiguity surrounding the extension of the contract (it 
  is worth noting that the contract was in fact renewed 15 times) justified the 
  trial judge’s decision to hear, and ultimately to rely on, evidence about the 
  parties’ intentions and conduct relating to the contract.  That evidence was, 
  as the trial judge found, overwhelming in support of  Ceccol’s contention that 
  she was hired, and performed for almost 16 years, as an indefinite term employee.</p>

  </span></span> Ceccol’s testimony about her understanding of the nature of the 
  employment contract was replicated by testimony from senior officers and managers 
  of the Federation.  Joe Rabel, the Executive Director from 1989-1997, and David 
  Williams and George Curran, both former Presidents of the Federation, all testified 
  that they regarded Ceccol as an indefinite employee and that the 12 month term 
  in article 1.1 of the contract was simply the vehicle by which the terms and 
  conditions of a new contract were negotiated.  In Mr. Williams’ words, the employees, 
  including Ceccol, “were treated as full-time employees, certainly not a year 
  to year arrangement”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I conclude with this observation.  Fixed term contracts of employment 
  are, of course, legal.  If their terms are clear, they will be enforced:  see 
  <i>Chambly</i> and <i>Lambert, supra</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, the consequences for an employee of finding that an 
  employment contract is for a fixed term are serious: the protections of the 
  <i>ESA</i> and of the common law principle of reasonable notice do not apply 
  when the fixed term expires.  That is why, as Professor Geoffrey England points 
  out in his text <i>Individual Employment Law</i> (Toronto: Irwin Law; 2000), 
  “the courts require unequivocal and explicit language to establish such a contract, 
  and will interpret any ambiguities strictly against the employer’s interests”.  
  (p. 222).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It seems to me that a court should be particularly vigilant when 
  an employee works for several years under a series of allegedly fixed term contracts.  
  Employers should not be able to evade the traditional protections of the <i>ESA</i> 
  and the common law by resorting to the label of ‘fixed term contract’ when the 
  underlying reality of the employment relationship is something quite different, 
  namely, continuous service by the employee for many years coupled with verbal 
  representations and conduct on the part of the employer that clearly signal 
  an indefinite term relationship.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the present case, Ceccol served the Federation loyally, professionally 
  and continuously for almost 16 years.  The Federation does not say otherwise.  
  I cannot  say that the contract which governed their relationship contains the 
  “unequivocal and explicit language” necessary to establish a fixed term contract.  
  I conclude that the employment contract was for an indefinite term, subject 
  to renewal and termination in accordance with other provisions in the contract.</p>

  </span></span> The conclusion that a contract is for an indefinite term has 
  as a corollary that, in normal circumstances, the employer can terminate the 
  contract only by providing reasonable notice.  This principle is not, however, 
  an absolute one.  There is an important exception, set out succinctly by Iacobucci 
  J. in <i>Machtinger</i>, at p. 998:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>I would characterize the common law principle of termination

  5.4 expressly specifies some other period of notice.  For convenience, I set 
  out article 5.4 again:</p>

  the Federation’s position is undercut by its own non-compliance with the <i>ESA</i> 
  when it notified Ceccol that her contract would not be renewed.  The notification 
  was communicated to Ceccol on May 9, 1997, which is not eight weeks before June 
  30.</p>

  </span></span> With respect to this matter, the Federation cannot say that the 
  May 9 notice merely confirmed the earlier December 3, 1996 notice to all employees.  
  The December 3 notice simply presaged that <i>some</i> employees might not be 
  offered new contracts; it did not explicitly inform Ceccol that <i>her</i> contract 
  would not be renewed.  Moreover, the evidence clearly establishes that Vice-President 
  Sanin got in a great deal of trouble with the Board of Directors of the Federation 
  for the form and contents of the December 3 notice.  At a board meeting in February 
  1997, an apparent crisis was defused only by the board deciding that the December 
  3, 1996 notice was <i>not</i> a notice of termination to employees.</p>

  contract are different and less clear.  There are the same clear active words 
  in several places in article 5.  Article 5.1 states “The Federation may terminate” 
  in a termination for cause scenario.  Article 5.2 states that the Federation 
  “may terminate” during the probationary period of employment. Article 5.3 provides 
  that “The Employee shall have the right to terminate this Agreement”.  However, 
  none of these clauses with virtually identical wording to the clear clauses 
  in <i>Machtinger</i> and <i>MacDonald </i> covers terminations without cause, 
  which is the Ceccol scenario.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Federation concedes as much.  Its submission is that the 
  Ceccol situation is covered by article 5.4 and that its wording is also clear 
  and points to the application of the eight week notice period in s. 57(1)(h) 
  of the <i>ESA</i>.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Not without hesitation, I disagree with the Federation’s submission.  
  As I mentioned above, the Federation’s interpretation of article 5.4 is a plausible 
  one.  However, in my view it is not the only plausible interpretation.  I find 
  it strange that the Federation would deal quite clearly (“may terminate”) with 
  three scenarios, termination with cause, termination of probationary employees 
  and termination by the employee, but be silent, or at least tangential, in its 
  treatment of a fourth and very common scenario, namely termination without cause.  
  I am also troubled by the absence in article 5 of language, as in <i>Machtinger</i> 
  (“otherwise”) and <i>MacDonald</i> (“in addition”), linking terminations without 
  cause to the explicit “may terminate” language of the termination clauses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the absence of “may terminate” wording in article 
  5.4 which, I underline, is the provision on which the Federation relies, leads 
  to a second plausible interpretation.  The interpretation is this: The Federation-Ceccol 
  contract permits only three types of termination – by the employer for cause 
  (article 5.1), by the employer of probationary employees (article 5.2) and by 
  the employee (article 5.3).  The contract <i>does not</i> deal with terminations 
  without cause.  It does not contain the explicit linking language of <i>Machtinger</i> 
  and <i>MacDonald</i>.  Moreover, importantly, article 1.2 <i>does</i> link renewal 
  to “acceptable performance reviews”, a signal, arguably, that terminations without 
  cause were not contemplated.</p>

  </span></span> The question then arises: if article 5.4 is not a provision dealing 
  with terminations without cause, what roles does it play?  My answer – and I 
  do not claim it is the only possible answer – is that article 5.4, with its 
  “abide by the [<i>ESA</i>] . . . concerning notice of termination” wording, 
  qualifies the three termination scenarios dealt with in articles 5.1 – 5.3.  
  Article 5.4 says to the parties: if you invoke the right to terminate the employment 
  relationship pursuant to any of articles 5.1 – 5.3, you must do so in accordance 
  with the <i>ESA</i>.  On the employer’s side, this would mean, <i>inter alia</i>, 
  co-operating with the Minister of Labour, if requested, concerning the re-establishment 
  of the employee (s. 57(12)) and maintaining the employee’s salary and benefits 
  during the notice period (s. 57(13)).</p>

  </span></span> Which of the two plausible interpretations of article 5.4 should 
  govern the Federation-Ceccol employment contract?  <i>Machtinger</i> instructs 
  that the presumption of reasonable notice can be rebutted only if the employment 
  contract “clearly specifies some other period of notice” (p. 998).  I do not 
  think that article 5.4 achieves that high level of clarity.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Moreover, I think it is important to acknowledge what is at stake 
  in the conflicting interpretations put forward by the parties.  Ceccol worked 
  loyally and professionally for the Federation for almost 16 years.  Her final 
  salary was $50,000.  If she is entitled to only the eight week payment established 
  by the <i>ESA</i>, she will receive approximately $7700.  If she is entitled 
  to reasonable notice, which the Federation is content to accept is 16 months, 
  she will receive approximately $66,700.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In an important line of cases in recent years, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada has discussed, often with genuine eloquence, the role work plays in 
  a person’s life, the imbalance in many employer-employee relationships and the 
  desirability of interpreting legislation and the common law to provide a measure 
  of protection to vulnerable employees:  see <i>Reference Re Public Service Employee 
  Relations Act (Alta.)</i>, [1987] 1 S.C.R. 313, <i>Machtinger, supra</i>, and 
  <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701 (<i>“Wallace”</i>).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These factors have clearly influenced the interpretation of employment 
  contracts.  In <i>Wallace</i>, Iacobucci J. said, at pp. 740-41:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The contract of employment has many characteristics that set it apart form 
      the ordinary commercial contract.  Some of the views of this subject that 
      have already been approved of in previous decisions of this court (see e.g. 
      <i>Machtinger, supra</i>) bear repeating.  As K. Swinton noted in “Contract 
      Law and the Employment Relationship: The Proper Forum for Reform”, in B.J. 
      Reiter and J. Swan, eds., <i>Studies in Contract Law</i> (1980), 357, at 
      p. 363:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><span> </span>. . . the terms of the employment contract rarely result 
          from an exercise of free bargaining power in the way that the paradigm 
          commercial exchange between two traders does.  Individual employees 
          on the whole lack both the bargaining power and the information necessary 
          to achieve more favourable contract provisions than those offered by 
          the employer, particularly with regard to tenure.</p>

  </span></span> In the present appeal, there are, as I have tried to demonstrate, 
  two plausible interpretations of article 5.4 of the employment contract.  One 
  interpretation would remove the common law entitlement to reasonable notice; 
  the other would preserve it.  One interpretation would result in a termination 
  provision which the trial judge described as “especially stringent and onerous”; 
  the other would provide an employee with notice which at common law, both parties 
  accept, is reasonable.  One interpretation would provide a loyal and professional 
  16-year senior employee with $7700 in termination pay; the other would provide 
  her with $66,700.  In my view, in each instance the second interpretation is 
  preferable.  It is also, in my view, consistent with the leading decisions of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada in the employment law domain.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Ceccol cross-appeals from the trial judge’s 
  decision to reduce the notice period from 16 to 12 months for failure to properly 
  mitigate her damages.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Shortly after she was terminated on May 9, 1997, Ceccol decided 
  to become an independent distributor for NIKKEN, a Japanese company that produces 
  preventive health care products.  She made an outlay of about $4500 for start-up 
  costs and made no profit during the first 16 months.  She did not consider or 
  seek employment of any other kind, including in the sports administration field 
  where she had worked for her entire career.  I note, parenthetically, that Joe 
  Rabel, the Executive Director of the Federation, who was terminated on the same 
  day as Ceccol, became the Executive Director of Judo Canada within four months 
  of his termination.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is certainly case law supporting decisions by employees 
  to attempt to start their own businesses as appropriate mitigation strategies 
  in certain circumstances: see <i>Gillespie v. Union Optics Corp. (Canada)</i> 
  (1987), 18 C.C.E.L. 58 (Ont. H.C.J.) aff’d. (1989) 26 C.C.E.L. xxiv (C.A.), 
  and <i>Peet v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Industries Inc.</i> (2001), 142 O.A.C. 314 
  (<i>“Peet”</i>).  However, each case needs to be assessed on its own facts.  
  As Finlayson J.A. said in <i>Peet</i>, “[t]he Trial Judge was in the best position 
  to assess the evidence, its relevance, and the weight to be attributed to it”(p. 
  317).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I can see no error in principle in the way the trial judge approached 
  and decided the mitigation issue in this case.  Ceccol contends that the trial 
  judge erred in concluding that she might have found employment in her area of 
  expertise because there was no evidentiary basis to support such a conclusion.  
  I disagree.  Although the Federation led no direct evidence on the mitigation 
  issue, its counsel’s cross-examination of Ceccol and Rabel provided a sufficient 
  evidentiary basis to support the trial judge’s conclusion on the mitigation 
  issue.</p>

    appeal differs in part from that of the trial judge.  The trial judge found 
    that the termination provision was clear but that it did not apply to Ceccol 
    because a standard form contract was used and the termination provision was 
    especially stringent and onerous; as a result, the employer had a duty to 
    draw the termination provision to Ceccol’s attention.  In my view, the employment 
    contract was not similar to the complex standard form printed car rental agreement 
    in issue in <i>Tilden Rent-A-Car v. Clendenning</i> (1978), 18 O.R. (2d) 601 
    (C.A.), which the trial judge applied.  Accordingly, the Federation did not 
    have a duty to specifically draw the termination provision to Ceccol’s attention.</p>
