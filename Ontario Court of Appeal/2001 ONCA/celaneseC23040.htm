<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice J. Peter Coulson dated June 27, 1995. 
</p>
<p>CARTHY J.A.:</p>
<p>[1] The appellants have been charged jointly that they:</p>
<p>On or about the 20th day of October, 1993 at Lot 24, 25, Concession 1, Ernestown 
  Township in the County of Lennox and Addington did commit the offence of causing 
  or permitting the discharge of a contaminant into a slow flowing ponded area 
  directly downstream of the west outfall of Celanese Canada Inc., which discharges 
  into Lake Ontario, which may impair the quality of the water, of any waters, 
  contrary to section 30(1) of the Ontario Water Resources Act R.S.O. 1990, c.O.40, 
  as amended.</p>
<p>[2] At trial, the Crown submitted as its case an agreed statement of facts, 
  an aerial photo of the appellant Celanese's premises, and a Certificate of Approval 
  (issued under the authority of s. 53 of the Ontario Water Resources Act, R.S.O. 
  c. O-40 (the &quot;Act&quot;) which imposes conditions on the level of discharges 
  from the factory). Upon motion by the appellants, Justice of the Peace T. Walker 
  acquitted the appellants on a directed verdict without calling upon them to 
  adduce evidence. Upon appeal by the Crown, Judge Coulson held that there was 
  sufficient evidence to call for a defence and directed a new trial. By leave 
  of a judge of this Court, the appellants seek to reinstate the directed verdict.</p>
<p>[3] The agreed statement of facts established the following background facts. 
  The Celanese plant is in the business of polyester production, requires large 
  amounts of water for cooling purposes and draws its supply by intake pipes extending 
  into Lake Ontario. When the water has served its cooling purpose it is discharged 
  from the plant into two slow moving and ponded waterways, called outfalls, running 
  across the Celanese property and eventually through pipes back to Lake Ontario. 
  When Zebra mussels invaded the lake, systems such as this became clogged with 
  the mussels and their larvae. Celanese hired experts who consulted with the 
  Ministry of the Environment and Energy and delivered a control system that added 
  chlorine at the point of intake to kill the mussels and then removed the chlorine 
  from the water as it passed through the plant. The system was operated pursuant 
  to a very detailed Certificate of Approval issued by the Ministry providing 
  in part that &quot;The owner shall … operate the works such that the total residual 
  chlorine concentration [in each outfall] prior to entering Lake Ontario does 
  not exceed 0.01 milligrams per litre.&quot;</p>
<p>[4] In the afternoon of October 23, 1993, the Ministry of Natural Resources 
  found approximately 300 dead fish in the west outfall. Water samples at that 
  time showed no evidence of chlorine in the outfall but subsequent investigation 
  revealed that on the morning of October 20th the chlorination system had been 
  shut down for the season and a vacuum effect may have drawn 10 to 20 gallons 
  of chlorine through the system. The agreed statement of facts included the concession 
  that &quot;with minor exceptions, fish died in the discharge channel and ponded 
  area as a result of exposure to chlorine as a result of a vacuum/siphon of chlorine 
  solution from the storage tank on October 20, 1993.&quot;</p>
<p>[5] On those facts the appellants were charged under s. 30(1) of the Act which 
  reads:</p>
<p>Every person that discharges or causes or permits the discharge of any material 
  of any kind into or in any waters or on any shore or bank thereof or into or 
  in any place that may impair the quality of the water of any waters is guilty 
  of an offence.</p>
<p>[6] The definition of &quot;waters&quot; in the Act is very broad and clearly 
  includes this outfall on private property. The issue at trial therefore was 
  whether there was any admissible evidence, direct or circumstantial, which if 
  believed by a properly charged jury, would justify a conviction of the appellants 
  of permitting a discharge that might impair the quality of that water.</p>
<p>[7] The appellants' principal position is that where a Certificate of Approval 
  is outstanding which permits a discharge of chlorine at specified levels, the 
  Crown must prove as an element of the offence that the impugned discharge occurred 
  in violation of the terms of the Certificate of Approval. It is argued that, 
  if it were otherwise, than a person who has express approval for discharge of 
  a contaminant up to a particular level may be prosecuted and convicted without 
  any proof of exceeding that level. That would be an attractive argument if the 
  charge was for breach of the Certificate of Approval, but is spurious when the 
  charge is a general one for discharge of a contaminant.</p>
<p>[8] Section 107(3) provides:</p>
<p>Every person that contravenes a term or condition of a licence, permit, approval 
  or report made under this Act is guilty of an offence.</p>
<p>This is not a prosecution for that offence, rather the general offence of polluting 
  waters.</p>
<p>[9] Further, s. 47(3) of the Provincial Offences Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.P-33 provides:</p>
<p>The burden of proving that an authorization, exception, exemption or qualification 
  prescribed by law operates in favour of the defendant is on the defendant, and 
  the prosecutor is not required, except by way of rebuttal, to prove that the 
  authorization, exception, exemption or qualification does not operate in favour 
  of the defendant, whether or not it is set out in the information.</p>
<p>[10] The appellants' Certificate of Approval contains a series of monitoring 
  requirements in obvious recognition that it is within the operator's control 
  to maintain records of chlorine levels and with a purpose directed to the very 
  events which occurred here. By the time the dead fish were found by the Ministry, 
  the chlorine which killed them had dissipated and could no longer be measured.</p>
<p>[11] The issuance of the certificate permitting the use of chlorine carried 
  with it the expressed obligation to monitor performance and the statutory obligation 
  to establish performance in the face of an allegation of a general offence under 
  the Act.</p>
<p>[12] I can find nothing in the authorities binding upon this court and cited 
  by the appellants that assists their argument. See Proulx v. Krukowski (1993), 
  109 D.L.R. (4th) 606 (Ont. C.A.), R. v. Boise Cascade Ltd. (1995), 17 C.E.L.R. 
  (N.S.) 276 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Lee's Poultry (1985), 17 C.C.C. (3d) 359 (Ont. 
  C.A.). To the contrary, acceding to their position would undermine the cornerstone 
  of jurisprudence on regulatory prosecutions set by Dickson J. in R. v. Sault 
  Ste. Marie (City), [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299. That seminal judgment fixed the demarcation 
  between the Crown's obligation to prove the actus reus beyond a reasonable doubt 
  and the regulated party's onus of establishing due diligence on a balance of 
  probabilities. Here the Crown proved that fish died from chlorine emanating 
  from the Celanese plant -- the actus reas -- and it was incumbent upon those 
  in control of the plant's operation and able to monitor its efficacy to respond 
  and demonstrate due diligence by compliance with it's Certificate of Approval, 
  or otherwise.</p>
<p>[13] The appeal should be dismissed. </p>
