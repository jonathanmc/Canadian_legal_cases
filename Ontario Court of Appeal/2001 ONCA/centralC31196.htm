<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Jack H. Jenkins dated 
  November 24, 1998 at Newmarket, Ontario.</span></p>
<p style='line-height:200%'><b><u><span lang=EN-US>ABELLA J.A.</span></u><span lang=EN-US>:</span></b></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Modern Tile Supply Company Limited was a small 
  retail store in Niagara Falls which sold floor and wall coverings. An elderly 
  couple, John and Nora Grepley, had operated the store for forty years. A third 
  partner, Ernesta Beltrame replaced her husband as a director of Modern Tile 
  when he died in 1987. The &quot;operating mind&quot; was John Grepley, but all 
  three individuals performed the tasks involved in running the business.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In 1990, Modern Tile suffered economic losses. 
  These financial problems were exacerbated when the Grepleys were unable to work 
  for a year after a car accident. By 1996, the business losses were so severe 
  that the Grepleys and Ernesta Beltrame took no wages or benefits. The Grepleys 
  estimated that over the course of several years, they advanced almost $100,000 
  of their own funds to the business, surviving on a pension and financial help 
  from their daughter. By 1997, Modern Tile was insolvent.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Central Supply Company (1972) Limited supplied 
  floor and wall coverings to Modern Tile for almost forty years and had an excellent 
  relationship with it. Deliveries from Central Supply to Modern Tile were made 
  to the store, not to any of Modern Tile's customers. All of Central Supply's 
  billing was to Modern Tile, but from time to time, Mr.&nbsp;Grepley requested 
  that Central Supply put the name of the customer for whom the goods were intended 
  on the invoice, so that Modern Tile could keep track of all the material that 
  was supplied and match it up with its customer. Unlike when it was dealing with 
  contractors, the invoices from Central Supply to Modern Tile never referred 
  to a specific work site, improvement, or premises where the product was ultimately 
  to be incorporated.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>When Modern Tile's financial problems resulted 
  in its issuing a considerable number of NSF cheques to Central Supply, a new 
  arrangement was made between Central Supply and Modern Tile, pursuant to which 
  Modern Tile agreed to give Central Supply a certified cheque each time products 
  were delivered. At no time did Central Supply request individual guarantees 
  from the Grepleys or Ms. Beltrame.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At trial, on consent, Modern Tile was ordered 
  to pay Central Supply $42,287.77, representing the value of various goods that 
  the appellant supplied to Modern Tile during 1996 and 1997. The claim against 
  629763 Ontario Ltd., a company controlled by Mr.&nbsp;Grepley, was abandoned. 
  The only issue at trial was whether Central Supply was entitled to succeed in 
  its claim against the individual defendants pursuant to the trust provisions 
  of ss. 8(1) and 13 of the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30. 
  The trial judge dismissed the claim. This is an appeal by Central Supply from 
  that decision.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The issue on appeal is whether monies received 
  by Modern Tile, from the retail sale of its product to members of the public, 
  constitute trust funds pursuant to the provisions of the <i>Act</i>. If so, 
  the related issue is whether personal liability should attach to the defendants 
  John and Nora Grepley and Ernesta Beltrame.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After the appeal was argued, the panel had concerns about whether 
  the appeal should have been brought to the Divisional Court.  Neither counsel 
  raised the point before or during the argument. We sought written submissions 
  from both parties on this issue and whether, if we were persuaded that the Divisional 
  Court was the proper forum, the matter should be transferred to the Divisional 
  Court or whether the panel should be reconstituted as one of that Court for 
  the purpose of adjudicating this appeal.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>Villa Verde L.M. Masonry Ltd. v. Pier 
  One Masonry Inc.</i> (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 76 (C.A.), released after this appeal 
  was heard, Rosenberg J.A. held that appeals concerning trust claims under Part 
  II of the <i>Construction Lien Act</i> should be heard by the Divisional Court. 
  Accordingly, this appeal should properly have been heard by the Divisional Court. 
  However, I think that this is one of those rare cases, referred to in <i>Villa 
  Verde,</i> where this panel should, with the designation of the Chief Justice 
  of the Superior Court of Justice, sit as a panel of the Divisional Court for 
  the purposes of this appeal and we have proceeded on that basis.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></b></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Part II of the <i>Act</i> deals with trusts 
  and Part III deals with liens. Under Part III, if the supply of services or 
  materials is made without knowledge of or contact with the improvement to which 
  the supply is made, no lien entitlement is created. The appellant, Central Supply, 
  submits that the trial judge erred in interpreting the trust provisions in Part 
  II as having an analogous requirement. It argues that, unlike liens, a supplier 
  need not know where or what the improvement is before a trust is created under 
  s. 8 of the <i>Act</i>. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Modern Tile submitted, on the other hand, that 
  the materials supplied by Central Supply were supplied in the ordinary course 
  of Modern Tile's business as a retailer of such products or materials, without 
  regard for the purpose for which they were to be used, and therefore no trust 
  arises.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Three Ontario judgments take a different approach from the one 
  taken by the trial judge in this case about how direct the contact must be between 
  a supplier and an improvement before a trust obligation is imposed under the 
  <i>Act</i>. <i>Re Schulz Concrete Pipe Ltd.</i> (1979), 32 C.B.R. (N.S.) 157 
  (S.C.) <i>Re Richmond Bros. Insulation Inc.</i> (1989), 73 C.B.R. (N.S.)  284 
  (S.C.); and <i>Maple Leaf Homes &amp; Cottages Inc. v. Zoellner Windows (1982) 
  Ltd.</i> (1989), 34 C.L.R. 6 (H.C.J.), have held that a supplier is not required 
  either to know or intend that its material would find its way into a specific 
  improvement before a trust arises. </p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The definition of &quot;material&quot; under 
  the <i>Mechanics’ Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 261, the statutory predecessor 
  to the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>, made no reference to an &quot;improvement&quot;. 
  This is a significant difference from the current <i>Act</i>, which focuses 
  remedial attention on specifically designated sites. To the extent, therefore, 
  that the interpretations in earlier cases were based on the former definition, 
  such as <i>Re Schulz</i>, or <i>Re Richmond </i>and <i>Maple Leaf Homes,</i> 
  which applied <i>Schulz</i>, they cannot prevail. With respect, it is my contrary 
  view that, like a lien remedy, there must be a specific, designated site or 
  improvement before a trust may be imposed. (See Joel S. Kuchar, <i>Breach of 
  Trust Actions Under the Construction Lien Act</i> (1995), 20 C.L.R. (2d) 18; 
  and Kevin McGuinness<i>, Trust Obligations Under the Construction Lien Act</i> 
  (1994), 15 C.L.R. (2d) 208).</span></p>

  is useful to consider the following guidance from E. A. Driedger in his classic

  where he wrote, at p. 87, that the words of an Act should be read &quot;harmoniously

  in <i>Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 3d ed., (Toronto: Butterworths,

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The <i>Construction Lien Act</i> is designed 
  to protect those who provide services or materials to a particular improvement 
  or project, by requiring a contractor or subcontractor receiving payment under 
  the contract to pay first those who provided services or materials on that project. 
  Funds received by the contractor or subcontractor on account of the contract 
  constitute a trust fund for the benefit of those who have supplied services 
  or materials to the improvement by virtue of s. 8(1) of the <i>Act</i>. Failure 
  to pay those suppliers who are owed money may constitute a breach of trust for 
  which the directors or officers of a corporate contractor may be personally 
  liable under s. 13.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Although liens and trusts represent discrete 
  remedies under the <i>Act,</i> the scheme and purpose of the <i>Act</i> argue 
  for a consistent approach between Parts II and III of the <i>Act</i>. The similarity 
  in wording between s. 8(1), which delineates when a trust arises under Part 
  II, and in ss. 14 and 15, which outline when a lien is created under Part III, 
  also supports a consistent requirement in both that there be an identifiable 
  improvement before either a lien or trust is established. Under s. 8(1), a trust 
  arises for the benefit of those who have supplied services or materials to an 
  improvement. Similarly, ss. 14(1) and 15 require that before a lien arises, 
  there must be services or materials supplied &quot;to an improvement&quot;:</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, therefore, the <i>Act</i> requires 
  that a supplier must intend that the material sold be used for the purposes 
  of a known and identified improvement before a lien or trust arises. Where the 
  supplier is selling material or services without any regard to the purpose or 
  site for which the material is destined, it is deemed to be selling on the credit 
  of the buyer alone, without access to the lien or trust remedies under the <i>Act</i>. 
  The trust provisions of the <i>Act</i>, therefore, create a trust only for the 
  benefit of persons who have supplied services or materials <i>to the improvement, 
  </i>not for the benefit generally of persons who supply contractors. (See <i>Kuchar,

<p><span lang=EN-US>That means that the onus on Central Supply is to demonstrate 
  the following three elements: (a) that Modern Tile received money on account 
  of a contract for a particular improvement; (b) that Central Supply supplied 
  materials on that improvement; and (c) that Modern Tile owes money to Central 
  Supply for those materials. (See <i>St. Mary's Cement Corp. v. Construc Ltd</i>.

  Tile’s customers did with the products after those products were picked up at 
  the store. Notwithstanding that its invoices sometimes named the customer to 
  whom Modern Tile would be selling the product, Central Supply had never shown
