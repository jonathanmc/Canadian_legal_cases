<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Lynn D. Ratushny 
  dated March 24, 1999.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was convicted of two counts of aggravated assault, two 
  counts of use of a firearm in the commission of an indictable offence, possession 
  of a dangerous weapon, breach of probation and possession of a firearm while 
  prohibited by court order. He appeals his conviction and raises two grounds 
  of appeal.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in not excluding 
  evidence resulting from the breach of the appellant’s ss. 7 and 10(b) <i>Charter</i> 
  rights.  Following his arrest, the appellant participated in an informal line-up 
  without being told about it by the police beforehand.  He was arrested for assault, 
  formally advised of his right to counsel and then informally reminded he had 
  a right to speak to a lawyer when he was told that he was a suspect on the more 
  serious charge of aggravated assault.  At the time that the informal line-up 
  took place, the appellant had not expressed any desire to contact counsel.  
  It was only towards the end of the informal line-up after the witness had admittedly 
  seen the appellant that the appellant indicated he wished to speak to counsel.  
  In our opinion, there was no breach of the appellant’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  
  Even if there was a breach of <i>Charter</i> rights such that the evidence should 
  not have been admitted, the trial judge stated that she was not relying on that 
  evidence in order to convict the appellant.  This ground of appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also says that the trial judge misapprehended parts of 
  the evidence of the identification witnesses and ignored other relevant exculpatory 
  evidence.  While there were inconsistencies in the evidence of the witnesses 
  as to what they told the police, the witnesses all agreed that the person who 
  committed the aggravated assault by firing a weapon was the person who was pursued 
  by the crowd, beaten up, and had a scar on his face.  The only person who fit 
  that description was the accused.  There is no error in the trial judge’s conclusion 
  that the appellant was the shooter.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
