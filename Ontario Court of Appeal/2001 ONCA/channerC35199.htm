  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The insured, by way of application sought a

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>the insurer failed to comply with the requirements 
      of s. 9.1(2) of <i>Ontario Regulation 664</i>, R.R.O. 1990 as amended;</span></p>

lang=EN-US>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>the insured delivered a written notice to 
      the insurer, rescinding the settlement, in compliance with s. 9.1(4) of 
      <i>Ontario Regulation 664</i>, R.R.O. 1990 as amended;</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>One of the grounds for the application to set 
  aside the release, or to declare it null and void, was that the insured lack 
  capacity to give valid release and was subjected to undue influence.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The insured and the insurer discussed and eventually agreed that 
  the issue of the validity of the release should be dealt with on a motion under 
  Rule 21.  Before the return of the Rule 21 motion, and in the insurer’s factum 
  filed on the motion, the insurer took the position that the issues of the insured’s 
  capacity to provide a release and undue influence should not be dealt with on 
  a Rule 21 motion, because the resolution of those issues was dependent on disputed 
  facts.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, absent consent or an express order from the motion’s 
  judge granting leave, issues the resolution of which depend on disputed facts, 
  should not be dealt with on a Rule 21 motion. See <i>Boutin v. Cooperators Lake 
  Insurance Co.</i> (1999), O.J. No. 64 (C.A.).  Resolution of the capacity/undue 
  influence issues was dependent on disputed facts and thus should not have been 
  dealt with on a Rule 21 motion.  Accordingly, in our view, the motion’s judge 
  erred in dealing with the capacity and undue influence issues and in making 
  the findings that he did on those issues.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Acting appropriately within the confines of Rule 21, the motion’s 
  judge concluded that in this case the insurer’s failure to comply with s. 9.1 
  of <i>Ontario Regulation 780/93</i> constituted an irregularity which the motion’s 
  judge held was not sufficient to permit the insured to rescind his release.  
  This finding is the subject of the cross appeal by the insured.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The insurer has conceded on the basis of this court’s recent 
  judgment in <i>Catania v. Scottish York Insurance Co. Limited</i> (2001), O.J. 
  651 that the motion’s judge erred in reaching the conclusion he did in respect 
  of the issue of the form and content of the release signed by the insured.  
  That release, in the circumstances, is null and void, but not for the reasons 
  found by the motion’s judge.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the cross appeal is allowed with costs.  In view 
  of our disposition of the cross appeal, the appeal is moot and is dismissed 
  as moot with costs.</p>
