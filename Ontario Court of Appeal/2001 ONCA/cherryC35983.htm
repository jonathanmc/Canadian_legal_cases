  </span></span> This is an appeal from the order of Weekes J. dismissing the 
  appellant’s motion which sought to set aside the noting in default and default 
  judgment and to grant the appellant leave to deliver a statement of defence 
  and counterclaim.  <b><span lang=EN-US

  </span></span> The respondent, Cherry Central, was the supplier of canned apple 
  juice for the appellant’s corporation, The New York Food Company.  In March 
  1998, the appellant, D’Angelo, signed a personal indemnity of the past and future 
  debts of New York Food.  In March 1999, the respondent sued both New York Food 
  and the appellant for $1.7&nbsp;million U.S.  In January and February of 2000, 
  the respondent requested affidavits of documents and production of documents 
  and received no response<b>.  </b>In April, the respondent served a motion to 
  compel production of documents and an offer to settle.  Again, there was no 
  response.  On May 18, Master Schreider ordered delivery of the affidavits of 
  documents of both defendants, failing which, the respondent had leave to move 
  <i>ex parte</i> to strike the defences and counterclaims.  In a letter dated 
  May 24, counsel for the appellant and New York Food advised Mr. D’Angelo about 
  this order.  <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On May 23, counsel for the appellant and New York Food advised 
  counsel for the respondent that New York Food had been petitioned into bankruptcy.  
  A petition in bankruptcy had been commenced against New York Food on February 
  2, 2000 and a receiving order made on March 1, 2000.  The appellant’s affidavit 
  states that when he was advised by his former counsel of the order requiring 
  the filing of the affidavit of documents, he nevertheless did not do so because 
  he thought the proceedings against him had been stayed as a result of the bankruptcy.  
</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On August 15, the respondent, having obtained an <i>ex parte</i> 
  order of Master Peterson on August 10 striking out the statement of defence 
  and counterclaim of the appellant for failure to comply with the order of Master 
  Schreider, had default judgment signed by the Registrar.  When the appellant 
  received the judgment and writ of seizure and sale from the respondent’s solicitors 
  on August 28, he retained new solicitors who moved in a timely fashion to set 
  aside the default judgment.<span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motion was brought under rule 19.08 to the Superior Court 
  of Justice for an order setting aside the noting in default as well as the default 
  judgment and granting the appellant leave to file a statement of defence.  A 
  proposed affidavit of documents was attached as part of the motion material.  
  Weekes J. held that the motion amounted to a collateral attack on the decision 
  of Master Peterson, which was a final order, and that the only way to challenge 
  that order was by an appeal to the Divisional Court (s. 19 (1)(c) of the <i>Courts 
  of Justice Act</i>).  Weekes J. concluded that he lacked jurisdiction and dismissed 
  the motion on that basis.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle>1.         Is the relief sought available on a Rule 19.08 
  motion?</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Under rule 19.08(1) the motions judge has discretion to set aside 
  a default judgment on such terms as the court considers just.  Under rule 19.08(3), 
  if the motions judge decides to set aside the default judgment, the court may 
  also set aside the noting in default.  There would be no point to setting aside 
  the default judgment and the noting in default if the court could not also order 
  the terms on which any prior default may be cured with a view to having the 
  action determined on the merits.  Typically, those terms require that the draft 
  statement of defence that has been filed with the application to set aside default 
  judgment be served and filed within a particular period of time.  We see no 
  reason why the court cannot also order that the draft affidavit of documents 
  that is filed with the motion to set aside the default judgment, or a fresh 
  affidavit of documents dealing with any additional necessary documents, be served 
  and filed with the statement of defence.  In both cases, the court is delineating 
  the terms on which the default that led to the signing of default judgment may 
  be cured. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The principle established in <i>National Bank of Canada v. Royal 
  Bank of Canada</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 533 (C.A.) applies.  In that case, the 
  court held that a default judgment granted by a judge under Rule 19 was not 
  a final judgment within the meaning of s.&nbsp;6(1)(b) of the <i>Courts of Justice 
  Act</i> for the purposes of an appeal to the court of appeal, “and does not 
  become a final judgment, if at all, until the remedy provided by Rule 19.08 
  has been sought and refused.” (p.534)  Similarly, once default judgment has 
  been signed by the Registrar following an order striking the statement of defence, 
  those orders are not final orders for the purposes of an appeal to the Divisional 
  Court under s.&nbsp;19(1)(c) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>; rather the 
  remedy is under rule 19.08. </p>
<p class=headingtitle> <span
lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>If the motions judge erred on the jurisdiction 
  issue, should default judgment be set aside and leave be granted to D’Angelo 
  to deliver a statement of defence?</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Both parties asked that we deal with this issue rather than refer 
  it back to a motions judge.  The requirements for setting aside a default judgment 
  are well-known.  One of those requirements is that the defendant put forward 
  a good defence to the action on the merits.  It is the appellant’s position 
  that he signed the indemnity in exchange for the continued supply of apple juice 
  at the best price, but that the respondent then supplied apple juice to a competitor 
  at a better price.  He said that it was agreed that the indemnity would not 
  be enforced until new pricing for the supply of apple juice had been agreed.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant, however, nowhere says in his affidavit or cross-examination 
  thereon that there was an agreement to that effect.  Nor did the lawyer who 
  acted for him on the indemnity transaction substantiate his position.  Furthermore, 
  the appellant’s position is contradicted by the indemnity agreement itself, 
  which contains a very full “entire agreement” clause that states in part: <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>For greater certainty the rights and remedies of the Supplier 
      hereunder and the obligations and liability of each Indemnifier shall not 
      be reduced, prejudiced or impaired by the provisions of any other agreement… 
      This Indemnity sets forth the entire agreement between the Supplier and 
      each Indemnifier concerning the terms and conditions of this Indemnity and 
      there are no covenants, conditions, representations, agreements, warranties, 
      undertakings, promises, inducements or understandings in any way relating 
      to this Indemnity…</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;'></span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the credibility of the parties requires 
  a trial.  However, in our opinion, the appellant has not put forward a good 
  defence at law to the action on the merits, even if the facts he relies on were 
  to be proved at trial.  Accordingly, we would not grant leave to set aside the 
  default judgment. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
