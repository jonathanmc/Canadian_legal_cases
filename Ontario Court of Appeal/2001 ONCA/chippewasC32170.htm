<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT RE COSTS</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following the release of our reasons disposing of the appeals 
  in this matter, we directed that the parties file written submissions with respect 
  to costs.  We have now received and reviewed those submissions and make the 
  following orders with respect to the costs of these proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>1.      CANADA</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Canada seeks an order for party and party costs 
  both of the appeals and cross-appeals and of the summary judgment motions.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The genesis of this litigation is the failure of Indian Department 
  officials to obtain a surrender as required by established protocol in effect 
  at the time.  In our view, our costs award should reflect the fact that much 
  of Canada’s case before the motions court judge and before this court was essentially 
  an unsuccessful effort to vindicate actions of the Indian Department.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We order no costs of the summary judgment motions as Canada based 
  its entire position in the motions court on the basis that there had been a 
  surrender.  Contrary to the written submission of Canada, this went well beyond 
  what was necessary to deal with the claims of the landowners and would have 
  finally determined the central issue in all claims advanced by the Chippewas 
  against Canada.  Before the motions court judge, Canada did not argue the point 
  that ultimately proved successful before us, namely, that the Chippewas were 
  not entitled to a remedy for the return of the land.  As Canada was successful 
  on that point before us, but unsuccessful on the surrender issue, we order that 
  the Chippewas pay 50% of Canada's cost of the appeals and cross-appeals on a 
  party and party basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>2.            ONTARIO</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There was no costs order for or against Ontario on the summary 
  judgment motions and no appeal is taken from that.  The sole issue is whether 
  Ontario is entitled to its costs on the appeals and cross-appeals.  In view 
  of the result and Ontario's position essentially supporting the position of 
  Canada with regard to the surrender issue, we order that the Chippewas pay 50% 
  of Ontario's costs on a party and party basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>3.            CLASS REPRESENTATIVES</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The class representatives of the landowners were entirely successful, 
  both on the motions for summary judgment and before this court.  The motions 
  court judge held that this was not a case for solicitor client costs and therefore 
  awarded the class representatives their costs on a party and party basis. No 
  appeal is taken from this order however the class representatives seek their 
  costs of the appeal on a solicitor and client basis. We are also of the view 
  that the award of costs should be on a party and party basis but for different 
  reasons. This matter proceeded essentially as a paper trial on consent of all 
  parties and in the circumstances the usual costs sanctions under Rule 20.06 
  should not be imposed. We order party and party costs in favour of the class 
  representatives, payable by the Chippewas.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As we have set aside the order that Canada pay the Chippewas' 
  costs, the order that the costs of the Class Representatives be paid from such 
  costs falls away.  We are not satisfied that there is any remaining basis upon 
  which we could order Canada or Ontario to pay the costs of the Class Representatives 
  should the Chippewas fail to do so.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The class representatives submit that there should be an order 
  allowing them to set off various amounts payable to the Chippewas under various 
  agreements against any costs ordered in favour of the Chippewas.  In our view, 
  there is an insufficient record before this court as to the nature of the respective 
  obligations between the parties for us to make such an order.  If the class 
  representatives wish to pursue that issue they will have to do so in some other 
  proceeding.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Each of the class representatives is entitled 
  to its own set of costs. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>4.            CANADIAN NATIONAL</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the costs award in favour of Canadian National should 
  be on the same basis as that in favour of the other class representatives. We 
  do not accept the motions court judge’s conclusion that Canadian National should 
  be disentitled to costs on account of the agreement between Canadian National 
  and the Government of Canada.  We accept the submission that Canadian National 
  was involved in these proceedings because it was a named defendant and as a 
  result of the order of Adams J. appointing it as one of the class representatives. 
  We would allow Canadian National’s appeal from the costs order of the motions 
  court judge denying them costs, and order costs throughout in its favour on 
  a party and party basis, payable by the Chippewas.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>5.            CHIPPEWAS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the Chippewas did succeed before us in upholding the motions 
  court judge's finding that there had been no valid surrender, in all other respects, 
  the effect of our judgment was to set aside the portions of the judgment that 
  favoured the Chippewas.  In view of the result, we do not accept the submission 
  of the Chippewas that the costs order of the motions court judge in their favour 
  following the summary judgment motions should stand, although as already explained, 
  we would make no order as to costs of the summary judgment motions in Canada's 
  favour.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We note the Chippewas’ submission that they intend to assert 
  a claim for any costs awarded against them as part of their damages claim advanced 
  against Canada and Ontario.  We express no opinion as to their entitlement to 
  do so.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-GB>OTHER ISSUES</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> All parties except the Chippewas asked that we fix the costs.  
  The Chippewas submit that the costs should be assessed.  We do not agree that 
  it would be appropriate for a five-judge panel of this court to fix the costs.  
  In view of the number of parties involved and the complexity of the proceedings, 
  it is appropriate to order that the costs be assessed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The costs of those parties using in-house counsel 
  are to be assessed on the same basis as the cost of all other parties.<b> </b></span></p>
