  </span></span> The appellant appeals the order fixing the arrears of support 
  owing by the respondent at $15,000.  The appellant submits that the arrears 
  total at least $50,000 from February 24, 1988 to the date of trial in November 
  1999, a period of over eleven years.  In addition, the appellant claims interest 
  of $27,240.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that, in fixing the amount 
  of arrears of spousal and child<u> </u>support at $15,000, the trial judge made 
  several factual errors that affected her decision as to the appropriate amount.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge’s findings with respect to the 
  arrears of support are summarized at paragraph 24 of her reasons:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I do not accept the arrears as calculated by Mrs. Cho.  I do not believe 
      that all of the payments made by Mr. Cho were credited.  The list of arrears 
      was reconstructed long after the fact.  Mrs.&nbsp;Cho was working for part 
      of the time that the arrears were accruing.  For part of the time, Mr. Cho 
      was not working.  She was reassessed for income tax purposes and required 
      to include one year of support in her income.  The rest of the payments 
      were received tax-free.  Another issue is the taxability of the arrears.  
      Even if I accepted the arrears she claims, were I to transfer the home in 
      satisfaction of the arrears, she would receive a windfall.  The support 
      order predated the child support guidelines and the payments would have 
      been taxable.  The matrimonial home is a tax-free asset.  The windfall would 
      be the tax on the support. </p>

  </span></span> At trial, the respondent questioned four payments totaling $2,500.  
  The appellant admits that one support payment of $850 made on March 31, 1992 
  was not credited. The other three amounts were clarified and in any event would 
  not reduce the amount of arrears below $50,000. </p>

</span></span> After an argument with Walter in 1987, the respondent had no further 
direct or indirect contact with Walter, Stella or the appellant.  Consequently, 
he made no further payments by giving an envelope of money to the children or 
buying things for them.  Instead, he began to make direct bank deposits into the 
bank accounts of the children.  In October 1987, the respondent issued a petition 
for divorce and the appellant filed an answer and counter petition seeking corollary 
relief.  In February 1988, Master Cork made an interim order of support in favour 
of the appellant<b> </b>as well as Walter and Stella, in the amount of $1,200 
per month.  The respondent continued to make direct bank deposits into the bank 
accounts of the children in an amount that was less than the $1,200 per month 
he had been ordered to pay.  In August 1995, the respondent stopped depositing 
money into Walter’s bank account.  The respondent paid $900 a month by money order 
into Stella’s bank account. The pass books showing the deposits were produced 
at trial.  The respondent made no other payments.

  </span></span> In August 1996, on his lawyer’s advice and out of concern that 
  he would lose the income tax deductibility of his support payments, the respondent 
  began to send monthly money orders of $900 directly to the appellant.  This 
  continued until October 1998, when the respondent discontinued his petition 
  for divorce and issued a statement of claim for partition and sale of the matrimonial 
  home.  He made<b> </b>no payments from October 1998 until March 1999.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant issued a new petition for divorce and corollary 
  relief and, in March 1999, Madam Justice Himel ordered the respondent to pay 
  interim support of $2,000 a month.  That order that was subsequently varied 
  to $1,500.  After Justice Himel’s order, the respondent made one payment directly 
  to the appellant.  Thereafter, all support payments were enforced through the 
  Family Responsibility Office (“F.R.O.”). </p>

  </span></span> The F.R.O. Director’s statement of arrears of October 6, 1999 
  shows arrears of over $50,000.  The Director’s statement was made an exhibit 
  at trial.  Having regard to the fact that no arrears accrued while the respondent 
  was voluntarily giving envelopes of money to the children, the evidence of direct 
  deposit into the children’s bank accounts until 1996, and the fact there is 
  no dispute concerning the arrears after 1996, the trial judge erred in concluding 
  that the arrears were reconstructed long after the fact. </p>

  </span></span> The appellant worked for part of the time the arrears were accruing.  
  She worked six years as a mail clerk for McCarthy Tétrault and, during this 
  time, her salary ranged from $12,000 to $19,000.  She then worked on a part-time 
  basis at a legal copy store and subsequently performed relatively low-level 
  clerical work on a freelance basis.  The respondent did not, however, bring 
  an application to vary the applicable order of support.  Having no contact with 
  the appellant or the children, he was unaware that the appellant was working.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The fact that the wife worked part-time would 
  properly have been a factor for the trial judge to consider in deciding whether 
  or not to enforce the arrears claimed and the interest of over $20,000 claimed 
  on those arrears, as this evidence goes to whether there has been a material 
  change in circumstances warranting the remission of all or part of the accumulated 
  arrears.</span></p>

  </span></span> The respondent went through a period of depression and did not 
  work for six months.  It is not disputed, however, that there was no period 
  between the time the order was made in February 1988 and the trial in October 
  1999 when the respondent was not receiving his full salary from York University.  
  His annual income increased from $40,000 in 1988 to $66,000 in 1999. </p>

lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Because the respondent had no interruption in his earnings, the 
  fact that he did not work for part of the time was not a reason to refuse to 
  enforce the arrears.  The respondent had the ability to pay the support ordered.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-style:normal'><i>5)</i></span><i><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;&nbsp;The

  </span></span> With respect to the issue of income tax, the respondent’s factum 
  did not dispute paragraph 21 of the appellant’s factum.  That paragraph states: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Appellant declared the support payments and the Respondent claimed 
      the corresponding deductions every year from 1988.  On the advice of H &amp; 
      R Block, the Appellant did not include the 1996-1997 support payments in 
      her income tax returns.  Following the Respondent’s notification to Revenue 
      Canada the Appellant was reassessed and paid the required taxes.  The Respondent 
      has received an income tax refund every year since 1988.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the respondent sought to withdraw this admission after 
  the appellant’s argument, we did not grant leave to do so.  The trial judge 
  erred in concluding that the appellant did not pay tax on the amount of money 
  that was being paid into the children’s bank accounts.  In any event, whether 
  the appellant did or did not report most of the support payments as income is 
  not, in our view, a proper basis on which to reduce the support arrears in this 
  case. There is no evidence as to the appellant’s tax rate, nor with respect 
  to the prejudicial effect on the respondent’s tax position.  The matrimonial 
  home has been listed for sale.  It is likely that, in this case, the payment 
  of arrears of support out of the respondent’s share of the proceeds of the matrimonial 
  home would be taxable in the hands of the appellant.  In <i>Gibson</i> v. <i>Canada</i> 
  (1994), 5 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>) 209 (T.C.C.), the court examined an order 
  that transferred the husband’s equity in the matrimonial home to the wife to 
  satisfy support arrears.  The court held that the transfer was a form of payment 
  and, thus, deductible in the hands of the payer and taxable in the hands of 
  the recipient.  As O’Connor T.C.J. held, at paras. 10-11,</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Court finds the effect of the Consent Judgment and the transfer effected 
      pursuant thereto was that the Appellant was released with respect to all 
      arrears of his alimony payments except for a sum of $5,100.00.  Surely therefore 
      the transfer must be considered as a form of payment. The Court therefore 
      concludes that for paragraph 60(b) or (c) to operate there need not necessarily 
      be payment in cash or by cheque.  Payment in kind provided there has been 
      an agreement or a binding determination of the value in money of the object 
      given, will suffice….</p>
    <p>Furthermore this case is distinguishable from another line of cases holding 
      lump sum payments not deductible because they were made in consideration 
      of the spouse granting a total release of all possible claims.  The amounts 
      here represented accumulated arrears of periodic maintenance payments.  
      When the Appellant paid the arrears (by transferring assets) he was entitled 
      to claim the deduction, just as he could have done had he made the payments 
      on time.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In general, periodic payments that fall into 
  arrears and then are accumulated and paid in lump sum are still deductible in 
  the hands of the payer and taxable in the hands of the recipient because, as 
  the Federal Court of Appeal held in <i>R</i>. v. <i>Sills</i> (1984), 85 D.T.C. 
  5096, “[t]he payments do not change in character simply because they are not 
  paid on time.”</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Where a lump sum of an amount substantially less than the amount 
  owing is agreed to be paid so as to release the debtor from any future obligations, 
  the character of the payments is changed and the lump sum payment is not deductible 
  (<i>MacDonald</i> v. <i>M.N.R.</i> (1968), Tax A.B.C. 1271).  However, where 
  the court reduces the amount of arrears owing, the nature of the debtor’s liability 
  is not changed, it is simply reduced, and the payment remains deductible in 
  the hands of the payer and taxable in the hands of the recipient.  See <i>Soldera</i> 
  v. <i>M.N.R</i>., [1991] 91 D.T.C. 987 (T.C.C.).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is not a case where a lesser amount of arrears is paid for 
  a release of future obligations.  Having regard to the decision in <i>Gibson</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, the payment of arrears out of the respondent’s share of the matrimonial 
  home appears to be subject to being reported as income by the appellant.  The 
  appellant, therefore, will not receive a “windfall” if arrears of support are 
  enforced.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent submits that even if the trial judge erred with 
  respect to some of her findings of fact, she had the discretion to decide whether 
  or not to enforce the arrears and we should not interfere with the exercise 
  of her discretion.  The trial judge’s reasons indicate that tax consequences 
  were a major consideration in her refusal to enforce the arrears of support 
  in their entirety.  As indicated, it appears that she erred with respect to 
  this consideration.  Having regard to this and the other factual errors made 
  by the trial judge, I cannot say that, absent these errors, the trial judge 
  would have exercised her discretion in the same manner. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mere delay in enforcing a claim for support, as with an equitable 
  claim, will not afford the respondent redress.  The appellant must have acquiesced 
  in the respondent’s conduct, or the appellant’s conduct must have either caused 
  the respondent to alter his position in reasonable reliance on the appellant’s 
  acceptance of the status quo or permitted a situation which it would be unjust 
  to disturb.  Ultimately, the issue of delay or laches is a matter of justice 
  as between the parties: <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.)</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 at 76-78.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'> [22] The respondent also relies on the trial judge's finding, at paragraph 
  17 of her reasons, that, although the appellant could have enforced the payment 
  of support arrears in 1991, she did not do so.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'>[23] Although the appellant did not enforce support arrears until 1999, 
  she made two unsuccessful early attempts to enforce the support order prior 
  to the F.R.O. taking over in 1999. One of these attempts was in August 1991. 
  The appellant wanted to enforce the amount of the difference between what the 
  respondent had been ordered to pay and what he was paying into the children's 
  bank accounts. On both these occasions the appellant was told that she could 
  not do this. The support order had to be enforced in its entirety or not at 
  all. The appellant formed the opinion that it would be better not to pursue 
  enforcement because, if the government agency failed her, she and the children 
  would be unable to survive. <br>

  </span></span> The appellant’s evidence was that she did not acquiesce in the 
  non-payment of arrears but, in her circumstances, she was not prepared to risk 
  non-receipt of the monthly payments into the children’s bank accounts.  There 
  is no evidence that the respondent altered his position based on the appellant’s 
  delay in seeking to enforce the arrears.  The appellant and the children were 
  the beneficiaries of a support order based on need.  Throughout the period in 
  question, the respondent had the ability to fully discharge his support obligation 
  but he chose to only partially discharge it.  The appellant worked for part 
  of the time but it is not clear to what extent her earnings would have reduced 
  the need for support of herself and the children.  In our opinion, the arrears 
  of support should be enforced to the extent of $50,000 to be paid out of the 
  husband’s share of the proceeds of the matrimonial home.  Having regard however 
  to the lack of contact between the parties, the fact that the appellant worked 
  for part of the time, and considering the equities of the case, I do not consider 
  this to be an appropriate case in which to allow interest on the arrears.</p>

  </span></span> The appeal is therefore allowed.  Paragraph three of the judgment 
  of divorce is varied by deleting the amount of $15,000 and substituting, in 
  its place, the amount of $50,000. </p>

  </span></span> Paragraph 10 of the judgment fixes the amount of costs at trial 
  on a party-and-party basis to be paid by the appellant to the respondent at 
  $5,000.  Having regard to the result of this appeal, I would also vary paragraph 
  10 of the judgment by ordering that the respondent pay to the appellant the 
  sum of $5,000 for her costs.  If there were outstanding offers at the time of 
  trial that would affect the order as to costs, further submissions in writing 
  may be made to the panel.</p>
