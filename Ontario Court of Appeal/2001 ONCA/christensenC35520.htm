  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant, Ruth Christensen, sued the respondent 
  Family Counselling Centre of Sault Ste. Marie and District for damages for wrongful 
  dismissal alleging that the notice of termination of her employment was inadequate. 
  There were three substantial issues to be determined at trial:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>1. Were the provisions regarding termination of employment contained 
      in the respondent’s policy manual part of Christensen’s contract of employment?</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>2. Did such provisions limit Christensen’s common-law entitlement to 
      damages in lieu of reasonable notice?</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>3. What was the appropriate quantum of damages, if any, to which Christensen 
      was entitled?</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge held that regardless of the answer to the first 
  question, the provisions contained in the employer’s policy manual were not 
  sufficiently clear to limit Christensen’s common-law entitlement to damages. 
  She assessed the damages on the basis of her finding that eight months’ notice 
  should have been given. The trial judgment was set aside on appeal to the Divisional 
  Court. Christensen appeals from the decision of the Divisional Court with leave 
  of this court.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Christensen was hired by the respondent as a therapist in May 
  1990. On September 22, 1997, she was advised by the respondent that her employment 
  was terminated by reason of funding cuts imposed by the provincial government. 
  The trial judge found that the respondent had the right to terminate Christensen’s 
  employment and that it had not acted in bad faith in doing so. The respondent 
  provided Christensen with ten weeks’ pay, continuing insurance benefits until 
  the end of 1997, and a very complimentary letter of reference.  It also volunteered 
  to assist Christensen in her new job search. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The first issue to be determined at trial was 
  whether the provisions regarding termination of employment contained in the 
  respondent’s policy manual were in fact part of Christensen’s contract of employment. 
  It was common ground between the parties that the contract of employment consisted 
  of a letter of offer dated May 15, 1990 signed by both the employer and Christensen. 
  The only reference to termination in the letter related to the six month probationary 
  period during which time either the employer or employee would be free to terminate 
  the contract on giving four weeks’ notice. The letter also set out the remuneration 
  for the position and made the following reference to the respondent’s staff 
  manual:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The responsibilities of this position have been outlined and I am enclosing 
      a staff manual which contains the conditions of employment and agency policies.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge accepted Christensen’s testimony 
  that the manual was not sent with the letter. Christensen testified that she 
  did not ask for the manual because she did not want to appear to be complaining 
  before her work even started. She did, however, ask for and receive a copy of 
  the manual during her first week of employment, she read it and she understood 
  it. She did not pay particular attention at the time to the termination provisions 
  contained in the manual nor were they explained to her by her employer. The 
  relevant provisions in the manual read as follows: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge noted that the reference to 
  “legislation” was not defined in the manual and concluded that, in context, 
  it was likely intended to refer to the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, R.S.O. 
  1990 c. E-14. She then considered the following relevant provisions of the Act:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>4          (1)       An employment standard shall be deemed a minimum requirement 
      only.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>(2)       A right, benefit, term or condition 
      of employment under a contract, oral or written, express or implied, or 
      under any other Act or any schedule, order or regulation made thereunder 
      that provides in favour of an employee a higher remuneration in money, a 
      greater right or benefit or lesser hours of work than the requirement imposed 
      by an employment standard shall prevail over an employment standard.</p>
    <p>6          (1)       No civil remedy of an employee against his or her 
      employer is suspended or affected by this Act.</p>
    <p>57        (1)       No employer shall terminate the employment of an employee 
      who has been employed for three months or more unless the employer gives,</p>
    <p><span>                        </span>…</p>
    <p>(g)       seven weeks notice in writing to the employee if his or her period 
      of employment is seven years or more but less than eight years;</p>
    <p>64.3    (2)       Subject to subsection (4), an employee is not entitled 
      to commence a civil action for wrongful dismissal if he or she files a complaint 
      alleging an entitlement to termination pay or severance pay relating to 
      the same termination of employment.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>(3)       The employee is not entitled to commence 
      a civil action in the circumstances described in subsection (1) or (2) even 
      if the amount owing to the employee is greater than the amount for which 
      an order can be made under the Act.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that the provision for 
  termination was capable of multiple interpretations. She explained them as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Firstly, it might be interpreted as setting a ceiling for termination pay, 
      implicitly providing that the lesser of one month’s pay or the termination 
      pay provided for by what is now section 57 of the <i>Employment Standards 
      Act</i>.  This interpretation would result in a violation of the minimum 
      standards set by the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> for employees whose 
      period of employment is five years or more.</p>
    <p>This interpretation would necessitate a conclusion that the provision was 
      null and void as violating the minimums prescribed by the <i>Employment 
      Standards Act</i> and thus would entitle the Plaintiff to damages in lieu 
      of reasonable notice on termination.  (<i>Machtinger v. HOJ Industries Ltd.</i> 
      (1992), 91 D.L.R. (4th) 491).</p>
    <p>It cannot be assumed that the Personnel Code was drawn to comply with the 
      <i>Employment Standards Act</i>.  I note that section H(A) 5 reserves to 
      the employer the right to withhold the final salary payment until records 
      and reports are completed by the employee, despite the prohibition in section 
      8 of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> against retention of wages.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Secondly, it might be interpreted as providing the greater of one month’s 
      pay or the notice required by the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, that 
      is, establishing a maximum and a minimum for the level of payments to be 
      made on termination.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Thirdly, it might be interpreted as providing for one month’s notice 
      and the notice or pay in lieu of notice required on termination by the <i>Employment 
      Standards Act</i>.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Finally, it might be interpreted as permitting an action for damages 
      for wrongful dismissal, but setting a minimum of one month’s notice to be 
      given in any event.</span></p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge held that in the event of any 
  ambiguity in the provision, it must be construed in favour of the employee who 
  took no part in the preparation of the document. The respondent does not take 
  issue with this finding that the principle of <i>contra proferentem </i>should 
  apply. The trial judge then concluded as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>If the Defendant wished to limit its obligations on termination of employment 
      to the notice provisions provided by section 57 of the <i>Employment Standards 
      Act</i>, it should have clearly expressed those intentions and brought them 
      home to the prospective employee.  As noted by Iacobucci&nbsp;J. in <i>Machtinger 
      v. HOJ Industries Ltd.</i> 91 D.L.R. (4th) 491 at p.&nbsp;503,</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>… In Canada it has been established since 
      at least 1936 that employment contracts for an indefinite period require 
      the employer, absent express contractual language to the contrary, to give 
      reasonable notice of an intention to terminate the contract if the dismissal 
      is without cause.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>and …</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:11.0pt;'>… I would characterize the common law principle 
      of termination only on reasonable notice as a presumption, rebuttable if 
      the contract of employment clearly specifies some other period of notice, 
      whether expressly or impliedly.</span></p>
    <p>In this case, the contractual provision is unclear.  Two of four possible 
      interpretations would permit the Plaintiff to claim damages for wrongful 
      dismissal.  The Plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of a favourable interpretation 
      of this ambiguous provision and I therefore conclude that even if part of 
      the employment contract, it does not bar a claim for damages for wrongful 
      dismissal. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, the trial judge assessed the damages 
  on the basis that eight months’ notice of termination should have been given.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On appeal to the Divisional Court, a unanimous 
  court was of the view that the termination provisions of the manual were part 
  of the employment contract and that, although she had made no specific finding 
  to that effect, the trial judge had so found because she had “concentrate[d] 
  on the various interpretations of the termination provision” in her judgment. 
  The court held further that the trial judge had erred in her conclusion that 
  Christensen was entitled to common-law damages for wrongful dismissal. In a 
  brief endorsement, the court gave its reasons as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The termination provision, although ambiguous, is not unfair, onerous 
      or does not result from any undue influence on the employee or any ignorance 
      or infirmity of the employee.</span></p>
    <p>The employer acknowledges that the <i>contra proferentem</i> principle 
      applies and that the interpretation most beneficial to the employee should 
      govern, that is that she is entitled to one month’s notice plus the 7 weeks 
      prescribed for in the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>.  She has in fact 
      received slightly more than that amount.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>This being the case, there has in our opinion been no breach of the 
      employment contract and Justice Pardu was clearly wrong in concluding that 
      the employee was entitled to common law damages for wrongful dismissal.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Divisional Court therefore set the trial 
  judgment aside and dismissed Christensen’s action with costs. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, the Divisional Court erred in stating 
  that the trial judge had found that the termination provisions in the manual 
  were part of the employment contract. It is clear from her reasons that the 
  trial judge expressly declined to make a final determination on this issue because 
  she was of the view that, regardless of the answer to this question, the contract 
  provisions in question were not sufficiently clear to rebut the common-law presumption 
  that an employee can only be terminated on reasonable notice. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, and more importantly, the Divisional 
  Court erred in failing to give effect to the principle in <i>Machtinger v. HOJ 
  Industries Ltd.</i> (1992), 66 O.R. (2d) 545 (S.C.C.). The determinative question 
  here was not whether the termination provisions in the manual were unfair, onerous 
  or the result of undue influence or any power imbalance. Rather, as found by 
  the trial judge, the case turned on whether the termination provisions, if they 
  formed part of the contract, were sufficiently clear to rebut the common-law 
  presumption. The trial judge’s conclusion that they were not was entirely reasonable 
  and ought not to have been interfered with. </span></p>

  of damages assessed at trial. I would therefore allow the appeal, set aside 
  the judgment of the Divisional Court, and restore the trial judgment.  I would
