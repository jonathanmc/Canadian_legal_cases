<p class=headingtitle><u>The Issue</u></p>
<p class=headingsubtitle>Can the respondent Apartment and Housing Services, Queen’s 
  University (“Queen’s”) enforce a “no pets” rule by refusing to renew the lease 
  of tenants who have pets, when it could not enforce a “no pets” term in the 
  lease itself?</p>

  </span> I would hold that while unlike other landlords, Queen’s can require 
  tenants to enter into an agreements to terminate their tenancy at the same time 
  as they sign their leases, Queen’s cannot rely on those agreements and refuse 
  to renew a tenancy solely for the purpose of enforcing a “no pets” policy.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Queen’s University owns approximately 550 residential rental units.  
  The units are available to students of Queen’s University.  At least one tenant 
  of each unit must be a student at the university.  The appellant, Ms. Atkinson, 
  was a student at Queen’s University throughout the relevant time period.  She, 
  the appellant Mr. Clandfield and their child resided in one of the rental units 
  owned by Queen’s University for several years.  Like all other tenants of the 
  units, the appellants entered into a series of one-year tenancies commencing 
  on September 1<sup>st</sup> and terminating on the following August 31<sup>st</sup>.  
  The appellants also entered into an agreement to terminate their tenancy each 
  time they entered into a new lease.  As of March 1999, the appellants had resided 
  in their unit for about 4 years.  Their lease had been renewed each year.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Queen’s had a policy forbidding pets in the rental units.  That policy 
  was set out in the Apartment and Housing Services Tenant Handbook and incorporated 
  into the tenancy agreement between Queen’s University and the appellants. In 
  March 1999, Housing Services at Queen’s learned that the appellants had two 
  cats.  The appellants were advised that their lease would not be renewed for 
  the term beginning September 1, 1999 unless they “relocated” their pets.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The decision to refuse to renew the appellants’ lease was based entirely 
  on the appellants’ breach of Queen’s University’s “no pets” rule.  There was 
  no suggestion that the cats were causing any problems or that there was any 
  other reason for refusing to renew the appellants’ lease.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants took the position that Queen’s University could not require 
  them to remove their pets as a condition of permitting them to renew their lease.  
  The appellants relied on s. 15 of the <i>Tenant Protection Act</i>, 1997, S.O. 
  1997, c. 24 (the “<i>Act</i>”), which provides that any term in a residential 
  tenancy agreement prohibiting pets is void.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Queen’s acknowledged that s. 15 of the <i>Act</i> applied to the appellants’ 
  lease, but took the position that the tenancy termination agreement signed by 
  the appellants terminated the tenancy as of August 31, 1999.  Queen’s argued 
  that like any other landlord, it could refuse to enter into a new lease with 
  a prospective tenant because that person had pets.  Queen’s contended that it 
  could enforce its tenancy termination agreement with the appellants for whatever 
  reason it considered appropriate, including the enforcement of its “no pets” 
  rule.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants brought an application before the Ontario Rental Housing 
  Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) for an order declaring that Queen’s could not refuse 
  to renew their lease because the appellants kept pets.  The Tribunal allowed 
  the application and made an order requiring Queen’s to renew the appellants’ 
  lease.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Queen’s appealed to the Divisional Court pursuant to s. 196 of the <i>Act</i> 
  on a question of law.  That court, by a majority, allowed the appeal and set 
  aside the order of the Tribunal.  Matlow J., for the majority, held that while 
  Queen’s could not terminate the appellants’ tenancy during the term of the tenancy 
  on the basis that the appellants kept cats, it could refuse to grant a new tenancy 
  to the appellants for that very same reason.</p>

  </span> Two provisions of the <i>Act</i> and one section of the regulations 
  made under the <i>Act</i> are germane to this appeal.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>s. 15            A provision in a tenancy agreement prohibiting the presence 
      of animals in or about the residential complex is void.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>s. 39(3) An agreement between a landlord and tenant to terminate a tenancy 
      is void if it is entered into, </p>
    <p>(a)            at the time the tenancy agreement is entered into; or</p>
    <p>(b)            as a condition of entering into the tenancy agreement.</p>
    <p>…</p>
    <p>O. Reg. 194/98 (the “Regulation”)</p>
    <p>s. 4(1) Subsections 39(3) and (4) of the <i>Act</i> do not apply to rental 
      units occupied by students of one or more post-secondary educational institutions 
      in a residential complex owned, operated or administered by or on behalf 
      of the post-secondary educational institutions.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 15 is self-explanatory.  A term in a residential tenancy agreement 
  prohibiting pets is void.  Section 15 applied to the lease in effect between 
  the appellants and Queen’s as of March 1999.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 39(3) is one of several provisions in the <i>Act</i> found under 
  the heading “Security Of Tenure”.  The section recognizes that tenants are often 
  not in an equal bargaining position with landlords when leases are being negotiated 
  and that landlords should not be allowed to extract tenancy termination agreements 
  at the time leases are signed.  The prohibition against such agreements affords 
  tenants a measure of security that in many cases they could not achieve through 
  the normal bargaining process.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> But for s. 4(1) of the Regulation, the tenancy termination agreement 
  between Queen’s University and the appellants would be void.  Section 4(1) creates 
  an exemption to s. 39(3).  That exemption is narrowly drawn and applies to units 
  occupied by students of a post-secondary institution where those units are located 
  in a residential complex owned, operated or administered by a post-secondary 
  institution.  Because of this regulation, landlords like Queen’s can require 
  students renting units in its residences to sign a tenancy termination agreement 
  at the same time as they sign their lease.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Tribunal found that the purpose behind the exemption created in 
  s. 4(1) of the Regulation was to allow post-secondary institutions “to preserve 
  the stock of student housing”.  In coming to that conclusion, the Tribunal relied 
  on correspondence emanating from the then Assistant Deputy Minister of Municipal 
  Affairs and Housing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am in substantial agreement with the Tribunal’s conclusion, although 
  I do not need to refer to the Assistant Deputy Minister’s correspondence to 
  come to that result.  The purpose behind s. 39(3), as well as the language of 
  s. 4(1) of the Regulation, make the purpose of that regulation clear to me.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The significant derogation from the security of tenure allowed by s. 
  4(1) of the Regulation reflects the unique position of landlords like Queen’s 
  whose role as landlord is an adjunct to their broader role as a provider of 
  post-secondary education.  In any given academic year, the demands by students 
  for rental units may far exceed the supply.  In order to achieve its educational 
  goals, Queen’s must be able to allot its limited residential resources on an 
  annual basis in a manner which best serves the broader educational needs and 
  purposes of the university.  Queen’s may, for example, conclude that the needs 
  of first year students dictate that the university community is best served 
  by giving priority to applications for rental units made by first year students, 
  even if that priority means students who rented units in previous years must 
  be denied the opportunity to renew their leases.  Without the exemption created 
  by s. 4(1) of the Regulation, Queen’s would not have the needed flexibility 
  to permit it to tailor its allocation of rental units to meet broader educational 
  concerns.  The normal security of tenure afforded to tenants by s.39(3) of the 
  <i>Act</i> must yield to the broader institutional concerns of the university.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Queen’s is bound by the provisions of the <i>Act</i> from which it is 
  not exempted.  These include s. 15.  Section 4(1) of the Regulation is directed 
  specifically at ss. 39(3) and 39(4) of the <i>Act</i>.  It is not intended to 
  permit Queen’s to circumvent the clear prohibition against a “no pets” term 
  in a lease found in s. 15.  Nor in my view, can it be seriously suggested (and 
  I don’t understand counsel for Queen’s to have made this suggestion) that the 
  enforcement of a “no pets” policy somehow furthers the broader educational goals 
  of Queen’s.  It is those goals and those goals alone which justify some derogation 
  from the security of tenure afforded to residential tenants by the <i>Act</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 4(1) of the Regulation provides that a tenancy termination agreement 
  entered into at the time a tenancy agreement is entered into is not void in 
  the circumstances described by the section.  Section 4(1) does not say that 
  such tenancy termination agreements are enforceable in all circumstances.  In 
  this case, by its own admission, Queen’s chose to invoke the termination agreement 
  and to refuse to renew the appellants’ tenancy solely because they had pets.  
  Had they relocated their pets, the tenancy would have been renewed.  Queen’s 
  used the exemption granted to it by the Regulation to do indirectly what it 
  could not do directly, that is, enforce a “no pets” rule.  In my view, the tenancy 
  termination agreement is not enforceable where it is invoked solely as a means 
  of indirectly imposing a limit on the use of the rented premises when the imposition 
  of that limitation is specifically prohibited by the <i>Act</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In so concluding, I do not go as far as the Tribunal and hold that the 
  tenancy termination agreement entered into by the appellants is void.  I hold 
  rather that it is unenforceable where the sole and stated purpose of reliance 
  on the termination agreement is to impose a prohibited limitation on the use 
  of the rented premises.  I would also not go beyond the declaration that the 
  tenancy termination agreement was unenforceable in the circumstances.  The Tribunal’s 
  order was broader and went beyond the facts of this case.  I see no reason to 
  decide more than is required to resolve this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the Divisional Court 
  and make an order declaring that Queen’s could not enforce the tenancy termination 
  agreement against the appellants for the sole purpose of imposing its otherwise 
  unenforceable “no pets” policy.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
