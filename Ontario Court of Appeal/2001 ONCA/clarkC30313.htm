<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the finding of dangerous offender made by 
  Justice C. Anderson on May&nbsp;7, 1996</span></b></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On May 7, 1996 the appellant pled guilty and was found guilty 
  of twenty sexual offences before Anderson J. The charges related to twenty different 
  complainants all of whom were young boys at the relevant time. After conviction,  
  the appellant’s bail was revoked and he was remanded in custody. The Crown indicated 
  that it intended to bring an application to have the appellant declared a dangerous 
  offender and the matter was adjourned in order to allow Crown counsel to obtain 
  the Attorney General’s consent.<span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On September 5, 1996, a second information, 
  marked “Duplicate Information”, was placed before the court alleging twenty 
  sexual offences in relation to the same incidents alleged in the May 7 information. 
  Crown counsel indicated that the new information was necessary because the earlier 
  information charged the appellant with offences under the Criminal Code that 
  were not enacted at the time. The new charges related to the same twenty complainants 
  and covered precisely the same conduct as alleged in the earlier information.</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Arial;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant was arraigned on the new information 
  and entered guilty pleas. By consent of counsel, the facts read into the record 
  on May 7, 1996 were read into the record and the appellant was convicted on 
  all counts. By inadvertence, the appellant’s guilty pleas on the earlier information 
  were not struck, his convictions were not set aside, and the charges were not 
  withdrawn.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The dangerous offender hearing commenced on 
  December 18, 1997 and proceeded intermittently over several months. On July 
  10, 1998, the appellant was found to be a dangerous offender and was sentenced 
  to an indeterminate period of incarceration. Both informations before the court 
  were marked accordingly. The appellant appeals from this finding and from the 
  sentence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first ground of appeal relates to the court’s jurisdiction 
  to conduct a dangerous offender hearing on both informations at the same time. 
  It is argued that this defect was fatal and that the finding and sentence should 
  accordingly be quashed.  In particular, the appellant submits that it is apparent 
  from the judge’s reasons, which refer repeatedly and mistakenly to the “39 convictions”, 
  that he was prejudiced by this error.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We see no merit to the contention that the entire 
  process was vitiated by this procedural irregularity. The trial judge had the 
  jurisdiction to proceed with the dangerous offender application on the basis 
  of the second information together with the consent of the Attorney General 
  thereto. Further, on reading the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, we are not 
  persuaded that his reference to the “39 convictions” was anything more than 
  inadvertent error. It is clear that the trial judge proceeded on the basis of 
  the allegations with respect to the twenty complainants.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The parties agree that the record must be corrected 
  to reflect the actual proceedings that transpired and an order will be made 
  accordingly.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although the appellant suggests that the trial judge misapprehended 
  the expert opinion evidence in certain respects, the next two grounds of appeal 
  in essence  relate to the reasonableness of the finding that the appellant is 
  a dangerous offender. Despite counsel’s able argument, we are not persuaded 
  that the conclusion reached by the trial judge was not reasonably supported 
  by the evidence. It was open to him on the totality of the evidence to be satisfied 
  beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a likelihood of the appellant causing 
  injury, pain or other evil to other persons through failure in the future to 
  control his sexual impulses.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to sentence, the trial judge declined 
  to exercise the discretion which was then reposed in him under the Criminal 
  Code to impose a determinate sentence. We see no error in the manner in which 
  he considered this question and declined to exercise that discretion. The imposition 
  of an indeterminate sentence was reasonably supported by the evidence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Consequently, the appeal is allowed with respect 
  to the convictions noted on the first information, those convictions are set 
  aside and the information is quashed. The appeal related to the dangerous offender 
  application is dismissed.</span></p>
