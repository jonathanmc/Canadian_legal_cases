        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant appeals from his conviction 
        on a charge of attempted murder. The facts giving rise to the charge are 
        summarized in brief below.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In the early morning hours of June 6, 
        1997, Gary Resendes was struck by a car as it travelled the wrong way 
        down a one-way street at a high rate of speed. The force of impact sent 
        Mr. Resendes flying into the air and he landed on his back in the middle 
        of the street. As a result of the collision, he was in the hospital for 
        six months and he continues to suffer from his injuries.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The car that struck Mr. Resendes was driven 
        by the appellant. Moments before the collision, Mr. Resendes and his friends 
        had a dispute with the appellant's stepson, Pino, over the purchase of 
        marijuana. As they left Pino's house, the appellant was seen getting into 
        his car. Moments later, he drove past Mr. Resendes and his friends as 
        they were crossing the next street over. The appellant then pulled into 
        a driveway, turned his vehicle around and came back towards Mr. Resendes, 
        who by then, was the only one still in the street. The appellant made 
        no attempt to avoid Mr. Resendes, nor did he stop after hitting him. The 
        appellant surrendered to the police the next day following a short investigation.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant was charged with attempted 
        murder, criminal negligence causing bodily harm and failing to remain 
        at the scene of an accident. He was found guilty at trial on all counts 
        but the latter two charges were stayed. Accordingly, he appeals only against 
        the conviction for attempted murder.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Although the appellant raised numerous 
        grounds of appeal, in our view, the only one with merit is the ground 
        relating to the trial judge's alleged misapprehension and misuse of certain 
        evidence going to the crucial issue of intent. </span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In concluding that the appellant had the 
        requisite intent for the offence of attempted murder, the trial judge 
        placed considerable emphasis on three factors, namely:</span></p>
      <p class=headingsubsubtitle> <span
lang=EN-CA>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>that the appellant deliberately drove 
        at the victim;</span></p>
      <p class=headingsubsubtitle> <span
lang=EN-CA>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>that he did so from a distance of approximately 
        70 metres; and </span></p>
      <p class=headingsubsubtitle> <span
lang=EN-CA>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-CA>that he was travelling at a speed of not 
        less than 70 kilometres per hour when he struck the victim.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>While the first of those three findings 
        was open to the trial judge, in our view, the latter two were not because 
        they were rooted in an out-of-court, unadopted hearsay statement. The 
        admissible evidence concerning distance and speed, though by no means 
        crystal clear, tended to show that the appellant drove at the victim from 
        a distance of approximately 50 to 60 feet and that he was travelling at 
        a rate of speed somewhere between 40 and 50 kilometres per hour at the 
        time of impact.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Had the trial judge factored those numbers 
        into the equation, we think that he may have come to a different conclusion 
        on the issue of intent for attempted murder. Expressed somewhat differently, 
        we cannot be certain that the trial judge would have found that the appellant 
        had the requisite intent to kill had he not used the 70 metre, 70 kilometre 
        per hour figures.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Ordinarily, the error in question would 
        lead to a new trial. In the circumstances of this case however, Mr. Tweney 
        does not ask for that. Rather, he invites us to quash the conviction for 
        attempted murder and in its place, substitute a conviction for the lesser 
        and included offence of aggravated assault.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>We see no reason why we should not give 
        effect to Mr. Tweney's request. The error made by the trial judge does 
        not affect the issue of intent in so far as the offence of aggravated 
        assault is concerned and the findings of fact made by the trial judge 
        that were available to him lead inexorably to the conclusion that the 
        appellant is guilty of that offence.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span> </span>Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal, 
        set aside the conviction for attempted murder and in its place substitute 
        a conviction for the lesser and included offence of aggravated assault.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In the course of argument, it was agreed 
        that in the event we substituted a conviction for a lesser offence, counsel 
        should be given the opportunity to make submissions in writing with respect 
        to sentence.</span></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Accordingly, the appellant is to file 
        written submissions with the court on the issue of sentence by no later 
        than Tuesday, August 7, 2001. The respondent is to file submissions on 
        sentence with the court by no later than August 13, 2001. If these time 
        frames cannot be met, the parties may apply to a member of the panel for 
        an extension.</span></p>
