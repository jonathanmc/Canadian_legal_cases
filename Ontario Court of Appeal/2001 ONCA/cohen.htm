    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following a trial by judge and jury, the appellant 
    was convicted on several counts of distribution and possession of child pornography. 
    He was sentenced to fourteen months’ imprisonment. He appeals against the

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant appeals his convictions on several 
    grounds. In our view, it is only necessary to address some of the grounds 
    in detail to dispose of the appeal. </span></p>
  <p><i><span lang=EN-US>1.         Admissibility and use of evidence about two 
    books found in appellant’s bedroom </span></i><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the evidence describing 
    two books found in his bedroom should not have been admitted at trial because 
    its very limited probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. 
    Counsel argues that the error was compounded by Crown counsel’s cross-examination 
    of the appellant about this evidence and by the trial judge’s failure to give 
    a proper limiting instruction to the jury. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The evidence about the books was limited. A 
    police witness testified that he came across the books during a search of 
    the appellant’s house. He described the books briefly, noting that one concerned 
    sexual abuse of children at a day-care and the other appeared to be a book 
    of fiction involving an adult male meeting or stalking a seventeen-year-old 
    female. The books were not seized and not produced in evidence. The officer 
    was not cross-examined on his recollections about the books. The appellant 
    testified that the first book was about a court case in the United States 
    and the second one was his wife’s.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Crown introduced this evidence to show 
    that the appellant was interested in the general subject matter of child abuse 
    and therefore the more likely occupant of his household to have authored the 
    pornographic electronic communications that formed the basis of the charges. 
    No objection was taken at trial to the admissibility of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We agree with the appellant’s contention that 
    this evidence was of very limited probative value. We also agree that its 
    potential prejudicial effect arguably outweighed its probative value. However, 
    the trial is the appropriate forum in which to challenge the admissibility 
    of evidence for the first time. In the absence of any objection at trial, 
    we are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in admitting this evidence 
    without a <i>voir dire </i>or that Crown counsel exceeded the bounds of permissible 
    cross-examination.  </span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although it would have been preferable for 
    the trial judge to specifically instruct the jury that they should not use 
    the presence of the books to reason from propensity, the failure to do so 
    in the circumstances of this case did not amount to a reversible error. The 
    evidence about the books was very limited and, when considered in the context 
    of the whole trial, of relative unimportance. In this regard it is noteworthy 
    that the defence did not request any limiting instruction nor did the defence 
    object to the instructions that were given to the jury. </span></p>

    Failure to instruct the jury on alleged alibi evidence and other matters relevant 
    to the defence</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant contends that the evidence of 
    one witness, Duncan Leggett, was in the nature of alibi evidence as on at 
    least one of the occasions when an electronic communication was taking place, 
    Mr. Leggett would have been in attendance with the appellant at his house. 
    He submits that the trial judge erred in failing to deal with this important 
    evidence in his charge. Counsel for the appellant also notes a number of other 
    items of evidence which, in his submission, were important to the defence 
    and should have been reviewed by the trial judge for the jury. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are not satisfied that the evidence of Mr. 
    Leggett was in the nature of alibi evidence. There is no indication on the 
    record that this evidence was treated by counsel as “alibi.” Rather, it would 
    appear that Mr. Leggett’s evidence was just one of many other items of evidence 
    relied upon by the appellant in support of his position that he was not the 
    author of the communications in question. In these circumstances, it was not 
    incumbent upon the trial judge to give any particular instruction to the jury 
    with respect to this evidence. Indeed, if it had been treated as alibi evidence, 
    the trial judge would have been required to instruct the jury to give the 
    evidence diminished weight because of the absence of an alibi notice giving 
    the police an opportunity to investigate the claim. The absence of such an 
    instruction enured to the benefit of the appellant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We are also of the view that the trial judge 
    adequately summarized the position of the defence and related it to the evidence 
    in the case. The trial judge was not required to address every argument and 
    every point in the evidence. Again it is noteworthy that no objection was 
    made to the jury charge. </span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US><i>3.            Other grounds of appeal</i></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The remaining grounds of appeal also relate 
    to matters that were not raised or objected to at trial. Having considered 
    the context in which these matters arose, we are satisfied that the failure 
    to object at trial properly reflected the relative unimportance of these alleged 
    errors.  Consequently, we did not call upon the Crown at the hearing to respond 
    to these additional grounds.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  <h3><span lang=EN-US>B.            Sentence Appeal </span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that the sentence of 
    fourteen months’ imprisonment and three years’ probation is excessive and 
    that the trial judge failed to give adequate consideration to the possibility 
    of a conditional sentence.  The respondent concedes that the sentence is &quot;at 
    the high end of the range&quot; but submits that we should not interfere.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In his reasons for sentence, the trial judge 
    focused almost entirely on the need for denunciation and deterrence for this 
    offence and, relying on the decision of this court in <i>R. v. Lisk,</i> [1998] 
    O.J. No.1456, held that it would not be appropriate to impose a conditional 
    sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We share the concerns expressed by the trial 
    judge about the need for a sentence that clearly denunciates the distribution 
    of child pornography and deters those who might be tempted to engage in its 
    dissemination.  However, meeting those concerns should not exclude consideration 
    of other relevant sentencing factors.  Bearing in mind the deference owed 
    to the trial judge in determining a fit sentence, it is our view that in the 
    circumstances of this offence and this offender, the sentence imposed is excessive 
    and reflects an error in principle justifying the intervention of this court.  
    We arrive at that conclusion for the following reasons.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the trial judge did not have the benefit 
    of the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Proulx </i>(2000), 
    140 C.C.C. (3d) 449.  In that case, it was pointed out, at p. 493, that conditional 
    sentences are punitive sanctions capable of achieving the objectives of denunciation 
    and deterrence and that they may be considered even where a sentence meeting 
    those objectives is required.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the circumstances of this case are 
    distinguishable from <i>Lisk</i>.  That case involved an offender who distributed 
    material in exchange for more child pornography.  In the present case, the 
    appellant responded to the invitations of under-cover police officers and 
    sent the offending material with no request for payment or exchange.  Moreover, 
    the sentence upheld in <i>Lisk</i> was three months, significantly less that 
    the fourteen-month sentence imposed here, and the court's refusal to intervene 
    in that case does not preclude the use of conditional sentences for this offence 
    in appropriate circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third, the circumstances of this offender are 
    mitigating factors.  The appellant was 44 years old at the time he was sentenced.  
    He is married and lives with his wife and three children.  He has no criminal 
    record.  He has been steadily employed in responsible positions and has supported 
    his family.  He has a supportive extended family and is involved in the synagogue 
    he attends.  The trial judge accepted psychiatric evidence that the appellant 
    is not a pedophile.  There is nothing to suggest that he is involved in the 
    creation or production of child pornography or that he poses a threat to the 
    community.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth, these proceedings have already had 
    a significant deterrent effect upon the appellant.  The arrest, trial and 
    conviction of the appellant on these charges have led to what the trial judge 
    described as &quot;harassment&quot; from the community.  His two youngest 
    children were, as found by the trial judge, &quot;subjected to abuse from 
    their peers and adults&quot;.  The appellant and his family had to move to 
    another community to escape.  He has had to change his job twice and has suffered 
    a significant decline in his income.  As a result of these charges, he has 
    spent time in jail, a total of just over two weeks’ pre-trial and post-trial 
    custody.  In our view, the sentence imposed by the trial judge failed to reflect 
    the devastating effect these proceedings have already had upon the appellant 
    and his family.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Taking all these factors into account, it is 
    our view that a sentence of fourteen months imprisonment reflects an error 
    in principle that justifies the intervention of this court.  The goals of 
    denunciation and deterrence in the circumstances of this offence and this 
    offender would be adequately met by substituting a conditional sentence of 
    fourteen months on the conditions that he:</span></p>
