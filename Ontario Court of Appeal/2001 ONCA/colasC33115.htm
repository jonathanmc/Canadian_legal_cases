  </span> Roger Colas appeals his conviction on November 19, 1997 on charges of 
  assault, assault causing bodily harm, sexual assault, forcible confinement, 
  mischief, breach of probation&nbsp;(2) and breach of undertaking&nbsp;(2).  
  He also applies for leave to appeal his sentence aggregating six years.</p>

'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are agreed that although there were a number of errors in the conduct 
  of the trial, including the charge to the jury, those errors, neither individually 
  nor collectively, are sufficient to require the setting aside of the convictions.  
  Nor are we of the view that the sentences are unfit.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On November 3, 1996, the appellant and his girlfriend O. T. (“T.”) were 
  ejected from a dance bar in Ottawa after consuming alcohol and getting into 
  an argument.  Outside the appellant screamed at T., punched her several times, 
  she fell to the ground and he kicked her in the chest.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On November 6, 1996, he was charged with assault causing bodily harm 
  and failure to comply with a probation order prohibiting him from the purchase, 
  possession or consumption of alcohol.  He was released upon his undertaking 
  not to communicate with T. and to abstain from alcohol.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In August 1997, the appellant pleaded guilty to breaching that undertaking 
  by leaving threatening messages on T.’s answering machine.  He was sentenced 
  to fourteen days in jail, having already served thirty days in pre-trial custody.</p>

  </span> He was released on September 11, 1997.  He went to T.’s apartment bearing 
  gifts and very drunk.  He demanded sex from her and when she refused he forced 
  her into her bedroom, threw her on the bed, pulled off her jeans and her underwear, 
  put his fingers in her vagina and then forced his penis inside her.  He did 
  this several times over the course of a couple of hours.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant remained with T. and the following day he again threatened 
  her, removed her clothes and forced her to have sex.  He also attempted to have 
  anal intercourse but was unsuccessful.  After ejaculating the appellant forced 
  her to put his penis in her mouth.  After this he performed oral sex upon her.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When he went to the bathroom she attempted to leave the apartment by 
  the bedroom window but he returned to the bedroom and prevented her escape.  
  Eventually the appellant left the apartment and T. telephoned the police.  She 
  was seen by a nurse and by a doctor in the Sexual Assault Treatment Centre of 
  Riverside Hospital in Ottawa that same day.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Colas was tried by a judge and jury commencing November 10, 1997.  He 
  pleaded not guilty to all nine counts, but after the conclusion of the evidence 
  pleaded guilty to the four counts involving breaches of probation and breaches 
  of undertakings.  The Crown relied upon the evidence of T., the nurse, the doctor 
  and the police.  The case turned upon the credibility of T.  The appellant did 
  not testify but did present other evidence.  He was convicted on all counts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the conviction appeal the appellant raised issues respecting alleged 
  errors in the charge to the jury, the admission of the doctor’s opinion, the 
  admission of a prior consistent statement, the admission of evidence of the 
  appellant’s character and the denial of a motion for a mistrial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The charge to the jury in this case was not given, as it is in most 
  cases, after all the evidence had been received and counsel had summed up to 
  the jury.  Rather the judge's charge was given in parts, commencing at the beginning 
  of the trial and continuing through to the end.  As well, unlike most trials, 
  the charge was given not only orally, but the oral presentation was followed 
  up with a verbatim rendition in print which the jury would receive soon after 
  the oral delivery.  This practice was followed by the same trial judge in <i>R. 
  v. Ménard</i> (1996), 108 C.C.C. (3d) 424 (Ont. C.A.) (Arbour, Labrosse and 
  Weiler JJ.A.); (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 416 (S.C.C.).  Those courts commented 
  on the format of the charge, both praising the idea and criticizing the performance.  
  Both pointed out some of the dangers involved, in particular, the risk of giving 
  erroneous instructions early on in the proceeding and the risk of guessing incorrectly 
  as to what is likely to occur as the trial proceeds.  In the result both courts 
  dismissed the appeal. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In passing, we note the advice provided by Cory J. speaking for the 
  majority in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at page 
  12:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In some jurisdictions, after the jury as been selected, the trial judge 
      will provide some brief basic instructions as to the nature of a criminal 
      trial and the fundamental principles that will be applied.  This is such 
      a sound, sensible and salutary practice that it should be undertaken in 
      all jurisdictions.  Obviously it will be of great assistance to jurors if, 
      at the beginning of the trial, they are advised of the applicable  basic 
      principles.  If that procedure is followed, it would be helpful to advise 
      the jury at this time, as well as at the conclusion of the trial, of the 
      presumption of innocence and the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
      which the Crown must meet.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Appellant’s counsel criticized the practice of giving instructions in 
  instalments, relying on <i>Ménard</i>.  In particular, the trial judge did make 
  errors in his first instructions dealing with the meaning of reasonable doubt.  
  Notwithstanding that this instruction was given on November 10, 1997, it failed 
  to observe some of the language disapproved by the Supreme Court of Canada in 
  <i>Lifchus</i>, which was released September 18, 1997.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Specifically, the trial judge said that when he spoke of reasonable 
  doubt he used the term in “its ordinary sense”.  He said “there is no mystic 
  or magical formula; there is no specific legal sense to that”.  He went on to 
  say that it was simply a question of “feeling sure” of the guilt of the accused.  
  “Do you feel sure of the guilt of accused?”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Some words and phrases were disapproved by Cory J. in <i>Lifchus</i>.  
  The word “ordinary” and the phrase “ordinary meaning” were disapproved of in 
  the context of reasonable doubt and the words “sure” and “certain” were warned 
  against unless and until a jury has already been instructed as to the meaning 
  of reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition, the oral instructions on that first day of trial contained 
  an obvious error in that in setting out the elements of sexual assault the trial 
  judge said that “for you to find the accused guilty of sexual assault you must 
  find that the <i>accused</i> has proven beyond a reasonable doubt the following: 
  . . .”.  (Emphasis added).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This obvious error was not picked up or commented upon by either counsel 
  and appeared in the typed transcript which was provided to the jury on Wednesday, 
  November 12, the second day of the trial.  As to the definition of “beyond a 
  reasonable doubt”, the phrases “feeling sure” and “feel sure”, which had not 
  been prohibited by <i>Lifchus</i>, remained.  The trial judge acknowledged that 
  his instruction on the first day had been wrong.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The next thing I want to tell you is that in respect of my opening remarks 
      to you, I instructed you on the burden of proof and presumption of innocence, 
      and since – and that is a form that I have used for many years, and yesterday 
      again I was here working, and it came to my attention that the Supreme Court, 
      while I was absent from the country, had handed down a decision which changed 
      to some extent the instructions that I should be giving to a jury in matters 
      of reasonable doubt and burden of proof.</p>
    <p>So what I have done, and I took the liberty to do and I vetted this with 
      both counsel, is in the copy that you will receive I have already made the 
      changes to the instructions so as to conform I think to the requirements 
      of the Supreme Court of Canada’s recent decision.  So, if there are -- you 
      probably won’t recall in any event word for word what I told you about that 
      --- I’m sure you won’t --- but anything that you do recall about what I 
      told you verbally, you should set it aside and rather take the definition 
      and instructions as you now have them in writing as being the correct one.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The transcript the jury was handed on the second day of trial made no 
  reference to “ordinary sense”.  It read as follows:</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE style=' you test the wall, not the brick.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p class=headingNUMBER style='margin-left:0pt;text-indent:0pt;line-height:normal'> 
  [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although this jury was warned of this correction on the second day of 
  the trial and given the transcript, it was not read to them at that time.  Instead, 
  at the end of the trial, a week later, the trial judge at the outset of his 
  instructions said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Members of the Jury, you have in your possession a transcript of my opening 
      remarks and of my instructions which I gave to you during the course of 
      the trial on certain types of evidence.  I do not believe it necessary to 
      repeat those comments.  You have them and have had the opportunity to read 
      them at will.  I instruct you, however, to start off your deliberations 
      by reading them again so that they will be fresh in your mind, particularly 
      as to the following:</p>
    <p>Your responsibility as sole judges of the facts;</p>
    <p>the need for you to be impartial;</p>
    <p>the burden of proof on the Crown and the presumption of innocence;</p>
    <p>and the approach of weighing testimony of witnesses.</p>
    <p>Because I am not repeating to you all of the instructions I have given 
      you in writing during the course of this trial, nonetheless they form an 
      essential part of my charge, and consequently again I ask you to do as I 
      have instructed you, start off by reading them.</p>
    <p>However, there is one change to my instructions on Reasonable Doubt, and 
      that change is that you must be sure of the guilt of the accused as opposed 
      to feeling sure.  So that my instructions on that point as corrected now 
      read as follows, and I propose to read them to you.</p>
    <p>In a criminal case, the accused is presumed to be innocent until the crown 
      has proven his guilt to you beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Crown must prove 
      the guilt of the accused as I have said beyond a reasonable doubt, not on 
      a mere balance of probabilities.</p>
    <p>Therefore, if you believe the accused is probably guilty or likely guilty, 
      that is not sufficient.  In those circumstances you must give the benefit 
      of the doubt to the accused and acquit because the Crown has failed to satisfy 
      you of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
    <p>What is meant by proof beyond a reasonable doubt? It is very seldom in 
      the conduct of human affairs, or in judging what is in a person’s mind, 
      that we can achieve absolute certainty.  That is why the Crown is only required 
      to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  It is based on reason and common 
      sense, and is logically derived from the evidence, not sympathy or prejudice.</p>
    <p>Proof beyond a reasonable doubt has been achieved when you as a juror are 
      sure of the guilt of the accused.  It is a real doubt, an honest doubt, 
      and not one resulting from a stretch of your imagination, as for instance 
      might be used by an irresponsible juror who wishes to avoid his duty.  It 
      is simply a question of being sure of the guilt of the accused.</p>
    <p>And it is a doubt which arises after a consideration of all of the evidence.  
      You must not make a compartmentalized and isolated analysis of each strand 
      of the evidence.  You must not break up the evidence into separate pieces, 
      but you must look at the total body of the evidence.  Look at its total 
      and cumulative effect and ask yourselves, are you sure of the guilt of the 
      accused?  You test the rope, not the strand; you test the wall, not the 
      brick.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=Style1 style='line-height:normal'>He then went on to deal with the nine 
  counts on a count by count basis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, this was sufficient to correct any error that might have 
  been made in the trial judge’s instructions given on the first day of the trial.  
  It has not been suggested that there is any reason to believe that the members 
  of the jury did not follow those instructions and read or re-read the charge 
  respecting proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Accordingly, there is no merit 
  in the submissions of the appellant that the jury was never properly completely 
  instructed in a comprehensible manner on proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also argued that the trial judge erred in his final instructions 
  in dealing with the victim’s motivation in that, by implication, an onus was 
  cast upon the appellant to explain why the complainant would fabricate her account.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span

  </span> Motivation is, of course, not part of the Crown’s case, but the trial 
  judge instructed the jury on the subject because it was raised by the appellant’s 
  counsel in his closing address to the jury when he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>You also have to look at what is the motivation of the witnesses to testify.  
      Why are they here?  What is in it for them?</p>
    <p>Now, why should O. lie about that?  </p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The part of the charge complained of is as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The matter of motivation for T. is of crucial importance in this matter 
      and you will have to deal with that aspect of the problem, although you 
      do not have to resolve it.  Why would she make those complaints, whether 
      they are true or not, obviously, and if they are not true, why would she 
      make them?  In answering that question, you are entitled to look at all 
      of the evidence of the witnesses, not only the statements made but the conduct 
      of the complainant at the time.  You may seek evidence of consistencies 
      or inconsistencies with her testimony here in court in the manner I described 
      to you in my earlier written instructions, in order to assist you in  arriving 
      at whether or not she is telling the truth.  Both counsel have dealt extensively 
      with this.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The instruction referred to at the end of this passage occurred on the first 
  day of trial and consists of the usual instructions given with respect to witnesses 
  in general.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, nothing in any of the foregoing gives rise to any suggestion 
  of an onus being cast upon the appellant nor does it invite the jury to conclude 
  that unless the appellant explained why the complainant would complain as she 
  did, that she should be believed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also complained that the trial judge failed to instruct 
  the jury not to discuss the case until all the evidence was in, the addresses 
  made and the instructions given.  In fact, it was argued that the jurors were 
  positively encouraged to discuss this case from the outset but it is not suggested 
  that the appellant was disadvantaged by this course of conduct.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did not in fact give any specific instruction with respect 
  to the time for discussion.  In his opening remarks on the first day he outlined 
  the trial process, concluding with the statement that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>After I have completed my charge, then that part of your task which is 
      the most difficult begins, for you must then consider your deliberations 
      and render your verdict.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Several pages later, after telling the jury the hours during which the 
  court would sit, he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>You may if you wish elect a president immediately who will preside over 
      your deliberations.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Still later he said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I will also during the course of the trial give you certain instructions 
      or rulings that I make depending on the evidential problems that are raised.  
      I will make available to you transcripts of those rulings.  Again you will 
      have these ruling in your possession.  You will be able to read them, consider 
      them and discuss them amongst yourselves.  If you have any problems understanding 
      either part of my opening remarks or my rulings, please let me know during 
      the course of the trial.  I will attempt to deal with it.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The appellant argues that these passages encourage discussion of the evidence 
  throughout the trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Still later the trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>During the course of the trial or particularly during your deliberations, 
      do not give more weight to any written notes that you may have as opposed 
      to the collective view of all of the other members of the jury, because 
      anyone of us can be mistaken as to the notes we take.</p>
    <p>. . . . .</p>
    <p>Having said that, if at the conclusion of trial when you start your deliberations 
      there is a real difference of opinion as to what a witness has said, there 
      are ways of dealing with that.  I say that bearing in mind that one or all 
      of you may have taken notes.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These passages suggest a distinction between “the course of the trial” 
  and “your deliberations”.  While it would have been preferable for the trial 
  judge to give a specific instruction not to discuss the case until the deliberation 
  stage, we do not accept the submission that the jury was invited to conduct 
  mid-trial deliberations.  It was made clear to the jury at the end of the case 
  that they were to consider all the evidence as a whole and to decide the case 
  on that basis.  We see no prejudice to the appellant arising from these instructions 
  read as a whole.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant also argued that he had been prejudiced by the reception 
  into evidence of two pieces of inadmissible evidence.  Each was followed by 
  a ruling instructing the jury to disregard the evidence in question.  It was 
  further argued that that prejudice was aggravated first by the delay in making 
  the ruling and then by the jury being provided with transcripts summarizing 
  the inadmissible evidence, thus providing additional emphasis and prejudice.  
  The trial judge told the jury that the evidence in question was inadmissible 
  and must be disregarded.  The fact that the jury got it in print was a consequence 
  of the trial judge’s practice of providing transcripts of his instructions.  
  In order to instruct the jury properly, the trial judge was required to identify 
  the evidence to which objection was taken.  We agree with the trial judge that 
  in the circumstances, an instruction to the jury would be sufficient, provided 
  it was given as promptly as possible, as was the case here.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In her factum, counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge 
  erred in not fairly putting to the jury the position of the defence.  This is 
  frequently the complaint when the defendant does not testify, as in this case.  
  In fairness, it should be pointed out that the case turned on the complainant’s 
  credibility.  The defence strategy involved attacking that credibility by cross-examining 
  her and calling witnesses who contradicted her evidence and gave evidence as 
  to her demeanour following the offences in September 1997.  On review, the trial 
  judge accurately and fairly put the defence position to the jury.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant argues that because Dr. Jacqueline Marie Parker was not 
  properly qualified as an expert the trial judge erred in admitting her opinion 
  to the effect that the complainant’s injuries were consistent with forcible 
  intercourse.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dr. Parker obtained her medical degree in England in 1981 and was licensed 
  to practice general medicine in Ontario in 1984.  In September 1997, she was 
  working in the Sexual Assault Treatment Centre of Riverside Hospital in Ottawa.  
  She examined the complainant gynecologically approximately thirty-six hours 
  after the alleged sexual assault.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> She reported that the clitoris was swollen, there was some swelling 
  of the introitus and some abrasions of the posterior fourchette.  Internally, 
  there were two contused red areas on the cervix.  It was Dr. Parker’s view that 
  for the significant amount of swelling to be still present thirty-six hours 
  after the event a fair degree of force had been used at the time.  She agreed 
  that the injuries would be consistent with forcible intercourse.  She stated 
  that the two contused areas on the cervix were consistent with a penetration 
  injury, that injury to the cervix is very uncommon because the cervix is to 
  two to four inches inside the vagina.  Finger nails could cause the abrasions 
  she saw on the cervix.  It would be unlikely for a woman to inflict such an 
  injury upon herself because of the position she would have to get herself into.  
  This latter opinion was produced on cross-examination. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although no voir dire was held to review Dr. Parker’s qualifications, 
  her experience in the Sexual Assault Treatment Centre would almost certainly 
  qualify her to give the evidence she gave.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the alternative, the appellant argues that the trial judge erred 
  in failing to caution the jury with respect to the impermissible use of the 
  expert evidence in relation to the complainant’s credibility.  No such caution 
  was given but on the other hand Dr. Parker was not classified as an expert in 
  the trial judge’s instructions.  The only reference to her was in setting out 
  the appellant’s position.  The trial judge said “finally he (the appellant) 
  questions the impartiality of Dr. Parker, as well as the validity of her conclusion”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As the respondent’s counsel noted in her factum “the significance of 
  Dr. Parker’s evidence lay not with her opinions but with her observations of 
  the injured genitalia.  With this admissible evidence alone, the jury had very 
  strong confirmatory evidence of a sexual assault.”  We see no error in the treatment 
  of the evidence of Dr. Parker.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Anne Wilson, the complainant’s counsellor, testified that in the spring 
  of 1997, the complainant told her that the appellant had assaulted her although 
  that precise word was not used.  The appellant objected to this evidence upon 
  the ground that it was a prior consistent statement.  The statement, however, 
  was part of the narrative required to demonstrate the significance of a statement 
  against interest by the appellant, who attended the counselling session, to 
  the effect that “it wouldn’t happen again”.  No objection was made to this evidence 
  at the time it was received.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Appellant’s counsel objected to the admission of bad character evidence 
  respecting her client.  In examination-in-chief, the complainant was asked whether 
  she know anything of the appellant’s “background” and whether this had any effect 
  or impact on her relationship with him.  She responded that although she did 
  know about his “background”, she “did not judge him”.  She testified that from 
  the beginning, she had always hoped that he would change, and he had done so 
  for “very brief periods”’ but could not follow through on anything.  In addition, 
  evidence was introduced at trial that at the time of his arrest in November, 
  1996, the appellant was on probation in relation to charges of trafficking a 
  narcotic, failure to comply with a probation order and possession of a narcotic.  
  Evidence also was introduced that on August 5, 1997, the appellant was arrested 
  on a breach of undertaking charge as a result of leaving threatening messages 
  on Ms. T.’s answering machine, specifically that he was going to “kick down 
  her door”.  Ms. T. advised the court that the appellant pleaded guilty to this 
  charge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Looking at these complaints in context we see no significant error in 
  the admission of this evidence.  Four of the charges were for breach of probation 
  and breach of undertaking.  The probation order and the undertaking order were 
  in the hands of the jury.  The probation order indicated that the appellant 
  had been in prison for three months, that he was on probation for another three 
  years, that he was to abstain from the possession or consumption of alcohol 
  or drugs, that he was required to attend for treatment assessment and counselling 
  as might be prescribed by his probation officer and that he was not to associate 
  with persons in the drug trade.  The undertaking told them that he was not to 
  communicate or associate with the complainant.  The jury knew as well that he 
  was pleading guilty to the charges of breach of probation and breach of undertaking.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It was against that background that the complainant testified as to 
  her relationship with the appellant.  The evidence now complained of was necessary 
  to explain her state of mind at the time the events complained of took place.  
  It is significant that no objection was raised during the trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s position is that the trial judge erred in refusing to 
  declare a mistrial because of a combination of matters, the reception of inadmissible 
  evidence from Constable Sweet and Dr. Hauser and improper remarks by Crown counsel 
  in her address to the jury.  Constable Sweet testified that in September,&nbsp;1997, 
  while working with the identification unit, the appellant read the charges against 
  himself, as listed on the booking sheet.  While reading the sheet, the appellant 
  said “how can you sexually assault you own woman?”.  Constable Sweet testified 
  that the appellant seemed to be in disbelief that he could be charged with this 
  type of an offence and that in his (Constable Sweet’s) opinion, this comment 
  was said more as a statement, in the rhetorical sense, rather than the appellant 
  looking for an answer.  Constable Sweet further testified that he was personally 
  “disgusted with that type of tone as well as obviously when he said ‘your own 
  woman’, placing ownership”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On this same day, Dr. Hauser testified that on November&nbsp;10, 1996, 
  Ms. T. attended his office complaining of pain to her face.  She advised him 
  that she “had been hit by her boyfriend twelve times, since separated, and was 
  concerned about retribution if she lays charges because her boyfriend was a 
  member of some gang”.  Defence counsel immediately objected to this evidence, 
  specifically the evidence that the appellant was a “member of some gang”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The mistrial application was denied.  The trial judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>As to the Sweet’s matter, I have no problems about that at all.  The first 
      part is admissible as to the intonation of the voice&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;but 
      the second part is clearly inadmissible.  It is a statement of his opinion, 
      and it is a statement not only of his opinion, it is statement of his values&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp; 
      It doesn’t go to the guilt or the innocence of the accused. It goes to the 
      values of this officer vis-à-vis that type of comment, and I don’t think 
      there is much prejudice from that really, providing that they are given 
      some instructions that they are not to take it into account.  Quite frankly, 
      I would think that a jury will have no problems in disregarding that comment 
      as being expressive of a statement of values on the part of the officer 
      and as well being inadmissible as being an opinion of the officer on that.  
      So, certainly on that basis of Sweet’s evidence, I will give them instructions, 
      and I think that will more than be adequate to satisfy the requirements”.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Style2 style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge then instructed the 
  jury that due to the fact that Constable Sweet put his own values on that statement, 
  which he was not entitled to do, they were to entirely disregard that comment.  
  He stated to the jury that: “it was unfortunate and ought not to have been made”.  
  In denying the application as to the evidence of Dr. Hauser, the trial judge 
  stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I think that the statement as it comes forth from the doctor is clearly 
      inadmissible as being hearsay evidence, and whilst it is prejudicial, I 
      think that under these circumstances because it is so clearly hearsay, and 
      in view of the fact that the witness, the complainant wasn’t even questioned 
      about that, I think that the prejudice will be removed by proper instruction 
      to the jury.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Style1 style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge then instructed the 
  jury that the statement “she told me she had been hit by her boyfriend twelve 
  times and since separated” was admissible because the complainant was questioned 
  and testified to it, and that her statement was consistent with that of Dr. 
  Hauser.  He further instructed them that the second part, i.e. that “she was 
  concerned about retribution if she lays charges because her boyfriend was a 
  member of some gang”, was hearsay evidence and was therefore inadmissible.  
  He instructed the jury to only disregard the second part of Dr. Hauser’s evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Following Crown counsel’s submission that, in her opinion, the entire 
  statement was inadmissible, the trial judge further recharged the jury, instructing 
  them that the entire answer of Dr. Hauser was inadmissible because it was hearsay 
  and not to give it any weight.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At the conclusion of the Crown’s address to the jury, defence counsel 
  objected that portions of the address were inflammatory, specifically the last 
  fifteen minutes of the forty minute address.  Defence counsel once again applied 
  for a mistrial, relying specifically on the following portions of the Crown’s 
  address:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (i) It [the hole in the wall] is absolutely confirmatory of his [the appellant’s] 
      aggression, and I would suggest to you that if anyone of you had been the 
      focus of that degree of aggression, you would have been terrified;</p>
    <p> (ii) He [defence counsel] has suggested very strongly to you that her 
      [the complainant’s] failure to do [to escape] that casts doubt on her whole 
      story . . . It may be that she could have asked for help and it may be that 
      somebody would have helped her, but <i>put yourself in her position</i>.  
      If you thought that if you tried to leave or if you tried to ask for help, 
      that you would be hurt again, and you had been hurt enough, would you try 
      to leave?  If you were thinking that the accused would catch you and kill 
      you and not even remember having done it because he was so drunk, would 
      you try to leave? [emphasis added];</p>
    <p> (iii) We have to put ourselves in O.’s shoes.  We have to ask ourselves 
      whether given the same circumstances, the same history, whether we would 
      have acted totally rationally; and</p>
    <p> (iv) Is it not possible that we might not have seen the avenues of escape 
      that offered themselves, because we were too exhausted, too obsessed with 
      our pain or our humiliation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A trial judge has the discretion to declare a mistrial after inadmissible 
  evidence or an inflammatory address is put to the jury.  The trial judge here 
  stated that he agreed with the position of defence counsel, but felt that the 
  situation could be remedied by an appropriate instruction.  He then gave very 
  clear instructions to ignore the inadmissible evidence of Dr. Hauser and Constable 
  Sweet.  He gave these instructions close in time to when the jury heard this 
  evidence and did not wait until the end of the trial.  Although the trial judge 
  found the remarks by Crown counsel to be improper, he described the “transgression” 
  as “not a major one”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In dealing with the remarks of Crown counsel the trial judge instructed 
  the jury as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The test is not what you would have done in her place; or would you not 
      have been terrified in her shoes.  Counsel for the Crown, in dealing with 
      this aspect of the evidence, put it to you on several occasions, “What would 
      you have done in her place or her shoes”?  This was improper and should 
      not have been put to you in this manner.  I repeat, that is not the test.  
      That is not the question you must ask yourselves.  Rather, it is: “Does 
      testimony of that witness, T., make sense, is it consistent with itself 
      and other facts as you find them, is it credible, and finally do you believe 
      her?”  This may not have been at all what you would have felt or done.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the trial judge’s instructions were sufficient to overcome 
  any prejudice to the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, we would not give effect to any of the grounds advanced 
  and would dismiss the appeal against conviction.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As to sentence, the appellant was sentenced to a total of six years 
  imprisonment: one and a half years for assault causing bodily harm, four and 
  a half years consecutive for sexual assault, thirty days concurrent on all but 
  one of the counts of breach of probation, breach of undertaking, mischief and 
  forcible confinement and two years concurrent on the remaining count of breach 
  of undertaking.  He was also prohibited from the possession of weapons pursuant 
  to s. 100 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for a minimum of ten years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The position of the appellant at trial was that, after giving credit 
  for ninety days pre-trial time served, a sentence of one year on the assault 
  causing bodily harm and a global sentence of two years for the other offences 
  would have been appropriate, for a total sentence of three years.  The Crown 
  sought a sentence of eight to ten years imprisonment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is argued that the ultimate sentence of six years was excessive having 
  regard to all the circumstances.  The appellant had a substantial record beginning 
  in 1985 but his longest previous sentence was two years in the reformatory.  
  There was no indication that his pre-trial time had been taken into account.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the sentence was entirely appropriate.  The offences were 
  committed in breach of probation and undertakings commencing upon the very day 
  of the appellant’s release from prison.  They involved serious breaches of trust 
  in the context of an intimate relationship and were both violent and degrading.
