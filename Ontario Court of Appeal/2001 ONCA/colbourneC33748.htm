  </span> The trial was lengthy and many issues were litigated.  The appeal, however, 
  focuses on the admissibility of the results of a blood/alcohol analysis performed 
  by the Centre of Forensic Sciences on a sample of the appellant’s blood seized 
  from the Georgetown Hospital under the authority of a search warrant.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"><span> 
  [2] </span></a>  The appellant contends that the warrant was invalid.  He also 
  submits that on the <i>voir dire</i> to determine the validity of the warrant, 
  the trial judge improperly held that the prosecuting attorney could not be called 
  as a witness. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span

  </span> A summary of the evidence relied on by the trial judge in making his 
  findings of fact will provide the backdrop necessary to understand the issues 
  raised on this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was driving his truck southbound on a two lane highway 
  at about 7:15 p.m. on September 1<sup>st</sup>, 1996.  The road was dry and 
  flat, the weather was clear, and the driving conditions were ideal.  The appellant’s 
  friend, Owen Budgell, was seated in the front passenger seat.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant, driving in excess of the speed limit of 80 km per hour, 
  drove up behind another southbound vehicle and tailgated that vehicle for some 
  distance.  Both cars were travelling at the speed limit.  Suddenly, and for 
  no apparent reason, the appellant’s truck veered into the northbound lane, over 
  the gravel shoulder on the east side of the road, and across the ditch.  The 
  truck became airborne and struck a tree.  Mr. Budgell was killed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Police Constable Henry, the principal investigating officer, attended 
  at the scene about one half hour after the accident.  The appellant was receiving 
  medical attention.  Constable Henry detected a strong odour of alcohol on the 
  appellant’s breath.  He also observed that the appellant’s face was red and 
  flushed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry asked a number of people at the scene whether they also 
  smelled alcohol on the appellant’s breath.  No one questioned by Constable Henry 
  smelled alcohol on the appellant’s breath.  A paramedic testified at trial that 
  he noticed a smell of “something like alcohol” when he removed the appellant’s 
  oxygen mask at the hospital.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was taken by ambulance to the Georgetown Hospital.  He 
  was conscious.  Samples of his blood were taken with his consent for medical 
  purposes.  Constable Henry became aware that blood samples had been taken.  
  After an attempt to obtain a breathalyzer sample was aborted on the mistaken 
  belief that the <i>Criminal Code</i> did not authorize the taking of the sample, 
  Constable Henry was directed by a superior to place a seal on one of the appellant’s 
  blood samples to preserve continuity should the police decide to seize the sample.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A blood sample was eventually seized from the hospital 6 days later 
  pursuant to a search warrant obtained by Constable Henry.  At trial, it was 
  argued that the Crown had not established that the blood sample seized from 
  the hospital came from the appellant and that the Crown had not established 
  the “integrity” of the sample seized.  The trial judge found against the appellant 
  on both issues and neither finding is challenged on appeal.  The appeal proceeded 
  on the basis that the blood seized from the hospital was the appellant’s blood 
  and that the blood/alcohol levels found in the analysis relied on by the Crown 
  were accurate.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to the results of the analysis of the appellant’s blood and 
  the expert evidence interpreting those results, the appellant’s blood/alcohol 
  level at the time of the accident was between 232 and 255 milligrams of alcohol 
  in 100 millilitres of blood.  The expert testified that at those very high levels 
  (about three times the legal limit), a person’s vision, perception, judgment 
  and reaction time would all be impaired.  Notwithstanding this physical impairment, 
  that same person might show few outward signs of impairment if he or she had 
  a high tolerance for alcohol.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant did not testify.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge, after a careful and thorough review of the evidence, 
  summarized his findings of fact in these words:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is no evidence why this accident occurred, other than the driving 
      of Mr. Colbourne.  In addition, from the impact on the tree, I can infer 
      the truck was still travelling at a high rate of speed when it impacted 
      against that tree, some distance off the road.  There is evidence of bad 
      driving.  The physical symptoms are minimal:  blood shot eyes, odour of 
      alcohol and flushed face.  But, I also have the blood/alcohol concentration 
      to consider.  Having found the samples admissible and that it was Mr. Colbourne’s 
      blood, the expert evidence, in addition to the above noted factors, satisfies 
      me beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Colbourne’s ability to operate a motor 
      vehicle was impaired by alcohol.</p>

<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>(i) The events at the hospital </b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was taken to the Emergency Department at the Georgetown 
  Hospital at about 8:00 p.m. on September 1<sup>st</sup>.  He was conscious and 
  breathing on his own with the assistance of an oxygen mask.  At about 8:15 p.m., 
  the attending physician instructed Jane Cartwright, a hospital technician, to 
  take samples of blood from the appellant.  The appellant agreed that Ms. Cartwright 
  could take the samples.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3"><span> [3] </span></a>  The trial judge found that the 
  samples were taken by hospital personnel for medical purposes only and without 
  any police involvement.  That finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>  Shortly after the samples were taken, Constable Henry arrived at the 
    hospital. He was told by the attending 
    physician that the appellant was conscious and could provide a breath sample. 
     Constable Henry took this as an indication from the doctor that he 
    could speak with the appellant. Constable Henry spoke briefly with the appellant 
    and confirmed the observations he had made earlier concerning the appellant’s 
    consumption of alcohol. He placed 
    the appellant under arrest.<span class="headingNUMBER1" style="line-height:normal"><a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref5"><span> [4]</span></a></span><span>  
    </span>Henry next read the appellant his rights to counsel and asked him whether 
    he understood those rights.<span>  </span>The appellant asked that his oxygen 
    mask be removed.<span>  </span>The attending physician then told Constable 
    Henry that further medical treatment was necessary and he asked Henry to stop 
    questioning the appellant.<span>  </span>Henry did so, but remained in the 
    Emergency area in the immediate vicinity of the appellant.<span>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At about 8:50 p.m., Constable Henry asked Ms. Cartwright to provide 
  him with a sample of the appellant’s blood.  She refused.  He then asked her 
  to be careful with the samples she had taken as they may be needed for investigative 
  purposes.<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5"><span> [5] </span></a>  At about 9:30 p.m., the breathalyzer 
  technician decided that under the law as he understood it, he could not demand 
  a breathalyzer sample from the appellant.  Once a breathalyzer was no longer 
  an option, the potential seizure of the blood sample became a very real possibility.  
  Sergeant Brandt told Constable Henry to place a police seal on the vial containing 
  the sample of the appellant’s blood which had been taken earlier that evening.  
  Ms. Cartwright allowed Constable Henry to mark one of the vials.  She had done 
  this many times in the past.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"><span> 
  [6] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant was allowed to leave the hospital and go home with his 
  wife of about 10:20 p.m.  He was no longer under arrest and was not formally 
  charged that evening.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry also testified that at some unspecified time on the 
  evening of September 1<sup>st</sup>, he overheard hospital personnel talking 
  about the test results of a blood sample which showed the presence of alcohol 
  in the blood.  Constable Henry took this to be a reference to the appellant’s 
  blood.  He could not recall where he was in the hospital when he overheard this 
  conversation or who made the comment.  Constable Henry recalled a reference 
  to a figure in the range of 50 to 57.  This number apparently referred to a 
  measurement in millimoles.  Constable Henry did not know how much alcohol that 
  figure represented, but took the comment as some verification of his opinion 
  that the appellant had consumed alcohol.  Constable Henry made no notes of this 
  comment and did not tell anyone about it until September 6<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>(ii) The search warrant applications</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry made two applications for a warrant to seize samples 
  of the appellant’s blood held at the Georgetown Hospital.  He made the first 
  application on September 3<sup>rd</sup>.  That application was refused.  He 
  made a second application before a different Justice of the Peace on September 
  6<sup>th</sup>.  A warrant was issued on that date and subsequently executed 
  at the Georgetown Hospital.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The facts surrounding the applications for the search warrant and the 
  intervening events were hotly disputed at trial.  The trial judge’s findings 
  of fact turned in large measure on his assessment of the credibility and reliability 
  of Constable Henry’s testimony.  Constable Henry was inexperienced and it showed.  
  This was his first fatal accident investigation and his first application for 
  a search warrant.  He did not understand the authority given to him under the 
  <i>Code</i> to make a breath demand and he did not appreciate the constituent 
  elements of a proper arrest.  Constable Henry’s memory was not good and his 
  notes were inadequate.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge was aware of these shortcomings.  His assessment of 
  Henry’s credibility and reliability is found in the following passage from his 
  judgment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>At the outset, I will deal with the credibility of Police Constable Henry 
      which was placed in issue by the applicant.  There is no dispute that he 
      was a relatively inexperienced officer as of September 1<sup>st</sup> 1996.  
      Similarly, there was no dispute that this was his first fatal motor vehicle 
      accident he had investigated and the first search warrant he had applied 
      for.  I agree that he had a poor recollection of many of the events which 
      likely is reflective of inadequate note-taking.  His evidence was wanting 
      in terms of precision and detail.  Too frequently his responses to the suggestion 
      made in cross-examination were, “it was possible” that a certain thing occurred.  
      He could hardly be described as a seasoned witness.  Too often the language 
      was loose as he attempted to explain events.  Having said that, however, 
      having observed his demeanour in the witness box and upon reviewing his 
      evidence, I am not prepared to say that he lied under oath before me.  In 
      general, I found his evidence to be credible but lacking in precision.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant does not suggest that this court should interfere 
  with the trial judge’s assessment of Constable Henry’s evidence.  I accept that 
  assessment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry prepared the information in support of the first request 
  for a search warrant on his own.  He used a pre-printed form and was unaware 
  of the practice of attaching appendices to the pre-printed form which, among 
  other things, set out the informant’s reasonable and probable grounds for believing 
  that the material to be seized would afford evidence of the commission of a 
  criminal offence.  Constable Henry put his grounds for believing that the appellant’s 
  blood could afford evidence of the commission of a crime in the one-inch space 
  provided in the pre-printed form.  He could not recall exactly what he put in 
  that small space.  The information sworn by Constable Henry on the first application 
  was destroyed or lost prior to disclosure and was never available to the defence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Justice of the Peace refused to issue the warrant.  Constable Henry 
  understood that her refusal was based on the lack of detail in the information.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry went to the Crown Attorney’s office after the Justice 
  of the Peace refused to issue the warrant.  He spoke first with Mr. MacKinnon, 
  an assistant Crown Attorney, and later with Mr. MacKinnon and Mr. O’Marra, the 
  senior Crown Attorney.  Mr. MacKinnon, who eventually assumed carriage of the 
  prosecution, and Constable Henry spoke with the Justice of the Peace who had 
  refused to issue the warrant.  Mr. MacKinnon and Constable Henry then spoke 
  again with Mr. O’Marra.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry was sure that these discussions were about the obtaining 
  of a warrant and the reasons why the warrant was refused.  He had very little 
  recollection, however, of the specifics of any of the discussions.  He testified:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The best I can do is sum up the day.  The impression I got was to – instead 
      of just having the one sentence synopsis or appendices in each area of the 
      warrant, the information to obtain, it’s best for me to include as much 
      detail as possible when obtaining the warrant.  That’s the information I 
      got from the whole day.  I can’t say exactly what happened or what was spoken 
      in that second meeting.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry was not scheduled to work on September 4<sup>th</sup> 
  and 5<sup>th</sup>.  By September 6<sup>th</sup>, he had decided to prepare 
  a new information and make a second application for a search warrant.  He had 
  been told by MacKinnon and other more experienced police officers that he should 
  put more detail in the second application.  He was told about the practice of 
  using appendices to set out in detail the grounds upon which the warrant was 
  requested.  Constable Henry anticipated that he would make his second application 
  for a search warrant before the same Justice of the Peace who had refused the 
  warrant on the first application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On September 6<sup>th</sup> Constable Henry met with Mr. MacKinnon to 
  discuss his information to obtain a search warrant.  Constable Henry had little 
  recollection of the specifics of this conversation.  He did recall, however, 
  that he told Mr. MacKinnon about the conversation he overheard in the hospital 
  which he took to be a reference to a blood/alcohol level in the appellant’s 
  blood sample.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After speaking with Mr. MacKinnon, Constable Henry prepared a second 
  information to obtain a search warrant.  That information was filed on the motion 
  to exclude the evidence of the analysis of the blood seized from the Georgetown 
  Hospital.  The information had three appendices attached to the pre-printed 
  form.  Appendix “A” described the items to be seized (blood samples of the appellant 
  held at the Georgetown Hospital). Appendix “B” set out the criminal offences 
  with respect to which the evidence was sought (impaired driving causing death, 
  dangerous driving).  Appendix “C” set out the grounds for Constable Henry’s 
  belief that the blood samples would afford evidence of the commission of the 
  crimes described in Appendix “B”.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In addition to the information described above, Appendix “C” also contained 
  the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>On one occasion when PC Henry was passing through the Emergency area he 
      overheard the hospital staff and Laboratory Technician indicating that the 
      alcohol in Mr. Colbourne’s blood to be in the 50 range (possibly 54 to 57).  
      This reinforced PC Henry’s opinion that he had alcohol in his body.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although Constable Henry fully intended to make his second application 
  before the Justice of the Peace who had refused the first application, the Justice 
  of the Peace office at the courthouse was closed by the time Constable Henry 
  had completed the necessary documentation on September 6th.  He was told that 
  a Justice of the Peace was available at a nearby correctional institution.  
  Constable Henry attended before that Justice of the Peace to make his second 
  application.  This Justice of the Peace was not the same person who had refused 
  the first application.  The information sworn in support of the second application 
  for a search warrant made no reference to the initial refusal.  The Justice 
  of the Peace who granted the search warrant on September 6<sup>th</sup> was 
  not aware that another Justice of the Peace had refused to issue a search warrant 
  three days earlier.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Constable Henry executed the search warrant and seized a vial of the 
  appellant’s blood from the Georgetown Hospital.  Ms. Cartwright, who had drawn 
  the blood, gave the vial to Constable Henry.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge made several findings of fact, none of which can be 
  successfully challenged on appeal.  He found:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span style='font-family:

      </span></span> That the information presented on the second application 
      for a search warrant was significantly different from the information presented 
      on the first application.  The first information contained “one liners” 
      in the small space provided on the pre-printed form.  The second information 
      contained “far more detail” and related the grounds upon which Constable 
      Henry believed that the blood sample would provide evidence of the commission 
      of the offence of impaired driving causing death or dangerous driving.  
    </p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:

      </span></span> The additional information included, but was not limited 
      to, the conversation which Constable Henry said he had overheard in the 
      hospital to the effect that the blood sample contained alcohol.</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:

      </span></span> When preparing the second information, Constable Henry believed 
      that he would make his second application for a search warrant to the same 
      Justice of the Peace who had refused the first warrant.  He honestly, but 
      mistakenly, believed that it was not necessary to include reference to the 
      initial refusal in his second application for a search warrant.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge also concluded that although the disclosure by hospital 
  personnel to Constable Henry of information concerning the appellant’s blood/alcohol 
  level was inadvertent, and Constable Henry did not seek out that information, 
  its disclosure to him amounted to a breach of the duty of confidentiality owed 
  to the appellant by the hospital personnel.  The trial judge found that when 
  Constable Henry received that information, the appellant’s rights under s. 8 
  of the <i>Charter</i> were breached.  He excised that comment from the information 
  relied on to obtain the warrant before deciding on the validity of the warrant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On appeal, the Crown argued that the trial judge was wrong in holding 
  that the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> were breached when 
  Constable Henry inadvertently overheard the conversation concerning the appellant’s 
  blood/alcohol level.  It is unnecessary to decide this issue.  I will assume 
  the trial judge was correct and that the overheard conversation was properly 
  excised by him from the information relied on to obtain the warrant.</p>
<p style='text-align:justify;'><b>(iii)  The validity of the warrant</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I begin with an examination of the information relied on to obtain the 
  warrant apart from any allegations of fraud, non-disclosure, misleading disclosure 
  or new evidence.  In my view, even if the overheard reference to the blood/alcohol 
  level is excised, the facts relied on in the second information provided adequate 
  grounds for the issuing of a warrant to seize the vial of the appellant’s blood.  
  The description of the appellant’s driving immediately before the accident, 
  the description of the accident itself, the absence of any apparent “innocent” 
  explanation for the accident, and Constable Henry’s observations of the appellant 
  at the scene provided a basis upon which a Justice of the Peace acting judicially 
  could grant the warrant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I next consider the accuracy of the facts as set out in the information.  
  At trial it was argued that the description of the appellant’s vehicle as approaching 
  another vehicle “at a high rate of speed” was false or at least inaccurate.  
  That argument was not pressed on appeal.  In my view, there is no significant 
  difference between the description of the vehicle as travelling at a high rate 
  of speed and the witness’s indication that the vehicle was travelling in excess 
  of the speed limit.  In my view, none of the material allegations in the information 
  was false or materially inaccurate.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s main arguments turn on allegations of non-disclosure 
  of material facts in the information used to obtain the warrant.  The appellant 
  submits that Constable Henry’s failure to disclose to the second Justice of 
  the Peace that another Justice of the Peace had refused to issue a warrant constituted 
  material non-disclosure.  Crown counsel acknowledges that Constable Henry should 
  have made that disclosure.  He submits, however, that the failure to disclose 
  the earlier refusal does not automatically render the warrant invalid.  Counsel 
  for the appellant accepts this submission:  <i>R. v. Eng</i> (1995), 56 B.C.A.C. 
  18 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The reasons for and the nature of the non-disclosure of the prior refusal 
  are important considerations in determining the effect of that non-disclosure 
  on the validity of the warrant.  If the non-disclosure was for some improper 
  motive or was intended to mislead the Justice of the Peace before whom the second 
  application was made, that non-disclosure standing alone may well invalidate 
  the warrant despite the presence of reasonable and probable grounds to issue 
  the warrant:  <i>R. v. Kesselring</i> (2000), 145 C.C.C. (3d) 119 at 127 (Ont. 
  C.A.);  <i>R. v. Morris</i> (1998), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 539 at 553 (N.S.C.A.);  
  <i>R. v. Araujo</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 473 (S.C.C.).  On the findings 
  of the trial judge, that is not this case.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Where the non-disclosure is not the product of an improper motive or 
  part of an attempt to mislead the Justice of the Peace, the question becomes 
  whether the second Justice of the Peace acting judicially and having been advised 
  of the prior refusal could have issued the search warrant.  I have no hesitation 
  in answering that question in the affirmative.  The trial judge found that the 
  information presented on the second application was substantially different 
  from the information presented on the first application.  The second information 
  contained a much more detailed description of the grounds upon which the warrant 
  was sought.  In these circumstances, disclosure of a prior refusal based on 
  a consideration of an entirely different information would not have precluded 
  the issuing of a warrant by the second Justice of the Peace.  In fact, given 
  the significant differences between the two informations, the first refusal 
  would have little relevance to how the Justice of the Peace exercised his discretion 
  on the second application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would observe that had the second information been the same as the 
  first information, the initial refusal would have played a much more significant 
  role in how the second Justice of the Peace exercised his or her discretion.  
  Indeed, in <i>R. v. Eng, supra</i>, at para. 49, Wood J.A. thought it improper 
  to make successive applications based on the same information.  As the information 
  in this case were very different, I need not decide whether I would go so far 
  as to say that two applications based on the same information are improper even 
  if full disclosure of the initial refusal is made.  I leave that question for 
  a case where it arises on the facts.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Counsel for the appellant also submits that there was non-disclosure 
  to the Justice of the Peace of certain exculpatory information known to Constable 
  Henry when he applied for the search warrant.  Counsel refers to three items:  
  the person driving the car in front of the appellant told Constable Henry that 
  the appellant did not appear to be driving dangerously immediately before the 
  accident;  no one at the scene of the accident other than Constable Henry noticed 
  the smell of alcohol on the appellant’s breath;  and Constable Henry did not 
  see any indicia of impairment other than the two he referred to in the information.  
  The last of these three items is not properly characterized as non-disclosure.  
  Constable Henry described the indicia of impairment that he observed.  It was 
  implicit that he did not observe any other indicia of impairment.  His failure 
  to specifically enumerate the things he did not see does not constitute non-disclosure.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge considered the other items said by the appellant to 
  constitute material non-disclosure.  He found that the failure to refer to these 
  items was not “fatal” to the validity of the warrant.  I agree.  The opinion 
  of the other driver that the appellant was not driving dangerously is of little 
  significance when considered in conjunction with her actual observations of 
  the appellant’s vehicle.  She saw the appellant’s vehicle speed up behind her, 
  follow her too closely, and for no apparent reason, travel across two lanes, 
  over a ditch and through the air into a tree.  These observations were included 
  in the information prepared by Constable Henry.  Similarly, the fact that others 
  did not smell alcohol on the appellant’s breath does not mean that Constable 
  Henry’s observations were unreliable.  Constable Henry was investigating the 
  accident and looking for signs of alcohol consumption.  Even if the Justice 
  of the Peace had been advised that others at the scene had not smelled alcohol, 
  he still, acting judicially, could have issued the search warrant.  The alleged 
  non-disclosure does not invalidate the warrant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that the warrant was valid 
  and that the seizure made under the auspices of that warrant did not violate 
  the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p class=headingblank style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'>III</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The final submission made by the appellant challenges the trial judge’s 
  ruling that Assistant Crown Attorney MacKinnon would not be required to give 
  evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> to determine the validity of the search warrant.  
  At trial, counsel argued that Mr. MacKinnon might have some recollection of 
  the contents of the first information.  Counsel submitted that as the differences, 
  if any, between the first and second informations were central to the attack 
  on the warrant, Mr. MacKinnon’s evidence was material.  Counsel for the appellant 
  at trial recognized that compelling the prosecuting attorney to testify was 
  an extraordinary step.  In addition to the materiality of Mr. MacKinnon’s evidence, 
  counsel relied on the prosecution’s loss or destruction of the first information 
  and Constable Henry’s very limited recollection of the contents of that information, 
  in support of his motion to compel Mr. MacKinnon to testify on the <i>voir dire</i>.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Trial counsel also submitted that Mr. MacKinnon might have some recollection 
  of the conversations he had with the Justice of the Peace and Constable Henry 
  on September 3<sup>rd</sup> and the conversation he had with Constable Henry 
  on September 6<sup>th</sup>.  Counsel submitted that this evidence could shed 
  light on Constable Henry’s veracity and the <i>bona fides</i> of his conduct 
  in obtaining the warrant without making disclosure of the earlier refusal.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In bringing this application at trial, counsel made it clear that the 
  defence was not impugning Mr. MacKinnon’s conduct or challenging his integrity.  
  In particular, defence counsel did not question the propriety of Mr. MacKinnon’s 
  speaking with the Justice of the Peace who had refused to issue the warrant.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The defence acknowledgement that it had no reason to question the conduct 
  or integrity of Mr. MacKinnon is a significant factor in considering the motion 
  to compel Mr. MacKinnon to testify on the <i>voir dire</i>.  To the extent that 
  he had relevant information to disclose and was bound to disclose it, there 
  is no suggestion that he failed to make that disclosure.  Therefore, the defence 
  contention that examination of Mr. MacKinnon could provide material evidence 
  as to contents of the first information or the various conversations involving 
  Mr. MacKinnon comes down to an assertion that under questioning Mr. MacKinnon 
  might recall information that he had not previously recalled, and had not therefore 
  disclosed to the defence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is certainly a possibility that under questioning, Mr. MacKinnon 
  might have recalled matters that he had not previously recalled.  But a possibility 
  is not enough to justify compelling any person to testify, much less compelling 
  prosecuting counsel to give evidence.  In <i>R. v. Harris</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 478 at 480 (Ont. C.A.), which both counsel accept as the controlling authority, 
  the court held:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>        In our view, it is not sufficient to sustain the subpoena that 
      the witness “may have” evidence material to the case.  The burden was on 
      the respondent to establish that Murphy [the prosecutor] was likely, or 
      to put it another way, would probably have evidence material to the issues 
      raised.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The court went on to observe at p. 480 that compelling a prosecuting 
  counsel to testify if he or she might have relevant evidence to give would countenance 
  what was in reality a “fishing expedition” that could significantly disrupt 
  the trial process.  It is well established that while a prosecuting counsel 
  (or defence counsel) is a compellable witness, he or she should only be compelled 
  to abandon the role of counsel and assume the role of witness in cases where 
  the proper administration of justice demands that counsel become a witness:  
  <i>R. v. Kyling</i>, [1996] Q.J. No. 1566 (Que. Sup. Ct.).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The position taken by the appellant at trial is on all fours with the 
  position rejected in <i>R. v. Harris, supra</i>.  Counsel had a hope, one might 
  even say a reasonable hope, that Mr. MacKinnon could shed some additional evidentiary 
  light on the relevant events.  Counsel could not, however, establish that it 
  was probable that Mr. MacKinnon could do so.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Whether considered from the perspective of the power to subpoena witnesses 
  contained in s. 699 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, or from the vantage point of 
  an accused’s right to make full answer and defence, I am satisfied that the 
  trial judge correctly held that prosecutor MacKinnon should not be compelled 
  to testify on the <i>voir dire</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On appeal Mr. Burstein advanced a variation on the argument made at 
  trial.  He accepted, for the purposes of his argument, that Mr. MacKinnon could 
  not give material evidence based on his recollection of the contents of the 
  first information or his recollection of the various conversations to which 
  he was a party on September 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup>.  Mr. Burstein 
  submitted, however, that Mr. MacKinnon might be able to give evidence that he 
  had an established practice which he followed in cases where police officers 
  sought his assistance after an initial request for a search warrant was refused.  
  Mr. Burstein suggested that it might be Mr. MacKinnon’s established practice 
  to instruct the officer that full disclosure of the first application had to 
  be made in the information sworn on the second application.  Mr. Burstein also 
  suggested that Mr. MacKinnon’s practice might also be to instruct the officer 
  that the first information had to be preserved so that full disclosure could 
  eventually be made to the defence.  Mr. Burstein went on to submit that if Mr. 
  MacKinnon had these practices, he could give evidence to that effect.  Were 
  he to do so, the trial judge might infer that although MacKinnon had no present 
  recollection of what he had said to Constable Henry, he had in fact followed 
  his established practice.  If the trial judge drew that inference, says Mr. 
  Burstein, it would put Constable Henry’s evidence in an entirely different light.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are two fundamental problems with this line of attack.  First, 
  it was not argued before the trial judge.  The determination of whether it is 
  probable that a person has material evidence to give involves an exercise of 
  the trial judge’s discretion.  I would not be disposed to hold that the trial 
  judge erred in the exercise of that discretion by declining to compel Mr. MacKinnon 
  to testify on grounds that were not argued before him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, Mr. Burstein’s argument is as speculative as that put forward 
  by trial counsel.  Mr. Burstein can put his position no higher than to claim 
  that Mr. MacKinnon may have had the practices outlined above.  As with the contention 
  made at trial, Mr. Burstein’s position falls below the requisite probability 
  standard.  </p>
<p class=headingblank style='text-align:justify;line-height:normal'>IV</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I am satisfied that the trial judge did not err in holding that Mr. 
  MacKinnon should not be required to testify, and that he correctly held that 
  there was no violation of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, it is not necessary for 
  me to address s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  I will, however, do so briefly.</p>

  </span> I agree with the trial judge’s characterization of the blood sample 
  as non-conscriptive evidence.  The sample was initially taken from the appellant 
  with his consent by hospital personnel for medical reasons.  The hospital personnel 
  were not acting on behalf of the police.  The police subsequently seized the 
  sample when it was in the possession of the hospital.  In my view, <i>R. v. 
  Colarusso</i> (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), controls.  Under that authority, 
  the blood sample is properly characterized as non-conscriptive evidence.  <i>R. 
  v. Stillman</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.), the authority relied on 
  by the appellant, speaks to the seizure of bodily substances from the person 
  of the accused by the state.  Nothing said in <i>R. v. Stillman, supra</i>, 
  detracts from the authority of <i>R. v. Colarusso, supra</i>.  Once it is accepted 
  that the evidence was non-conscriptive, it follows that its admission into evidence 
  would not adversely affect the fairness of the trial.  </p>

  </span> As I agree with the trial judge’s description of the evidence as non-conscriptive, 
  there is no basis upon which this court could interfere with the trial judge’s 
  balancing of the relevant factors and his ultimate determination that even if 
  the seizure of the sample violated s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, the appellant 
  had not established that the sample and the analysis of the sample should be 
  excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText> [1]  The trial judge also found the appellant 
    guilty of dangerous driving and driving with a blood alcohol level over the 
    legal limit.  The trial judge entered conditional stays on both of these charges.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn2> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText> [2]  The admissibility of hospital records 
    containing the results of blood/alcohol tests done by the hospital was also 
    challenged.  The admissibility of those records becomes important only if 
    the analysis done by the Centre of Forensic Sciences is excluded under s. 
    24(2) of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  As I would not exclude 
    that evidence, I need not consider the admissibility of the hospital records.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn3> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText> [3]  There was some uncertainty at trial 
    as to whether Ms. Cartwright took 2 or 4 samples.  The number of samples taken 
    is irrelevant for the purposes of the appeal.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn4> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText> [4]  The trial judge found Constable Henry 
    had reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the appellant on a charge of 
    impaired driving. </p>
</div>
<div id=ftn5> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText> [5]  It is unclear when Henry became aware 
    that samples had been taken.  It seems that the information came to him while 
    he was in the area of the hospital where the appellant was receiving treatment.  
    At trial it was argued that when Henry overheard that samples of blood had 
    been taken from the appellant, he unconstitutionally seized that information 
    from the appellant.  The trial judge rejected that argument and it is not 
    advanced on appeal.</p>
</div>
<div id=ftn6> 
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText> [6]  At trial it was argued that when 
    Henry placed a police seal on the vial, he effectively seized the blood.  
    The trial judge rejected this argument and it was not renewed on appeal.</p>
