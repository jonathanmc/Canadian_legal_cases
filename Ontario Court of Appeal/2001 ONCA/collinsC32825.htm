  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C.-46 arising out of the discharge 
  of his firearm and the killing of seven-year-old Christopher Noel. The appellant

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The young victim, Christopher, was camping for 
  the weekend by the side of Black Lake, also known as Spring Lake, in Northeastern 
  Ontario, with his father, two siblings and the appellant who was a family friend. 
  On Sunday, September 6, 1998, at around 5:00 p.m., the appellant discharged 
  five rounds from his firearm into the lake. Christopher, who was sitting on 
  a log, fishing by the side of the lake some 45 metres away, was hit by one of 
  the bullets. He suffered a single gunshot wound to the left upper chest region. 
  There was no dispute at trial that the bullet that hit Christopher was fired 
  by the appellant. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>After the shooting, Christopher’s father immediately 
  gathered his injured son and his two other children, and left in his truck to 
  get assistance. The appellant stayed behind to put the fire out. Mr. Noel drove 
  off frantically, stopped at the first house, but no one was home. He stopped 
  at the second and asked the occupant to call 911 and have the ambulance meet 
  him on the road. The ambulance did meet him and Christopher was brought to the 
  hospital in Sault Ste. Marie where, after resuscitation attempts were made, 
  he was pronounced dead. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown’s case against the appellant was based 
  primarily on the evidence of Christopher’s nine-year-old sister, Cindy, who 
  was by the lake with Christopher at the time of the shooting. She testified 
  that she saw the appellant across the lake aiming his rifle at a small fish 
  that her brother was holding at the end of his fishing line. She heard four 
  shots and a “plop” caused by a bullet in the water. She then saw that her brother 
  was bleeding from his neck area. Her father came rushing to her brother and 
  yelled to the appellant that Christopher was bleeding. She heard the appellant 
  say “I didn’t shoot that way”. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Statements made by the appellant to various 
  witnesses and to the police on the evening in question were also introduced 
  in evidence by the Crown. Leah McCormick and her cousin, Stanley McCormick, 
  testified that at about 6:50 p.m., they were returning in separate vehicles 
  from Mr. McCormick’s camp, with Ms. McCormick driving ahead, when they saw the 
  appellant come out of the bush, waving his arms. He asked for a ride to town 
  and said that “a kid had cut his leg with an axe”. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At about 7:30 p.m. that evening, the appellant 
  arrived at the house of a friend, Alexander Doucette. He came in and said he 
  was in trouble. He said he had shot a kid and didn’t know what to do, in particular 
  whether to call a lawyer or the police. The appellant said that the child had 
  been bleeding from the chest and mouth and that he didn’t know if he was alive. 
  One occupant of the Doucette household heard the appellant say that he was target 
  shooting in the water. Alexander Doucette then accompanied the appellant to 
  the appellant’s home. There, the appellant said that he had been shooting out 
  over the lake, that a bullet had ricocheted on a rock or something, and that 
  he had not seen the children swimming in the water. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At 8:13 p.m., the appellant called 911 and reported 
  that he had fired off a gun, aiming out into the lake and “one of the bullets 
  ricocheted, I guess out of the edge of the water, … and struck a little boy.”

      can you tell the parents? Just a fuckin’ freak accident, ricocheting like 
      that. I was teaching the kids today how to use a firearm safely and this 
      happens. The kids had no reason to be on the other side of the lake… I just 
      tossed a twig in the water and started to sight the rifle in with a few 
      shots when someone yelled “Christopher has been shot”. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown also relied on the evidence of Sergeant Jeffrey Barnes 
  of the Ontario Provincial Police, who was qualified by the court as an expert 
  in the handling and use of firearms, including the type used by the appellant. 
  Sgt. Barnes gave evidence about an experiment that he and his fellow officers 
  conducted at the site of the shooting on October 15, 1998. Sgt. Barnes set up 
  a rifle on a tripod at the approximate location where the appellant would have 
  been standing at the time of shooting. The appellant’s approximate location 
  was determined according to witnesses’ statements and shell casings found at 
  the scene. Using the rifle belonging to the appellant, Sgt. Barnes fired sixteen 
  shots aiming in the water at various distances in front of the spot where Christopher 
  was positioned  All but one of the bullets struck a large target placed in the 
  area where Christopher was sitting. One bullet missed the target entirely. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A videotape of the experiment was played for 
  the jury. It showed an unobstructed view from the location where the appellant 
  had been standing to the location where Christopher was sitting on a log some 
  45 metres away. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified at trial. He stated 
  that he threw a stick in the water as far as he could into the lake and then 
  fired five rounds at the stick. He explained that he never saw the children 
  on the side of the lake. When asked by his counsel whether he had any idea why 
  he would not have seen Christopher, he answered “Cause I really wasn’t looking 
  for him because I knew they weren’t… they weren’t supposed to be in that area”. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown did not allege that the appellant intended to shoot 
  Christopher.  It was the Crown’s theory at trial that the bullet hit the water 
  in front of Christopher and ricocheted off the surface of the water, striking 
  him. The Crown took the position that, in firing in the direction of the child, 
  the appellant displayed a wanton and reckless disregard for the life or safety 
  of the child, and consequently was guilty of criminal negligence causing death. 
  The defence theory was that the appellant, entirely unaware of the presence 
  of Christopher and his sister across the lake, was shooting at a stick in the 
  water, and that Christopher was shot accidentally and not negligently. </p>
<b><span lang=EN-US>2. The issue on appeal</span></b>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The sole issue on this appeal relates to the 
  admissibility of Sgt. Barnes’ testimony. Prior to its admission, the evidence 
  of the simulated experiment was fully canvassed on a <i>voir dire</i>. The trial 
  judge allowed the evidence, albeit in a restricted form. He held that the experiment 
  was not of a scientific nature, nor was it unusual. Rather, it was in the nature 
  of a reconstruction to demonstrate what happens when a gun is fired in the way 
  described by Christopher’s sister. The trial judge was satisfied that Sgt. Barnes 
  had the expertise required to carry out the experiment. Sgt. Barnes had expertise 
  in the firing of firearms and related issues such as sighting, the ejection 
  of cartridges and the general manner in which fired projectiles may act. He 
  was also satisfied that the experiment evidence was relevant to the issues before 
  the court and necessary for the jury to understand whether it was possible for 
  bullets to ricochet off the water as alleged. The trial judge therefore concluded 
  that the experiment evidence was admissible to show what happened when a gun 
  was fired in a way suggested by one of the witnesses. He ruled, however, that 
  Sgt. Barnes could only testify as to the experiment that was actually conducted 
  and its results, but that he could <i>not </i>offer any opinion that went beyond 
  the actual results of the experiment because he did not have the necessary expertise. 
  The Crown on appeal does not take issue with this restriction. Hence, the trial 
  judge would not allow the officer to suggest that, as a rule of physics or as 
  a matter of science, in every case when one fires under particular circumstances 
  the bullets will necessarily behave in a particular manner. Nor would he allow 
  the officer to express any opinion on the safety of the act being simulated. 
  It would be up to the jury to draw their own conclusions in that regard. Sgt. 
  Barnes then testified as to the experiment in accordance with this ruling. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The crux of the appellant’s submission is that 
  the experiment evidence constituted expert opinion evidence and that, as such, 
  it could only be admitted if it met the usual criteria for admissibility set 
  out in <i>R. v. Mohan </i>(1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C). Counsel for the 
  appellant submits that Sgt. Barnes’ experiment evidence failed to meet these 
  criteria. In particular, he submits that it was in the nature of “novel scientific 
  evidence” and that, as such, it failed to meet the threshold standard of validity 
  and reliability that is required to satisfy the criteria in <i>Mohan</i>. He 
  also submits that Sgt.&nbsp;Barnes could not qualify as an expert to conduct 
  this type of experiment since he had never performed an experiment of this kind 
  before. Consequently, the appellant submits that the experiment evidence should 
  not have been admitted at trial for any purpose.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The respondent submits that the experiment evidence 
  was <i>not </i>expert opinion evidence but, rather, that it was factual testimony, 
  the admissibility of which is merely dependent on whether prejudice is outweighed 
  by probative value. The respondent submits that the probative value of experiment 
  evidence of this kind is determined by the degree of similarity between the 
  conditions of the experiment and the actual event. This does not require identical 
  conditions, but only that the degree of similarity be sufficient to ensure that 
  the results of the experiment are probative. Any objection based on dissimilarity 
  of some of the conditions goes to weight rather than admissibility.</span></p>
<b><span lang=EN-US>3. The law on the admissibility of experiment evidence</span></b>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Despite the fact that experiment evidence is often, and at times 
  routinely, admitted at trials, there is a paucity of Canadian jurisprudence 
  relating to this kind of evidence. Perhaps this is explained by the fact that 
  experiment evidence often goes unrecognized for what it is: in some cases, it 
  consists of mere factual evidence, much like any other sworn testimony; in other 
  cases, it is a combination of factual and opinion evidence. In either situation, 
  its admissibility is governed by well-established rules of evidence.  Indeed, 
  in my view, the key to determining the admissibility of experiment evidence 
  is to keep in mind this distinction between fact and opinion as it is understood 
  in the law of evidence. I will briefly review the applicable principles of law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the law of evidence, an opinion means an “<i>inference from 
  observed fact</i>”: see <i>R. v. Abbey</i> (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 394 at 409<i>.</i> 
  As stated in <i>Abbey</i>, as a general rule, witnesses testify only as to observed 
  facts and it is then up to the trier of fact to draw inferences from those facts. 
  A lay witness will be permitted to give an opinion only with respect to matters 
  that do not require special knowledge and in circumstances where it is virtually 
  impossible to separate the facts from the inferences based on those facts. A 
  witness testifying that “a person was drunk” is a common example of an opinion 
  that can be provided by a lay witness. See <i>R. v. Graat</i> (1982), 2 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 365 (S.C.C.) for a review of the law on non-expert opinion. Otherwise, 
  opinion evidence will only be received with respect to matters calling for special 
  knowledge beyond that of the trier of fact. In those cases, an expert in the 
  field may be permitted to provide the judge and jury with an opinion, that is 
  “a ready-made inference which the judge and jury, due to the technical nature 
  of the facts, are unable to formulate” (<i>Abbey</i> at 409). The law as to 
  expert opinion evidence was authoritatively restated in <i>Mohan, supra</i>. 
  Before expert opinion evidence can be admitted, the evidence: (a) must be relevant 
  to an issue in the case; (b) it must be necessary to assist the trier of fact; 
  (c) it must not be subject to any other exclusionary rule; and (d) it must be 
  given by a properly qualified expert.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A witness’ testimony as to observed facts is, of course, subject 
  to the general principles governing the admissibility of any evidence: relevance 
  and materiality. <i>Relevance </i>is established at law if, as a matter of logic 
  and experience, the evidence tends to prove the proposition for which it is 
  advanced. The evidence is <i>material </i>if it is directed at a matter in issue 
  in the case.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> Hence, evidence 
  that is relevant to an issue in the case will generally be admitted. Indeed, 
  it is a fundamental principle of our law of evidence that any information that 
  has any tendency to prove a fact in issue should be admitted in evidence unless 
  its exclusion is justified on some other grounds: see <i>R. v. Corbett</i>, 
  [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670 at 715; <i>Morris v. R.</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 190 at 201; 
  and <i>R. v. Seaboyer</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 at 609. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The grounds that justify the exclusion of evidence 
  that is otherwise relevant and material form the basis of many of our more specific 
  rules of evidence. The rule against hearsay, the opinion rule and the similar 
  fact rule are a few examples. Quite apart from these specific rules, evidence 
  that is otherwise relevant and material may also be excluded by the exercise 
  of the trial judge’s general power to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings. 
  Our law of evidence recognizes the general power of a judge to exclude relevant 
  and material evidence where its probative value is outweighed by the prejudice 
  caused by its admission, provided that where the evidence is tendered by the 
  defence, it should not be excluded on that basis unless the prejudice <i>substantially</i> 
  outweighs the value of the evidence: see <i>Seaboyer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 390; 
  and <i>R. v. S.C.B. </i>(1997), 119 C.C.C. (3d) 530 at 541 (Ont. C.A.). Prejudice 
  in this context does not mean, of course, that the evidence will be detrimental 
  to the other party’s position. Rather, it is related to the detrimental effect 
  that the evidence may have on the fairness and the integrity of the proceedings. 
  For example, the evidence may not be worth receiving if its reliability is clearly 
  outweighed by its potential to mislead or confuse the trier of fact. The evidence 
  could also be excluded where its admission would involve an inordinate amount 
  of time that is not commensurate with its value. See <i>Mohan</i>, <i>supra</i>,

  evidence. A pre-trial experiment can be as simple as driving from one location 
  to another to determine the time it takes to cover the distance in order to 
  substantiate or disprove an alibi, or driving along a particular stretch of 
  road to determine at what point a stop sign becomes visible. The evidence in 
  such cases, provided that it is relevant to an issue in the case, will usually 
  be admitted without argument. It is entirely factual, and its admissibility 
  is only subject to the general principles of relevance, materiality and discretion 
  as discussed earlier. In other cases, the pre-trial experiment may be more complex, 
  requiring particular technical or scientific knowledge to perform, and it may 
  also form the basis of expert opinion evidence in the interpretation of the 
  results. In such cases, the experiment evidence, in so far as the observed facts 
  are concerned, will be subject to the usual principles of relevance, materiality 
  and discretion but, in addition, to the extent that it includes inferences from 
  observed facts, the opinion rule will come into play. In order to be admissible, 
  that part of the experiment evidence that constitutes opinion evidence will 
  have to meet the criteria in <i>Mohan</i>.</span></p>

  relevant to an issue in the case, should generally be admitted, subject to the 
  trial judge’s residuary discretion to exclude the evidence where the prejudice 
  that would flow from its admission clearly outweighs its value. Beyond this, 
  when the evidence requires the making of inferences from observed facts that 
  require special knowledge, the test in <i>Mohan</i> will have to be met before

  evidence will depend on the degree of similarity between the replication and 
  the original event. Consider the example given earlier where the experiment 
  consists of the driving along a particular stretch of road to determine at what 
  point a stop sign becomes visible. If the distance at which the stop sign becomes 
  visible is in issue at trial, the experiment evidence will be material, but 
  will only be relevant if the replication bears some similarity to the original 
  event. For example, if the original event occurred in the summer when vegetation 
  partly obstructed the driver’s view but the experiment was conducted in winter 
  after all the leaves had fallen, the relevance of the evidence will be greatly 
  diminished. Depending on all the circumstances, it may not be worth receiving. 
  Similarly, if the experiment evidence includes expert opinion evidence, variances 
  between the replication and the original event, depending on their degree and 
  importance, will affect the weight that can be given to the expert opinion evidence.

  (2d) 699 (S.C.C.), the plaintiff brought an action against defendant police 
  officers for damages in respect of brain injuries that he suffered as a result 
  of extensive force used by the officers in making an arrest.  In support of 
  his case, the plaintiff called a witness who testified as to hearing a ‘thud’ 
  from over 100 feet away during the timeframe of the arrest. To contradict this 
  witness, the defendants introduced evidence of an audibility experiment in which 
  a hammer was pounded on the police station floor.  The plaintiff objected to 
  this evidence. On appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada, the Court held that 
  the evidence was irrelevant to the issues at trial, but made the following brief 
  comment about experiments in general at p. 709:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There is much, of course, to be said against that kind of evidence.  It 
      is absolutely impossible to duplicate all the elements affecting audibility

  60 (Ont. C.A.), the accused was convicted of arson.  At trial, the Crown had 
  relied on the evidence of a fire marshal who theorized that the fire had been 
  started by the partial filling of a bathtub with flammable fluid and then igniting 
  it. To test this theory, he had conducted a simulation in another bathtub, and 
  then examined the blisters. He gave evidence of this simulation and its results 
  before the jury. On appeal, the accused argued that such evidence should not 
  have been admitted. In rejecting this ground of appeal, Zuber J.A. (at 62) relied 
  on the following excerpt from <i>McCormick’s Handbook of the Law of Evidence</i>, 
  2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (1972), c. 20 at pp. 484-485:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Testing the truth of hypotheses by the use of controlled experiments is 
      one of the key techniques of modern scientific method.  The courts in their 
      task of investigating facts make extensive use of this technique, but under 
      conditions which prevent them from exploiting the process to the full limits 
      of its usefulness.  The legal doctrines relating to experimental evidence 
      are simple and the principal task of the lawyer is to recognize the opportunities 
      for their use, to seize these opportunities boldly, and when experiments 
      are employed to plan them inventively and correctly, so that the results 
      derived will be convincing to judge and jury.  We are dealing here with 
      experiments carried out before trial and presented at the trial through 
      descriptions given by witnesses of the experiment and its results…</p>
    <p>The opportunities are of limitless variety.  Some of the types of experiments 
      most frequently encountered are these: tests of the composition and properties 
      of substances; testing firearms to show the patterns of powder and shot 
      made upon the object at different distances; experiments by human beings 
      in the holding of firearms to determine whether a given gunshot wound could 
      have been self-inflicted; tests of the visibility of objects or persons 
      at a given distance; tests of audibility and tests of the speed of locomotives 
      and motor vehicles and of the effectiveness of their brakes and headlights.

  accused was convicted of first degree murder. At trial, the Crown relied on 
  experiment evidence to contradict the appellant’s allegation that his wife had 
  fallen from the balcony.  On appeal, the accused argued that the experiment 
  evidence was inadmissible, due to “incomplete information and inaccurate assumptions”.  
  In rejecting this argument, MacKinnon A.C.J.O. stated at p. 2 (QL):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…the information used was substantially that given by the appellant and 
      the tests were conducted in accordance with scientific methodology.  There 
      was no need for a deep knowledge of the laws of physics to question the 
      statements of the accused that he saw his wife falling as he was running 
      from the kitchen and still had time to cross the living-dining room and 
      the balcony and catch her, only to have her slip from his grasp.  However, 
      it was within the jury’s province to weigh the evidence of the tests conducted 
      and introduced by the Crown; the argument that the tests were based on incomplete 
      information goes to its weight and not its admissibility.</p>

  C.A.), an issue arose as to the cause of a red mark on a young victim of a homicide. 
  It was the Crown’s theory at trial that the red mark was caused by a cigarette 
  burn inflicted by the accused. It was the defence theory that the mark was caused 
  when the victim fell on a red toy funnel in the bathtub. To disprove the accused’s 
  allegation, the investigating officer performed a “crude experiment” with a 
  funnel in his bathtub to determine how it would land in the water.  At trial, 
  the officer testified about the results of this experiment without objection. 
  However, the admissibility of his evidence was contested on appeal. Laskin J.A., 
  in writing for the court, stated as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> I agree that the results of Detective Sergeant Harild’s experiment should 
      not have been admitted.  He did not have the required scientific training 
      to give this evidence and the evidence itself was of dubious relevance.  
      See <i>R. </i>v. <i>Mohan </i>(1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (S.C.C.). But the 
      error was harmless for two reasons. First, the trial judge instructed the 
      jury to ignore the evidence. … Second, the medical evidence at trial showed 
      that the mark was likely caused by a cigarette burn. Indeed the medical 
      evidence dismissed the possibility of a funnel having caused or aggravated 
      the lesion. I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>

      different levels of water.  When there was two inches of water in the tub, 
      I would just randomly throw this toy in, flipping it and also that there 
      was no, no consistency in the way it was introduced into the water, and 
      out of the 25 times that I threw it, 24 times it landed like this with the 
      funnel up, <i>because basically this part of the funnel is so heavy that 
      it’s sitting on the water and physics dictates that the heaviest then will

  the appellant successfully adduced  experiment evidence by way of fresh evidence 
  on his appeal from his second degree murder conviction. The appellant maintained 
  at trial that he had shot away from the victim not intending to kill him. The 
  fresh evidence consisted of an experiment conducted by a retired R.C.M.P officer, 
  in which the circumstances of the shooting were simulated.  The Crown argued 
  that the evidence was not of sufficient probative value, because it amounted 
  to a speculative experiment with no scientific evidence. The British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal rejected this argument, admitted the evidence and ordered a 
  new trial stating, at 73:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the result, I am satisfied that the appellant has met each of the tests 
      required by [<i>R. </i>v. <i>Palmer</i>, [1980] 1S.C.R. 759].  As I have 
      already indicated, the fresh evidence is capable of raising a reasonable 
      doubt whether [the appellant] shot directly at [the victim] and a reasonable 
      doubt whether the facts themselves prove that he did.  If accepted, and 
      I do not think we can make that determination, the consequence would be 
      a verdict of manslaughter, not second degree murder.  </p>

  motor vehicle involving a high-speed night chase.  At trial, the only live issue 
  was the identity of the driver. To rebut the eyewitness identification evidence, 
  the defence sought to adduce expert opinion evidence, based on a series of experiments

  a failure to precisely replicate the circumstances of the original night. On 
  appeal, the appellant argued that the expert opinion was improperly rejected. 
  Hill J., sitting as a summary conviction appeal court judge, disagreed, finding 
  that the expert’s opinion was properly rejected because the subject-matter of 
  his testimony was outside his area of expertise. Hill J. also made the following 
  useful comment with respect to the assessment of this kind of evidence (at paras. 
  62-63):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span> </span>Where an expert witness purports to express opinion evidence 
      founded on an experiment or recreation of events, the opinion will have 
      probative value, more or less, depending on the integrity of the purported 
      replication.  As in the instance of a hypothetical question posed to an 
      expert witness, variances from the established facts of the original event(s), 
      may, depending on materiality and degree of departure, substantially diminish 
      the weight which can reasonably be afforded the expert’s evidence.  In an 
      extreme case, admissibility itself may be jeopardized. </p>
    <p>While no experiment or recreation can, as a general rule, exactly duplicate

  On appeal, the appellant sought to adduce fresh evidence by forensic experts 
  to show that the handwritten notes of the disputed interviews could not have 
  been made in the time claimed by the interviewing officers. The prosecution 
  argued against the admission of this evidence on the basis that the witness 
  had insufficient experience to perform the tests.  In admitting the fresh evidence, 
  the Court of Appeal was reported to have ruled as follows (at 520):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…the evidence was admissible provided that it was confined to tests performed

  experiment testimony as expert opinion evidence in the nature of “novel scientific 
  evidence” is misconceived. In describing how projectiles acted when a rifle 
  was shot in a certain way, the witness was not advancing any novel scientific 
  proposition. Indeed the trial judge was correct in finding that this kind of 
  evidence was neither scientific nor unusual. The appellant’s argument also fails 
  to recognize the fundamental distinction between fact and opinion.  Although 
  Sgt.&nbsp;Barnes was qualified as an expert in the handling and use of firearms, 
  it does not follow from that fact that his testimony necessarily constitutes 
  opinion evidence: see <i>R. v. K.(A.) </i>(1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at paras.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The gist of Sgt. Barnes’ testimony was as follows. 
  First, he described how the experiment was set up. He testified that, on October 
  15, 1998, he and his fellow attended the scene where the shooting had taken 
  place. A target array was placed at the location where the young victim was 
  alleged to have been when he was shot. The appellant’s own rifle was placed 
  on a tripod across the pond at the location where the officers believed the 
  appellant was standing at the time he fired the shots. This location was determined 
  from information received from witnesses and from the shell casings found at 
  the scene. Markings were placed at several distances in the water. Sgt. Barnes 
  determined the site alignment of the appellant’s rifle. Second, Sgt. Barnes 
  described how the experiment was carried out. He described in detail how and 
  where 16 shots were fired at the targeted markings in the water and further 
  described how 15 of the 16 bullets hit the target across the pond. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The experiment evidence was rather simple and 
  easy to understand. To the extent that any expertise in the use and handling 
  of firearms may have been required in actually setting up the experiment and 
  carrying it out, the evidence is clear that Sgt. Barnes had the necessary qualifications 
  and the trial judge was correct in recognizing his expertise in that field. 
  However, the gist of Sgt. Barnes’ testimony did not require any particular expertise; 
  it simply consisted of his observations when the sixteen shots were fired into 
  the lake. A review of the transcript reveals that his testimony, save for one 
  exception to which I will refer later, was restricted to giving an eyewitness 
  account of the experiment and its results. Even when asked by the Crown to give 
  his “conclusions” based on the experiment, his testimony was restricted to a 
  factual account. His answer was the following: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>On the particular day under the parameters we had set for that particular 
      test, that when we fired rounds into the water in alignment with the target 
      and if they struck the water approximately 7.5 meters in front of the target 
      array, we produced bullet strikes in close proximity to that proportion 
      of the target.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Hence, the essence of Sgt. Barnes’ testimony 
  was factual in nature and not subject to the general exclusionary rule with 
  respect to opinion evidence. As discussed earlier, its admissibility was merely 
  dependant on its relevance and materiality, subject to the trial judge’s general 
  power to exclude the evidence on the basis of prejudice. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the evidence was relevant and material. 
  It is beyond dispute that the question whether a bullet could ricochet off the 
  water as alleged was an issue at trial. Indeed, it was an important issue - 
  the trial judge held that it was <i>necessary </i>for this jury to understand 
  whether it was possible for bullets to ricochet off the water. It is also beyond 
  question that the experiment evidence was relevant to this issue. Hence the 
  experiment evidence was clearly material, relevant and therefore admissible 
  unless it can be shown that the trial judge erred in failing to exercise his 
  general discretion to exclude the evidence on the basis of prejudice. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, the appellant has not shown any 
  prejudice that would justify the exclusion of the evidence. I see no merit to 
  the contention that the jury would not be able to properly interpret the results 
  of the experiment without expert opinion evidence. The evidence was introduced 
  simply to show how bullets can ricochet off water. It was entirely open to the 
  jury to draw their own inferences on this issue from the results of the experiment.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The only aspect of Sgt. Barnes’ testimony that 
  went beyond mere factual observations relates to his statement that he didn’t 
  believe the results of the experiment would be different if fifty or a hundred 
  more shots had been fired in the same manner. The appellant takes particular 
  issue with this aspect of Sgt. Barnes’ testimony. The appellant is correct in 
  stating that, in giving this answer, Sgt. Barnes’ testimony expressed an opinion 
  that went beyond the actual results of the experiment in contravention of the 
  trial judge’s express ruling. However, it is noteworthy that the impugned testimony 
  was given in answer to a few discrete leading questions put to the witness by 
  defence counsel in cross-examination – questions that defence counsel, who is 
  not counsel on appeal, was previously cautioned by the trial judge against asking.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, the impugned testimony was adduced as 
  a result of questions by counsel for the appellant that specifically called 
  for opinion evidence. Presumably, the questions were asked in a bona fide attempt 
  to attack the witness’ evidence. This court should not look behind trial counsel’s 
  tactical decisions save only to prevent a miscarriage of justice: <i>R. v. B. 
  (G.D.) </i>(2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 299 (S.C.C.). The impugned testimony 
  did not occasion any miscarriage of justice. When considered in the context 
  of the witness’ entire testimony which, in all other respects, was properly 
  admitted, and in the further context of the other evidence at trial, it could 
  not reasonably have affected the verdict. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, the jury would have clearly understood 
  from the trial judge’s instructions that Sgt. Barnes’ testimony, as the rest 
  of the evidence, should be critically assessed, and that it was up to them to 
  decide what weight, if any, should be attached to it in arriving at their verdict. 
  In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge referred to Sgt. Barnes as 
  an expert witness. As Sgt. Barnes was qualified as having sufficient expertise 
  to conduct the experiment, he was, in that limited sense, an expert witness. 
  However, as Sgt. Barnes had been properly precluded by the trial judge’s ruling 
  from offering any opinion that went beyond the actual results of the experiment, 
  it would have been preferable if Sgt. Barnes’ testimony had not been generally 
  identified as expert testimony. In the end, his evidence was factual in nature 
  and the appellant was not prejudiced by the trial judge’s reference to Sgt. 
  Barnes as an expert witness. It is noteworthy that there was no suggestion in 
  the trial judge’s instructions that the results of the experiment were scientific 
  in nature or worthy of any greater consideration than the other evidence adduced 
  at trial. Rather, the trial judge gave thorough instructions on how to assess 
  the credibility of witnesses, including a specific caution against finding the 
  testimony of police witnesses more worthy of belief simply because they may 
  appear more comfortable in giving their testimony. The instructions on credibility 
  were immediately followed by detailed instructions on how to critically assess 
  expert opinion evidence, including the necessity to assess the factual basis 
  for any opinion. Sgt. Barnes’ testimony was specifically referred to as an example 
  to illustrate this latter instruction; however, the reference to the witness’ 
  expertise was confined to the replication of the conditions of the shooting 
  and was not in any way related to the results of the experiment.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, it is my view that the trial

  Barnes’ testimony substantially conformed to the trial judge’s ruling, and I

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For the sake of completeness, I find it important 
  to note that part of the trial judge’s instructions on expert evidence was incorrect. 
  After giving very thorough and helpful instructions on the assessment of expert 
  opinion evidence, the trial judge concluded that part of his charge with the 
  following: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the final analysis, it is for you to determine what expert evidence 
      you accept (if any), and what weight you wish to attach to it.  As I have 
      said before, you are the sole judges of the facts and in determining what 
      the facts are, you may believe all or none or only part of the evidence 
      of a witness.  The same principle applies to the expert witness who may 
      have testified.  Be cautious before rejecting an expert's professional opinion, 
      but keep in mind that it is open for you to do so.  Also keep in mind, that 
      <i>where an expert's opinion favours the crown, the opinion of the expert 
      witness may be valid only if the evidentiary basis of the opinion is factually 
      true.  On the other hand, where the opinion of the expert witness favours 
      the accused, you are entitled to act on it if you find, as a first step, 
      that its evidentiary basis is factually true or if you have a reasonable 
      doubt as to whether it is true or false.  It is only when you find that 
      the evidentiary basis is false that you must not consider the opinion of 
      an expert witness that favours the accused</i>. </p>

  </span></span> While it is conceivable that the latter part of this instruction 
  could have some valid application to a particular fact situation, it is incorrect 
  as a general principle of law and should not be routinely given. There is no 
  basis at law for differentiating between Crown and defence expert opinion evidence 
  when it comes to assessing the evidentiary foundation for the opinion. In either 
  case, the more the expert relies on facts not proved in evidence, the less weight 
  the jury may attribute to the opinion. The corollary is also true: the more 
  the expert fails to consider relevant facts, the less weight the jury may attribute 
  to the opinion. These principles apply in the same way whether the expert opinion 
  favours the Crown or the defence. See <i>R. v. Abbey, supra;</i> <i>R. v. Lavallee</i>, 
  [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852; and more recently, <i>R. v. Charlebois</i>, [2000]  2 S.C.R. 
  674 at para. 22 where the court reviewed the correctness of jury instructions 
  in relation to a defence expert and did so solely in terms of these principles.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, it is my view that the experiment evidence

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On the voir dire concerning admissibility of

  the experiment was “to set up a shooting protocol to fire rounds across the 
  body of water, skipping them off the water, <i>and attempting to produce strikes 
  on the target array that we had built</i> [emphasis added]”. During the trial 
  he explained that he did not know in advance whether he could hit the target

  could skip the bullets off the water, but I didn’t know how random the event

  </span></span> Sergeant Barnes explained that he placed Mr. Collins’ rifle on 
  a tripod in order to stabilize the shooting platform “so there’s no variables 
  in that it was wobbling around or you have a wobble area as a result of holding 
  it free standing”. Of the sixteen shots that were recorded, the first ten were 
  fired with the rifle aimed at the target representing Christopher’s position<a href="#_ftn2"

  through ten were aimed at a point approximately seven and one half metres in 
  front of the target array using a muzzle angle of 3.0 degrees. Although the 
  original plan was to space the shots at five metre intervals, Sergeant Barnes 
  selected the seven and one half metre point of aim when it appeared that shots 
  fired at a point five metres in front of the target array were impacting too

  the outer target or whether [the bullets would] move to the inside target…”

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Well, going into it, we weren’t sure exactly what the results were 
      going to be. Quite frankly, I didn’t know how the bullets were going to 
      react with the impact with water and what it would do to the trajectory. 
      After having fired the shots, however, it became readily apparent, like 
      to produce a bullet strike on one of these targets where they were placed 
      and the level they were above the water, that I had to line the rifle up 
      with the particular target to produce a bullet strike on that particular 
      target. <i>When I changed to the outside targets and I stopped shooting 
      on the centre line of the… of the middle targets, the bullet strikes as 
      soon as I changed the bearing of the rifle to those outside targets, the 
      bullet strikes starting appearing there, so it became readily apparent that 
      to strike any one of those targets, that the rifle had to be lined up with 
      that particular target to produce the strike</i>. [emphasis added]</span></p>

    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The only way to…for us under the conditions that we did the test firing 
      under, to produce a bullet strike on a specific target such as the centre, 
      middle, white target is that I had to line the rifle up with that target 
      so it was in line with it as I struck the water with the bullet. In answer 
      to His Honour’s question it wasn’t exactly in line, there was some variance, 
      they did pull left, they did pull right, some went slightly higher, some 
      went slightly lower, obviously …because they’ve struck off the water, but 
      it was consistent in that to produce a bullet strike on that target, I had 
      to be in line with the target to do so. </span></p>

  ricochet off of the water. However, the trial judge did permit Sergeant Barnes

  said the following:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Sergeant Barnes was not presented as, and is not, a scientist in the 
      sense of being able to explain his test results in terms of the science 
      of physics or any other formal science. He cannot offer scientific opinion 
      in that sense which explains how the projectiles behaved in flight or on 
      impact, ricochet or otherwise, nor can he predict in such scientific terms 
      how the projectiles might behave if any of the components of the test are 
      varied. … he can comment on the flight of the bullets he fired, of the bullets 
      he fired from and to the particular location within the ranges of distance 
      and muzzle angles tested, however, he cannot and should not comment on what 
      would happen outside of those tested parameters. So, for example, he cannot 
      say what would happen if the gun were fired from a position a foot or two 
      higher, or a yard or two back, or to either side, or with differing angles 
      than those tested. These variations were not tested to offer opinions about 
      what would or would be likely to occur outside of the parameters of the 
      test that was actually conducted would be unwarranted and dangerous and 
      I think the Crown should be very cautious in keeping the witness within 
      those parameters. If the evidence at trial offers variations of the components 
      that form the planned basis of the tests, then the Jury will have to decide 
      how to deal with it and I will instruct them on how they may use the evidence.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is, however, noteworthy that the relevance 
  of the experiment evidence lies in its demonstrated results. The trial judge 
  found that Sergeant Barnes did not possess the expertise to explain how the 
  bullets behaved nor to predict what would happen if any of the testing variables 
  were changed. He accordingly restricted Sergeant Barnes from expressing any 
  opinion about those matters. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, a similar caution was desirable 
  to warn the jury that the experiment evidence could not support conclusions 
  concerning the outcome of undemonstrated changes in the testing variables. There 
  was an inherent risk that the jury would erroneously conclude that by demonstrating 
  the plausibility, and even likelihood, of an event based on one theory of causation, 
  the experiment evidence effectively excluded other theories of causation. That 
  risk was heightened by the fact that Sergeant Barnes was qualified as an “expert” 
  to give evidence that did not require expertise. The nature of the experiment 
  evidence itself further increased this risk. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is useful to analyze the experiment evidence

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the first part of the experiment, namely 
  shots one through ten, Sergeant Barnes aligned his rifle with the specific target 
  that was intended to approximate Christopher’s position, and, using three different 
  muzzle angles, attempted to replicate Cindy’s account of the incident, by skipping 
  bullets off of the water at varying distances in front of the target in order 
  to hit it.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In the second part of the experiment, namely 
  shots eleven through sixteen, Sergeant Barnes changed the rifle alignment so 
  that it was pointing at the left side of the target array, away from Christopher’s 
  position. He used two muzzle angles, one that he had not used in the first part 
  of the experiment and one that he had, and again attempted to skip bullets off 
  of the water at varying distances in front of the target, this time in order 
  to see what would occur.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The key distinction between the two parts of 
  the experiment is that shots one through ten were confined to being an attempt 
  to replicate Cindy’s version of the incident, while shots eleven through sixteen 
  were not. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Like the shots fired during the first part of 
  the experiment, shots eleven through sixteen demonstrated, with one exception, 
  that bullets ricocheting off of water generally follow a consistent trajectory 
  to the target when fired at the selected muzzle angles. However, because the 
  rifle alignment was changed in the second part of the experiment, shots eleven 
  through sixteen also provided a graphic demonstration of an available conclusion 
  that one had to aim at the target intended to approximate Christopher’s position 
  in order to hit it, when using the selected muzzle angles. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In and of itself, this specific conclusion, 
  predicated on the use of the selected muzzle angles, creates no risk of prejudice 
  to the appellant. Albeit potentially harmful to the appellant’s position, it 
  is an actual demonstrated result. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view however, there is a risk of prejudice 
  to the appellant that arises from the evidence of the second part of the experiment, 
  namely that the jury would draw the more general conclusion stated by Sergeant 
  Barnes on the voir dire, that one had to be aligned with the target in order 
  to hit it, when that conclusion had not been demonstrated. The evidence that 
  the bullet trajectory remained consistent even though the rifle alignment was 
  changed suggests the conclusion that one had to be aligned with the target in 
  order to hit it. Although Sergeant Barnes was not permitted to express his conclusion 
  in the presence of the jury, the fact that he, a person qualified as an expert 
  in the handling, operation and firing of guns, drew it, demonstrates a real 
  risk that the evidence would suggest the same conclusion to the jury. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Sergeant Barnes did not design an experiment 
  that was capable of excluding alternate versions of causation. He did not, for 
  example, attempt to determine the spectrum of muzzle angles that would produce 
  a ricochet, nor did he attempt to test whether bullets fired from a rifle using 
  muzzle angles in every range of that spectrum behave in the same fashion. In 
  other words, he did not attempt to test whether the trajectory of bullets ricocheting 
  off of water remains consistent through the range of muzzle angles that will 
  produce a ricochet. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Although Sergeant Barnes varied one muzzle angle 
  in the second part of the experiment, one change to the muzzle angle, without 
  knowing the range of muzzle angles that could produce a ricochet, is of no particular 
  significance in proving the conclusion he stated on the voir dire. Absent a 
  more complete experiment, or assistance from an expert, the accuracy of the 
  general conclusion that one has to be aligned with a target in order to hit 
  it by skipping bullets off of water remains to be seen. This is not to say the 
  conclusion is inaccurate, merely that its accuracy was not demonstrated by the 
  experiment that was conducted.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Although I consider that the evidence concerning 
  the second part of the experiment, in particular, created a risk of prejudice 
  to the appellant, it has not been demonstrated that that risk outweighed the 
  probative value of the evidence. I reach this conclusion for three reasons. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, there was significant additional probative 
  value to the evidence of the second part of the experiment. That evidence demonstrated 
  graphically that bullets fired from a rifle, aimed away from Christopher’s position 
  using any of the muzzle angles tested during the experiment, generally would 
  not hit it. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Second, the evidence of the first part of the 
  experiment significantly reduced the air of reality to be afforded to any alternate 
  version of causation raised by Mr. Collins’ evidence in any event. That evidence 
  not only confirmed the plausibility of Cindy’s version of the incident; it increased 
  the probability that it happened in the manner she described. Mr. Collins’ account 
  of the incident was unclear to begin with. The evidence of the first part of 
  the experiment diminished the prospect that it would be afforded any weight.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Third, Sergeant Barnes was not permitted to 
  express the conclusion he reached and counsel did not invite the erroneous inference.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Although it has not been demonstrated that the 
  risk of prejudice arising from the evidence of the second part of the experiment 
  outweighed its probative value, Sergeant Barnes’ conclusion, as stated on the 
  voir dire, that one had to be aligned with the target in order to hit it, in 
  and of itself, demonstrates the desirability of cautioning the jury that the 
  evidence of the experiment could not exclude alternate versions of causation. 
  In fairness to the trial judge however, he was never asked to give such an instruction, 
  let alone to weigh the risk of prejudice of the second part of the experiment 
  against its probative value. </span></p>
