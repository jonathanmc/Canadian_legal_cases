<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Regional Senior

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is one of two appeals heard by this court raising issues 
  about the civil liability of the Brantford Police Services Board for conduct 
  of police officers employed by the Board.  The cases involve entirely different 
  incidents but each turns on the allegedly illegal arrest of the respective plaintiffs.  
  The reasons in the other case, <i>Hudson v. Brantford Police Services Board</i> 
  are being released concurrently with these reasons.  This case concerns the 
  proper interpretation of s. 495 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which governs the 
  warrantless arrest of a person, and the protection against arbitrary detention 
  under s. 9 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  The Deputy 
  Judge of the Small Claims Court and the Divisional Court judge both found in 
  favour of the plaintiff.  For the reasons that follow I would allow the appeal. 
</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>THE FACTS</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Officers of the Brantford Police Services Board arrested the 
  plaintiff, Mr. Collins, on two occasions.  The trial judge awarded damages for 
  both arrests and this judgment was affirmed on appeal to the Divisional Court.  
  In the present appeal, the appellant Board only contests the findings with respect 
  to the first arrest.  I will therefore confine my review of the facts to the 
  first incident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On August 4, 1997, Elsie Widdis was hanging out her laundry in 
  her own backyard.  Mrs. Widdis is a slight woman of 71 years of age.  For no 
  apparent reason, her neighbour, Mr. Collins, sprayed her with water from a hose.  
  There is a history of difficulties between Mr. Collins and his neighbours.  
  The trial judge charitably describes Mr. Collins as lacking “the social skills 
  to maintain diplomatic relationships with his neighbours”.  As a result of the 
  hose incident, Mrs. Widdis called to her neighbour Mr.&nbsp;Martino and he came 
  over.  Mr. Collins began to yell derogatory remarks at Mr.&nbsp;Martino.  Mrs. 
  Widdis telephoned the police and Constable Sawkins was dispatched.  Mrs. Widdis 
  described the incident to Constable Sawkins.  Mrs. Widdis testified that because 
  of this incident and other conduct by Mr. Collins she feared for her safety 
  and she therefore spent the night at her son’s home.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Constable Sawkins went to the area of Mrs. Widdis’ residence 
  sometime after 4:30&nbsp;p.m.  He had some familiarity with the problems the 
  neighbours were experiencing with Mr. Collins.  He had personally attended to 
  complaints by Mr. Collins about Mrs.&nbsp;Widdis on two occasions and he had 
  discussed the problems with other members of the police service.  Constable 
  Sawkins spoke to Mr. Martino and to Mrs. Widdis.  Mrs.&nbsp;Widdis was upset 
  because verbal abuse from Mr. Collins had now turned to violence.  Constable 
  Sawkins also spoke to Provincial Constable Homeniuk who lived on the street, 
  was aware of the problems caused by Mr. Collins, and had had some personal dealings 
  with him.  P.C. Homeniuk advised Constable Sawkins to have another officer with 
  him before dealing with Mr. Collins.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Constable Sawkins decided to arrest Mr. Collins for assault.  
  He testified that he intended to make the arrest without a warrant, and would 
  only get a warrant if he was refused entry to the Collins home to effect the 
  arrest<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>.  After 
  another constable arrived, they went to Mr. Collins’ home and knocked on the 
  front door.  Mr. Collins motioned the officers to come in.  He began to tell 
  his side of the story but Constable Sawkins cut him off, saying that he would 
  have an opportunity to do so later.  The officer advised Mr. Collins that he 
  was under arrest and advised him of his right to counsel.  Mr. Collins became 
  agitated but he eventually did go with the officers.  The arrest took place 
  about three hours after the water spraying incident. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The officers took Mr. Collins to the police station where he 
  entered into a recognizance before the officer in charge.  The recognizance 
  required him to refrain from having contact with his neighbours.  He was released 
  about two hours after the arrest.  He was subsequently convicted of assault.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>THE CLAIM</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The plaintiff launched his claim on August 31, 1998, over one 
  year after the arrest.  He claimed damages for the common law tort of unlawful 
  arrest and for breach of his right to protection against arbitrary detention 
  under s. 9 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</i>  In its defence, 
  the Board relied in part on the six-month limitation period in s.&nbsp;7 of 
  the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.38.  The Board 
  concedes that s. 7 is only a bar to the common law action and does not affect 
  the claim based on breach of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his reasons, the trial judge did not distinguish between the 
  two causes of action.  He appears to have found that the arrest was unlawful 
  because the conditions in s. 495(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> were not met.  
  However, respectfully, the reasons are not entirely clear and I intend only 
  to refer to his factual findings at this point.  I will return to his legal 
  findings later.  In the early part of his reasons, the trial judge found the 
  following facts:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>I find that the inter-neighbour tension was too high, 
      and quite long standing.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Considering all the evidence as to the neighbourhood situation 
      and the history of the tension in the Grand St. neighbourhood where the 
      events and the arrests took place, I cannot conclude that the arrests were 
      necessary to prevent the continuation or repetition of the offences or the 
      commission of another offence.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Disgruntled, grating, social invalid bully that the plaintiff 
      was, I am not prepared to find that:</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p>b.)        Officer Sawkins felt in August of ‘97 that arrest for a hybrid 
      offence without a warrant was justified.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Later in his reasons the trial judge also made 
  these, somewhat inconsistent, findings:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>With regard to the August ‘97 arrest, I find that I cannot 
      place myself in the position of Officer Sawkins as to where this neighbourhood 
      difficulty might lead, but I can find that the offenses charged were not 
      indictable, and that arrest cannot be made to fit under section 495(2) of 
      the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</span></p>
    <p>Evidence was led in an effort to establish that the fact that Mrs. Widdis 
      had decided to go away from her home for “the weekend” created a cushion 
      as to the timing of any continuation of the offence.  The evidence was not 
      compelling.  The police officer did not have or provide the particularity 
      to use that factor in their planning.  I find Mrs.&nbsp;Widdis’ absence 
      did not impact on “the plan”.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p>So what were the Brantford Police officers doing?  The fact is I find they 
      attempted to do good community police work.  They made a full examination 
      of the facts, they thought about a neighbourhood and its problems and its 
      safety.  They dealt with individuals who were aging and perhaps turning 
      inward in their dealing with their neighbours as individuals.</p>

<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>THE REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Fedak R.S.J. held that the plaintiff’s claim was based on the 
  <i>Charter</i> and therefore s. 7 of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i> 
  did not bar the action.  He interpreted the trial judge’s reasons as finding 
  that the arrest was not necessary to prevent the continuation or repetition 
  of an offence or the commission of another offence and that “under the circumstances, 
  the arrest could not be made to fit under s. 495(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>”.  
  He therefore held that the case had to be decided on the basis of whether the 
  trial judge had made a palpable and overriding error that affected his assessment 
  of the facts.  He could find no such error and dismissed the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>ANALYSIS</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This appeal turns, in part, on the interpretation of s. 495 of 
  the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  That, however, is not the only issue.  In view of 
  s. 7 of the <i>Public Authorities Protection Act</i>,<i> </i>even if the arrest 
  was unlawful, the plaintiff could only succeed if he also established that he 
  was arbitrarily detained contrary to s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>.  While the 
  Divisional Court judge, unlike the trial judge, recognized that the claim depended 
  upon the <i>Charter,</i> he did not deal separately with the s. 9 issue.  He 
  seems to have accepted that if the arrest was unlawful because the officer did 
  not comply with s. 495(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> it was also an arbitrary 
  detention.  This was an error of law.  This court made that point in <i>R. v. 
  Duguay, Murphy and Sevigny</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 296 where MacKinnon 
  A.C.J.O. held that, “It cannot be that every unlawful arrest necessarily falls 
  within the words ‘arbitrarily detained’.”  I will return to that issue after 
  considering s. 495.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 495 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>gives a police officer 
  a power to arrest without a warrant but imposes certain limits on that power.  
  The section provides, in part, as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>495. (1) <u>A peace officer may arrest without warrant</u></span></p>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>(a) a person</span></u><span

    <p><span lang=EN-US>(3) <u>Notwithstanding subsection (2), a peace officer

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Assault is a hybrid offence, that is an offence for which the 
  person may be prosecuted by indictment or for which he is punishable on summary 
  conviction within the meaning of s. 495(2)(b).  Accordingly, the limitation 
  on the arrest power in that section applied.  The respondent submits that, in 
  fact, Constable Sawkins had no power of arrest at all under s. 495(1) because 
  assault is not an indictable offence.  This argument appears to be based upon 
  the decision of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Dobrotic</i>, 
  [1997] N.B.J. No. 488 and seems to have found favour with the trial judge.  
  In my view, the respondent and the trial judge have misapprehended the effect 
  of <i>Dobrotic</i>.  In any event, this argument is foreclosed by the decision 
  in <i>R. v. Cayer</i> (1988), 28 O.A.C. 105 at 113 (C.A.).  In <i>Cayer</i>, 
  this court held that former s. 450(1) [now s. 495(1)] confers a power to arrest 
  without warrant a person who, on reasonable and probable grounds, the officer 
  believes has committed an indictable offence.  A hybrid offence like assault 
  in this case, or impaired driving in <i>Cayer</i>, is an indictable offence 
  “notwithstanding that the Crown may elect to prosecute either by indictment 
  or by way of summary conviction”.  The court relied upon its earlier decision 
  in <i>Re Abarca and the Queen</i> (1980), 57 C.C.C. (2d) 410, which in turn 
  had relied upon the holding in <i>Dallman v. The King</i>, [1942] S.C.R. 339, 
  where the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that an offence that could be 
  prosecuted either on indictment or on summary conviction was an indictable offence 
  as it could be prosecuted by indictment.</p>

  </span></span> The real question in this case turned on the limitation on the 
  arrest power in s.&nbsp;495(2).  I point out, however, that by virtue of s. 
  495(3), the burden of proving that the arrest was unlawful because of non-compliance 
  with s. 495(2) was on the plaintiff.  Thus, in the words of s. 495(2), it was 
  for the plaintiff to establish that Constable Sawkins believed on reasonable 
  grounds that the public interest, having regard to all the circumstances, could 
  be satisfied without arresting him.  The trial judge and the Divisional Court 
  judge both appeared to consider that this issue was determined by the finding 
  that the arrest was not necessary to prevent the continuation or repetition 
  of the offence or the commission of another offence within the meaning of s. 
  495(2)(d)(iii).  In my view, they were in error.  The decision not to make a 
  warrantless arrest for a hybrid offence must be made in the public interest 
  having regard to all of the circumstances.  The factors enumerated in s. 495(2)(d) 
  are only some, albeit the most important, of the factors to which the officer’s 
  attention is expressly directed.  The overriding consideration remains the public 
  interest.  In my view, the plaintiff did not meet his onus of establishing that 
  the public interest could have been satisfied without an arrest.  </p>

  </span></span> As I have said, neither the trial judge nor the Divisional Court 
  judge dealt with this issue.  Constable Sawkins was not asked whether he believed 
  the arrest was in the public interest, although it is a fair inference from 
  his testimony that he believed it was necessary in the public interest given 
  the tension in the neighbourhood and the need to place some controls on the 
  plaintiff’s contacts with his neighbours.</p>

  </span></span> However, even if the plaintiff did establish that the arrest 
  was unlawful because of s. 495(2), he failed to show that the arrest was arbitrary 
  within the meaning of s. 9 of the <i>Charter.</i>  Section 9 reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained 
      or imprisoned.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>Duguay</i> at p. 296, this court held 
  as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It cannot be that every unlawful arrest necessarily falls within the words 
      &quot;arbitrarily detained&quot;. The grounds upon which an arrest was made 
      may fall &quot;just short&quot; of constituting reasonable and probable 
      cause. <u>The person making the arrest may honestly, though mistakenly, 
      believe that reasonable and probable grounds for the arrest exist and there 
      may be some basis for that belief. In those circumstances the arrest, though 
      subsequently found to be unlawful, could not be said to be capricious or 
      arbitrary.</u> On the other hand, the entire absence of reasonable and probable 
      grounds for the arrest could support an inference that no reasonable person 
      could have genuinely believed that such grounds existed. In such cases, 
      the conclusion would be that the person arrested was arbitrarily detained. 
      Between these two ends of the spectrum, shading from white to gray to black, 
      the issue of whether an accused was arbitrarily detained will depend, basically, 
      on two considerations: first, the particular facts of the case, and secondly, 
      the view taken by the court with respect to the extent of the departure 
      from the standard of reasonable and probable grounds and the honesty of 
      the belief and basis for the belief in the existence of reasonable and probable 
      grounds on the part of the person making the arrest.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Cayer</i> at p. 115, this court held that a detention would 
  be arbitrary for the purpose of s. 495 if it is “capricious, despotic or unjustifiable”.  
  This is simply not an apt description of Constable Sawkins’ conduct.  There 
  is no question that he had reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the 
  plaintiff had committed an indictable offence.  He had interviewed the victim 
  and two other persons.  He was aware that verbal abuse from the plaintiff had 
  escalated, albeit marginally, to assault.  The elderly victim was afraid.  Constable 
  Sawkins and other members of his department were aware of the continuing problems 
  caused by the plaintiff in the neighbourhood.  The arrest itself was conducted 
  properly, courteously, and with attention to the plaintiff’s age and medical 
  condition.  He was held in custody for a short time.  I repeat the finding by 
  the trial judge:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>So what were the Brantford Police officers doing?  The fact is I find they 
      attempted to do good community police work.  They made a full examination 
      of the facts, they thought about a neighbourhood and its problems and its 
      safety.  They dealt with individuals who were aging and perhaps turning 
      inward in their dealing with their neighbours as individuals.</p>
  </blockquote>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> That is hardly a description of capricious, despotic or unjustifiable 
  conduct.  The trial judge and the Divisional Court judge erred in law in failing 
  to consider whether the arrest, even if unlawful, amounted to an arbitrary detention.  
  Accordingly, the finding of liability cannot stand.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge held that the plaintiff had suffered damages 
  in the amount of $6,000 as a result of the two unlawful arrests. As I have said, 
  the appellant no longer contests the finding of liability with respect to the 
  second arrest.  The trial judge did not expressly attribute an amount to each 
  arrest.  He did, however, refer with approval to another case in the Small Claims 
  Court where the judge awarded $3,000 in similar circumstances.  Rather than 
  remit the matter of damages to the trial court I would reduce the amount of 
  the damages to $3,000.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
