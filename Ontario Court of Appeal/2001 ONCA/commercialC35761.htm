<h4 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h4>
<p> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is an unusual motion for this court. The respondent in the appeal 
  has obtained an order under Rule 63.01(5) lifting the stay of execution which 
  otherwise attaches when an appeal is filed. However, the appellant has proved 
  skilful in moving his receivables into new corporate entities with the result 
  that execution on the judgment has proved very difficult for the respondent. 
</p>
<p> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> One such corporate entity is WMH Inc., a corporation which has been 
  found by Sachs J. to be, in effect, the alter ego of the appellant. Sachs J. 
  was asked only to allow a garnishment against WMH Inc. to be effective to the 
  extent of 20% of any payments on the basis that the garnishee was paying the 
  appellant’s wages to the corporation WMH Inc. The respondent now wants this 
  court to make an order allowing the sheriff to seize all assets of WMH Inc. 
  without limitation. </p>
<p> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The final fact in the mix is that the appellant has filed a Notice of 
  Intent to Make a Proposal under the <i>BIA</i>, and has followed with the Proposal. 
  Under s. 69 of the <i>BIA</i>, all enforcement proceedings by creditors are 
  now stayed. The appellant now argues that if the corporation is his alter ego, 
  then the stay against the appellant applies to enforcement against the corporation 
  as well. He says that the respondent judgment creditor should seek its remedy 
  lifting the <i>BIA</i> stay on terms under s. 69(4) of the <i>BIA</i> in the 
  Commercial List (or the Superior Court), not in this court.</p>
<p> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This court’s jurisdiction is said to be found first in Rule 63.01(5) 
  because the stay pending appeal was lifted by this court, and in Rule 60.17(c) 
  which provides: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>60.17  Where a question arises in relation to the measures to be taken 
      by a sheriff in carrying out an order, writ of execution or notice of garnishment, 
      the sheriff or any interested person may make a motion for directions,</p>
    <p>. . .</p>
    <p>(c)  where an appeal has been taken from the original order, to a judge 
      of the court to which the appeal has been taken, at any place.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With respect to Rule 60.17(c), I am not satisfied that the “order” referred 
  to in that subsection is the original judgment under appeal, rather than a separate 
  order made to the sheriff and which has been appealed. In any event, even if 
  this court has jurisdiction to order the relief requested, in my view it ought 
  not to do so in the current circumstances of this case. </p>
<p> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The judgment below is under appeal. There is now no stay of execution. 
  However, matters arising in the enforcement of judgments are to be heard in 
  the Superior Court and matters arising under the <i>BIA</i> in the Bankruptcy 
  Court. In my view the relief requested here falls under both of those jurisdictions 
  and is properly dealt with under the provisions of the <i>BIA</i> and the applicable 
  <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> by the Superior Court, as was done by Sachs 
  J. </p>
<p> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Proposal as filed is problematic: it makes no mention of the appeal, 
  nor does it refer to the obligation to pay legal fees in connection with the 
  appeal as an expense of the appellant. Counsel assures the court that the trustee 
  is aware of the appeal, and that he is aware of these proceedings and does not 
  wish to attend. It may be otherwise if the matter is brought on in Bankruptcy 
  Court.</p>
<p> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In order to preserve the status quo, while this matter is properly pursued 
  in the appropriate forum, para. 2 of the interim order of Laskin J.A. shall 
  remain in full force and effect until a further order is made by the Superior 
  Court (or Commercial List) the matter to be brought on there by either party 
  or by WMH Inc. on proper material.</p>
<p> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Costs of this motion fixed at $2,000 to be payable as directed by the 
  Superior Court.</p>
