  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Crown opposes bail in this case primarily 
  on the public interest ground (s.&nbsp;679(3)(c)). The Crown points out that 
  the appellant has one fail to appear on his record. Counsel also argues forcefully 
  that although the appeal cannot be said to be frivolous, the likelihood of success 
  on appeal against conviction is not high, given the trial judge’s consideration 
  of the issues of necessity and reliability in admitting the out-of-court statements 
  of the four-year old complainant, and his reasons for ultimately relying on 
  those statements. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Counsel points out further that the appellant 
  has breached previous bail orders including the day after his conviction when 
  he was released prior to sentencing. At that time he was babysitting children. 
  As this matter and the previous convictions involve sexual assault of children, 
  the breach is a particularly serious one. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Crown also points out that the appeal should 
  be able to be heard early in the new year as the transcript will be complete 
  by the end of next week.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I agree that I am not satisfied that the appellant’s 
  detention is not necessary in the public interest in all of the circumstances 
  of this case. The application for bail pending appeal is denied. </span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I note that the appellant also has a 60-day 
  consecutive sentence to serve. In the event his appeal is successful, he may 
  be able to have part of the time he is serving be attributable to that sentence.<u></u></span></p>
