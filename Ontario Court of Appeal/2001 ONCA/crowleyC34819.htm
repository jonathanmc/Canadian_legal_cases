      <p align="left"><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice 
        Chester C. Misener dated July 13, 2000.</span></p>
      <h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The principal focus of the argument of 
        this appeal was the legal effect to be given to the brief discussion between 
        Mr. Crowley and Mr. Junker, to which Mr. Crowley testified in these terms:</span></p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>... and then I said that we were going to be looking at some corn.  
          </p>
          <p>And he says, well, he says, I have got corn for sale too.  ... and 
            I said to him, I says, is it good corn.  And he said yes, it is, he 
            said he’d been – he had sold some to Tavistock, Yantzi Feeds, and 
            he said they tested it, it’s good corn.  I said okay.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> Misener J. found that the effect of this conversation, 
        in the context of the parties’ intention, was to create a warranty that 
        the corn sold by the appellant would be suitable for the purpose of feeding 
        to the respondents’ pigs.  </p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span>         </span>In coming to that conclusion, he 
        addressed the intention of both Mr. Junker and Mr. Crowley.  He described 
        Mr. Junker’s intention in these terms, in paragraph 71 of his reasons 
        for judgment:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p><span lang=EN-US>... there is no doubt but that Mr. Junker intended 
            the warranty to mean that the corn was Grade #2 in appearance and 
            weight and suitable for the purpose of feeding the plaintiffs’ pigs.</span></p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>This finding accurately reflected Mr. Junker’s evidence at the trial.</span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> Mr. Crowley’s testimony was that the expression “good corn” 
        in the industry meant “grade one, grade two, more closer to grade two 
        corn, mold free and toxin free”.  He modified the expressions “mold free” 
        and “toxin free” on his cross-examination, but agreed with the trial judge’s 
        encapsulation of his evidence that “all of these specific words, toxins 
        and molds, generally speaking were not used, it was this all encompassing 
        word or expression ‘no problem’”.</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span>   </span>From these expressions of the parties’ 
        understanding of the meaning of “good corn”, Misener J. drew the conclusion 
        that Mr. Junker, as vendor, was warranting to Mr.&nbsp;Crowley, as purchaser, 
        that the corn would be suitable for the purpose of feeding to the respondents’ 
        pigs.  He went on to find that it was not suitable for that purpose and 
        that the damage to the pigs was caused by toxic substances in the corn.  
        He assessed the respondents’ damages at $36,500.  These latter findings 
        and assessment were not challenged by the appellant.</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span>   </span>In his able argument, counsel for the appellant 
        also put the issue on the basis of risk allocation:  as between two farmers, 
        who ought to bear the risk that the corn would  not be suitable for feeding 
        to the respondent’s pigs?</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> The trial judge found that Mr. Junker intended to make 
        his affirmation that the corn was “good corn” a term of the contract.  
        As noted above, both men essentially agreed that that phrase meant it 
        was grade 2 corn and relatively free of toxins or molds such that it was 
        suitable for feeding to pigs. </p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> The evidence was, however, that because corn is not normally 
        lab-tested in order to make that determination, and usually contains some 
        toxins and mold, farmers rely on the fact that corn from various suppliers 
        is blended together at the supplier, which has the effect of diluting 
        any toxins or mold, to make the blended corn suitable to feed to pigs. 
        The feed suppliers then, in effect, field test the product by selling 
        it and receiving reports as to its suitability.  But that does not happen 
        with the corn of a single farmer, which is not mixed or diluted.  Such 
        corn therefore cannot be said to be “good corn” in the sense understood 
        in the industry without dilution or field testing, unless it has been 
        fed to pigs.  Mr. Junker knew the corn was not blended with other corn 
        and had not been fed to his own pigs.</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> However, Mr. Junker did not qualify his statement that 
        the corn was “good corn”.  The trial&nbsp;judge found that it was reasonable 
        in these circumstances for Mr. Crowley to assume&nbsp;that, as Mr. Junker 
        stated it was “good corn”, he must have tested the corn by feeding it 
        to his own pigs.  By stating that the corn was “good corn”, Mr. Junker 
        assumed, in contractual terms, the risk that it would not be suitable 
        to be fed to Mr.&nbsp;Crowley’s pigs.</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In our view, it was open to Misener J. 
        on the evidence that was before him, referred to above, to draw the conclusion 
        regarding warranty that he did and, notwithstanding Mr. Shaheen’s capable 
        submissions, we are not persuaded that he erred in doing so.</span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
