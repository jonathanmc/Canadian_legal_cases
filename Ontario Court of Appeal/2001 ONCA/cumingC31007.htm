  was convicted of robbery while using a firearm, wearing a disguise, and possession 
  of stolen property in relation to an armed robbery of a jewellery store in Etobicoke

  stolen in the robbery; and (c) the use of hearsay evidence to prove joint possession 
  of the same items of jewellery.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> On April&nbsp;10, 1997, two employees of Humbertown Jewellers 
  in Etobicoke unlocked the door to a man they recognized as having been in the 
  store as a customer a week or two previously. Instead of coming in, the man 
  held the door open for a period of time. This concerned one of the employees 
  who went into the back room of the store and pushed a button that sounded a 
  silent alarm. At this point, two masked men entered the store with the first 
  man who pulled the collar of his sweater up over his face. The two employees 
  were instructed to lie face down on the floor while the three men broke a number 
  of display cases and took some jewellery.  Within 45 seconds, the three men 
  left with over $400,000 worth of watches, bracelets, and other jewellery. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It was the Crown’s theory at trial that the 
  man who first came to the door was the appellant. The Crown’s case consisted 
  of three main components: (a) eyewitness identification evidence; (b) evidence 
  of possession of three stolen watches giving rise to the doctrine of recent 
  possession; and (c) other circumstantial evidence linking the appellant to one 
  of the masked robbers and to the jewellery taken in the robbery. In a nutshell, 
  this evidence was as follows: </span></p>
<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left;'><i><span lang=EN-US><b>(a)

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Both employees of the store recognized the first 
  assailant as a previous customer. They each provided descriptions of him on 
  the offence date and gave similar descriptions of him at trial. One of the employees 
  made a tentative identification of the appellant in a police photo line-up, 
  recognized him about a year after the offence at the courthouse in connection 
  with another proceeding, and identified him in court at the preliminary hearing 
  and at trial. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Four still photographs from the store security 
  video camera were enhanced and two witnesses at trial identified the appellant 
  from these enhanced stills: Det. Yarenko, the officer in charge of the investigation; 
  and Maureen Tobin, the ex-girlfriend of Felix Parum, one of the two masked robbers. 
  A second investigating officer could not identify the appellant from the enhanced 
  photographs. The members of the jury were invited to make their own identification 
  of the appellant from these photographs. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Nine days after the robbery, the appellant was 
  stopped for speeding by a State Trooper in Texas. He was in the company of Felix 
  Parum. The appellant gave the State Trooper permission to search his vehicle. 
  The State Trooper discovered a number of watches secreted in the lining of Parum’s 
  coat. These watches were later discovered to have been stolen in the robbery.

  </span></span> It was the Crown’s theory that the appellant and Parum were in 
  joint possession of the watches and that the doctrine of recent possession gave 
  rise to the inference that the appellant had committed the robbery.  In order 
  to prove that the appellant was in joint possession of the watches found in 
  Parum’s coat, the Crown relied on the following items of evidence: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(i) the fact that the car driven by the appellant in Texas belonged 
      to his mother thereby giving him control over its contents, including the 
      watches in Parum’s coat; </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(ii) the appellant’s failure to show surprise together with his alleged 
      utterance “we’re toast”, made to the State Trooper at the time the watches 
      were found and allegedly repeated several times thereafter; </span></p>
    <p>(iii) the appellant’s failure to give an explanation to the State Trooper 
      at the time the watches were found;   </p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(iv) the appellant’s refusal to sign a waiver form provided by the 
      State Trooper in relation to the watches; and </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(v) the State Trooper’s testimony that he was later informed by a lawyer 
      that the appellant and Parum intended to claim the watches at a civil proceeding 
      to determine the ownership of the watches. </span></p>

  </span></span> It was uncontested at trial that Felix Parum was one of the masked 
  robbers. Parum’s ex-girlfriend, Maureen Tobin, testified for the Crown. Tobin 
  had assisted Parum in disposing of guns and stolen jewellery. At the time she 
  gave evidence she was facing a charge of possession of stolen property. Tobin 
  testified that Parum and the appellant were often together around the time of 
  the robbery, and that Parum had given the appellant jewellery in exchange for 
  money on more than one occasion in the days that followed the robbery.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Cell phone records showed increased contacts 
  between the appellant and Parum on the day of the robbery, no calls at the time 
  of the robbery, and two calls between them after the robbery on that same day. 
  Records for the appellant’s bank account revealed a series of cash transactions 
  in the weeks following the robbery. </span></p>

  that there was insufficient evidence that he was in joint possession of the 
  watches in Texas, and that Tobin was not a credible witness. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge gave the following instructions 
  to the jury in relation to the store employees’ identification evidence: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>On the issue of identification normally I would 
      be required to give you a charge on the dangers of eye witness testimony 
      but in this case as I will tell you in a moment the evidence of the 2 employees, 
      although their evidence may be helpful to you in other areas their evidence 
      in law does not amount to identification.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>You’ll recall that the gentleman, Mr.&nbsp;Youngson, 
      when he viewed the line up said something to the effect if number 3 had 
      a moustache and a five o’clock shadow he could be one of the robbers.  That 
      is, in law, not identification.  Although he purports to see this accused 
      about a year later at the East Mall courthouse and identifies him there 
      that identification is flawed by the fact he has seen a picture of the accused 
      and of course you’ll recall that he asked the Officer whether he was correct 
      or not.  So I tell you as a matter of law although his evidence may be helpful 
      in other areas that his purported identification of this accused as one 
      of the robbers is not a basis for your consideration.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>Similarly, the female employee, Michaela Corrado, 
      made no identification at all.  She was somehow attracted to picture number 
      3 but did not identify picture number&nbsp;3 and said something to the effect 
      the ears are too big and you’ll recall the Officer that showed her the photo 
      line up noted in his book was unable to make an identification.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect to the identification of the appellant 
  from the enhanced video photographs, the trial judge gave the following brief 
  instruction: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>As far as Detective Yarenko’s identification of the accused in Exhibit 
      20 and the other photos you, the jury, are in as good a position as the 
      Officer is to see how valid that identification is and you may come to the 
      conclusion that his identification of the accused in Exhibit 20 may somehow 
      be the result of the other evidence that he has heard in this courtroom 
      rather than identifying the person solely by the picture. </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant takes the position that the trial 
  judge was correct in instructing the jury that the evidence of Mr. Youngson 
  and Ms. Corrado did not, in law, amount to evidence identification. However, 
  he takes issue with the latter instruction in relation to Detective Yarenko’s 
  identification. He submits that the instruction did not go far enough for three 
  reasons: first, at no time did the trial judge warn the jury to exercise any 
  caution in attempting to identify the appellant from the photograph, as is required 
  by the jurisprudence; second, Detective Yarenko’s purported identification of 
  the appellant in the photograph was non-expert opinion evidence deserving of 
  no weight and the jury should have been so told in clear terms; and third, Maureen 
  Tobin purported to identify the appellant from the photograph, and no warning 
  whatsoever was given respecting her evidence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown argues that no further jury instruction 
  was required in the circumstances. Crown counsel submits that the officer’s 
  opinion with respect to the enhanced photos was just a small part of the Crown’s 
  case but that it was nonetheless deserving of consideration by the jury because 
  the officer had seen the appellant on a number of occasions and hence had a 
  better opportunity to make the visual comparison than the jury did. The Crown 
  argues further that there was no risk that the jury would have given Detective 
  Yarenko’s evidence special added value because the trial judge had alerted the 
  jury, elsewhere in his charge, that police officers should be assessed like 
  any other witness. In any event, Crown counsel argues that the obvious force 
  and effect of the judge’s instruction was to take the officer’s evidence on 
  this point away from the jury because they were told that they were in as good 
  a position as the officer to decide if the appellant was the person in the photo. 
  The Crown argues further that the appellant had the undeserved windfall that 
  the trial judge’s charge in effect took away from the jury the identification 
  evidence of both eyewitnesses to the robbery. While the Crown agrees that their 
  evidence did not constitute a positive identification upon which the jury could 
  have acted alone, it is submitted that the witnesses’ identification evidence 
  should have been left for the jury’s consideration together with the rest of 
  the evidence. Finally, the Crown submits that it is noteworthy that no objection 
  was made to the charge by defence counsel at trial. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is my view that the instructions to the jury 
  with respect to the identification evidence were inadequate in several respects 
  and, in the circumstances of this case where identification was the sole issue 
  for the jury, the verdict cannot stand. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>First, I agree with the appellant’s submission 
  that it was incumbent upon the trial judge to instruct the jury to exercise 
  caution in attempting to identify the appellant from the videotape and enhanced 
  photographs. Although the videotape and the original enhanced photographs were 
  not available for review on appeal, we were advised by counsel that the evidence 
  was of poor quality. The poor quality was certainly apparent from the photocopies 
  of the evidence that were presented to this court. This made it all the more 
  important to give appropriate instructions to the jury. The Supreme Court of 
  Canada decision in <i>R. v. Nikolovski</i> (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 403 at 417 
  (S.C.C.) provides useful guidance on this point. Cory J., in writing for the

      so</i>.  For example, when a jury is asked to identify an accused in this 
      manner, <i>it is essential that clear directions be given to them as to 
      how they are to approach this task.  They should be instructed to consider 
      carefully whether the video is of sufficient clarity and quality and shows 
      the accused for a sufficient time to enable them to conclude that identification 
      has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt</i>.  If it is the only evidence 
      adduced as to identity, the jury should be reminded of this.  Further, they 
      should be told once again of the importance that, in order to convict on 
      the basis of the videotape alone, they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable 
      doubt that it identifies the accused. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> Second, it is my view that the instruction with respect to Detective 
  Yarenko was also inadequate. Non-expert opinion evidence on such matters as 
  identification is admissible but, as with any opinion evidence, there must be 
  some basis for the opinion before it can be given any weight and the jury should 
  be given some assistance in assessing the basis for the opinion. Crown counsel 
  submits that the officer had a better opportunity to make the visual comparison 
  than the jury did. It is not clear from the record to what extent he would have 
  had a better opportunity. There was no evidence that he knew the appellant other 
  than through his investigation of this robbery and no particulars on the extent 
  of his dealings with the appellant. Further, it was the trial judge’s view that 
  the members of the jury were in as good a position as the officer to make an 
  identification from the photographs. If that was indeed the case, it seems to 
  me that the officer’s opinion on the identity of the person in the photograph 
  was irrelevant and should not have been received. Finally, I cannot agree with 
  Crown counsel’s submission that this item of evidence was of relative unimportance. 
  Crown counsel in her closing address relied on the officer’s testimony and the 
  trial judge also reviewed this evidence in his charge. It is unknown what reliance 
  the jury may have placed on the officer’s identification.   </p>

  </span></span> There is one final point I wish to make with respect to the trial 
  judge’s instructions on identification evidence. Although this matter was not 
  raised by counsel on appeal, it may become of relevance at the new trial. As 
  noted in the excerpt from the charge reproduced above, the trial judge told 
  the jury that he did not have to give them the usual charge on the dangers of 
  identification evidence with respect to the employees’ testimony because their 
  evidence of the photo lineup and the in-dock identification did not constitute 
  an identification at law. It was within the trial judge’s discretion to tell 
  the jury that they should disregard the purported identification made by these 
  witnesses. However, it is my view that  it was nonetheless incumbent upon the 
  trial judge to give an appropriate instruction on the frailties of identification 
  evidence. Quite apart from the relevance of such an instruction in relation 
  to the identification by other witnesses based on the enhanced photos, the instruction 
  was also necessary with respect to that part of the employees’ testimony that 
  was left for the jury’s consideration. Both employees gave descriptions of the 
  unmasked robber and the Crown placed much reliance on this evidence in her closing 
  address to the jury. The trial judge also reviewed this evidence in his charge. 
  This evidence was subject to many of the usual frailties of eyewitness identification 
  and the jury should have been cautioned accordingly. For a useful review of 
  the relevant factors to be considered in the assessment of identification evidence, 
  see <i>R. v. Smierciak</i> (1946), 87 C.C.C. 175 (Ont. C.A.); see also <i>R. 
  v. Miaponoose</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont. C.A.).</p>

  </span></span> As noted earlier, it was the Crown’s theory at trial that the 
  appellant and Parum were in joint possession of the watches found by the State 
  Trooper in Texas in the lining of Parum’s coat, and that the doctrine of recent 
  possession gave rise to the inference that the appellant had committed the robbery.  
  In order to prove that the appellant was in joint possession of the watches 
  found in Parum’s coat, the Crown relied in part on the appellant’s failure to 
  give an explanation to the State Trooper at the time the watches were found, 
  and on his later refusal to sign a waiver form. The appellant submits that this 
  evidence, which consisted of an exercise by the appellant of his right to silence, 
  was inadmissible for the purpose submitted by the Crown. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown submits that the appellant’s right 
  to silence was not denied by the admission of this evidence since the evidence 
  was only descriptive of the appellant’s inaction with respect to the watches. 
  The Crown argues further that the appellant’s constitutional right to silence, 
  as guaranteed under s.7 of the <i>Charter</i>, does not extend to transactions 
  occurring outside Canada. In the alternative, if the appellant can invoke the 
  <i>Charter</i> with respect to the admission of this evidence at trial, the 
  Crown submits that it is incumbent upon the appellant to show that the use of 
  this evidence caused an unfair trial. It is submitted that there was no unfairness 
  in the circumstances of this case because this was not a pivotal argument for 
  the Crown, and the appellant did not object to the admissibility of the evidence 
  at trial.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The use that was made of this evidence at trial 
  is reflected in Crown counsel’s closing address:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>I expect His Honour will instruct you on the doctrine of recent possession. 
      Based on this if you find that the accused was in joint possession of watches 
      and it was recent you can infer he participated in the robbery.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p>On the issue of possession you must consider several pieces of evidence.  
      First of all, the watches were in the car of the accused’s mother.  He certainly 
      had control over the car and its contents.  Next consider his reaction when 
      the watches were found.  He didn’t react at all.  If he had no prior knowledge 
      of those watches would you not expect him to show some surprise?  What you 
      do in that situation if you were in Texas with a friend, stopped by a State 
      Trooper and much to your surprise your friend had 4 stolen Rolex watches? 
      What would your reaction be?  <i>I suggest you would either tell the Trooper 
      I’ve never seen those watches before or turn to your friend and demand an 
      explanation.</i></p>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US>Mr.&nbsp;Cuming did neither of those things</span></i>.  
      Instead, when he is first asked about the watches by the State Trooper, 
      he says, “We’re toast”.  And he repeats that phrase several times.  <br>
      That phrase has only one meaning.  Mr.&nbsp;Cuming is saying, we’ve been 
      caught with stolen watches and there is no innocent explanation for it.</p>
    <p><i>Perhaps more significantly you have the evidence of the waiver.  At 
      the station Mr.&nbsp;Cuming was given an opportunity to say he knew nothing 
      about those watches and had no property interest in them.</i><span>  </span>Again, 
      ladies and gentlemen, put yourself in that position.  If you were with a 
      friend who had stolen watches that you knew absolutely nothing about <i>I 
      suggest you would sign that waiver in a second.  You would not hesitate 
      to sign it.  If the watches were not his what did Mr.&nbsp;Cuming have to 
      lose by signing that waiver?  I submit he didn’t want to sign it because 
      the watches were his, his and Felix’s, and they wanted those watches badly 
      enough to commit an armed robbery at the Humbertown Jewellery Store</i>.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>….</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>On the Texas evidence, <i>particularly the refusal to sign the waiver 
      form</i>, I submit the evidence is very clear the accused was in joint possession 
      of those watches with Felix Parum. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also highlighted this evidence 
  when he reviewed the Crown’s theory during his charge:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>After the accused knew that the watches were not recorded on any database 
      they had access to he refused to sign the waiver form.  This and other surrounding 
      circumstances she argues proves this accused had joint possession of those 
      watches with Felix and that gives rise to the doctrine of recent possession 
      as I have explained it to you.  <i>She argues that the Texas evidence alone 
      makes out the case against the accused</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant does not contend that the evidence 
  of his apparent lack of surprise and his alleged utterance (“we’re toast”) when 
  the watches were found was inadmissible. He submits, however, that the Crown 
  made an improper use of his failure to provide an explanation to the State Trooper 
  about the watches and his refusal to sign the waiver. He submits these two items 
  of evidence were instances when he exercised his right to silence and that the 
  use of this evidence to prove his guilt was improper. The appellant relies more 
  particularly on the decision in <i>R. v. Chambers</i> (1990), 59 C.C.C. (3d) 
  321 (S.C.C.) where the Supreme Court of Canada held that it was “now well recognized 
  that there is a right to silence which can properly be exercised by an accused 
  person in the investigative stages of the proceedings” (at 340). Counsel for 
  the appellant submits that the determinative question is the same whether the 
  issue is considered according to common law principles or under s.7 of the <i>Charter</i>. 
  In either case, the question is whether the use of this evidence rendered the 
  trial unfair. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, I will deal with the issue raised by the Crown about the 
  territorial application of the <i>Charter. </i> In my view, no jurisdictional 
  issue arises here. The appellant is not alleging that the conduct of State Trooper 
  McFarland violated his rights. He takes the position, rather, that evidence 
  of his silence was inadmissible to prove his guilt at his trial and that the 
  impermissible use of this evidence resulted in an unfair trial. There is no 
  doubt that the trial judge, at common law, has the power to exclude evidence 
  that would result in an unfair trial: see <i>R. v. Harrer </i>(1995), 101 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 193 at 205 (S.C.C.). The right to a fair trial, of course, is now constitutionalized 
  by its enshrinement in the <i>Charter.</i> Hence a <i>Charter</i> application 
  could have been brought on the basis that the admission of the impugned evidence 
  would violate the appellant’s rights under s.7 or s.11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>. 
  No jurisdictional issue would have arisen on such an application where the alleged 
  violation is the admission of the evidence at the appellant’s trial here in 
  Canada. I agree with counsel for the appellant that, in the circumstances of 
  this case, the issue is the same whether the matter is considered according 
  to common-law principles or under s.7 of the <i>Charter </i>– it is a question 
  of fairness. In this case, since no <i>Charter</i> application was brought by 
  the appellant, the issue should be determined in accordance with common-law 
  principles.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The first item of evidence in question here 
  concerns the appellant’s failure to provide an explanation to the State Trooper 
  on the side of the road at the time the watches were found. In my view, the 
  appellant is correct in his submission that he had no obligation to provide 
  an explanation to the authorities and, to the extent that the Crown’s address 
  to the jury may have suggested otherwise, it was improper and the jury should 
  have been instructed accordingly. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A further difficulty arises from the use that 
  Crown counsel sought to make of the fact that there was no explanation provided 
  in relation to the watches. The absence of an explanation was relevant in the 
  application of what is commonly referred to as the doctrine of recent possession. 
  A succinct statement of this principle can be found in <i>R. v. Kowlyk</i> (1988), 
  43 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 12-13 (S.C.C.):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>In summary, then, it is my view, based on the cases, both English and 
      Canadian, which I have referred to, that what has been called the doctrine 
      of recent possession may be succinctly stated in the following terms. Upon 
      proof of the unexplained possession of recently stolen property, the trier 
      of fact may – but not must – draw an inference of guilt of theft or of offences 
      incidental thereto. Where the circumstances are such that a question could 
      arise as to whether the accused was a thief or merely a possessor, it will 
      be for the trier of fact upon a consideration of all the circumstances to 
      decide which, if either, inference should be drawn. In all recent possession 
      cases the inference of guilt is permissive, not mandatory, and when an explanation 
      is offered which might reasonably be true, even though the trier of fact 
      is not satisfied of its truth, the doctrine will not apply. </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown in her closing address misapplied 
  these principles when she sought to use the absence of an explanation to prove 
  that the appellant was in joint possession of the watches. The appellant’s silence 
  does not give rise to any inference that he is in possession of the goods in 
  question and the jury should have been instructed to disregard any suggestion 
  to the contrary. As noted in <i>Kowlyk</i>, the doctrine of recent possession 
  simply describes a permissible inference that may be drawn from certain facts. 
  Before any inference may be drawn, however, those facts have to be proven. The 
  trier of fact must be satisfied that (a) the person is in possession of the 
  goods; (b) the goods were stolen; and (c) the theft was recent. In addition, 
  if an explanation is provided, the jury must be satisfied that it could not 
  reasonably be true before it may draw an inference that the person is the thief 
  or that he knew the goods were stolen. A proper application of these principles 
  does not give rise to any issue with respect to an offender’s right to silence.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>While the trial judge did explain the doctrine 
  of recent possession for the jury in terms consistent with <i>Kowlyk</i>, he 
  did not relate the law to the evidence. On the facts of this case, it is my 
  view that it was important to provide this assistance for the jury. In particular, 
  I am not sure that it would have been clear to the jury what evidence they could 
  consider to determine such matters as possession by this appellant, recency 
  of the theft, and which of the two inferences, if any, could be drawn from the 
  evidence. Since the appellant was charged with both robbery and possession of 
  stolen goods, it was particularly incumbent upon the trial judge to assist the 
  jury in distinguishing between the two different inferences that may be drawn 
  from a person’s unexplained possession of recently stolen goods. Whether the 
  inference may be drawn that the person actually stole the goods or that he simply 
  knew that they were stolen depends on all the circumstances. In this case, given 
  the nature of the goods in question, it was at least questionable whether the 
  fact of possession some nine days later could reasonably give rise to the inference 
  that the person in possession actually stole the goods. This distinction was 
  never explained to the jury. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Next, I will deal with the appellant’s refusal 
  to sign a “Voluntary Disclaimer of Interest and Ownership” form. State Trooper 
  McFarland, during his testimony in-chief, explained how this form was presented 
  to the appellant:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Q.        What did you say to him about the form?</p>
    <p>A.        We explained it to him and told him that it gives him the opportunity 
      to make claim to the property or deny ownership or interest in the property 
      and that it wasn’t a criminal matter, it was a civil matter.  It wouldn’t 
      have any effect on any criminal charges.  That it was primarily just so 
      that he could claim the ownership.  By refusing to sign it he will be claiming 
      ownership to the property and by signing it he would be disclaiming any 
      ownership or interest in the property.</p>
    <p>Q.        Did you ask if he wanted to sign the form?</p>
    <p>A.        Yes.</p>
    <p>Q.        What was his response?</p>
    <p>A.        Said he didn’t want to sign it.  He said we wanted to see a lawyer.  
      Said “we’re toast”.</p>

  </span></span> In my view, it is clear from the evidence that the authorities 
  were investigating into the ownership of the watches when they presented the 
  appellant with the waiver form and that the appellant was exercising his right 
  to remain silent when he chose not to sign it.  In these circumstances, it was 
  improper to use the appellant’s refusal to sign the waiver as evidence that 
  he was claiming ownership. I disagree with Crown counsel’s submission that this 
  evidence was not pivotal. As the trial judge noted to the jury in reviewing 
  the Crown’s position at trial, “[Crown counsel] argues that the Texas evidence 
  alone makes the case against the accused.” Hence, it is my view that the use 
  of this evidence to prove guilt was inconsistent with the appellant’s right 
  to silence and that it compromised the fairness of the trial.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I am not unmindful of the fact that the admissibility 
  of this evidence was not objected to at trial. The failure to object at trial 
  is a relevant factor on appeal and at times can be determinative of the result. 
  However, the appellant is not precluded from raising the issue for the first 
  time on appeal. And in the circumstances of this case, where the evidentiary 
  record is complete, no tactical reason can explain the failure to object, and 
  a question of fairness arises, I would give effect to this ground of appeal

  much attention by the jury. However, Crown counsel, in her closing address,
