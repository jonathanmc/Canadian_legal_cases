  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellants, Paul Mazza and Nigel Stephen 
  Axton, non-parties in these bankruptcy proceedings, appeal the judgment of Ground&nbsp;J. 
  awarding costs against them.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The parties are in agreement that this appeal can be brought 
  under s.&nbsp;193(c) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, 
  c.&nbsp;B-3 (&quot;the Act&quot;) as of right.  The property involved in this 
  appeal exceeds in value ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ted Pangia and Dallas/North&nbsp;Group&nbsp;Inc. (&quot;D/NG&quot;) 
  were petitioned into bankruptcy on the basis of a promissory note made by them.  
  It was alleged that Pangia and D/NG had ceased to meet their liabilities generally 
  as they became due.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>After reviewing a complicated factual situation, 
  based on a long and tortuous history, the trial judge concluded that the petitioning 
  creditors had failed to establish by sound and convincing evidence either the 
  debt alleged to be owing or the alleged acts of bankruptcy.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also concluded that there was 
  overwhelming evidence that the petitions had been brought for a collateral purpose, 
  namely to remove Pangia as an officer and director of a third-party company, 
  Ecology Pure Air International Inc. (&quot;EPAI&quot;) and reduce his shareholdings, 
  and not for the purpose of obtaining a distribution of the property among creditors.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge further concluded that it was apparent that there 
  had been a concentrated effort orchestrated by Paul Mazza and Nigel Stephen 
  Axton of bullying, harassment and intimidation against Pangia and that it was 
  difficult to think of a clearer example of petitions in bankruptcy having been 
  brought for an improper collateral purpose.  The barrage of proceedings brought 
  against Pangia and D/NG constituted an abuse of process and was orchestrated 
  by Mazza and Axton.  The trial judge found it most disturbing that the misconduct 
  of Mazza and Axton was carried out using the court system as a vehicle and that 
  a lawyer participated in the scheme.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The petitions were accordingly dismissed.  There is no appeal 
  from this decision.  The conclusions reached by the trial judge about the improprieties 
  underlying the bankruptcy proceedings, therefore, remain unchallenged.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Having ordered costs against certain parties 
  to the bankruptcy which were without assets, the trial judge asked for written 
  submissions from counsel as to other persons against whom the costs order should 
  be made.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Pangia made written submissions for costs in a fixed amount against 
  Mazza and Axton.  Counsel for Mazza and Axton responded with written submissions.  
  After reviewing the bill of costs submitted by Pangia's counsel, the trial judge 
  made certain deductions and fixed the bill of costs at $60,000 inclusive of 
  fees, disbursements and GST.  He ordered the costs to be paid by EPAI, Mazza 
  and Axton.  As stated earlier, neither Mazza nor Axton was a party in the proceedings.  
  Mazza was a witness.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is our view that the costs conclusions of the trial judge 
  are proper, given the evidence.  We have not been shown any error in principle 
  which affected the exercise of his discretion, particularly given his conclusions 
  that the petitions were in fact brought for a collateral purpose and constituted 
  an abuse of process.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Costs in bankruptcy proceedings are in the discretion of the 
  court pursuant to s.&nbsp;197(1) of the Act.  There are no words limiting this 
  section which, on its face, gives the court the widest discretion.  The Act 
  is a federal statute which must be interpreted within its own parameters.  A 
  court must be careful to avoid interpreting a federal statute using local rules 
  of practice not necessarily found in other provinces.</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Rockwell Developments Ltd. v. Newtonbrook Plaza Ltd.</i>, 
  [1972] 3 O.R. 199 (C.A.), the court was interpreting s.&nbsp;131 of the <i>Courts 
  of Justice Act (Ontario</i>) which has different wording than s.&nbsp;197(1) 
  of the Act.  See also <i>Oasis Hotel Ltd. v. Zurich Insurance Co.</i> (1981), 
  124 D.L.R. (3d) 455 (B.C.C.A.).</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US>In Re Sturmer &amp; Town of Beaverton</span></i> 
  (1912), 25 O.L.R. 566 (Div. Ct.) was properly applied by the trial judge.  He 
  recognized that the criteria of the &quot;man of straw&quot; exception could 
  not be met and that it was not technically a case of maintenance.  Unlike certain 
  authorities referred to by the appellants (<i>Rockwell Developments Ltd. v. 
  Newtonbrook Plaza Ltd.</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Television Real Estate Limited 
  v. Rogers Cable T.V. Limited</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 291 (C.A.); <i>XLO Investments 
  v. Hurontario Management Services</i> (1999), 118 O.A.C. 258 (C.A.) the principles 
  that are applicable in the present case are principles about costs involving 
  duplicity and abuse of the court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There are special policy considerations to take into account 
  when dealing with abuse of process in bankruptcy court because bankruptcy proceedings 
  are quasi-criminal in nature and a petition in bankruptcy can destroy a person's 
  financial standing and reputation.  A harsher consequence in costs against a 
  person who misuses the bankruptcy court for an improper collateral purpose is 
  therefore justified.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the present case, extensive evidence was led concerning all 
  of the vexatious steps taken against Pangia and D/NG.  The trial judge was fully 
  informed in that regard.  The trial judge invited and received written submissions 
  on both the law and the bill of costs, as submitted.  Although we recognize 
  that the power to assess costs against non-parties must be used sparingly, we 
  are of the view that the special circumstances of this case warranted the costs 
  order against Mazza and Axton.</p>
