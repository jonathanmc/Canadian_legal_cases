<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Sidney N. Lederman, 
  sitting without a jury, dated February 22, 1999.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge began his reasons for judgment by identifying 
  two issues in this action:  first, the interpretation of a share purchase agreement 
  and whether an income tax refund in the amount of $130,642.16 received by 245039 
  Investments Limited (“039”) constituted an “account receivable” as of the closing 
  date of the agreement; and second, the liability of the defendants in respect 
  of the matter of distribution of a dividend payment, in which the plaintiffs 
  had an interest, made  by Deloitte &amp; Touche Inc. (“Deloitte”) from the bankrupt 
  estate of Darrigo Consolidated Holdings Limited (“Consolidated”).</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> He resolved both issues in favour of the plaintiffs.  In our 
  respectful view, he erred in so doing.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We deal first with the issue of the income tax refund.  The share 
  purchase agreement in question was entered into in June, 1987.  Paragraph 3.01 
  of the agreement defined the three elements of the purchase price:  (i) $650,112 
  in cash; (ii) all sums to be received by the company from the trustee in bankruptcy 
  in respect of sums owed to it by the bankrupt; and (iii)&nbsp;the amount of 
  all of the company’s “cash on hand and <i>accounts</i> <i>receivable</i>”.  
  The agreement contained an “entire agreement” clause.  Paragraph 5.06, entitled 
  “Post Closing”, provided that, following determination of income taxes <i>payable</i> 
  in accordance with para.&nbsp;3.01(iii),  money held in trust was to be paid 
  out  to the vendor in satisfaction of the purchaser’s obligations under that 
  clause.  There was no reference in the agreement to income taxes received or 
  receivable after closing.  The agreement closed in August, 1987.   </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The financial statements and the income tax returns that resulted 
  in the income tax refund in question, based upon an unexpected loss in respect 
  of a loan made by 039 to Consolidated, were not prepared until 1988.  The income 
  tax refund claim for a business loss against current income was ultimately settled 
  and allowed by the federal and provincial revenue departments in 1991.  It is 
  common ground that, at the time of the share purchase agreement in 1987, neither 
  side anticipated the refund or even envisaged that it might be available.  039 
  was a holding company, not a trading corporation and not in the business of 
  making loans, and even the accountant who claimed the refund considered that 
  treatment to be “aggressive”.  In asserting the claim, he did not take the share 
  purchase agreement into account.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the refund was not  an “account receivable” of 039 
  within the contemplation of that term as it appeared in the share purchase agreement.  
  We consider the agreement to be unambiguous in this respect.  The agreement 
  clearly considered and addressed the prospect that the purchase price might 
  be reduced if there proved to be further income tax payable by the company, 
  but not the converse.  The trial judge was in error in seeking to interpret 
  the agreement by having recourse to events in years subsequent to the closing 
  of the agreement and to the treatment of income tax noted in the C.I.C.A. Handbook.  
  Even if he had been entitled to consider such evidence, however, it does not 
  unequivocally support the conclusion he drew from it.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge should have decided the first 
  issue in favour of the defendants.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It follows from our decision on the first issue that the second 
  issue should also have been decided in favour of the defendants.  The portion 
  of the bankruptcy dividend owing to the plaintiffs was paid to them: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      <span>     </span>by deduction of $21,100, which was admittedly owing for 
      legal and accounting fees; </p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span></span> <span>     </span>by 
      the payment by Mr. Saginur, pursuant to direction, of the sum of $80,000 
      then held by him in favour of the purchasers; and</p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>by payment of $177,478 by bank draft.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  <span>      </span>With this deduction and these payments, the portion of the 
  dividend owing to the plaintiffs was paid in full, and no further sum was owed 
  to them by any of the defendants.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In addition to the plaintiffs’ claims regarding the income tax 
  refund and the bankruptcy dividend, the trial judge granted judgment in their 
  favour for “additional items not properly accounted for” totalling $20,759.  
  That claim was asserted in para.&nbsp;23 of the statement of claim.  We accept 
  Mr. Salsberg’s statement that he misspoke when he failed in his opening remarks 
  at trial to draw the trial judge’s attention to the existence of that third 
  claim.  But, in any event, the “additional items” that made up that claim were 
  not established by proper evidence during the trial.  The one witness who was 
  asked about them came on the scene years after the closing of the share purchase 
  agreement and worked solely from schedules on which he recorded amounts of which 
  he had no personal knowledge and into the origin of which he never inquired.  
  The trial judge ought not to have granted judgment for the plaintiffs in respect 
  of these “additional items”.<span lang=EN-US

<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>For these reasons, the appeals are allowed, the 
  judgment of Lederman J. is set aside and, in its place, judgment will go dismissing 
  the plaintiffs’ action with costs.  The costs of the action payable to Deloitte 
  will be assessed on a party-and-party basis.  The costs of the action payable 
  to the defendants other than Deloitte will be assessed on a party-and-party 
  basis to February 10, 1998, the date on which their offer to settle was served, 
  and on a solicitor-and-client basis thereafter.  The cross-claim made by Deloitte 
  will be dismissed without costs.  The appellants will have their costs of their 
  respective appeals, payable forthwith after their assessment.</p>
