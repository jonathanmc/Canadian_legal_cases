  </span></span> David Cooper and Irving Cooper are brothers. Through their respective 
  corporations, they both operate bars on Yonge Street featuring nude female dancers, 
  officially referred to as “adult entertainment”.  In 1992 Irving Cooper was 
  overextended at the bank as a result of a real estate investment he had made. 
  He asked his brother for help in dealing with the bank. With David's help, Irving 
  was able to negotiate an excellent accommodation with the bank, allowing him 
  to retain the Brass Rail Tavern, a profitable business, and to eliminate his 
  other indebtedness to the bank.  As part of this arrangement he was obliged 
  to sell his second bar, the Bermuda Tavern, for a sum which the bank would be 
  prepared to accept in order to discharge his entire indebtedness.  Irving asked 
  his brother if he would purchase the Bermuda Tavern.  David eventually agreed 
  to do so on the basis of a very favourable lease of the Bermuda Tavern which 
  he had negotiated with another Yonge Street businessman, Mr. Pratt, who operated 
  a gay bar which featured nude male dancers, and who needed an adult entertainment 
  license to operate legally. After Irving entered into an agreement to sell the 
  Bermuda Tavern to David, which agreement was approved by the bank, Irving approached 
  Mr. Pratt himself, reneged on his agreement with David, and entered into the 
  favourable lease agreement directly with Mr. Pratt and his sister, with the 
  approval of the bank.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> David sued Irving for specific performance of their agreement.  
  Irving denied there was a finalized contract with David, saying that it was 
  conditional, and counterclaimed for damages for sullying his reputation with 
  the bank and for punitive and exemplary damages for breach of fiduciary duty 
  and fraud.  The trial judge found that the brothers had made an agreement, that 
  there was a condition but that it was satisfied. He denied David the remedy 
  of specific performance but granted him substantial damages against Irving for 
  breach of contract, and dismissed Irving’s counterclaim.</p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although David initially appealed the denial of specific performance, 
  he later abandoned the appeal.  However, Irving proceeded with a cross-appeal, 
  seeking dismissal of David’s claim.  Irving raises three legal bases which he 
  claims preclude David from receiving damages: that when David dealt with Mr. 
  Pratt, he acted as a self-appointed agent for Irving; that in the circumstances, 
  David owed Irving a fiduciary duty; and that the maxim <i>ex turpi causa non 
  oritur actio</i> should have been applied on the basis that the contract between 
  David and Irving was illegal or immoral.  For the reasons that follow, I would 
  dismiss Irving’s appeal.</p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There were three taverns on Yonge Street with adult entertainment 
  licenses: the Zanzibar Tavern (owned by David Cooper) and the Brass Rail and 
  Bermuda Taverns (both owned by Irving Cooper).  The Bermuda Tavern had been 
  operated by the brothers’ father and uncle.  Irving purchased his uncle’s interest 
  in the Bermuda Tavern operation, then purchased the real estate from its owner.  
  When his father died, Irving ran the Bermuda Tavern on his own.  In 1992, the 
  Bermuda Tavern was owned 50% by Irving, 25% by the father’s estate and 25% by 
  their elderly mother.  As the zoning for the area by that time prohibited adult 
  entertainment, the three establishments were unique as prior legal non-conforming 
  uses, as long as the premises continued to be used as adult entertainment taverns.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although both men had been very successful, street-wise entrepreneurs 
  in the tavern and strip-club business, it was David Cooper who had more knowledge 
  of real estate values, and who had political and financial connections and sophistication 
  in dealing with business matters.  He had also been very helpful to Irving over 
  the years, assisting him, without compensation of any kind, when he faced financial 
  difficulties of one sort or another.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1992, Irving found himself in a situation where he was holding 
  land he had purchased for $2,800,000 on Charles Street near the Brass Rail Tavern, 
  intending to develop it as condominiums.  However, the market had fallen and 
  he was overextended with the carrying costs of the property.  He asked his brother 
  David for help.  First he wanted to sell the property to the City of Toronto 
  and David contacted people and attended meetings on Irving’s behalf, but in 
  the end the city did not buy the property.  By the summer of 1992 Irving was 
  at the point of losing everything he owned as a result of his indebtedness to 
  the CIBC.  David spoke to his own branch manager and through him was referred 
  to a work-out specialist, Mr. Brawn, to negotiate for Irving with the CIBC.</p>
<p> <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Brawn had Irving’s loan transferred to the special loans 
  department at the main branch of the bank.  There were several meetings, some 
  of which David attended.  By September, an agreement for a restructuring was 
  reached. The payments contemplated by the agreement were to be in full satisfaction 
  of all indebtedness and would release all of Irving’s companies as well as the 
  personal guarantees he and his wife had given to the bank.  The bank was to 
  receive:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The agreement was signed in December, 1992, to close on January 
  22, 1993, with some modifications of the amounts.  For example, the amount to 
  be paid by Irving and his wife was reduced from $400,000 to $350,000.  The bank 
  was to discharge all of its existing security except for its second mortgage 
  for $1,000,000 on the Bermuda Tavern property.  The first mortgage in the amount 
  of $330,000 was held by CIBC Mortgage Corp., a separate entity from the bank, 
  and was not affected by the agreement in any way.  The trial judge found that 
  the bank took a loss of approximately $1,500,000 in respect of Irving, his wife 
  and various corporations he controlled, allowing him to retain his profitable 
  business, the Brass Rail Tavern, and to shed the financially draining Charles 
  Street property.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Irving was short of 
  the funds he required for the closing and borrowed $35,000 from David, interest 
  free.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The 
  agreement with respect to the Bermuda Tavern was that it should be sold, if 
  possible, as a going concern. The bank agreed that it would absorb the ongoing 
  operational expenses of the business pending the sale. Irving was obliged to 
  list the property for sale within 15 days of the closing, although he never 
  did.  He began to spend the bank’s money making improvements to the business.  
  The agreement provided that for six months, as long as the property was listed 
  for sale, the bank would not enforce its second mortgage.  However, if after 
  that time it had not been sold with a closing within one year, then Irving would 
  cooperate in a power of sale.  The bank had the power to dictate what offer 
  would be accepted.  This made sense because no matter what price was achieved, 
  the bank was accepting it in full satisfaction of any further obligation on 
  the part of Irving.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> In 
  the spring of 1992, Irving had spoken to Mr. Pratt, the owner of the gay bar 
  on Yonge Street, who, Irving had heard, was having problems operating without 
  an adult entertainment license.  However, at that time, Mr. Pratt was not interested 
  in the Bermuda Tavern.  In November, 1992, while he was negotiating with the 
  bank, Irving again approached Mr.&nbsp;Pratt, who expressed some interest but 
  was going on vacation at the time. They agreed that after Irving returned from 
  Florida, where he was shortly going, Mr. Pratt would contact him.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Irving 
  and David were both in Florida in late December, 1992, and early January 1993.  
  At that time Irving told David that Mr. Pratt was interested in acquiring the 
  assets of the Bermuda Tavern and leasing the property, and suggested that David 
  purchase the property.  At that time David told Irving he was not interested. 
</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> After 
  the closing with the bank in late January 1993, Irving appointed his son-in-law, 
  Paul Krandel, to be manager of the Bermuda Tavern.  Paul Krandel became interested 
  in purchasing the property in March, and sought David’s advice.  David discouraged 
  him on the basis that it would not be a good investment.  Subsequently, Paul’s 
  uncle offered to purchase the realty from the bank for $450,000 in an attempt 
  to facilitate a transaction whereby Paul would run the Bermuda Tavern and keep 
  the profits but without any specific sale of the assets.  The figure of $450,000 
  was enough to pay off the first mortgage of $330,000 and to release an outstanding 
  loan of $120,000 which had been guaranteed by Irving.  This price therefore 
  suited Irving, but the bank would not accept it. The bank wanted $600,000, which 
  is not surprising, as the bank had had the property appraised in 1992 at $850,000.  
  David was again consulted by Paul. Again David discouraged him from increasing 
  the offer.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Nefarious 
  motives are attributed to David by Irving, and it would appear that the trial 
  judge seemed to accept that at this time, David began to be interested in the 
  property himself and therefore, in effect, pretended that the property was less 
  valuable than it was. However, in my view, the evidence discloses that David 
  perceived that the property was only worthy of investment if, rather than continuing 
  to be operated as it was, it could be leased at a favourable rate to another 
  operator, such as Mr. Pratt.  Furthermore, it was this very opportunity that 
  Irving had offered to David first in Florida, and again in February.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> During 
  the week of April 12, 1993, David and Irving again had discussions about David 
  buying the Bermuda Tavern.  Irving wanted David to buy it.  This would require 
  an offer the bank would be willing to accept.  By this time, the bank knew that 
  Irving had not listed the Bermuda Tavern for sale and that it was operating 
  at a loss for the bank. The bank wanted Irving to close down the Tavern in an 
  orderly fashion and made Irving aware of the remedies it could exercise.  Irving 
  wanted to ensure that the employees and dancers would be paid so as not to reflect 
  negatively on his Brass Rail Tavern business.  He also wanted to maintain tax 
  losses in the operating companies.  In their discussions, David told Irving 
  that he would not be prepared to buy the Bermuda Tavern unless he had a tenant 
  for it.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Apparently, 
  Mr. Pratt never did get in touch with Irving again.  However, in April, David 
  asked Mr. Pratt to call him, which he did on April 12, and expressed interest 
  in the Bermuda Tavern.  David then arranged with Paul Krandel for Mr. Pratt 
  to have a tour of the Bermuda Tavern.  Paul Krandel obtained permission from 
  Irving, although they did not know in advance who would be receiving the tour.  
  Mr. Pratt and his lawyer toured the Bermuda Tavern with Paul Krandel at noon 
  time on April 14.  When they came outside, David and Irving were standing there.  
  Irving claimed that David initially indicated that the person was not Mr. Pratt 
  but someone else, but Irving and Mr. Pratt shook hands and exchanged pleasantries, 
  and Irving knew at that time that it was Mr.&nbsp;Pratt who had had the tour 
  and was the person interested in leasing the Bermuda Tavern.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Irving 
  acknowledged in his evidence that he was 99% sure that Mr. Pratt was David’s 
  prospective tenant for the Bermuda Tavern.  However, at no time did Irving take 
  any step or indicate in any way that David was not to deal with Mr. Pratt, or 
  that he did not have the authority to do so in order to arrange the tenancy 
  he wished to have in place so that he could purchase the Bermuda Tavern.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> After 
  speaking to Mr. Pratt, Irving and David walked over to Old Angelo’s restaurant 
  where they had lunch with Mr. McMurray from the bank.  At that lunch there was 
  some discussion of real estate in Toronto generally and on Yonge Street, and 
  in an off-the-cuff remark, David expressed the view that the best use for the 
  Bermuda Tavern would be as a retail outlet.  Mr. McMurray told him he disagreed.  
  Irving made much of this conversation in his evidence.  He said it was here 
  that David first misled him by suggesting that he intended to lease the Bermuda 
  Tavern to a retail tenant and that was the basis upon which he (Irving) was 
  operating when he agreed to sell the Bermuda Tavern to David.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>However, David was clearly directing his 
  remarks to Mr. McMurray, with a view, it appears, to minimizing the sale price 
  of the property.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> On 
  April 16 and 19, David met with Mr. Pratt and his lawyer, as well as with Mr. 
  Pratt’s sister, Ms.&nbsp;Travers (who was entering into the business with her 
  brother), and her lawyer.  One of the lawyers had searched the title to the 
  property and found that David was not the owner.  David said that he had authority 
  to deal and waived some papers, which he declined to show to the lawyer.  Ms. 
  Travers signed the lease document, but David did not sign at that time.  He 
  did not yet have a signed agreement with his brother and the bank to purchase 
  the Bermuda Tavern.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The 
  trial judge found that David did not have the authority he said he had, that 
  the papers he waived were false and that his representation was false.  Although 
  it is clear that David had no written authority to deal with the property, he 
  certainly had been authorized by Irving to contact and deal with Mr. Pratt about 
  leasing the Bermuda Tavern, and when Irving became aware that he had done so, 
  he did not revoke that authority, nor did he advise Mr.&nbsp;Pratt that his 
  brother had no such authority.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Although 
  David could proceed to negotiate with the prospective tenant, he clearly could 
  not bind himself as landlord until he had concluded his agreement to purchase 
  the Bermuda Tavern from Irving and the bank.  He therefore declined to sign 
  the lease with Ms.&nbsp;Travers until after the agreement to purchase the Bermuda 
  Tavern was signed by Irving and approved by the bank.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Irving 
  had recently leased the second floor of the Bermuda Tavern building to a tenant 
  who intended to operate another bar there.  However, Irving had not deposited 
  the $5,000 lease deposit cheque.  On April 17, the tenant was in arrears of 
  rent.  Because David needed vacant possession of both levels of the Bermuda 
  Tavern building, David and Irving evicted the upstairs tenant on that date, 
  and Irving returned the deposit cheque. </p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> On 
  Monday, April 19, David had an offer to purchase the assets of the Bermuda Tavern 
  prepared by his son, a lawyer.  Irving had learned that Mr. McMurray was intending 
  to travel to the east coast for a few days and wanted the agreement to purchase 
  signed before he left.  They had knowledge that at that point the bank would 
  not accept less than $525,000 as the purchase price.  David told Irving he was 
  only prepared to offer $500,000 and that if they waited two weeks, he believed 
  the bank would be willing to accept $500,000.  Irving suggested that they split 
  the $25,000 difference in order to complete the deal immediately, and David 
  agreed.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The next day David and Irving met with Mr. McMurray and David 
  presented the offer for $500,000.  However, Mr. McMurray would not go lower 
  than $525,000 and eventually that amount was agreed upon.  The bank approved 
  the terms of the offer. Irving had no input into the terms.  The offer was conditional 
  on the purchaser being able to assume the first mortgage in place to CIBC Mortgage 
  Corp. in the amount of $330,000, although that condition could be waived by 
  the purchaser.  The agreement was also conditional on a covenant by the vendor, 
  which was Irving’s company, to transfer both the liquor and adult entertainment 
  licenses attached to the premises to the designate of the purchaser within 60 
  days.  This condition could also be waived by the purchaser.  The existence 
  of this condition, which was accepted by Irving, belies any real belief that 
  David's tenant was a retail operator.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the action, Irving claimed that the agreement was conditional 
  from his side as well.  He claimed that he made an oral condition that the agreement 
  was not to be operative until it had been approved by his lawyer and his accountant.  
  The trial judge reviewed the evidence on the issue and concluded that there 
  was no such condition.  That finding is not under appeal.  The trial judge did 
  find that Irving had made it a condition that the agreement would not jeopardize 
  his general agreement with the bank and that he intended to show it to his lawyer 
  and accountant for that purpose.  The trial judge concluded that the purchase 
  agreement did not in any way jeopardize Irving’s general agreement with the 
  bank, and therefore that condition was satisfied.  That finding is also not 
  under appeal.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although Irving was 99% sure that Mr. Pratt was David’s prospective 
  tenant for the Bermuda Tavern, Irving waited to contact Mr. Pratt until April 
  21, the day after he signed the agreement to sell the Bermuda Tavern assets 
  to David.  That is when he learned the details of the agreement Mr. Pratt had 
  made with David.  Irving told Mr. Pratt that David did not have the authority 
  to make the deal, but that he had the authority, and that he would make the 
  same deal on the same terms with Mr. Pratt. </p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The terms required the tenant to pay $50,000 for the Bermuda 
  Tavern assets, and to   enter into a 10 year lease with a minimum yearly rent 
  of $86,000.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After speaking to Mr. Pratt, Irving was upset because he thought 
  his brother had taken advantage of him. He went to see Morris Krandel, his accountant 
  and the father of his son-in-law, Paul Krandel.  Morris Krandel advised him 
  to try to resolve the matter with David.  Irving and his son, Michael, then 
  came to ask David to give Irving the Pratt deal.  When David refused, Irving 
  became angry and said he would not transfer the adult entertainment licenses.  
  In fact, he had already deliberately filled out the license transfer forms incorrectly 
  so that he could easily revoke them.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Through his lawyer, Irving then took the position that the agreement 
  with David was null and void based on the fact that his accountant and lawyer 
  were not satisfied with its terms, and proceeded to enter into the lease and 
  asset purchase agreement with Mr.&nbsp;Pratt’s sister, Ms. Travers. He also 
  finalized his arrangements with the bank: the general agreement was amended 
  in his favour to facilitate the transaction, allowing him to now retain the 
  Bermuda Tavern, but pay the bank $525,000 less the amount of the first mortgage, 
  the same price as David had negotiated.  The bank was prepared to agree to this 
  arrangement even with the knowledge that Irving was securing a lucrative lease 
  on the Bermuda Tavern property.</p>

<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This issue was addressed and rejected by the trial judge on the 
  facts as he found them.  In <i>English v. Dedham Vale Properties</i>, the defendant 
  made an offer to purchase the plaintiffs’ property in May, 1971.  At the time, 
  the defendant told the plaintiffs that it was unlikely that the planning authority 
  would grant permission for the redevelopment of the whole property.  The defendant 
  said nothing about the prospects for development of one small strip.  On July 
  13 the plaintiffs’ solicitors notified the defendant’s solicitors that the plaintiffs 
  were ready to exchange contracts formally.  Armed with that information, on 
  July 14, before the contracts were exchanged, an employee of the defendant submitted 
  a written application to the planning authority for development of one strip 
  of the property.  He made the application in the names of the plaintiffs and 
  signed as their agent with all correspondence to come to him.  The plaintiffs 
  were never told until after closing in December about the application nor the 
  fact that it had been granted in October. </p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On those facts, the court held the defendant liable to account 
  to the plaintiffs for the profits accrued as a result of the grant of the planning 
  permission.  The court found that by submitting the application as self-appointed 
  agent for the vendors during negotiations for the sale of property, but without 
  their knowledge or consent, in circumstances where the outcome of the application 
  could affect the price, a fiduciary relationship arose.  As a result the defendant 
  had a duty to disclose the application to the vendors before completion.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In distinguishing that case, the trial judge pointed out that 
  the purchaser, the Dedham Vale company, was not the agent of Mr. and Mrs. English, 
  and had no authority to sign as such.  Therefore “as between himself and the 
  vendors he could not insist that he had obtained it for his own account.” (para. 
  101).  In this case, the trial judge found that David had misrepresented to 
  Mr. Pratt and Ms. Travers that he had authority to deal, but that he did not 
  deal on behalf of Irving but on his own behalf.  Furthermore, the agreement 
  that was entered into was between David's company and Ms. Travers.  In other 
  words, David never acted as self-appointed agent of Irving.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In rejecting the appellant’s claim that David misused confidential 
  information, namely the fact that Mr. Pratt might be interested in leasing the 
  Bermuda Tavern and buying its assets, the trial judge found that David had not 
  made unauthorized use of the information because he had been expressly authorized 
  by Irving to use it in order to facilitate his purchase of the property.  The 
  trial judge again noted:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Moreover, Irving was 99% sure from the time he shook 
      hands with Mr. Pratt outside of Bermuda that Mr. Pratt was the tenant and 
      he did nothing about it and signed the agreement.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In my view this conclusion amounts to a recognition by the trial judge that 
  David did have authority from Irving to deal with Mr. Pratt by negotiating with 
  him.  Irving’s evidence was that he became very suspicious and concerned once 
  he saw Mr. Pratt was looking at the Tavern, but he deliberately did nothing 
  and allowed David to proceed to deal with Mr. Pratt and with the bank before 
  he made any inquiry to, or regarding, Mr.&nbsp;Pratt.  When it came time to 
  sign his agreement with Ms. Travers, David could only do that once he had agreed 
  to purchase the property from Irving.  Although David was not candid with Mr. 
  Pratt, Ms. Travers, and their lawyers as to his capacity to sign the lease and 
  indeed told a story about having to call his mother in order to explain his 
  unwillingness to do so immediately, David did not misrepresent his authority, 
  given by Irving, to enter into negotiations with the prospective tenants.</p>

  following requirement for a fiduciary relationship:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>… what is required is evidence of a mutual understanding

</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge’s finding that there was no fiduciary obligation 
  created is fully supported by the evidence.  The real issue in this case is 
  the basic disagreement between the parties as to whether, in agreeing to purchase 
  the Bermuda Tavern property from Irving, it was understood and intended that 
  David would relinquish his self-interest.  In my view, to state the question 
  is to answer it.  It cannot possibly be the case that the parties ever contemplated 
  that David would be making a financial sacrifice by purchasing the Bermuda Tavern, 
  and that if he could make the transaction a lucrative one, then he was to somehow 
  ensure that Irving would get the benefit of it.  In other words, if the deal 
  was a bad deal, then David should help out Irving by buying the property, but 
  if it was a good deal, then David should not take the benefit of it but give 
  that benefit to Irving.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Irving could not have it both ways.  He had no basis to expect 
  David to purchase the Bermuda Tavern – thereby assisting him in completing the 
  excellent deal David had helped him negotiate with the bank – but only if David 
  did not stand to make money on the transaction.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Furthermore, it was 
  not contemplated in Irving’s general agreement with the bank that he could retain 
  the Bermuda Tavern, enter into a lucrative lease which made the property very 
  profitable, and still be released from his financial obligations to the bank 
  totaling approximately $1.5 million. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
13.0pt;'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Irving also argues that the bargain reached was an unconscionable 
  one and unfair to him.  Again, this submission does not accord with the reality 
  of the situation.  Irving’s agreement with the bank involved him selling the 
  Bermuda Tavern as a going concern.  He would only receive money from the sale 
  if it generated enough to repay his entire indebtedness to the bank of over 
  $1.5 million.  That was never a possibility.  Whatever funds were generated 
  by the sale would all go to the bank.  As a result, Irving had no interest in 
  the sale price.  Therefore, again, any concept of unconscionability can only 
  be based on the theory that if the Bermuda Tavern could be made to be a more 
  valuable property, it was unconscionable for David to make that deal for himself 
  rather than for Irving.  In my view, there is no basis on the facts for such 
  a conclusion.</p>

  performance of his agreement with Irving and instead awarded him damages for 
  breach of contract.  The trial judge believed that David made misrepresentations 
  about the value of the property to Paul Krandel, about his authority to deal 
  to Mr. Pratt, and to both Irving and the bank about his intention to lease to 
  a retail tenant rather than to an adult entertainment operator.  As a result 
  of these misrepresentations, the trial judge concluded that David did not act

  trial judge also concluded that David took advantage of Irving by pressuring 
  him into dealing with the bank quickly in April, and was unfair in asking Irving 
  to contribute $12,500 to the purchase price.  It is interesting to note that 
  the finding that David put enormous pressure on Irving was denied forcefully 
  by Irving in his evidence.  Irving’s complaint was that his brother asked him 
  to contribute to the purchase price without disclosing how much he would be 
  making from the sale and lease to Mr. Pratt.  However, Irving acknowledged that 
  despite knowing about Mr. Pratt and being suspicious about the deal, he made 
  no enquiry whatever about it.  Furthermore, he clearly did not believe that 
  Mr. Pratt was going to operate a retail outlet from the premises when he knew 
  Mr. Pratt’s interest was in the adult entertainment license.</p>

  specific performance issue is not under appeal.  However, relying on the findings 
  of the trial judge regarding David’s conduct, Irving submits that the trial 
  judge, of his own motion because the issue was not raised before him, ought 
  to have declined to enforce the bargain on the basis of the <i>ex turpi causa 
  non oritur actio </i> maxim.  This maxim, that no court will lend its aid to 
  a party who founds a cause of action upon an immoral or an illegal act, dates 
  from <i>Holman v. Johnson </i>(1775), 1 Cowp. 341, 98 E.R. 1120. (See <i>Continental 
  Bank Leasing Corp. v. Canada</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 298 at 342-3.) As stated by 
  Krever J. (as he then was) in <i>Menard v. Genereux</i> (1982), 39 O.R. (2d) 
  55 (H.C.) at p. 64:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is, however, well established that whether or not they are pleaded, 
      if facts are shown in the course of a trial which may render an agreement 
      unenforceable by reason of illegality or public policy a court must take 
      these facts into consideration and, depending on the circumstance, act upon 
      them if necessary by refusing to lend its assistance to a party seeking 
      to enforce his or her rights by relying on the agreement.</p>

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant relies on the authority of 
  <i>Pupiec v. Dereniowski</i> (1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 150 at 2 (C.A.) for the proposition 
  that: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>… a plaintiff who is a willing participant in an illegal 
      or immoral act may not have the assistance of the court if her damages flow 
      from her involvement in the illegal or immoral act: see <i>Canada Cement 
      LaFarge Ltd. v. British Columbia Lightweight Aggregate Ltd., </i>[1983] 
      1 S.C.R. 452. Once the court finds that the plaintiff and the defendant 
      participated in a scheme to defraud a third party, as this trial judge expressly 
      found, it is wrong to suggest that the court should entertain an action 
      between the participants to the fraud to allocate responsibility for the 
      loss in reverse proportion to their guilt. </span></p>

  </span></span> The maxim has no application in this case.  This is not a situation 
  where the parties participated in an illegal or immoral act with a view to defrauding 
  a third party.  Nor does the contract between David and Irving Cooper engage 
  public policy in any other manner.  Here Irving complains about the ethics of 
  David’s behaviour in relation to him.  The issue therefore is whether there 
  was fraud, misrepresentation or breach of duty by David or another basis in 
  law or equity upon which denial of Irving’s liability could be based.  In this 
  case there was none.  </p>
