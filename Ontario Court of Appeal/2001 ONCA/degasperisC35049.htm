<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice John D. Ground dated 
  August 30, 2000.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this appeal, DeGasperis Muzzo Corporation (“DMC”) appeals 
  from the judgment of the Honourable Mr. Justice Ground dated August 30, 2000.  
  In his judgment, Ground J. declared that the mortgage security interests in 
  the SkyDome created in favour of the respondents, the Montreal Trust Company 
  of Canada, in its capacity as Trustee for the Holders of Certain Mortgage Bonds 
  (“Montreal Trust”) and Stadium Corporation of Ontario Limited (“Stadco”) rank 
  in priority to the leasehold interest of DMC in SkyBox #321. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Stadco and Montreal Trust also cross-appeal 
  from the judgment of Ground J. and request that the judgment be varied to declare 
  that:</span></p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent> <span
lang=EN-US>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>the leasehold interest of DMC in SkyBox #321 
  was not created or effective prior in time to the mortgage security interests 
  of either Stadco or Montreal Trust; and</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>DMC was not entitled to relief from forfeiture 
  in relation to its defaults in the performance of its obligations under its 
  lease of SkyBox #321 dated March 16, 1994 (the “SkyBox Suite Lease”).</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>These proceedings arise from the application 
  of SkyDome Corporation, previously known as Stadium Acquisition Inc. (“SAI”) 
  and subsequently renamed 951865 Ontario Inc. (“951865”), under the <i>Companies’ 
  Creditors Arrangement Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36, as amended (the “<i>CCAA</i>”) 
  and the consequent court-approved sale of the SkyDome in March 1999.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Pursuant to an order dated June 24, 1999, the Honourable Mr. 
  Justice Blair directed that PricewaterhouseCoopers, the court-appointed receiver 
  of SkyDome Corporation, hold in reserve a portion of the proceeds from the sale 
  of the SkyDome pending judicial determination of the claim of DMC.  By way of 
  an endorsement made as of December 3, 1999, Blair J. directed a trial of the 
  issue of the priorities as between the interests in the SkyDome of Montreal 
  Trust, Stadco and DMC.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his judgment in the trial of the issue, Ground J. determined 
  that the interests of Stadco and Montreal Trust rank in priority to the interest 
  of DMC.  We do not think that Ground J. erred in making that determination.  
  In particular, having regard to the agreements and the documents that make up 
  the arrangements under consideration, Ground J. was correct in finding that:</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>(a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>pursuant to subs.&nbsp;78(5) of the <i>Land 
  Titles Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.5, as amended, registered interests rank according 
  to the order in which the instruments are entered in the register and that the 
  instruments securing the interests of Stadco and Montreal Trust were entered 
  in the register prior to that of DMC;</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>(b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>in any event, DMC agreed in the SkyBox Suite 
  Lease to subordinate its leasehold interest to the interests of Stadco and Montreal 
  Trust; and</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>(c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>the non-disturbance agreements dated March 15, 
  1994 provided to DMC by each of Stadco and Montreal Trust (the “Non-Disturbance 
  Agreements”) did not affect the determination of the priorities as between the 
  interests of the parties.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We do not think it necessary or appropriate 
  to deal with any other issues on the appeal.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed with costs.  The cross-appeal 
  is dismissed without costs.</p>
