  </span></span> On September 29, 2000 Ellen Macdonald J. dismissed an application 
  by Denison Mines Limited under s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, 
  S.O. 1991, c. 17 for leave to appeal from an award of an arbitration tribunal 
  dated November 23, 1999.  Ontario Hydro was the respondent in the application.  
  Denison commenced an appeal to this court from the order dismissing its application.  
  What is before us now is a motion by Ontario Hydro to quash the appeal on the 
  ground that, because the order in question is an interlocutory order, this court 
  does not have jurisdiction.  It relies on the decision of this court in <i>Hillmond 
  Investments Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 
  612.  As I shall indicate, shortly, there are issues in addition to the final/interlocutory 
  question which must be considered on this motion.</p>

  </span></span> As an aid to following my reasons, I now set forth my responses 
  to the issues which must be considered on this motion.  First, I conclude that 
  the proposed appeal falls within an exception to the general rule that no appeal 
  lies from an order granting or refusing leave to appeal.  This exception is 
  applicable where it is submitted that the judge refusing leave to appeal mistakenly 
  declined jurisdiction.  Second, I conclude that the order is a final one because 
  it was granted on an application.  Third, I conclude that we should not treat 
  the matter as having proceeded before Macdonald J. by way of motion.  Finally, 
  I express the view that, if I am wrong in my third conclusion, the order would 
  also be a final one if made on motion.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the motion.</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Hillmond Investments Ltd. v. C.I.B.C., supra, </span></i>canvassed 
  a series of cases all of which concluded that an order by an intermediate court 
  refusing leave to appeal is not appealable: <i>Kay v. Briggs</i> (1889), 22 
  Q.B.D. 343; <i>Lane v. Esdaile</i>, [1891] A.C. 210 (H.L.); <i>Industrial Acceptance 
  Corp. v. Canada Permanent Trust Co</i>., [1931] S.C.R. 652; <i>Canadian Utilities 
  Ltd. v. Deputy Minister of National Revenue</i> , [1964] S.C.R. 57 and <i>Ernewein 
  v. Canada (Minister of Employment &amp; Immigration)</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 639.  
  Reference may also be made to Holmested and Gale, <i>The Judicature Act of Ontario 
  and Rules of Practice</i> (1983) at pp. 2284.28(2)-2284.29 for additional decisions 
  affirming this principle.  See also Bennion, <i>Statutory Interpretation: A 
  Code</i>, 3rd ed. (1997) at pp. 74 and 98.  <i>Hillmond</i> also observed at 
  pp. 623-624 that <i>MacDonald v. Montreal (City)</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460 which 
  departed from this principle, turned on its being concerned with a leave to 
  appeal provision and with the principle that the jurisdiction of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada, as a national court of last resort, should be unfettered.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The non-appealability of decisions refusing or granting leave 
  to appeal is the general rule and, subject to the exception to which I shall 
  refer shortly, it should, as <i>Hillmond</i> held, be applicable to appeals 
  from orders made under s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>.  The rule 
  flows from the strong implication that, notwithstanding the wording of s. 6(1)(b) 
  of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, a general statute, no appeal is intended 
  from an order made refusing or granting leave to appeal.  Any other conclusion 
  would defeat the purpose of s. 45(1) which is to limit appellate recourse to 
  the courts in arbitration matters.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This strong negative implication is reinforced by s. 49 of the 
  <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> which provides for an appeal to the Court of Appeal 
  from a superior court judge’s decision in an appeal of an award, but only with 
  leave of the Court of Appeal.  It would be incongruous to attribute to the Legislature 
  an intention that there be appeals, as of right, from decisions on leave applications 
  under s. 45(1) when no such appeal is provided for with respect to decisions 
  on what may be called the main issue, the correctness of the arbitral decision.</p>

  </span></span> As I have said, the non-appealability of orders refusing leave 
  is the general rule.  As <i>Hillmond </i>sets forth on pp. 624-25, the courts 
  have engrafted onto this general rule an exception which is applicable where 
  the judge mistakenly declines jurisdiction.  <i>Hillmond</i> referred to and 
  quoted the following passage from the reasons of Cartwright J. for the Supreme 
  Court of Canada in <i>Canadian Utilities Ltd. v. Deputy Minister of National 
  Revenue</i>, [1964] S.C.R. 57 at 63:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It appears to me to have been 
      consistently held in our courts and in the courts of England that where 
      a statute grants a right of appeal conditionally upon leave to appeal being 
      granted by a specified tribunal there is no appeal from the decision of 
      that tribunal to refuse leave, <i>provided that the tribunal has not mistakenly 
      declined jurisdiction but has reached a decision on the merits of the application.</i> 
      [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Denison relies upon this exception in the present case.  It submits 
  that Macdonald J. erred in concluding that the arbitration agreement dealt with 
  appeals on questions of law (s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>), 
  that is, that the parties had “contracted out” of a right of appeal and, accordingly, 
  erred in declining jurisdiction.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I appreciate that in many cases the meaning of “jurisdiction” 
  can be fraught with difficulty.  In the present case, however, I think that 
  the principle stated by Cartwright J. can be applied with some degree of confidence.  
  He distinguished between declining jurisdiction and reaching a decision on the 
  merits of the application.  In the present case, the parties did not argue the 
  merits of the application before Macdonald J.  By agreement they argued whether 
  or not Macdonald J. had jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal.  If she had decided 
  that she had jurisdiction, they would have continued the hearing of the application 
  on the merits. I think that the exception applies.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>To give effect to 
  this exception is not to recognize a right of appeal from the reasons as opposed 
  to the order (contrary to a basic principle relating to appeals: see, for example, 
  <i>Canadian Express Ltd.. v. Blair</i> (1991), 6 O.R. (3d) 212 (Div. Ct.)) but, 
  rather, from the order itself on the ground that the reasons show (at least 
  in Denison’s submission) error respecting the court’s jurisdiction to deal with 
  the merits.</span></p>
<p class=Heading><span lang=EN-US>Is The Order Final or Interlocutory?</span></p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Hillmond </span></i>held that an order dismissing a 
  motion for leave to appeal under s. 45(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> 
  is interlocutory.  There is a distinction between the present case and <i>Hillmond</i> 
  in that in this case Denison sought relief in the form of an application and 
  in <i>Hillmond</i>, as the documents in the appeal book in that appeal show, 
  the relief was sought by motion.  The leading authority in Ontario on the final/interlocutory 
  distinction is <i>Hendrickson v. Kallio</i>, [1932] O.R. 675 (C.A.) and decisions 
  of this court have applied the reasoning in <i>Hendrickson v. Kallio</i> to 
  conclude that orders that finally determine the issues raised in an application 
  are final orders: <i>Automatic Systems Inc. v. Bracknell Corp</i>. (1994), 18 
  O.R. (3d) 257 (C.A.); <i>Automatic Systems Inc. v. E.S. Fox Ltd</i>., [1994] 
  O.J. No. 193 (C.A.); <i>Buck Bros. Ltd. v. Frontenac Builders Ltd</i>. (1994), 
  19 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.) (and the decisions referred to in it ); <i>Leo Alarie 
  &amp; Sons Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Natural Resources) </i>(2000), 48 O.R.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On the argument before 
  us, Ontario Hydro referred to rule 14.01(3) in the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, 
  which provides:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>(3) Where leave to commence 
      a proceeding is required it shall be obtained by motion.</span></p>
    <p>Ontario Hydro acknowledged that it did not question the use of the application 
      procedure before Macdonald J. or refer to rule 14.01(3), but submitted that 
      it did not make sense that the resolution of this issue should turn on the 
      distinction between motions and applications.  From a policy point of view 
      I agree with this submission (accepting, for the purposes of addressing 
      the submission, that orders relating to leave made on motion are interlocutory) 
      but the question which must be decided is the proper interpretation and 
      application of rule 14.01(3) to the facts of this case.  I would be inclined 
      to treat the matter as having been proceeded with by way of motion before 
      Macdonald J. if I thought that the case was clearly covered by rule 14.01(3).  
      See Holmested and Watson, <i>Ontario Civil Procedure</i> at p. 62-28.</p>

<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The question is whether an appeal is a “proceeding” within the 
  meaning of this word in rule 14.01(3).  Rule 1.03 provides that a “proceeding” 
  means “an action or an application” and that a “motion” means “a motion in a 
  proceeding or an intended proceeding”.  According to the defined meanings it 
  is difficult to say that an “appeal” is a proceeding within the meaning of rule 
  14.01(3).  An appeal is a step in a proceeding.  If an appeal was intended within 
  the purview of the rule I think that it would have used different wording.  
  The subject of appeals and leave to appeal is dealt with in Rules 61 and 62 
  and the commencement of proceeding is dealt with in Rule 14.</p>

  </span></span> As far as the authority for bringing the matter before the court 
  by way of application is concerned, it is clear that this is provided for by 
  rule 14.05(3)(h) because this is a “matter where it is unlikely that there will 
  be any material facts in dispute.”  One difference between rule 14.05(3)(h) 
  and rule 14.01(3) is that the former is an enabling provision, while the latter 
  (where, of course, it is applicable) is a mandatory provision.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Ontario Hydro has 
  referred to <i>Milton (Town) v. Kalmoni Establishments Inc</i>. (1996), 31 O.R. 
  (3d) 157 (C.A.) in support of its position, in particular the following passage 
  on p. 159:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>With respect, I think that the legal step taken to obtain leave to appeal 
      to the Divisional Court is a motion, as defined in the Rules of Civil Procedure 
      and, clearly, not an application as defined in those rules, as appears to 
      be suggested by the Divisional Court.  Rule 1.03 defines “motion” as meaning 
      “a motion in a proceeding or an <i>intended proceeding</i>” (emphasis added).  
      The intended proceeding which is relevant in the present context, while 
      it may not be, strictly speaking, a “proceeding” as defined in the rules 
      (“an action or application”), is the intended appeal to the Divisional Court: 
      <i>cf</i> rule 14.01(3) which provides: “Where leave to commence a proceeding 
      is required, it shall be obtained by motion.”</p>
  </blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This passage was concerned with what was said by the Divisional 
  Court in the earlier case of <i>Standard Industries Ltd. v. Regional Assessment 
  Commissioner, Region No. 13</i> (1993), 15 C.P.C. (3d) 19.  The Divisional Court 
  in that case held that the procedure to be followed to obtain leave to appeal 
  to the Divisional Court under s. 96(1) of the <i>Ontario Municipal Board Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. O.28 was an application and not a motion.  This court disagreed 
  and said that it was a motion.  While it is true that the court referred to 
  rule 14.01(3), this was by analogy (“cf”).  As the court noted on p. 160, rule 
  61.03 clearly contemplates that where an appeal to the Divisional Court requires 
  the leave of that court, the procedure is by way of motion.  I must say, in 
  view of the matter being covered by rule 61.03, that it was not helpful to refer 
  to rule 14.01(3).</p>

  </span></span> A further observation may be made about <i>Standard Industries</i> 
  that was not made in <i>Milton</i>.  Unlike judges of the Superior Court sitting 
  alone, the Divisional Court does not hear ordinary applications (see rule 38.01).  
  It does, of course, hear applications for judicial review (Rule 68).  In fact, 
  in <i>Standard Industries</i>, the order in question, refusing leave to appeal, 
  had been made on motion.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Accordingly, I do 
  not think that <i>Milton</i> supports Ontario Hydro’s position.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> If I am wrong and the order should be considered to have been 
  made on motion, I should say something further on the final/interlocutory question.  
  I say, with great respect, that I do not think that the judgments of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada referred to in <i>Hillmond</i> support the conclusion that an 
  order refusing leave under s. 45 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> is interlocutory.  
  The court did not apply the <i>Hendrickson v. Kallio </i>test to determine the 
  question and it may be noted that in <i>Hendrickson</i> Middleton J.A. observed 
  at p. 679 that judgments of the Supreme Court of Canada on its jurisdiction 
  depend upon a statute widely different from that in question before him.  Further, 
  as noted in Sopinka<i> </i>and<i> </i>Gelowitz, <i>The Conduct of an Appeal</i>, 
  2nd ed. (2000) at pp. 25-26, under the current legislation relating to appeals 
  to the Supreme Court of Canada, the distinction between final and interlocutory, 
  on the matter of jurisdiction, is no longer relevant.</p>

  </span></span> Under the Ontario approach it appears that the decision denying 
  leave to appeal in this case is one that finally disposes of the moving party's 
  substantive right to relief in the court and is hence, a final order. See Holmested 
  and Watson, Ontario Civil Procedure at p. 62-17 and Osolsky v. Schwartz (1929), 
  37 O.W.N. 121 (App. Div.), Khalil v. United Investment Services Ltd. (1975), 
  11 O.R. (2d) 707 (Div. Ct.), Mackay v. Queen Elizabeth Hospital (1989), 68 O.R. 
  (2d) 90 (H.C.J.) and 92 (Div. Ct.), and Primex Investments Ltd. v. Northwest 
  Sports Enterprises Ltd. (1995), 46 C.P.C. (3d) 385 (B.C.C.A.) at 390. Accordingly, 
  in my view, it does not make a difference whether the matter was put before 
  the Superior Court by way of application or motion.<br>
