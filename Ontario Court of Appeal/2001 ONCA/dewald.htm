style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The appellant Thomas Dewald pleaded guilty to two counts of second 
    degree murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole eligibility 
    for 23 years. He seeks a reduction in the parole eligibility to 12 years as 
    recommended at the sentencing hearing in a joint submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The crime was shocking to anyone’s sensibilities.  The appellant took 
    his two children aged ten and twelve for a cottage swim. While the youngsters 
    were happily playing in the water, the appellant held their heads underwater 
    until they drowned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>One reason Crown counsel supported a modest ineligibility period of 
    twelve years was the Crown’s expressed satisfaction that the appellant acted 
    spontaneously, and was driven by a long standing clinical depression and a 
    belief that the children would be better off dead so that they need not experience 
    life as he saw it.  The trial judge appears not to have accepted this interpretation 
    of events and to have concluded that the motive was a selfish desire to improve 
    his love life by removing these apparent impediments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The appellant argues that the trial judge should not have rejected 
    this fundamental feature of the joint submission. Further, he argues that 
    the judge’s reasons for sentence reveal additional errors of principle which 
    justify interference by this court and a sentence in accordance with the joint 
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I find that it was not open to the trial judge to have rejected the 
    version of events contained in the joint submission in the absence of a hearing 
    to test this version of events on a criminal burden of proof.  The joint submission 
    was not unreasonable and contrary to the public interest, and in rejecting 
    it the trial judge committed an error in principle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I will commence with a summary of the Crown’s presentation of the evidence 
    in the sentencing hearing and will then deal with the points of appeal as 
    they arise in the reasons for sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>At the opening of trial a <i>voir dire</i> was held as to the admissibility 
    of a statement made by the appellant to the police.  It was declared admissible 
    and the appellant thereupon pleaded guilty to the two counts of second degree 
    murder.  At the first sentence hearing date the Crown laid out the factual 
    background, a summary of which follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The murders occurred on August 13, 1998 when the appellant was age 
    35.  He was married in 1987 and was employed in Windsor at a parts manufacturing 
    plant until his arrest.  In 1992 his wife died of cancer and, under the care 
    of his family physician, he began to take days off work complaining of depression. 
    He continued  fighting with bouts of depression, struggling to cope with the 
    loss of his wife and experiencing difficulty raising his two children.  He 
    was not good with the children and there was a complaint in 1997 that he had 
    punched his son.  In late 1996 he began dating Tina Marlatt, and the relationship 
    became intimate.  In November 1997 Ms. Marlatt broke off the relationship.  
    The appellant became severely depressed and went on a six month disability 
    leave.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>From this point on the appellant became obsessed with Ms. Marlatt. 
    He continually called her, followed her, and showed up unannounced at her 
    residence, seeking to rekindle the relationship.  On one occasion she called 
    the police to say that he had passed out in a fetal position in her backyard. 
    He had overdosed with drugs and was admitted to hospital.  Soon afterward, 
    the appellant put himself in the care of a psychiatrist. In the first months 
    of 1998 Ms. Marlatt became very concerned for the mental health of the appellant 
    and for the care of the children who appeared dirty and unkempt.  During this 
    time the Children’s Aid Society became involved.  On March 11 1998 the appellant 
    was admitted to hospital for ten days under the care of his psychiatrist.  
    The diagnosis was major depression with suicidal tendencies.  The  appellant 
    expressed anger relating to his breakup with Ms. Marlatt and stress with raising 
    the children.  He also expressed concern that he might repeat the abuse he 
    had suffered at the hands of his father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>On March 20, 1998 the appellant was released from hospital on prescription 
    medication. He returned to work on April 27, was laid off on June 30 and decided 
    to file for bankruptcy.  At about this time he apparently stopped taking his 
    medication. On July 12 he spoke with Ms. Marlatt. In an effort to convince 
    him the relationship would not work she said she did not enjoy being around 
    his daughter, that she was too emotionally immature.  On August 4 the appellant 
    returned to work but began taking days off.  On August 11 his son phoned the 
    employer to say his father would not be in for the week because he “was all 
    stressed out” and that he, the son, was caring for him.  On August 12 the 
    appellant met with Ms. Marlatt. He told her he could not stand being around 
    his children, could not handle them and was “losing it” with them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>On August 13 the appellant took the children to his father’s lakeside 
    residence, knowing his father would not be there.  The purpose was to have 
    a swim.  Curiously, the appellant took an alarm clock and a Walkman with him 
    along with towels and beach toys.  The details of how the murders occurred 
    are found in statements made at a later date by the appellant.  Apparently, 
    in the early afternoon the children went down the embankment to the water 
    and played happily in the waves.  The appellant joined them in water up to 
    his knees. He simultaneously held each of them under the water until they 
    drowned.  He said he panicked and tried to save them, but realizing they were 
    dead directed their bodies out into the lake. He then retreated up some stairs 
    to sit in a lawn chair about 60 feet from the water.  He put on his Walkman 
    and pretended to sleep. An hour later he got up, looked for the bodies, saw 
    only his daughter, and in an emotional state went to a nearby residence to 
    seek help, saying he thought his children had drowned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>When the bodies were found the police were called. The appellant claimed 
    that they had drowned when he fell asleep listening to his Walkman.  The appellant 
    maintained his innocence throughout the bulk of the investigation.  On August 
    14 Ms.&nbsp;Marlatt spoke to the police and related her concerns, which included 
    what she had said to the appellant about not getting along with his daughter, 
    his obsession with renewing a relationship, and his stress over caring for 
    the children. She believed the children had not died accidentally, and she 
    agreed to allow the police to intercept discussions between her and the appellant.  
    The interceptions included one conversation where the appellant denied killing 
    his children to be with her, and another where he admitted to the killings. 
    During the latter conversation when she asked “You did it for me?”, he nodded 
    yes and began to cry.  He told her he had done a lot of damage and wished 
    he could take it back.  He explained that he had done it “because I love you 
    more than anything in the world”.  He said he did not plan to drown his children.  
    Rather, he intended to drown himself but was unable to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The appellant was then arrested and, after consulting a lawyer, made 
    a statement in which he admitted to the killings but claimed that he thought 
    that his children would be better off.  He told them that “life sucked”, that 
    his children would end up having to go through the “same shit kind of life” 
    as him. He claimed that he thought about killing them for the first time when 
    he was in the water, and then just lost it. He claimed that when he found 
    he could not save them he panicked and went back to the house and passed out 
    in the chair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Those were the facts presented to the trial judge on March 17, 1999.  
    The hearing was remanded for submissions and sentence to June 21.  In the 
    meantime, the trial judge had the opportunity to consider the evidence and 
    the inferences to be drawn from it which would bear on sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>On June 21 a psychiatric report was filed.  It read in part:</p>
  <p class=headingQUOTE>Although it is my opinion that Mr. Dewald is criminally 
    responsible for his actions as it relates to mental disorder, his state of 
    depression at the time would be significant mitigating and precipitating factors 
    related to his actions. He has experienced a significant amount of emotional 
    turmoil, was facing significant psychosocial stresses and difficulty coping 
    with his problems which affected his perception of his children’s needs and 
    his ability to meet them.  He appears to be genuinely remorseful for his actions.  
    I would recommend that while Mr. Dewald is in custody, that he receive psychiatric 
    treatment and counselling regarding his underlying emotional problems, psychosocial 
    stressors and interpersonal relations.  Academic and vocational pursuits ought 
    to be encouraged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Counsel then made submissions in support of a joint submission for 
    twelve years  ineligibility.  Very experienced Crown counsel assured the court 
    that the agreement was not arrived at in a vacuum, that there had been speculation 
    about first degree murder that had been carefully investigated, that counsel 
    had consulted with all concerned and had ultimately reached the view that 
    this was the proper disposition.  He mentioned that counsel have access to 
    facts not presented to the court that lead to such decisions. When asked what 
    those facts might be, he offered as an example the history of the Walkman.  
    Possession of the walkman was a suspicious feature until the Crown learned 
    that the appellant always took his Walkman to the beach.  The Crown emphasized 
    the fact that the appellant was indicted for second degree murder because 
    there was no evidence of first degree murder.  He states:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>That confession I have to take as a whole.  It is very 
      difficult for me to say to the Court, “I want you to believe 90 percent 
      of this confession, but for the other ten percent I want you to reject it 
      as a lie and speculate that something different happened without evidence.”  
      Can’t do that.  This case is a second degree murder and there are many facts 
      that led me to that conclusion which don’t form part of the record. So that 
      is one example. </div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Crown counsel then emphasized that the timing of the guilty plea was 
    a significant indicator of remorse, as confirmed by the psychiatrist.  He 
    continued:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>The evidence upon which the Crown relied and the only 
      evidence to support a murder conviction is that the accused committed these 
      murders on impulse.  That he didn’t want his children to have a crumby life 
      like he had. Those aren’t his words, but that he was so disappointed in 
      life he didn’t want to put them through it. That is the evidence and the 
      only evidence with respect to his motive for murder at the time the murder 
      was committed, at the time he made the decision.  It’s easy to speculate 
      in this case and to try and impute a motive beyond that, but there is no 
      evidence to support it Sir, and believe me, I looked long and hard at that 
      issue.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The appellant addressed the court at some length indicating by his 
    words that he fully appreciated the enormity of his conduct, that he was prepared 
    to face his punishment, and that he wished to address his mental difficulties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>After a short recess the trial judge delivered his reasons.  In his 
    recital of facts he refers to the appellant staying overnight with the children 
    at Bruce Peninsula a few days before August 13, despite his financial difficulties.  
    He stated: “This activity was extremely suspicious in light of what happened 
    to the children a few days later”.  Later he said:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>He alleged they died as a result of an accident.  This 
      was a deliberate attempt to throw off or deceive the police who were investigating.  
      It was a planned cover up.  Again, this is suspiciously like a well thought 
      out plan in advance.  However, I must stress he was not on trial for first 
      degree murder.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>And then later in his reasons:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1>Again the same people had to deal with the death of the 
      two little children again.  This time they had to come to terms with the 
      fact that you had murdered the two children in order to remove an impediment 
      to your love life which if removed, would allow you to selfishly have what, 
      in you mind, would have been a happy life. But you did not look or take 
      that into consideration.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>And further</p>
</div>
<blockquote>

    </span>In making these observations, the trial judge made it clear that he 
    was aware that the charge was second degree murder, but that under s.745.4 
    of the <i>Code</i> he was permitted to consider aspects of planning and deliberation 
    as relevant evidence of “the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding 
    its commission”.</p>

    </span>I would not argue with the appropriateness of considering all surrounding 
    facts and, in normal circumstances, drawing appropriate inferences from them.  
    See <i>R. v. Phillips</i> (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 297 (Ont. C.A.) 302.   However, 
    in doing so here, the trial judge has rejected the fundamental premise of 
    the joint submission – that the murders were driven by depression and the 
    act was spontaneous.  The Crown’s submission mirrored the position of the 
    accused, as reflected in his confession.  If the accused’s version was to 
    be rejected it should only have been so after a hearing with findings on a 
    beyond reasonable doubt basis.  See <i>R. v. Gardiner</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 
    368; <i>R. v. Boulet</i> (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 178; <i>R. v. Poorman</i> 
    (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 82. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The trial judge did more here than draw inferences from admitted facts.  
    He found the presence of a motive and an element of planning in the murder, 
    contrary to the views of the investigators, the psychiatrist, the Crown, and 
    the position taken by the accused.  This finding set the tone for the balance 
    of his reasons. Without a hearing directed to that issue, this finding effectively 
    added eleven years to the sentence without parole. The trial judge disbelieved 
    the appellant without providing him with his right to be heard in testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The appellant raised a number of other grounds of appeal, including 
    the trial judge’s overemphasis on deterrence, his failure to consider rehabilitation, 
    his failure to give credit for remorse, his references to the publicity surrounding 
    the case, and his categorization of this offender and this crime as among 
    the worst.  He did the latter by equating the facts of this case to those 
    in <i>Regina. v. Olsen and Podniewicz</i> (1999), 131 C.C.C. (3d) 355. In 
    <i>Olsen</i>, a 25 year period of parole ineligibility was upheld for a father 
    who murdered his daughter by repeated beatings over a period of time, and 
    then watched her die of pneumonia.  He was convicted of beating another child 
    on an earlier occasion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>There is merit to each of these concerns, but mostly they may be characterized 
    as flowing from the fundamental assumption that the appellant’s crime was 
    a callous, planned act designed to reunite him with his former lover.  By 
    contrast, if we accept the Crown’s assumption that this was a spontaneous 
    act driven by a severe mental condition, the trial judge’s considerations 
    going to sentence must be revised.  General deterrence becomes a modest concern 
    because parents in this state of depression do not think rationally about 
    the consequences of their actions.  Rehabilitation becomes a more prominent 
    concern than individual deterrence once the cause of the crime is identified 
    as a mental problem, and the appellant expresses a desire for treatment.  
    If on the trial judge’s view of the facts they could be compared to those 
    in <i>Olsen</i>, and I don’t agree that they do, they retreat measurably if 
    the Crown’s position is accepted.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>As horrific as the murder of two children by drowning may be, the ultimate 
    question on sentencing is, why did this crime happen and what should be done 
    to prevent recurrence by this offender or others?  It was not the act of a 
    brutal sadist, a potential repeat offender or a man with previous convictions.  
    It was the tragic act of a man who was overwhelmed by the weight of his problems 
    and in a state of clinical depression.  The law rightly does not excuse that 
    conduct, and the appellant deserved a life sentence. Indeed, this life sentence 
    is not being disturbed here no matter when parole eligibility begins.</p>

    </span>In <i>R. v. Winn</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 750, this court approved 
    the test for departure from a joint submission as to sentence. Departure is 
    allowed where the proposal is so unreasonable or contrary to the public interest 
    that its acceptance would bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
    On a proper view of the evidence and the manner in which it was presented 
    my view is that the test in <i>Winn</i> is not met. The public interest and 
    the administration of justice are properly served by a life sentence and the 
    opportunity for rehabilitation and parole in 12 years.</p>

    </span>I have read the reasons of my colleague Carthy J.A. and I do not agree 
    with his proposed result.  In my view, the trial judge did not err in concluding 
    that the joint submission for twelve years parole ineligibility was so contrary 
    to the public interest that accepting it would bring the administration of 
    justice into disrepute.  The trial judge did, however, err in equating this 
    case to <i>R. v. Olsen</i>.  Although killing one’s own children is one of 
    the worst offences, Mr. Dewald was not one of the worst offenders.  I would 
    allow the appeal and reduce the period of parole ineligibility from 23 years 
    to 17 years.</p>
  <h3>1.<span

    judge err in rejecting the joint submission? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>A joint submission on sentence is important to the administration of 
    the criminal justice system.  This has been recognized for many years.  Trial 
    judges should therefore seriously consider a joint submission but they are 
    not required to accept it.  Unquestioning acceptance would remove their sentencing 
    discretion.  Trial judges may reject a joint submission if accepting it would 
    be contrary to the public interest or would otherwise bring the administration 
    of justice into disrepute.  These principles are also well established.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>The trial judge in this case applied these principles in rejecting 
    the joint submission of 12 years parole ineligibility for Mr. Dewald.  The 
    trial judge’s rejection of the joint submission is therefore entitled to deference 
    on appeal.  In my view, the trial judge’s conclusion that a parole ineligibility 
    period of 12 years “will bring the administration of justice into disrepute 
    and clearly would not be in the public interest” was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>I think it was reasonable for three reasons:  first, denunciation; 
    second, aggravating features of the crime; and third, general deterrence.  
    The appellant was convicted of not one, but two counts of second degree murder.  
    The enormity of his crime – deliberately drowning his two young children – 
    would shock the sensibilities of any right-thinking person.  The trial judge 
    cannot be faulted for concluding a severe denunciatory sentence was called 
    for, a sentence that would reflect society’s abhorrence of this kind of crime.  
    As he justly said:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section2>Children such as Jennifer and Christopher place in their 
      parents the ultimate trust.  A parent comforts, consoles, sustains and protects.  
      They rely on their parents for shelter, safety and survival.  So, when a 
      parent breaches that trust it is a breach of the worst kind.  Children most 
      often cannot fight back and cannot survive on their own.  I have no doubt 
      that a parent murdering their child is the worst possible breach of trust. 
      …</div>
    <div class=Section2><br>
      The public interest requires that there be confidence in the court system 
      and the administration of justice.  The public must know the concept of 
      denunciation and they must also know that courts will not tolerate a breach 
      of trust of this magnitude.</div>

    </span>Carthy J.A. concludes the trial judge erred in rejecting, without a 
    hearing, the underlying basis of the joint submission, that Mr. Dewald acted 
    spontaneously and that his depression precipitated his horrendous crime.  
    My colleague says that the trial judge should not have found the aggravating 
    elements of planning and motive without giving Mr. Dewald a chance to be heard.  
    My colleague’s reasons are compelling.  I would agree with him if I were of 
    the view that the underlying facts were disputed.  But I take a different 
    view of the evidence.  I see this not as a case of disputed facts but as a 
    case of competing inferences from undisputed facts.  The underlying facts 
    were not contested.  In exercising his discretion under s. 745.4 of the <i>Criminal 
    Code</i>, the trial judge was not obliged to accept counsels’ view of the 
    appropriate inferences to be drawn.  He was entitled to draw his own inferences 
    as long as he had a reasonable evidentiary basis for doing so.  See <i>R. 
    v. W.B.C.</i>, [2000] O.J. No. 397.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In my view, the aggravating features of the crime relied on by the 
    trial judge were amply supported by the uncontested record.  The trial judge 
    was at the very least “extremely suspicious” whether Mr. Dewald acted spontaneously.  
    His suspicion was well-grounded.  On August 11, 1998, two days before the 
    murders, Mr. Dewald’s son told his father’s employer that his father would 
    be away for the rest of the week.  The next day, Mr. Dewald told Ms.&nbsp;Marlatt 
    that he was not enjoying his children and could not stand to be around them.  
    On August 13<sup>th</sup>, the day he murdered his children, he took them 
    to his father’s house by Lake Erie, knowing that the house would be empty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>In addition to his suspicion about the spontaneity of the murders, 
    the trial judge concluded that Mr. Dewald had a motive for the murders – to 
    better his own life and to try to get back together with Ms. Marlatt.  In 
    the trial judge’s words:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section2>You made a conscious decision to rob your children of 
      their precious lives in an effort to enhance your own life.  You sacrificed 
      your own flesh and blood to obtain some sort of personal gratification so 
      you could have a better life.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section2> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Again, the record reasonably supports this finding.  Mr. Dewald could 
    not accept that Ms. Marlatt had ended their relationship.  He obsessively 
    pursued her, desperately pleaded with her to restart the relationship.  About 
    two weeks before the murders, in an effort to convince Mr. Dewald that the 
    relationship between them could never work, Ms.&nbsp;Marlatt told him that 
    she did not enjoy being with his daughter.  After the murders, when Mr. Dewald 
    finally confessed to Ms. Marlatt, she asked him what he was thinking and he 
    replied: “I was there, they were there.  I thought of you and it happened.”  
    She then asked him why he killed his children and he answered: “Because I 
    love you more than anything in the world.”  Later, he told the police: “I 
    just wanted a nice life to live, I was searching, couldn’t find it, to happiness.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Finally, the trial judge took into account Mr. Dewald’s attempted cover-up 
    of the murders.  That the accused tried to cover up what he had done is an 
    inescapable finding on the evidence.  After drowning his children, Mr. Dewald 
    pushed the bodies out to the middle of the lake.  He then took a circuitous 
    route back to his father’s cottage, sat down on a lawn chair, put his feet 
    up on a bench, put on the headphones of his Walkman and pretended to sleep.  
    After an hour, he got up, went to a nearby house and told several neighbours 
    present that he thought his children had drowned accidentally.  He repeated 
    this lie to the police and maintained that the drownings were accidental until 
    his admission to Ms.&nbsp;Marlatt in one of their telephone discussions, which 
    the police intercepted with her consent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>These aggravating features of the crime were all relevant to the appropriate 
    period of parole ineligibility.  The trial judge also considered that general 
    deterrence was relevant.  In his words:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section2>However, of far more importance is the general deterrence 
      to all those persons out there who may treat the lives of their children 
      in a callous and mean spirited way.  They need to know that they will not 
      attract a period of ineligibility at the lower end of the range if they 
      are convicted of second degree murder involving children.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section2> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Mr. Dewald argues that the trial judge erred in principle in taking 
    into account general deterrence.  But the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision 
    in <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 321 says otherwise.  In 
    deciding whether to increase the period of parole ineligibility in cases of 
    this kind, my view is that denunciation is ordinarily far more important than 
    general deterrence.  But both are relevant.  In <i>M. (C.A.)</i>, Lamer C.J.C. 
    wrote at 360-61:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section2>As Iacobucci J. recently noted in <i>R. v. Shropshire</i> 
      (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at para. 23, 129 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 657, 
      [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, in discussing the mandatory minimum period of parole 
      ineligibility for first degree murder: “[p]arole ineligibility is part of 
      the ‘punishment’ and thereby forms an important element of sentencing policy”.</div>
    <div class=Section2><br>
      While Parliament was undoubtedly animated by the full range of sentencing 
      principles in setting such threshold periods, it appears to have been principally 
      motivated by the sentencing goals of deterrence and denunciation.  By establishing 
      a fixed formula for a minimum period of parole ineligibility under s. 120(1) 
      of the <i>Corrections Act</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, the lesser of one-third of the 
      sentence or seven years), Parliament seems to have concluded that a minimum 
      period of physical confinement was necessary to advance the causes of general 
      deterrence and denunciation even if the offender was completely rehabilitated 
      and posed absolutely no threat to society at the time of sentence.  Courts 
      of appeal have similarly concluded that other minimum parole ineligibility 
      periods set by the <i> Code</i> are principally motivated by the concerns 
      of deterrence and denunciation.  As the Manitoba Court of Appeal concluded 
      in <i>R. v. Ly</i> (1992), 72 C.C.C. (3d) 57 at p. 61, 16 W.A.C. 209, 78 
      Man. R. (2d) 209, in discussing the 10-year parole ineligibility for second 
      degree murder under s. 744 of the <i>Code</i>: “Parliament’s purpose in 
      adding a minimum period of parole ineligibility to a life sentence was, 
      in my view, twofold.  It was to deter and denounce the crime.”</div>

    </span>Denunciation, the aggravating features of the crime and general deterrence

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Before leaving this issue, I wish to address briefly the question whether 
    Mr.&nbsp;Dewald had a fair opportunity to meet the trial judge’s concerns.  
    Both the Crown and Mr. Dewald knew that the trial judge was not bound by the 
    joint submission.  Both, therefore, ought to have put before the court a full 
    record justifying the proposed sentence.  See the <i>Report of the Attorney 
    General’s Advisory Committee on Charge Screening, Disclosure and Resolution 
    Discussions </i>(<i>The Martin Report</i>, Toronto:  Queen’s Printer, 1993<i>)</i> 
    at p. 373-5.  Counsel ought especially to have done so in a case like this 
    where the joint submission on its face seemed unduly lenient and would cause 
    many judges to question whether it should be accepted.  Indeed, Justice Thomson 
    expressed his own concerns about it during the submissions on sentence.  In 
    attempting to justify the joint submission, Crown counsel suggested that he 
    and defence counsel knew many more facts about the case than the court.  He 
    said:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section2>Now when I agreed to take that position it was apparent 
      to all concerned that Your Honour would in no way be bound by that joint 
      submission.  On the other hand we expected and the law makes plain that 
      if Your Honour is faced with such a joint submission, that you will give 
      it due deference and will consider, among other things, that counsel are 
      in a position to have access to many more facts surrounding the case.</div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section2> 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The trial judge responded: 
    “Like what?”  Crown counsel answered by giving, as an example, his accepting 
    after investigation that the murders did not involve elements of planning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span>Mr. Dewald now contends that the trial judge erred in assuming that 
    he had all the information counsel were relying on in support of the joint 
    submission.  I cannot accept this contention.  Crown counsel cannot expect 
    the trial judge to act on a record known to the parties but not disclosed 
    to the court.  If other information justified the joint submission, both counsel 
    should have disclosed this information to the court.  Even on appeal, however, 
    defence counsel did not put forward any additional information to support 
    12 years parole ineligibility.  The trial judge was entirely justified in 
    concluding:</p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <div class=Section2>All participants in the trial were fully aware of all 
      of the facts that were submitted by Crown counsel here.  There is a complete 
      history of it.  As well, all of the video statements and oral statements 
      were exposed for scrutiny during the course of this trial.  I specifically 
      asked Crown counsel what additional facts there were and elicited only one 
      and that was with respect to the fact that Mr. Dewald listened to his stereo 
      radio at the cottage.</div>

    </span>Though justified in rejecting the joint submission, in my view, the

    23 years.  He erred in two related ways.  He equated this case with <i>R.

    of remorse, his depression and his prospects for rehabilitation.</p>

    </span>In the present case, the trial judge concluded that Mr. Dewald was 
    “one of the worst kind of offenders having committed one of the worst kinds 
    of offences.”  I do not agree.  Murdering your own children must rank as one 
    of the worst offences but Mr.&nbsp;Dewald is not one of the worst offenders, 
    at least not compared to Mr. Podniewicz.</p>

    Mr.&nbsp;Podniewicz shook his infant daughter several times.  He watched her 
    die over several days and never once called for help.  He had previously assaulted 
    another child, leaving the boy severely brain damaged.  He was on parole at 
    the time he murdered his daughter and his prospects for rehabilitation were 
    poor to non-existent.  He showed no remorse and refused to accept responsibility 
    for what he did.  Nothing in his background explained or mitigated his conduct.</p>

    rehabilitation.  He was severely depressed when he committed the murders, 
    a depression that according to his psychiatrist, contributed to what he did.  
    Mr. Dewald also exhibited remorse by his guilty plea, in his discussions with 
    his psychiatrist and in his closing statement to the court.</p>

    </span>The trial judge gave very little weight – inadequate weight in my view 
    – to these mitigating considerations.  The trial judge did not fairly balance 
    the effect of Mr.&nbsp;Dewald’s depression, the remorse he showed and his 
    prospects for being rehabilitated against the horrendous nature of his crime.  
    Although the crime itself and the circumstances surrounding it warranted a 
    period of parole ineligibility well above the minimum, the character of the 
    offender militated against a period at the upper end of the range.  In my 
    view, an appropriate period is 17 years.</p>

    </span>I would allow the appeal by reducing the period of Mr. Dewald’s parole 
    ineligibility from 23 years to 17 years.</p>
