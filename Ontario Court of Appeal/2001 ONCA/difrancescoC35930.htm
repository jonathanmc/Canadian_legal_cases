<p><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On appeal from the order of Justice Peter B. Hambly 
  dated February 8, 2001.</span></b></p>
<h4 align=left style='text-align:left'><b>SIMMONS J.A.:</b></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>        This appeal raises 
  two issues. The first issue requires consideration of  when a change of circumstances 
  will justify rescission of arrears of child support on a variation application. 
  The second issue is whether the dismissal of an application to rescind child 
  support arrears bars a future application for rescission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Ms. DiFrancesco 
  appeals from an order dated February 8, 2001 that rescinded outstanding arrears 
  of child support totalling almost $40,000, reduced the amount of child support 
  payable to her by Mr. Couto for the parties’ two children from $500 per month 
  to $102 per month, and directed that Mr. Couto provide her proof of his income 
  by affidavit every three months.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Ms. DiFrancesco 
  says no variation should have been made because there had been no change in 
  circumstances since the date of the last variation order as required by s. 17(4) 
  of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985. c.3. Further, she says the motions judge 
  erred by rescinding arrears that had accumulated prior to the date of the last 
  application to rescind, which was dismissed. Finally, she says the motions judge 
  erred by “imputing” an income of only $9,000 per annum to Mr. Couto, given that 
  he lost a better paying job as the result of misconduct, and has indicated he 
  will not support his children. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       I would allow 
  the appeal in part, by setting aside the order for rescission of arrears, and 
  by suspending enforcement of arrears against income sources, save to the extent 
  of $50 per month.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Background</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Ms. DiFrancesco 
  and Mr. Couto divorced on August 31, 1992. The divorce judgment required Mr. 
  Couto to pay child support in the amount of $250 per month per child for each 
  of the parties’ two children. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Ms. DiFrancesco 
  assigned the order for child support to the Ministry of Community and Social 
  Services on June 1, 1991, as she was in receipt of family benefits at the time. 
  The assignment remained in effect for various periods between June 1, 1991 and 
  November 30, 1995. The arrears that accumulated during that period were accordingly 
  the property of the Ministry. They totalled approximately $8,000 as of January 
  30, 2001.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Mr. Couto brought 
  the first variation application on May 25, 1995. It was confirmed that child 
  support arrears were at a zero balance as of July 1993; that Mr. Couto had been 
  on public assistance since June 1993; and that approximately $7,000 in child 
  support arrears had accumulated since that date. A parental support worker for 
  the Social Services Department of the Regional Municipality of Waterloo also 
  indicated that the Ministry of Consumer and Social Services was prepared to 
  waive its share of child support arrears, totalling $6485.17 as of April 30, 
  1995. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       Ms. DiFrancesco 
  submitted that Mr. Couto lost the job he held on the date of the Divorce Judgment 
  as a result of misconduct. She said he worked for his cousin while receiving 
  workers’ compensation benefits, and that he was also disentitled from receiving 
  unemployment insurance benefits because of his actions. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The applications 
  judge concluded that “in [his] opinion the applicant ha[d] the ability to meet 
  the terms of the existing support order” and dismissed the application for a 
  variation of periodic support and rescission of arrears.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By notice of motion dated December 11, 2000, Mr. Couto applied for similar 
  relief to that requested on May 25, 1995. On February 8, 2001 the motions judge 
  made the following findings:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Respondent has long been an alcoholic. He does not have the earning 
      capacity to pay the arrears nor the current support order. I accept that 
      a reasonable imputed income to him at the present time based on the material 
      before me is $9,000 per year.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge reduced ongoing child support payments to $102 per 
  month, being the amount payable pursuant to the federal Child Support Guidelines 
  for two children based on an income of $9,000 per year. He also rescinded all 
  outstanding arrears of child support, including the pre-May 1995 arrears.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Couto’s material filed on the February 2001 motion disclosed his 
  income from 1992 onward as follows: 1992 -- $17,496 (employment earnings of 
  $14,174, tips of $2,247 and other income of $1,075); 1993 -- $12,053 (employment 
  earnings of $5,331, W.C. benefits of $2,587 and social assistance of $4,135); 
  1994 -- $549 per month (social assistance); 1995 -- $6,447 (social assistance); 
  1996 – $5,842 (social assistance); 1997 -- $4,974 (social assistance); 1998 
  -- $4,867 (social assistance); 1999 -- $7,387 (social assistance of $2,096 and 
  employment earnings of $5,291). </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Couto’s evidence was that he went to California shortly after the 
  Divorce Judgment was granted to commence rehabilitation for alcohol abuse. He 
  said that he has had a problem with alcohol abuse throughout his adult life 
  and that it has impacted adversely on his ability to hold a steady job for extended 
  periods of time. He claimed that he worked at one job from September 1999 until 
  May 15, 2000 but that he was unjustly terminated due to a personality conflict. 
  He did not qualify for Unemployment Insurance because his employer advised Unemployment 
  Insurance that it was a voluntary termination. In October 2000 he registered 
  with an employment service and was assigned a temporary position where he earned 
  $9 per hour. He said he was hopeful that he would earn $9,000 in 2001 based 
  on an average of 20 hours per week at $9 per hour. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. DiFrancesco claims that Mr. Couto’s annualized income as of the 
  date of the Divorce Judgment was in excess of $26,500 per year. According to 
  her, annualized figures for the jobs he held in 1999 and 2000 reveal an earning 
  capacity ranging from $21,000 per year to $16,548 per year respectively. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. DiFrancesco said the following in her affidavit filed in support 
  of the February 2001 motion: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>From the time we initially separated, the respondent has repeatedly said 
      to me that he will pay nothing to me for child support. He expressed this 
      view to me repeatedly and regularly for years while he continued to make 
      no payments under the support Order.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ms. DiFrancesco claims that payments made by Mr. Couto over the years 
  have all been involuntary. She points particularly to the fact that although 
  he was working during portions of 1999 and 2000, there is no indication Mr. 
  Couto ever gave notice of his income sources to the Family Responsibility Office. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although apparently prepared to waive arrears at one time, the Ministry 
  of Community and Social Services supports the position taken by Ms. DiFrancesco 
  on this appeal, that it was not open to the motions judge to rescind arrears 
  accumulated prior to a dismissed rescission application. It submits the decision, 
  in that respect, is <i>res judicata.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Decision</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, there was sufficient evidence before the motions judge to 
  justify his conclusion that there had been a change in circumstances as of February 
  2001 warranting a reduction in the quantum of periodic child support. It is 
  apparent that as of February 2001, Mr. Couto had failed to generate even a subsistence 
  level of income over a period of <i>several years</i>. This, combined with Mr. 
  Couto’s recent history of temporary work placements through an employment agency, 
  led the motions judge to impute to him an annual income of only $9,000. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge attributed Mr. Couto’s persistent failure to generate 
  additional income to alcoholism, and not to wilful non-compliance. He obviously 
  concluded that Mr. Couto’s longstanding failure to generate income had affected 
  his <i>capacity</i> to earn income. Accordingly, unlike the situation existing 
  in May 1995, when the applications judge determined Mr. Couto still had the 
  capacity to generate sufficient income to pay the original support order, the 
  motions judge in February 2001 determined that was no longer the case. Based 
  on the evidence before him, I am unable to say his conclusion was unreasonable. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree that the motions judge would have been justified in imputing 
  additional income to Mr. Couto, however I am not persuaded that he erred in 
  arriving at a figure of $9,000. Mr. Couto had only recently returned to the 
  workforce after a very lengthy absence and had no track record of steady employment. 
  The nature of Mr. Couto’s continuing employment was uncertain. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motions judge’s findings that Mr. Couto lacks the capacity to pay 
  the original support order on an ongoing basis, and that a variation of ongoing 
  support is therefore necessary, are justified based on an imputed income of 
  $9000 per year. In my view, however, the finding that Mr. Couto lacks capacity 
  to pay relates only to his <i>present</i> capacity to pay. The motions judge 
  did not consider, nor was there evidence concerning, the likelihood of Mr. Couto 
  regaining the capacity to make payments on account of the arrears in the future.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The finding of a <i>present</i> incapacity to pay does not, of itself, 
  foreclose the prospect of ability to pay in the future. In <i>Haisman v. Haisman</i> 
  (1994), 7 R.F.L. (4<sup>th</sup>) 1 (Alta. C.A.) Hetherington J.A. said the 
  following at paragraphs 26 – 27:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>A present inability to pay arrears of child support does not by itself 
      justify a variation order. It may justify a suspension of enforcement in 
      relation to the arrears for a limited time, or an order providing for periodic 
      payments on the arrears. However, in the absence of some special circumstance, 
      a variation order should only be considered where the former spouse has 
      established on a balance of probabilities that he or she can not pay and 
      will not in the future be able to pay the arrears.</p>
    <p>In short, in the absence of some special circumstance, a judge should not 
      vary or rescind an order for the payment of child support so as to reduce 
      or eliminate arrears unless he or she is satisfied on a balance of probabilities 
      that the former spouse or judgment debtor can not then pay, and will not 
      at any time in the future be able to pay, the arrears. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The decision to rescind arrears involves consideration of a variety 
  of factors. In <i>Filipich v. Filipich</i> (1996), 92 O.A.C. 319 this court 
  noted that some of the factors a court may consider are set out in <i>Gray v. 
  Gray</i> (1983), 32 R.F.L. (2d) 438 Ont. (H.C.J.) at p. 441. They are as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p> (1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> the nature of the obligation 
      to support, whether contractual, statutory or judicial;</p>

      of the obligation, tempered, however, in the case of child support with 
      the fact that such support obligation exists for the child’s benefit, is 
      charged with a corresponding obligation to be used by the custodial parent 
      for the child’s benefit and cannot be bargained away to the prejudice of 
      the child;</p>
    <p> (5)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> unreasonable and unexplained

  </span> In light of the exercise of discretion involved in rescinding arrears, 
  I would not adopt as strict a position as that set out in <i>Haisman, supra.</i> 
  Rather, in my view, the motions judge erred in this case by rescinding outstanding 
  arrears without assessing Mr. Couto’s future<i> </i>capacity to pay those arrears. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I note as well that there was no evidence before the motions judge that 
  Mr. Couto had made any voluntary payments on account of arrears following the 
  dismissal of his last application for a variation. Similarly, there was no evidence 
  indicating that he had notified the Family Responsibility Office that he had 
  resumed employment in 1999. Mr. Couto’s apparent failure to make any voluntary 
  efforts at compliance is a factor that militates against even partial rescission 
  of arrears at this time. Wilful non-compliance with the terms of a support order 
  should not be condoned or rewarded by the court. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not, however, view the dismissal of an application to rescind arrears 
  as an absolute bar to future rescission of those same arrears, provided there 
  is a change in circumstances sufficient to warrant a variation. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, I note that the language of the provisions authorizing a variation 
  is very broad. Although the <i>Divorce Act</i> stipulates that the change in 
  circumstances necessary to trigger the right to seek a variation must occur 
  after the date of the last variation order, there is no such language limiting 
  the scope of variation available.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Second, the issues presented on succeeding motions for rescission of 
  arrears lack the identity necessary to give rise to issue estoppel.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a>   The first issue for determination on an application for variation 
  of support payments or arrears is whether there has been a change in circumstances 
  sufficient to warrant the variation sought. Once that threshold is met, the 
  presenting issue is whether rescission is justified <i>in the context of the 
  changed circumstances</i>. The fact that a prior application did not meet the 
  threshold for variation does not, of necessity, determine the issue of whether 
  rescission of those same arrears is justified in the context of subsequent changed 
  circumstances. </p>

  </span> In <i>Setinas v. Setinas</i> (1984), 39 R.F.L. (2d) 43 (Ont. Prov. Ct. 
  (Fam. Div.)) at para. 18, Main Prov. Ct. J. made the following comments about 
  the application of issue estoppel to matrimonial litigation, and variation applications 
  in particular: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Fundamental to the doctrine of estoppel by record including issue estoppel 
      is that it is in the public interest that there should be an end of litigation: 
      <i>interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium</i>… However, it must be borne 
      in mind that matrimonial litigation, as it relates to the issue of ongoing 
      support, both as to enforcement and variation, differs from ordinary litigation. 
      Finality can be achieved only where a support obligation ceases and when 
      all outstanding arrears are either paid or rescinded. Until that point is 
      reached, s. 21 of the [<i>Family Law Reform</i> <i>Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, 
      c. 152] allows for applications to vary and to rescind. To that extent, 
      the maxim must be modified. This is not to say that frivolous or vexatious 
      proceedings will be tolerated. The six-month limitation on applications 
      to vary, without leave of the court, an award of costs on a solicitor and 
      client basis and the power in the court to stay or dismiss as an abuse of 
      process are sufficient to dissuade litigants from making such applications.</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>Setinas</i> involved a question of whether findings made in an enforcement 
  proceeding could give rise to issue estoppel in a subsequent application to 
  vary made pursuant to the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i>. Although not directly 
  applicable here, the comments are instructive in that they address a particular 
  feature of family law legislation, namely the ability to seek a variation of 
  a prior order based on changed circumstances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the requirement that there be a change in circumstances as 
  a precondition to the right to seek a variation protects against abuse and signals 
  that the scope of the variation available is very broad. Once the threshold 
  of changed circumstances is met, the court’s discretion to make the order that 
  would have been appropriate, had those circumstances existed in the first instance 
  is engaged. The fact that an order for rescission was inappropriate on an earlier 
  date, may impact on the manner in which the discretion to grant a variation 
  is exercised; for example, where a debtor was recalcitrant in fulfilling his 
  obligations. It does not however, bar the court’s discretionary authority to 
  make the appropriate order, based on the changed circumstances existing when 
  a subsequent application is made.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The determination that issue estoppel does not bar subsequent rescission 
  of arrears following an unsuccessful application to vary, is consistent with 
  decisions relating to variation of orders for custody and access. Those decisions 
  indicate that once the threshold of changed circumstances is met, the court 
  must embark on a fresh inquiry into what is in the best interests of the child, 
  not based on a presumption in favour of the custodial parent, but rather based 
  on the findings of the judge who made the previous order, <i>as well as</i> 
  the evidence of the new circumstances. Ultimately, the issue to be determined 
  is the best interests of the child: <i>Gordon v. Goertz</i> (1996), 19 R.F.L. 
  (4<sup>th</sup>) 177 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At this point, Mr. Couto has not demonstrated either a present willingness 
  to support his children voluntarily, or an accurate picture of his future capacity 
  to contribute to outstanding arrears. It is not therefore, appropriate to rescind 
  outstanding arrears. Rather, enforcement should be suspended to an extent that 
  reflects the motions judge’s finding concerning Mr. Couto’s present ability 
  to pay. In my view, it would be unreasonable to conclude that Mr. Couto could 
  contribute more than $152 per month to the support of his children from an annual 
  income of $9000.</p>
