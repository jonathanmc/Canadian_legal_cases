  </span></span> The appellant, D.O., was convicted of the offences of indecent 
  assault and gross indecency following a jury trial presided over by Justice 
  Robert Weekes in Bracebridge in June 1998.  The time frame set out in the indictments 
  was 1973 – 1982 and the complainant was T.M., the appellant’s step-daughter 
  at the time.  In October 1998, the trial judge sentenced the appellant to 12 
  months imprisonment for the indecent assault conviction and 12 months concurrent 
  for the gross indecency offence.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant appeals his convictions on four grounds: (1) an 
  improper cross-examination of the appellant designed to show that he was a person 
  of bad character; (2) the failure by the trial judge to warn the jury against 
  drawing an improper propensity inference with respect to the lifestyle of the 
  appellant and his former wife (the complainant’s mother); (3) an insufficient 
  warning to the jury about relying on the complainant’s evidence after a 20 year 
  lapse of time between the dates of some of the alleged incidents and the laying 
  of the charges; and (4) the failure to stay one of the convictions on the basis 
  of the principle in <i>R. v. Kienapple</i> (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 524 (S.C.C.).  
  The appellant also appeals his sentence.  He contends that the trial judge erred 
  by not imposing a conditional sentence.</p>

  </span></span> The complainant was the appellant’s step-daughter and the only 
  Crown witness.  She alleged that the appellant sexually abused her in various 
  homes on a total of six or more occasions by digitally penetrating her, masturbating 
  her and performing oral sex on her.  She also testified that the appellant ground 
  his body against her, used her hand to masturbate himself and forced her to 
  perform oral sex on him.</p>

  </span></span> T.M. testified that she disclosed the sexual abuse to her mother 
  in the appellant’s presence  when she was approximately 12 years old, but that 
  her mother did not believe her.  She did not report the allegations to the police 
  until she was an adult following two years of behavioural therapy, and she told 
  her sister and half-sister about the allegations when she was 22 or 23 years 
  old.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant testified in his own defence and denied the allegations.  
  The appellant’s daughter and another step-daughter also testified on his behalf.  
  They said that the appellant had never sexually abused them or acted inappropriately 
  towards them.  All of the defence witnesses testified about inappropriate sexual 
  activity on the part of D.H., another step-father, against all three girls.</p>

  <u>Improper cross-examination</u></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant contends that the Crown conducted an improper cross-examination 
  of the appellant focussing on his alleged shortcomings as a parent vis-à-vis 
  his other children.  The appellant cites the following examples of improper 
  areas explored by Crown counsel in his cross-examination of the appellant:  
  the appellant had custody of his son but did not take care of him and placed 
  him to live with a couple unrelated to him; the appellant had no interest in 
  the whereabouts of his daughter K. between the ages of 3 and 16; the appellant 
  allowed his daughter to “fend for herself” after she became 5 years of age; 
  and the appellant had allowed his step-daughter J. to move back to live with 
  her mother S.M. when he knew that S.M. was not taking care of the children properly.  
  The appellant contends that questions relating to these events were designed 
  to portray the appellant as a bad and unloving father.  The inference the jury 
  might draw from this evidence, the appellant submits, is that a bad and uncaring 
  father might be the sort of person capable of committing acts of sexual impropriety 
  on his step-daughter, the complainant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not agree with this submission for two reasons.  First, 
  the appellant testified at great length about his good parenting in relation 
  to his children and step-children.  Indeed, he tried to portray the complainant’s 
  mother, S.M., in a very bad light and testified that he regularly took steps, 
  at great personal and professional cost, to look after the children, including 
  the complainant.  For example, in his examination in chief, the appellant testified:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In 1978 I had arrived home from a western trip and found the children alone, 
      and they had been for several days.  I quit my job and stayed home.  I got 
      a job in Ralph Scales Refrigeration in Gravenhurst.  I bought the house 
      on Sarah Street and moved the children and myself into the house so it would 
      be easier for me to look after them because I worked in Gravenhurst and 
      Southwood was about 14 miles cross country across the old 13<sup>th</sup> 
      Concession to Gravenhurst.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=No style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>In my view, in light of 
  the extensive and detailed testimony by the appellant about how good a parent 
  he was, including in relation to the complainant, there was nothing improper 
  about the Crown’s cross-examination of him in this area.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second,  in his examination in chief, the appellant testified 
  about alleged sexual abuse of the complainant by another step-father, D.H.:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Well T.M. came over to the house one afternoon and she was very upset, 
      and she asked me if she could move into the house.  And I thought it was 
      - - she was just mad at her mother, and as children will do, they, they 
      - - they’re going to run away from home.  She was - - I noticed she was 
      very upset.  She just didn’t calm down.  I asked her what was the matter.  
      Why did she want to move, move into the house?  And she said that, she said 
      that - - you’ll have to forgive me for what I’m going to say.  She said 
      that D.H. was drunk all the time.  And her exact words were, “He’s eating 
      my crotch.”</p>

  <blockquote>

lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The principle of fairness is applicable to the circumstances 
  of this case.  In light of the strong position the appellant took in his own 
  testimony about his good parenting, his former wife’s bad parenting, and the 
  presence of an abusive step-father, D.H., in the children’s lives, the Crown 
  was entitled to cross-examine him about his parenting skills so  that the jury 
  would not be left “with a distorted view of the facts”.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant submits that the learned trial judge erred by not 
  warning the jury against drawing a propensity warning as a result of the evidence 
  of the lifestyle of the appellant and his former wife, S.M., the complainant’s 
  mother.  The specific evidence  the appellant relies on to support his contention 
  that such a warning was required was:  the appellant enjoyed watching pornographic 
  movies in the presence of the complainant; the appellant had broken D.H.’s fingers 
  when they became involved in a physical fight; the appellant was a bad and uncaring 
  father; the appellant and S.M. maintained an unusual relationship over the years; 
  and S.M.’s parenting was interrupted by her incarceration at the Vanier Centre 
  for Women.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not accept the appellant’s submissions on this point.  The 
  trial judge did tell the jury that the appellant’s lifestyle should not be a 
  factor in their deliberations:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US>Bear in mind that this trial is not about the lifestyle

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Turning to the specific evidence relied on by 
  the appellant on this issue, the trial judge specifically dealt with the evidence 
  relating to pornographic movies:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I want to say something about the pornographic movies.  T.M. told us that 
      the accused made her watch them while she was living at Farquhar Street.  
      The accused said that there were such movies that came into his possession 
      and that, while he watched them with S.M., he never showed them to T.M.  
      <i>If you find as a fact that the movies were never shown by the accused 
      to T.M. then the fact that the accused watched them is irrelevant to your 
      consideration of these charges</i>.  If, on the other hand, you find as 
      a fact that they were shown to T.M. by the accused that would demonstrate 
      inappropriate behavior on the part of the accused in his dealings with T.M. 
      which you might find to be supportive of her allegations against him.   
      [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> The evidence relating to the appellant breaking D.H.’s fingers 
  was brief and did not prejudice the appellant at all.  In cross-examination, 
  the complainant testified that she remembered a particular house because D.O. 
  and D.H. “scuffled and fought on the stairs” and “D.O. broke his [D.H.’s] finger”.  
  In his cross-examination, the appellant explained that the incident took place 
  because D.H. “had assaulted S.M., knocked her unconscious down the stairs” and 
  “I broke his little fingers when he was trying to choke me and I threw him out 
  of the house”.  It is unlikely that the jury would draw a negative inference 
  about the appellant from this evidence.</p>

  </span></span> The limited evidence about the appellant’s bad parenting was, 
  as discussed in the previous section, appropriate in light of the appellant’s 
  own evidence about his parenting  and his attack on the suitability and conduct 
  of S.M. and D.H. as parents.</p>

  </span></span> The evidence relating to the appellant’s unusual relationship

  did not prejudice him.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant contends that the trial judge erred by failing 
  to charge the jury that, in light of the passage of about 20 years between the 
  time of some of the alleged events and the laying of charges, the evidence of 
  the complainant could not be adequately tested.  Accordingly, the appellant 
  submits, the jury should have been told that it would be dangerous to convict 
  on the complainant’s evidence alone unless the jury, scrutnizing the evidence 
  with great care, considering the circumstances relevant to its evaluation and 
  paying heed to the warning, were satisfied of its truth and accuracy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge instructed the jury about the passage of time 
  between the events and the laying of charges, but the appellant submits this 
  only made matters worse.  The trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The evidence of the complainant must be scrutinized carefully 
      . . . because of her age when the events are claimed to have happened and 
      because of the lapse of time between the claimed events and her trial testimony.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He then pointed to the difficulties an adult might have in trying to remember  
  traumatic events from her childhood, the fact that trauma from an assault might 
  prevent a detailed accurate memory of an event and concluded:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Children may not be able to recount precise details of the when and 
          where of an event.  This does not mean that they have misconceived what 
          happened and who did the act.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The trial judge then instructed the jury that, in spite of these difficulties, 
  “the underlying standard of proof of the elements of the offence remains as 
  proof beyond a reasonable doubt”.  Later in his charge, the trial judge identified 
  as a factor for the jury when considering the complainant’s testimony, “[h]er 
  present ability to recall and the reliability of that memory”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s submission on this issue boils down to the proposition 
  that in historical sexual assault cases, the trial judge must instruct the jury 
  about “the danger” of convicting on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant.  
  In support of this position, the appellant relies on the <i>Longman</i> line 
  of cases in Australia, including <i>R. v. GJH, </i>[2001] N.S.W.C.C.A. 128<i>, 
  R.</i> <i>Mayberry</i>, [2000] N.S.W.C.C.A.A. 531, <i>R. v. Crampton </i>(2000), 
  176 A.L.R. 369 (Aust. H.C.), and <i>R. v. Longman</i> (1989), 168 C.L.R. 79 
  (Aust. H.C.).</p>

  </span></span> I do not agree that in the circumstances of this case a special 
  instruction was required.  The rationale for the <i>Longman</i> line of cases 
  is the effect of the lapse of time on the ability of the defence to test or 
  challenge the complainant’s allegations.  I am not persuaded that the circumstances 
  of this case give rise to this concern.  The appellant did not raise the issue 
  with the trial judge.  Both the appellant and his witnesses testified in great 
  detail about the events that had occurred many years before.  In my view, there 
  is not a sufficient basis shown to justify the conclusion that the appellant 
  was sufficiently prejudiced in mounting his defence by the passage of time between 
  the events and the laying of charges to warrant a special instruction or caution 
  along the lines of <i>Longman</i>.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The appellant, relying on <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, 
  <i>supra,</i> submits that the trial judge erred in not entering a stay of proceedings 
  on the conviction for gross indecency because there was a complete overlap between 
  the offences of indecent assault and gross indecency.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, I disagree.  Both the indictment and the trial 
  judge’s jury charge made a clear distinction between the alleged acts of the 
  appellant that gave rise to the charge of indecent assault and the single category 
  of act, the appellant performing oral sex on the complainant, that served as 
  the basis for the charge of gross indecency.  Accordingly, there was not the 
  overlap in charges prohibited by <i>Kienapple.</i>  Moreover, I note that defence 
  counsel, who was familiar with the evidence in the case, did not raise a <i>Kienapple</i> 
  objection after the jury returned its verdict or during the sentence hearing.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for the 
  offence of indecent assault and 12 months concurrent for the offence of gross 
  indecency.  He contends that the trial judge over-emphasized the principles 
  of general deterrence and denunciation and erred by not imposing a conditional 
  sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge considered the leading cases in this court dealing  
  with conditional sentences, especially <i> R. v. Wismayer</i> (1997), 115 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 18 (Ont. C.A.).  He recognized that it “would be open to me to impose a 
  conditional sentence if I were satisfied that it met the ends of sentencing”.  
  Nevertheless, because the appellant “used T.M. as an object of sexual gratification 
  when he ought to have been providing a safe haven for her”, the trial judge 
  concluded that “the principles of general deterrence and denunciation would 
  not be met by a conditional sentence on these facts”.  It is well established 
  that trial judges are to be accorded considerable deference when deciding whether 
  or not to give a conditional sentence.  In my view, there is no error of principle 
  shown that would justify the intervention of this court.</p>
