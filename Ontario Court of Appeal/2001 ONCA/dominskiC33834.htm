  </span> The appellant appeals acquittals entered by a summary conviction appeal 
  court on one count of driving while impaired by drugs or alcohol under s. 253(a) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and one count of driving with a blood alcohol level 
  in excess of the legal limit under s. 253(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Police stopped the respondent’s motor vehicle after observing him disobey 
  a traffic signal and driving erratically. The officer who stopped the respondent 
  smelled marihuana when she approached his vehicle. She asked if he was high 
  on drugs. He said that he was. The officer arrested the respondent for driving 
  while impaired by drugs<ins cite=""
datetime="2001-05-30T14:46">,</ins> handcuffed him, and placed him in the back 
  of her vehicle. She also advised him of his s. 10(b) rights under the <i>Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. When asked whether he understood and if 
  he wanted to call a lawyer, the respondent replied “yeah, whatever”. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The officer noticed an odour of alcohol when she returned to her vehicle 
  after speaking to another officer. She asked the respondent if he had been drinking. 
  He confirmed that he had. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> An approved screening device was delivered to the scene within four 
  minutes of the officer detecting the odour of alcohol. The officer demanded 
  the respondent provide a sample of his breath pursuant to s. 254(2) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>. The respondent failed the test. He was re-arrested and taken to the 
  police station. He failed a breathalyser test administered after he had exercised 
  his rights to counsel.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge accepted the police officer’s evidence that she considered 
  the respondent’s answer to her inquiry about whether he wanted to call a lawyer 
  following his arrest on the charge under s. 253(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  for driving while impaired by drugs as ambiguous and non-committal. The trial 
  judge found that “yeah whatever”, in the unique circumstances of the respondent’s 
  actions, did not amount to an invocation of his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights. 
  He convicted the accused of driving with a blood alcohol level in excess of 
  the legal limit contrary to s. 253(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. He said he 
  was satisfied the evidence would support a finding of guilt on the impaired 
  driving charge under s. 253(a) of the Criminal Code but that the principle in 
  <i>Kienapple<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a></i> 
  allowed a finding of guilt only on the charge under s. 253(b) of the Criminal 
  Code. The charge under s. 253(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as set out on the 
  information was marked “stayed”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The summary conviction appeal judge reversed the trial judge’s finding 
  on whether the respondent had invoked his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights and 
  held that the respondent was not afforded the right to counsel at the earliest 
  opportunity. There was no basis for the summary conviction appeal judge to change 
  the trial judge’s finding of fact. His reasons are of no assistance on this 
  pivotal point.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although the respondent was detained in relation to the s. 253(a) impaired 
  driving charge at the time the approved screening device demand was made, we 
  are satisfied the statutory prerequisites set out in s. 254(2) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> for making a demand existed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Generally, police are under no obligation to advise a motorist of his 
  s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights prior to implementing an approved screening device 
  demand: <i>R. v. Misasi</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 339 at 345 (Ont. C.A.); see 
  also <i>R. v. Thomsen</i> (1988) 40 C.C.C. (3d) 411 (S.C.C.). The respondent 
  did not argue that his pre-existing detention in any way diminished the usual 
  constitutional justification for the suspension of the right to counsel at the 
  time an approved screening device demand is made. We note that strict compliance 
  with section 254(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is a prerequisite to a prosecution 
  for failing to comply with a demand and that the required demand is that the 
  sample be provided ‘forthwith’: <i>R. v. Grant</i> (1991), 7 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  388 (S.C.C.). We accordingly see no reason to depart from the principle enunciated 
  in <i>Thomsen</i> and <i>Misasi </i>in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For all of the foregoing reasons, in our view the trial judge was correct 
  in finding that there was no breach of the respondent’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> 
  rights. There was accordingly no basis for the summary conviction appeal court 
  to overturn the conviction on the charge under s. 253(b) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In the unusual circumstances of this case we would, if necessary, extend 
  the time for appealing the decision of the summary conviction appeal court on 
  the charge under section 253(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to 30 days after 
  the day the decision was rendered on the charge under s. 253(a) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Leave to appeal the acquittal entered by the summary conviction appeal 
  court on the charge under s. 253(b) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>is granted<i>,</i> 
  the appeal is allowed, and the conviction entered at trial is restored. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In light of our decision on the s. 253(b) charge, it may not be strictly 
  necessary to deal with the decision of the summary conviction appeal court on 
  the charge under s. 253(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. Nevertheless, we are 
  satisfied, based on <i>R. v. Terlecki</i>  (1984), 22 C.C.C. (3d) 224 (S.C.C.) 
  aff.’g (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 522 at 529-30 (Alta C.A.), that it was unnecessary 
  for the Crown to file a notice of cross-appeal of that count to the summary 
  conviction appeal court. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The summary conviction appeal court determined that the trial judge 
  failed to enter a finding of guilt on the charge under s. 253(a) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> even though it appeared the trial judge had intended to do so. Absent 
  a finding that the intended verdict was unreasonable, rather than enter an acquittal, 
  the summary conviction appeal court ought to have left undisturbed the stay 
  of that charge entered by the trial judge. In the unique circumstances of this 
  case, leave to appeal the acquittal on the charge under s. 253(a) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code </i>is granted, the acquittal entered by the summary conviction appeal 
  court is set aside, and the charge is conditionally stayed in accordance with 
  the principle in <i>R. v</i>. <i>Kienapple</i>.</p>
