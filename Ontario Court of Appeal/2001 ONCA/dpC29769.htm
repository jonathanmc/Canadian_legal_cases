    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On April 17, 1997, after trial by judge alone, 
    the appellant D.P. was found guilty of one count of sexual assault upon A.M. 
    and two counts of touching A.M. for a sexual purpose. On June 2, 1997, he 
    was sentenced to five years imprisonment on the count of sexual assault and 
    five years and two years concurrent on the two counts of touching for a sexual

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In 1993, the appellant formed a relation with 
    the complainant's mother S.M. Between 1993 and 1996, even though he continued 
    to maintain his own residence, the appellant essentially resided with S.M. 
    and her children. During this timeframe, when the complainant was age 12 to 
    14, she claimed that the appellant engaged in various acts of sexual misconduct 
    with her, including full intercourse on a regular basis.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The complainant testified that the first incident 
    occurred in early July 1995 when her mother was in the hospital giving birth 
    to her fourth child. On that occasion, after the appellant had sent her two 
    brothers to bed, he lured her into the basement on the pretext that he wanted 
    to show her a gift he had purchased for her mother. Once downstairs, the appellant 
    forced her onto the bed and proceeded to rape her. She stated that he used 
    a condom at the time and that she was bleeding from her vagina after the attack. 
    She also recalled the appellant saying that he would &quot;hurt&quot; her 
    if she told anyone about the incident.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>According to the complainant, the sexual abuse 
    continued until October 1996, at which time she left home and went into foster 
    care. Several months later, she reported the abuse to a friend and this led 
    to the Children's Aid and the Police becoming involved. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Apart from the one incident in July 1995, 
    the complainant was not asked to provide details about the other incidents 
    of sexual abuse. She did however state that the abuse took various forms, 
    including regular acts of intercourse, and it usually occurred when her mother 
    was not at home or when she was showering. She testified that throughout the 
    course of the abuse, the appellant regularly threatened her and she specifically 
    recalled being told on more than one occasion that she would be a &quot;goner&quot; 
    if she said anything.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Despite these threats, the complainant testified 
    that she did report the abuse to her mother on an intermittent basis. Furthermore, 
    she claimed that on at least one and perhaps several occasions, her mother 
    actually caught the appellant having sex with her. Nothing came of this however, 
    because she and her mother were frightened of the appellant. According to 
    the complainant, the appellant had a violent streak in him and he regularly 
    assaulted her and the other children as well as her mother. In short, she 
    portrayed him as someone who dominated the household and brooked no opposition.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> The complainant turned 14 on August 4, 1996. In October of 
    that year, she left home and went into foster care. On November 5, 1996, within 
    a month of leaving home,  the complainant was examined by Dr. Anne Niec, an 
    expert in the identification and interpretation of signs of sexual abuse in 
    children. </p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> Called as a Crown witness, Dr. Niec testified that in the course 
    of her examination, she observed abnormalities in the complainant's hymen 
    which in her view were indicative of sexual abuse. Specifically, she noted 
    that the hymenal opening was &quot;quite large and gaping&quot; and that the 
    hymen itself had been torn or lacerated in two places. Although she could 
    not date the injuries, she was certain that they had not occurred within the 
    past 72 hours. According to Dr. Niec, these findings were abnormal for a young 
    person A.M.'s age and they were &quot;consistent with something&quot; being 
    &quot;forced  into her vagina&quot;.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In cross-examination, Dr. Niec conceded that 
    the historic injuries to the hymen could theoretically have been caused by 
    innocent means, such as falling on a hard object that penetrated directly 
    into the vagina. In her opinion however, events of this nature were extremely 
    rare and it was far more likely that the injuries were the product of trauma 
    from sexual abuse. </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span
lang=EN-US><br>
    [10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant testified on his own behalf 
    and his evidence stood in stark contrast to that of the complainant. He denied 
    ever sexually abusing her and he rejected her allegations of physical abuse. 
    He did admit to being a strict disciplinarian and he claimed that the complainant 
    disliked him because of this. In his mind, that accounted for her leaving 
    home and falsely accusing him with sexual abuse.</span></p>

    Reasons for Conviction</span></u></b></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span lang=EN-US><br>
    [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge delivered brief oral reasons 
    for judgment. He recognized that the case boiled down to credibility and he 
    identified several features in the complainant's evidence that caused him 
    concern. Accordingly, he instructed himself on the need to proceed with caution 
    before acting on her evidence alone to convict. In the final analysis however, 
    taking into account the confirmatory evidence provided by Dr. Niec, he accepted 
    the complainant's evidence over that of the appellant, whom he characterized 
    as &quot;an evasive and unresponsive witness totally lacking in credibility&quot;.</span></p>

    [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that he was prejudiced 
    because of trial counsel's failure to adequately and effectively represent 
    his interests at trial. He bases this submission on counsel's failure to call 
    the complainant's mother S.M. as a witness and his failure to seek out and 
    possibly call an expert witness to challenge the medical evidence given by 
    the crown's expert Dr. Niec.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span lang=EN-US><br>
    [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Beginning with the first complaint, the appellant 
    submits that his counsel should have called S.M. to rebut the complainant's 
    evidence that on at least one and perhaps several occasions, S.M. actually 
    observed the appellant having illicit sexual relations with the complainant. 
    </span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span lang=EN-US><br>
    [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> Based on the record<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
    [1] </span></a>, it is clear that as a result of his interviews with S.M., 
    trial counsel knew that she would deny having seen any such encounters. What 
    is unclear is whether she also would have denied that the complainant disclosed 
    the abuse to her on an intermittent basis and was told to say nothing to avoid 
    being harmed by the appellant. On this subject, the record merely indicates 
    that trial counsel was told by S.M. that she did not believe her daughter's 
    allegations. We have no way of knowing whether by this, S.M. was saying that 
    she did not believe her daughter in general or that she did not believe the 
    specific complaints made to her throughout the course of the alleged sexual 
    abuse.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span lang=EN-US><br>
    [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> If the latter, we see every good reason why trial counsel would 
    have been reluctant to call S.M. as a witness. Not only would her testimony 
    have confirmed the complainant's  evidence of early disclosure, something 
    the defence was not prepared to concede, it would also have required S.M. 
    to explain why she disbelieved her daughter and what, if any steps she took 
    to ferret out the truth.</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span lang=EN-US><br>
    [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Apart from this potential concern, trial counsel 
    provided two further reasons for choosing not to call S.M. as a witness. First, 
    he felt that she would make a very poor witness because of her inability to 
    articulate her evidence with any degree of certainty or consistency. Second, 
    he was alive to S.M.'s concern that her disbelief of the complainant could 
    result in Children's Aid removing her other children from the home. This was 
    a risk she was not prepared to run and one which the appellant, when cross-examined 
    on his affidavit, admitted he would not have asked her to take.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoNormal> <span lang=EN-US><br>
    [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In addition to the reasons articulated by 
    trial counsel, we think that had S.M. been called, she might well have confirmed 
    the complainant's evidence that the appellant was a violent, domineering individual 
    who brooked no opposition in the household. Such evidence could only have 
    enured to the benefit of the Crown, confirming, as it would have, the complainant's 
    evidence that both she and her mother feared the appellant and felt helpless 
    to put an end to his sexual abuse. </span></p>

    to call S.M. as a witness came down to a judgment call on the part of trial 
    counsel. Having weighed the pros and cons, he chose not to call her. In our 
    view, he had good cause to believe that S.M.'s evidence might do the appellant 
    more harm than good. In the circumstances, we are far from persuaded that

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Without going into detail, suffice it to say 
    that Dr. Cramer took no issue with most of the evidence given by Dr. Niec. 
    Specifically, he confirmed that the injuries to the complainant's hymen had 
    been &quot;caused by penetration of the complainant's vagina involving force&quot;. 
    He further confirmed that the historical injuries were caused by repeated 
    penetration and that the penetration &quot;was consistent with intercourse 
    and not a blunt trauma injury&quot;. Unlike Dr. Niec, however, he was not 
    prepared to accept that the injuries were the product of sexual abuse. Rather, 
    in his opinion, they were equally consistent with consensual sexual activity.</span></p>

    engaged in consensual sex with the complainant but whether he engaged in sex 
    with her at all. Dr. Niec and Dr.&nbsp;Cramer were both of the view that the 
    abnormalities to the complainant's hymen were consistent with repeated acts 
    of intercourse and inconsistent with any other rational explanation. To that

    at trial, his evidence may have left the trial judge with a doubt about whether 
    the sexual conduct between the complainant and the appellant was consensual 
    as opposed to non-consensual. That finding however, would have been of no 
    assistance to the appellant because under s.150.1(1) of the <i>Code</i>, the

    judge might have had a doubt not only that the complainant engaged in consensual 
    sex but that she did so with someone other than the appellant. Viewed in its 
    most charitable light, Dr. Cramer's evidence could not possibly satisfy the 
    second of these prerequisites. In our view, it would be rank speculation to 
    infer from his evidence that the complainant was having consensual sex with 
    someone other than the appellant during the relevant timeframe. Accordingly, 
    we are not persuaded that the appellant suffered any prejudice from trial 
    counsel's failure to seek out a defence expert witness.</span></p>

    A.M. had left home and was living in a foster home, the other long after the 
    appellant's trial when A.M. was living at Grace Haven, a home for unwed mothers. 
    According to T.Q., on the first occasion, A.M. told her that the appellant 
    had sexually abused her but she (A.M.) provided no details of the sexual misconduct. 
    On the second occasion, T.Q. claimed that A.M. recanted and told her that 
    she had lied about being sexually abused by the appellant, stating instead 
    that she had been raped by a former boyfriend.</span></p>

    Police in December 2000. In it, T.Q. readily recalls the conversation in which 
    A.M. disclosed that she had been sexually abused by the appellant. In addition, 
    contrary to her evidence at the wardship proceeding, she remembers that A.M. 
    provided details of the sexual abuse, stating that the appellant had fondled 
    her breasts, touched her vagina and raped her. Notably however, despite being 
    questioned repeatedly about it, she denies having any further conversation 
    with A.M. about the appellant and she is adamant that A.M. did not recant 
    her earlier accusations. Of equal, if not greater significance, she flatly

    when questioned by Mr. Trotter about A.M.'s alleged recantation, T.Q. initially 
    stated that A.M. did not recant her accusations while she was residing at 
    Grace Haven or anywhere else. After being reminded of her evidence at the 
    wardship proceeding, she immediately changed her response, stating that although 
    A.M. did recant at one point, she could not say where it occurred. Mr. Trotter 
    then reminded T.Q. of her statement to Detective Huss in which she clearly 
    stated that A.M. did not recant her earlier accusations at any time and, in 
    an effort to determine her final position on the issue, Mr. Trotter asked: 
    &quot;What's the right version&quot;?, to which T.Q. replied: &quot;I don't 
    know&quot;. After several more questions and answers, T.Q. reverted to saying 
    that A.M. did recant at one point. Ultimately, she maintained that position 
    in response to a series of leading questions put to her by Mr.&nbsp;Burstein.

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>With respect, we disagree with the appellant's 
    submission. Although we are satisfied that T.Q.'s evidence meets the first 
    two criteria in <i>Palmer</i>, in our view, her evidence founders on the third 
    test. Simply put, we are not persuaded that T.Q.'s evidence is reasonably 
    capable of belief. To the contrary, when her evidence is considered as a whole, 
    it is so highly suspect and unreliable that we consider it to be virtually 
    worthless. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Apart from anything else, we find it impossible 
    to place any reliance on T.Q.'s evidence as it relates to the alleged recantation, 
    given that her evidence on the subject appears to change not only from proceeding 
    to proceeding but at times, from moment to moment. Just as she was certain 
    at the Crown wardship proceeding that A.M. did recant, she is equally certain 
    in her statement to Detective Huss that she did not. Indeed, in that statement, 
    she denies having taken a different position on the subject at the wardship 
    proceeding. As for her January 3lst evidence, while it is true that in the 
    end, she maintains that A.M. did recant, her evidence on the subject is highly 
    inconsistent and contradictory. Indeed, as we have noted, she initially took 
    the position that A.M. did not recant, only to change her mind after being 
    confronted with her testimony from the wardship proceeding. </span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Other features of T.Q.'s evidence are equally 
    unsatisfactory and leave us completely perplexed. For example, in her videotaped 
    statement and her testimony on January 31, 2001, she is questioned about how 
    and why she came to be called as a witness on behalf of S.M. at the Crown 
    wardship proceeding. Without going into detail, suffice it to say that her 
    answers are contradictory, confusing, and in the end completely unintelligible. 
    In short, it remains a complete mystery to us as to how and why she came to 
    be at that hearing.</span></p>

    </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Our reticence about T.Q.'s reliability is 
    heightened by her suggestibility and inventiveness as a witness. A prime example 
    of this occurred in her videotaped statement when Detective Huss asked her 
    if A.M.'s mother is a good cook. Initially, T.Q. replied that she had no idea 
    because she had never eaten a meal at A.M.'s home. She was then confronted 
    with her testimony from the wardship proceeding in which she stated that A.M.'s 
    mother was a good cook. Realizing that she had been trapped, T.Q. suddenly 
    remembered eating one meal at A.M.'s home and she relied on this as a basis 
    for justifying her testimony at the wardship proceeding. In our view, her 
    recovery, though quick, was completely contrived.</span></p>
