style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting his former girlfriend 
  with a machete.  Two other charges were withdrawn.  There does not appear to 
  have been any agreement between counsel as to the appropriate sentence.  The 
  facts read in by Crown counsel after the plea were accepted by defence counsel 
  as accurate.  They fully supported the plea and the trial judge found the appellant 
  guilty.  The matter was adjourned for the preparation of a pre-sentence report.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant told the probation officer preparing the pre-sentence 
  report that he knew his actions were “inappropriate”.  He also denied significant 
  portions of the police statements and said that he “pled guilty only because 
  my lawyer told me to”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In light of the allegations in the pre-sentence report, trial counsel 
  moved before the trial judge to be removed from the record.  Prior to sentence, 
  new counsel brought a motion to strike the guilty plea.  He expressly disavowed 
  any claim that former trial counsel had acted improperly or unprofessionally.  
  Counsel argued that the plea should be struck because the appellant did not 
  understand the proceedings at which he pleaded guilty and was confused when 
  he entered his guilty plea.  The appellant testified on the motion to strike 
  the plea and indicated that he was confused and upset when he pleaded guilty.  
  Apparently he had a bad headache.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant has about a grade six education and his ability to read 
  and write English is limited.  He is not from Canada, but has worked in Canada 
  for many years.  He has been before the criminal courts on four previous occasions.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In cross-examination, the appellant acknowledged that when he was arrested 
  very shortly after the alleged incident, he knew that he was charged with hitting 
  the complainant with a machete.  He also acknowledged that he told the probation 
  officer that he pled guilty only because his lawyer told him to.  The appellant 
  said that he was confused when he made this statement to the probation officer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A guilty plea entered in open court, particularly by an accused represented 
  by counsel, is presumed to be a valid plea.  An accused seeking to set aside 
  that plea bears the onus of demonstrating that the plea is not valid.  There 
  is nothing in the record of the proceedings in which the plea was entered that 
  raises any concern about the validity of the plea, or which would have necessitated 
  that the trial judge make some specific inquiries of the appellant personally 
  to satisfy himself that the plea was valid.  The facts read in by the Crown 
  were straightforward, simple and fully supported the allegation.  The accused 
  pleaded guilty personally and was represented by experienced counsel who acknowledged 
  in open court the correctness of the facts referred to by the Crown.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We read the trial judge’s reasons as making a finding that the appellant 
  comprehended what he was being asked when he pleaded guilty.  In coming to that 
  conclusion, the trial judge said that he was entitled to infer that counsel, 
  who it was agreed had acted properly and professionally in representing the 
  appellant on the plea, had taken the necessary steps to ensure that the appellant 
  understood the nature and consequences of his plea.  We think the inference 
  drawn by the trial judge is an appropriate one where it is accepted that counsel 
  acted in accordance with his professional obligations.  We see no reason to 
  interfere with the trial judge’s finding that the appellant had not discharged 
  the onus of demonstrating the invalidity of his guilty plea.  </p>
