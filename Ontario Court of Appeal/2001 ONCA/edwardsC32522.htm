<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the sentence imposed by 
  Justice Kenneth A. Langdon, sitting without a jury, dated June 18, 1999</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ROSENBERG J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This Crown appeal concerns the admissibility and use of evidence 
  of other criminal acts in determining the sentence to be imposed upon an accused.  
  The appeal appears to represent a clash between two principles of sentencing.  
  On the one hand, a sentencing court may not punish an offender for other untried 
  offences.  On the other hand, this and other appellate courts have held that 
  a sentencing court may take into account evidence of other criminal acts as 
  that evidence may shed light on the background or character of the accused or 
  explain the circumstances of the offence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appeal also involves consideration of two other principles 
  of sentencing.  The Crown sought to justify imposition of the life sentence 
  in this case on the basis of the so&#8209;called <i>Hill</i> principle (<i>R. 
  v. Hill</i> (1974), 15 C.C.C. (2d) 145 (Ont. C.A.); affirmed, [1977] 1 S.C.R. 
  827).  That principle sanctions the imposition of a life sentence for offenders 
  who have committed a very serious offence and who appear to represent a continuing 
  danger to the community.  Finally, this appeal involves the scope of appellate 
  intervention on a Crown appeal in light of the position taken at trial by Crown 
  counsel.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of his 
  common-law spouse.  Before the trial judge, the Crown sought to prove a pattern 
  of conduct by the respondent towards this victim and his other partners that 
  would justify imposition of a life sentence.  The trial judge ruled most of 
  the evidence inadmissible.  The Crown conceded that if it could not establish 
  this pattern of conduct, an appropriate sentence would be ten years' imprisonment 
  less credit for pre-trial custody.  The trial judge therefore imposed a sentence 
  of eight years' imprisonment taking into account approximately nine months of 
  pre-trial custody.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss this appeal.  In 
  summary, I would resolve the issues of principle as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>1.            Evidence of uncharged and untried offences is admissible 
      for the limited purpose of showing the background and character of the offender.</p>
    <p>2.            The trial judge has a discretion to refuse to admit evidence 
      of other uncharged and untried offences.</p>
    <p>3.            Where it would not be disproportionate to the gravity of 
      the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender, the court 
      may, in application of the <i>Hill</i> principle, impose a life sentence 
      where the offence is part of a pattern of violent behaviour that threatens 
      the physical safety of others.</p>
    <p>4.            Ordinarily, the pattern of violent behaviour will be demonstrated 
      by convictions.  If it cannot be demonstrated in that way, and the Crown 
      seeks an indeterminate sentence, the Crown should generally resort to the 
      dangerous offender provisions of Part XXIV of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
    <p>5.            The trial judge in this case did not err in refusing to admit 
      some of the evidence of untried and uncharged offences.  </p>
    <p>6.            The failure to admit the other evidence did not affect the 
      validity of the sentence in view of the Crowns position at trial.</p>
    <p>7.            In light of the Crowns position at trial, the judge did 
      not err in imposing the eight-year sentence and this court should not interfere 
      with the sentence.</p>

    &lt;/span&gt;The victim Glenna Firth was 35 years of age at the time of the plea.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt;She first met the respondent in Edmonton when she was 19 years of age.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;

    at the time of the plea.&lt;span

    18 years of age, from another relationship.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The following day, the police were called to the home of Ms. 
  Firth and the respondent because of a verbal argument.  The respondent agreed 
  to move out of the house for two months to give Ms. Firth an opportunity to 
  find alternative accommodation.  A week later, Ms. Firth brought an <i>ex parte</i> 
  application for a restraining order and for custody of Jamal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> About two weeks later, on September 11, 1998, the respondent 
  returned to the house while Ms.&nbsp;Firth and a friend were planning a birthday 
  party for one of their friends. The respondent eventually left but returned 
  at 6:30 p.m. and took Ms. Firth, Jamal and two of Jamals friends to a local 
  restaurant.  The respondent behaved strangely.  He did not eat and just stared 
  at his food.  On the way back from the restaurant, the respondent kept telling 
  Ms. Firth that they had to go to Guelph and that Jamal would be staying at his 
  friends house.  Ms. Firth did not understand the reference to Guelph.  She 
  had no reason to go there.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the house, Ms. Firth went to the master bedroom to get some 
  things and when she turned around the respondent was in the room.  He grabbed 
  her neck, called her a fucking bitch and poked at her eyes.  Ms. Firth tried 
  to fight him off and told him that she loved him.  The respondent continued 
  to choke Ms. Firth until she became unconscious.  When she regained consciousness, 
  Ms. Firth realized that she was bleeding.  She looked in the mirror and saw 
  that one of her eyes was hanging out of its socket.  Eventually, Ms. Firth made 
  her way to a neighbours and then to the hospital.  Her eye was removed at the 
  hospital.  Ms. Firth had also sustained injuries to her neck.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the meantime, the respondent had left the house.  He called 
  a friend and told her that he had killed Ms. Firth by strangling her.  He told 
  his friend to call the police.  She did so.  A few hours later, the respondent 
  approached a police officer and surrendered.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After pleading guilty, the respondent acknowledged that these 
  facts were correct although he claimed that he did not remember all of the events 
  of the evening of the offence.  Based on these facts, the trial judge entered 
  a finding of guilt for attempted murder.  On consent, the case was remanded 
  to June 18, 1999.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is apparent from the transcript of the proceedings before 
  the trial judge that there had been negotiations between Crown counsel, not 
  Ms. Ficek, and counsel for the respondent.  As I understand the arrangement, 
  if the Crown could bring a witness from Jamaica to Canada by June 18, 1999, 
  the Crown would seek to have her evidence admitted.  Then, based on that and 
  other evidence, the Crown would argue that a life sentence was warranted because 
  of a pattern of conduct on the part of the respondent.  The Crown agreed that 
  if it could not prove a pattern of conduct, a ten-year sentence less credit 
  for pre-sentence custody was appropriate.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With considerable effort, the Crown was able to get the Jamaican 
  witness, Rose Powell, to court on June 18<sup>th</sup>.  Counsel for the respondent 
  argued that this evidence was inadmissible.  Crown counsel summarized his argument 
  for admission of the evidence in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The fact [is] that this offence is part of a pattern that the Crown submits 
      warrants a life sentence.  The facts themselves in the case, the Court may 
      find amount to an offence of stark horror.  You have heard the facts of 
      the case and that would be a decision wholly for Your Honour, of course, 
      to decide if that is a valid basis upon which to consider a life sentence.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US> in order to prove that [this offence] is not an event 
      that is isolated,  that does form a pattern of conduct of violence, the 
      Crown has to look at the character and background of the accused.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the course of his submissions, Crown counsel gave the trial 
  judge only a very sketchy indication of the evidence he sought to call.  He 
  stated that based on the evidence of Ms. Powell, the respondents first spouse, 
  and admissions made by the respondent to Ms. Firth, he could prove that when 
  the respondents relationship with Ms. Powell ended, the respondent hired someone 
  to throw acid in her face.  This incident occurred about eighteen years earlier 
  in Jamaica.  The respondent was never convicted of any offence in relation to

  </span></span> Crown counsel also made brief reference to the facts underlying 
  previous convictions for assault and threatening for which the respondent received 
  a sentence of two years' imprisonment.  Crown counsel told the trial judge that 
  he would prove that the accused attacked the victim of that offence with a fork 
  in an attempt to disfigure her.  Crown counsel stated that this too was part 
  of his pattern of trying to disfigure his former partners when his relationship 
  with them endsa pattern of if I cant have you, no one can.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge initially ruled only on the admissibility of 
  the evidence concerning Ms. Powell.  He held that if evidence is adduced at 
  the trial of a pattern of violent or dangerous conduct, it may be taken into 
  account on sentencing.  However, the Crown cannot manufacture a criminal record 
  at sentencing by leading evidence of untried and contested crimes.  The trial 
  judge held that this would deprive the accused of all the procedural safeguards 
  of a trial, especially where the collateral crime is committed in a foreign 
  country, an accused would be at a substantial disadvantage of finding or calling 
  evidence to defend himself.  The trial judge also said that the danger exists 
  of deflecting the courts attention from the sentencing issues and creating 
  the undesirable situation of embarking on a trial within a trial.  Finally, 
  the trial judge asked, Is not the accused entitled to a jurys verdict before 
  it can later be said of him, in aggravation of sentence, that he has earlier 
  committed a serious indictable offence or a serious indictable offence that 
  formed part of a pattern extending back eighteen years?  Is this court to deprive 
  an accused of a defence he may have in the foreign country?  </p>

  </span></span> In the result, the trial judge ruled that the evidence was inadmissible.  
  Crown counsel then sought to call Ms. Powell on a <i>voir dire</i> to preserve 
  her evidence for use at a possible appeal.  It seemed that Ms. Powell was a 
  reluctant witness and counsel was concerned that he would not be able to secure 
  her attendance in Canada in the future.  The trial judge refused to permit this 
  procedure.  He did, however, permit Crown counsel to file a videotape of a statement 
  Ms. Powell had given to the police the night before.  This statement was taken 
  under oath and after Ms. Powell was warned of the consequences of giving a false 
  statement.  Following the trial, the police prepared a transcript of this statement, 
  which was filed in this court.</p>

  </span></span> After the ruling concerning Ms. Powell, the Crown sought to call 
  Ms. Firth to testify about the conduct of the respondent towards her during 
  their fifteen-year relationship.  Crown counsel gave very little indication 
  of the contents of this proposed evidence.  He simply stated that some of this 
  conduct had led to charges but the charges had been withdrawn.  Crown counsel 
  seemed to concede that the trial judges ruling on Ms.&nbsp;Powells allegations 
  might apply to this evidence.  The trial judge ruled the evidence inadmissible.  
  He stated that there was an additional reason for rejecting the evidence.  He 
  stated that one of the chief benefits of entering a plea of guilty is that the 
  facts are read before the Court and a great deal of evidence that might technically 
  be admissible in a contested trial, a great deal of that evidence is simply 
  not put in.  It might well have been relevant at this trial to demonstrate the 
  accused person had engaged in a pattern of violent or controlling conduct towards 
  this individual, with a view to proving the motive for murder.  However, since 
  the respondent had pleaded guilty to attempted murder the issue was moot.  Thus, 
  the proposed evidence was simply prior conduct involving untried and contested 
  crimes.  Again, the trial judge did permit the Crown to file a videotape and 
  transcript of a statement Ms. Firth had given to police describing this conduct.

  </span></span> Crown counsel filed documents relating to the respondents conviction 
  in 1986 for assault and uttering threats.  The victim was Veronica Johnson, 
  the respondents second spouse.  The material filed by the Crown indicated that 
  the respondent had attacked Ms.&nbsp;Johnson in the face with a fork.  Three 
  months later, while on judicial interim release, the respondent made a death 
  threat to Ms. Johnson.  The respondent received a sentence of two years' imprisonment 
  and three years' probation.  This material seems to have been admitted without 
  objection.</p>

  had made these recordings and no objection was taken to their admissibility.</p>

  </span></span> After the various evidentiary rulings, Crown counsel conceded 
  that without the excluded evidence, he could not establish a basis for a life 
  sentence.  He repeated that the appropriate sentence was ten years less credit 
  for pre-sentence custody.  In light of the Crowns position, defence counsel 
  stated he would not be calling any evidence.  He provided very brief information 
  about the respondent.  The respondent was born in Jamaica in 1955.  His mother 
  is still alive and lives in the United States.  He has four siblings.  Two brothers 
  live in Alberta.  Two sisters live in the United States.  They are all of good 
  character.  The respondent came to Canada in 1977 and lived in Alberta.  He 
  studied metallurgy and then trained as a welder.  He had held full-time employment 
  as a welder since then.  He moved to Ontario in 1986.  Defence counsel suggested 
  that the mitigating circumstances were that the respondent had turned himself 
  in to the police, never denied committing the offence, waived the preliminary 
  inquiry and pleaded guilty.  Defence counsel submitted that taking into account 
  the pre-sentence custody, the appropriate sentence would be eight years.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge gave very brief reasons for sentence explaining 
  why he acceded to the submissions of both counsel.  He stated that while the 
  offence could easily be classified as a crime of stark horror attracting 
  a maximum punishment, the lesser punishment was justified in light of the fact 
  that the respondent turned himself in to the police, waived the preliminary 
  inquiry and most importantly did not require Ms. Firth to relive the attack 
  by having to testify at trial.  All this showed that the respondent was not 
  without conscience and was remorseful.  The trial judge therefore imposed the 
  sentence of eight years' imprisonment and made a lifetime weapons prohibition 
  order.</p>

  </span></span> Ms. Powell began a relationship with the respondent in Jamaica 
  in 1976, when she was sixteen years of age.  She described five violent incidents 
  over the course of the relationship, ending in August 1980.  They may be summarized 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(i)            About a year after the relationship began, the respondent 
      slapped Ms. Powell in the face.  She could not remember the reason for this 
      assault.</p>
    <p>(ii)            On another occasion, she was joking with the respondent 
      and for no reason the respondent took a piece of broken glass and cut Ms. 
      Powell on the bicep.</p>
    <p>(iii)            On another occasion, Ms. Powell went into the countryside 
      and when she came back the respondent accused her of going to look for a 
      man.  The respondent then beat her up so badly that he nearly killed her.  
      This attack left a scar on her face.</p>
    <p>(iv)            In the summer of 1980, the respondent returned to Jamaica 
      from Canada.  He took Ms. Powell to a movie and then they went to the guesthouse 
      to sleep.  When Ms. Powell returned from the bathroom, the respondent had 
      a gun, which he pointed at her head.  Ms. Powell ran away and the police 
      later recovered the gun.  Ms. Powell believed the respondent wanted to kill 
      her because he was jealous that she was seeing another man.  However, they 
      reconciled and the respondent returned to Canada.</p>
    <p>(v)            About three weeks later in August 1980, the respondent returned 
      to Jamaica and visited Ms. Powell at her mothers house.  He was looking 
      around her room and saw the name of a man on a piece of paper.  The respondent 
      asked her whether she was seeing another man.  He said he was going to return 
      to Canada on August 25<sup>th</sup>.  On that day, three men and a woman 
      came to her mothers home and asked for Rose and mentioned the man whose 
      name had been on the piece of paper.  The woman then threw acid at Ms. Powells 
      face.  Ms. Powell suffered burns to her face and shoulder and required skin 
      grafts.  She was in hospital for about a month.</p>

  </span></span> In 1984, Ms. Firth moved to Toronto to join the respondent.  
  The respondent became jealous of Ms. Firths relationship with her sister and 
  he took away her clothes and left her naked and locked in her room.  She eventually 
  was able to get out of the room and call her sister.  She stayed at a hotel 
  for about a week and then they reconciled.  </p>

  assaulting Ms.&nbsp;Johnson, he and Ms. Firth resumed their relationship and 
  Jamal was born.  Some time later, Ms. Firth found out that the respondent was 
  having an affair.  She confronted him and he slapped her.  This was about five 
  years prior to the attempted murder.  She decided that their relationship was 
  over and she tried to end it.  She attempted to get help from a friend, Leroy, 
  and when the respondent learned of his identity he made threatening telephone 
  calls to him.</p>

  to Toronto and convinced Ms. Firth to come back with him to Edmonton.  After 
  staying with him for six months, Ms. Firth returned to Ontario.  She described 
  the respondent as obsessed with her and she was afraid.  In 1994, there was 
  another encounter with the respondent when he hit her in the head and threatened 
  to shoot her.  She managed to escape and go to a police station.  The police 
  laid charges but they were withdrawn when she and the respondent reconciled

  that they have sex.  She refused and the respondent hit her.  The respondent 
  was charged with assault.  He was released on bail and they again reconciled

  this case, in what circumstances may a sentencing court admit evidence of untried 
  offences to demonstrate a pattern of violent behaviour so as to justify a life 
  sentence on the <i>Hill</i> principle.  I intend to approach these issues by 
  considering the applicable statutory provisions and the case law concerning 
  use of untried offences at sentencing generally.  I will then explain how, in 
  my view, those legal principles should apply to the special problem of the <i>Hill</i>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There are several provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that 
  govern the sentencing of an offender for untried offences.  Section 6 sets out 
  in statutory form the fundamental principle of our criminal justice systemthe 
  presumption of innocence.  Generally speaking, our system knows of only one 
  way to overcome the presumption of innocence.  A charge must be laid and the 
  accused found guilty either by a plea of guilty or by the adducing of evidence 
  meeting the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  This principle has, 
  of course, obtained constitutional protection in s. 11(d) of the <i>Canadian 
  Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</i>  </p>

  </span></span> There are nevertheless certain statutory provisions that contemplate 
  the use of untried offences at the sentencing stage.  Those provisions also 
  set the limits on the use of such evidence and contain important safeguards 
  for the offender.  The most important is s. 725.  Because of its importance 
  to resolve the issues in this case I have set the section out in full:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>725. (1) In determining the sentence, a court</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>(a) shall consider, if it is possible and appropriate 
      to do so, any other offences of which the offender was found guilty by the 
      same court, and shall determine the sentence to be imposed for each of those 
      offences; </span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>(b) shall consider, if the Attorney General and the offender 
      consent, any outstanding charges against the offender to which the offender 
      consents to plead guilty and pleads guilty, if the court has jurisdiction

      each charge unless the court is of the opinion that a separate prosecution

    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>(ii) the court has jurisdiction to try each charge,</span></u></p>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>(iii) each charge has been described in open court,</span></u></p>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>(iv) the offender has agreed with the facts asserted

      the offence described in each charge; and</span></u></p>

    <p><span lang=EN-US>(1.1) For the purpose of paragraphs (1)(b) and (b.1), 
      the Attorney General shall take the public interest into account before

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The parts of s. 725 that are of particular relevance in this 
  case are paragraphs (1)(b.1), (c) and subsection (2).  In summary, paras. (1)(b.1) 
  and (2) allow a sentencing court to take into account outstanding charges only 
  if, among other things, the offender has agreed with the facts asserted by the 
  prosecution and admitted his or her guilt in relation to those offences.  This 
  part of s. 725 is consistent with the principle of the presumption of innocence, 
  since the court may only take these facts into consideration in imposing a sentence 
  for the predicate offence if a charge exists and the accused admits liability.  
  Further, if this procedure has been followed, the offender is protected from 
  double jeopardy because those offences are noted on the information and no other 
  proceedings may be taken in relation to such offences, unless the conviction 
  for the predicate offence is set aside.  This part of s. 725 was not invoked 
  in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 725(1)(c) gives the court a discretion to take into account 
  conduct that is part of the circumstances of the offence, even though that conduct 
  could form the basis of a separate charge.  This provision recognizes the common-sense 
  proposition that conduct does not always fit neatly into the offences as described 
  in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It encourages the prosecution to lay only those 
  charges that most nearly describe the conduct.  The offender is protected from 
  double jeopardy because no further proceedings may be taken with respect to 
  any offence disclosed by those facts unless the conviction for the predicate 
  offence is set aside.  Unlike the para. (1)(b.1) procedure, the offenders consent 
  or admission of liability is not required to invoke this procedure.  However, 
  the occasions on which this procedure may be invoked are carefully circumscribed 
  by the requirement that the facts form part of the circumstances of the predicate 
  offence.  To take a simple example, in sentencing an offender for dangerous 
  driving causing death, the court may take into account as an aggravating factor 
  that at the time of the offence the offenders blood alcohol level exceeded 
  .08.  <i>R. v. Gourgon</i> (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 193 (B.C.C.A.) provides an 
  example of application of this principle.  In that case, in setting the period 
  of parole ineligibility for murder, the trial judge took into account a number 
  of circumstances including the stabbing, during the confinement and murder of 
  the victim, of two other occupants of the home.  As the court said at p. 201:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It would be a very limited, and indeed questionable, consideration that 
      ignored anything material that had happened. The nature of the murder would 
      be meaningless without a consideration of all that happened at the time 
      and place immediately prior to and following the crime. <u>It is all part 
      of the <i>res gestae</i>. It is true that normally on sentencing other offences 
      on which there have been no convictions are not considered, but that is 
      an entirely different situation from the Judge not considering everything 
      that happened at the scene and time when he was reviewing, as he must, the 
      nature and circumstances surrounding the murder for which he was imposing 
      sentence</u>. Whether they constituted other possible charges or offences, 
      was immaterial.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> This provision was not invoked in this case and, in any event, 
  it had no application.  In my view, even Ms. Firths description of her relationship 
  with the respondent in the years prior to the attempted murder did not form 
  part of the circumstances of that offence in the sense contemplated by para. 
  (1)(c).  Those incidents were not, to use the language from <i>Gourgon</i>, 
  part of the <i>res gestae</i>.</p>

  </span></span> The other provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that explicitly 
  deal with the use of evidence of untried offences are found in Part XXIV dealing 
  with dangerous and long-term offenders.  For example, a basis for finding that 
  an offender is a dangerous offender includes evidence showing a pattern of 
  repetitive behaviour by the offender, of which the [predicate offence] forms 
  a part.  The special procedure in that Part was not invoked in this case.  
  Moreover, even where the court is asked to find the accused to be a dangerous 
  offender and to impose a sentence of indeterminate detention, that designation 
  and sentence are imposed for the predicate offence, not the previous untried 
  offences.  The Supreme Court has held that otherwise the procedure would violate 
  s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>:  <i>R. v. Lyons</i> 
  (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at 21-2. </p>

  </span></span> To summarize, it is only in special circumstances, as set out 
  in s. 725, that a court may punish or sentence an offender for untried offences.  
  Those provisions were not invoked in this case.</p>

  </span></span> There are statutory provisions that do permit the use of evidence 
  about the offender, even though that evidence also discloses the commission 
  of other crimes.  First, s. 718(c) and (d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> set out 
  as two of the objectives of sentencing:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(c)            to separate offenders from society, where necessary;</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Neither of these objectives can be fairly achieved through sentencing 
  without knowing something, and perhaps quite a bit, about the background and 
  character of the offender.  The Crown, in this case, in effect put its case 
  for admission of this evidence on the need to separate this respondent from 
  society.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The procedural provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> sentencing 
  regime support the admission and use of evidence about the offenders background 
  and character.  For example, under s. 721, unless otherwise ordered, a pre-sentence 
  report must, wherever possible contain information of the offenders character, 
  behaviour, attitude and willingness to make amends, and the history of previous 
  findings of guilt.  Section 723 provides that the court shall hear any relevant 
  evidence presented by the prosecutor or the offender.  It seems to me that this 
  must include evidence relevant to the offenders character or behaviour and 
  that the admission of such evidence cannot be dependent upon its being placed 
  in a pre-sentence report.  Under s. 724, where there is a dispute about any 
  aggravating fact that is relevant to the determination of a sentence, the prosecutor 
  must establish the fact by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 743.6, which permits a court to set a minimum period 
  of parole ineligibility, also supports admission of evidence about the offenders 
  character.  Under that section, the court is directed to have regard to the 
  character and circumstances of the offender.  That section was not invoked 
  in this case.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is a very important limit on the use of evidence of the 
  offenders character or background.  In addition to the limitation implicit 
  in s. 725 that prohibits punishing an offender for untried offences, s. 718.1 
  sets out the fundamental principle of proportionality in sentencing:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>718.1 A sentence must be proportionate to <u>the gravity of the offence</u> 
      and the <u>degree of responsibility of the offender</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Below, I will consider how that section applies in this case.  
  I simply point out at this juncture that the offence referred to must be the 
  offence of which the respondent was convicted, not the various other offences 
  allegedly committed against Ms. Firth and Ms.&nbsp;Powell.  Similarly, it seems 
  to me that the degree of responsibility of the offender must mean responsibility 
  for the offence, not some other untried offences, absent resort to s. 725.  
  I will turn now to the case law concerning the use of evidence of untried offences 
  at the sentencing stage.</p>
<p class=headingQUOTE><b><i><span lang=EN-US>The case law on use of evidence of

  </span></span> Most of the decisions to which we were referred on this issue 
  were made prior to the enactment of the present sentencing regime.  Nevertheless, 
  they may be of assistance in resolving this issue because the principles outlined 
  in the statutory provisions have largely been part of the common law of sentencing 
  in this country.  For example, parts of s. 725 codify, to a certain extent, 
  the procedure set out in <i>R. v. Garcia and Silva</i>, [1970] 3 C.C.C. 124 
  (Ont. C.A.), for taking other charges into account.</p>

  </span></span> Consistent with the statutory provisions that I have set out 
  above dealing with the pre-sentence report and admission of evidence, the courts 
  have recognized that a sentencing judge has a broad discretion concerning the 
  admission of evidence at a sentence hearing.  As Dickson J. said in <i>R. v. 
  Gardiner</i> (1982), 68 C.C.C. (2d) 477 (S.C.C.) at 513-14:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>One of the hardest tasks confronting a trial judge is 
      sentencing. The stakes are high for society and for the individual. <u>Sentencing 
      is the critical stage of the criminal justice system, and it is manifest 
      that the judge should not be denied an opportunity to obtain relevant information 
      by the imposition of all the restrictive evidential rules common to a trial.</u> 
      Yet the obtaining and weighing of such evidence should be fair. A substantial 
      liberty interest of the offender is involved and the information obtained 
      should be accurate and reliable.</span></p>
    <p><u>The judge traditionally has had wide latitude as to the sources and 
      types of evidence upon which to base his sentence. He must have the fullest 
      possible information concerning the background of the accused if he is to 
      fit the sentence to the offender rather than to the crime</u>.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

  </span></span> In <i>R. v. Jones</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.) at 
  398, a case dealing with admissibility of evidence on a dangerous-offender application, 
  Gonthier J. spoke about sentencing generally and reiterated the need for the 
  judge to have at his or her disposal the broadest possible range of information.  
  He noted that the sentencing stage places a stronger emphasis on societal interests 
  and more narrowly defines the procedural protection accorded to the offender.</p>

  </span></span> The Crown particularly relies upon the decision of this court 
  in <i>R. v. Roud and Roud</i> (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 226.  Mr. and Mrs. Roud 
  were tried and convicted of attempted murder.  The victim of the offence was 
  one of their sons.  At trial, the Crown led evidence of other acts of abuse, 
  especially by Mr. Roud, against the victim and the other children of the marriage.  
  This evidence was admitted as similar fact evidence being relevant to intent.  
  At sentencing, the prosecution led further evidence of abuse by Mr.&nbsp;Roud 
  against the victim and evidence of abuse by Mr. Roud against his son from a 
  previous relationship.  This evidence concerned events that had taken place 
  at least fifteen years earlier.  Trial counsel did not object to the admission 
  of any of this evidence.  The trial judge imposed a sentence of fifteen years' 
  imprisonment.  </p>

  </span></span> On appeal, it was argued that the trial judge erred in taking 
  this evidence into account in determining the sentence.  A fair reading of the 
  reasons of Brooke J.A. speaking for the court at p. 242 indicates that all the 
  evidence, including the evidence of the fifteen-year-old events, was admissible:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Nothing could be more prejudicial to an accused on the 
      issue of sentence than evidence which tends to be general and perhaps more 
      so if examples are injected in the general setting. How can a convicted 
      man defend himself from what is said in such circumstances? Yet in such 
      a case as this one on the issue of sentence, where the question of individual 
      deterrence and rehabilitation of the convicted man are central issues along 
      with the question of the protection of the public, it seems logical that 
      such evidence must be dealt with, for the background and character of the 
      accused man are necessary information for the sentencing Court. The accused 
      must be given every opportunity to cross-examine and to call whatever evidence 
      he chooses.</span></p>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>In my respectful view, the evidence was relevant and 
      admissible and I do not think the learned trial Judge erred in the use he 
      made of it. He did not, as he must not do, punish the appellant for past 
      acts, but on the other hand I think he properly sought to understand the 
      appellant in determining the quantum of sentence appropriate for the offence 
      of which he had been convicted by the jury</span></u><span>  </span>He had 
      a duty to the public, and he had a duty to the appellant. I do not see how 
      he could have discharged either without fairly complete information as to 
      the appellant, his background and his character.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As to the use that the trial judge made of the 
  evidence, at pp. 240-41 Brooke J.A. quoted the following passage from the reasons:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>This is a tragic and horrible case involving a course 
      of separate and joint acts of abuse and mistreatment of ones own child 
      with elements of brutality in which you, Mr. Roud, were the prime mover</span></u><span lang=EN-US> 
      and played a more serious role and you, Mrs. Roud, a lesser role, but an 
      active participant, which conduct culminated in the shooting of Gary with 
      very serious injuries being inflicted on this helpless, defenseless child.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Society has a special responsibility for children and

    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>This is about as grave and ugly an offence as one could 
      see, a senseless, brutal attack by parents upon their own innocent child, 
      in their own home, who did nothing to provoke in any way such vicious conduct; 
      unable to remove himself from such an environment; unable to protect himself. 
      The Court must take adequate measures to show that this is the sort of crime 
      which society looks upon with horror, and also to do justice.</span></u><span>

  </span></span> As indicated in the passage previously quoted, Brooke J.A. held 
  that the trial judge did not misuse the evidence.  It seems to me that the primary 
  thrust of the evidence, at least as it related to the contemporaneous acts of 
  abuse, was to show the relative blameworthiness of the two accused and that 
  the act of attempted murder was not an isolated event but part of a course of 
  conduct of abuse.  However, it is also relatively clear that in the end the 
  trial judge focused on the circumstances of the particular act, which he described 
  as a senseless, brutal unprovoked attack on a vulnerable child.  It is not clear 
  from the reasons of this court what, if any, use the trial judge made of the 
  fifteen&#8209;year-old allegations.</p>

  </span></span> <i><span lang=EN-US>Roud</span></i> is obviously a very important 
  case in this area.  However, I wish to make very brief reference to some of 
  the other decisions.  An application of the <i>Roud</i> principle in circumstances 
  similar to this case can be found in <i>R. v. Inwood</i> (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 
  173 (Ont. C.A.) where on the sentencing of the accused for assault on his wife 
  and infant son, the Crown was permitted to lead evidence of the accuseds abusive 
  relationship with five other women over a seven-year period.  Speaking for the 
  court at p.&nbsp;179, Howland&nbsp;C.J.O. held that the trial judge had made 
  proper use of the evidence:  The trial judge clearly recognized that Inwood 
  could not be given a greater sentence because of any acts of abuse against any 
  of these women as he had not been charged or convicted in respect of such acts.  
  These incidents were simply evidence of his abusive character toward women. 
  He could only be sentenced for the actual assaults committed on [his wife] and 
  [his son].</p>

  </span></span> In <i>Lees v. The Queen</i> (1979), 46 C.C.C. (2d) 385 (S.C.C.), 
  the offender had pleaded guilty to robbery.  At sentencing, he led expert and 
  other evidence to show that he was not violent, was of good character and was 
  unlikely to commit further offences.  In response, the Crown adduced evidence 
  that when the accused had been arrested, a year after the robbery, he was in 
  possession of paraphernalia for use in a further robbery and had stated that 
  he was intending to commit a further robbery because the money from the first 
  one was running out.  The court held, at p. 389, that this evidence was properly 
  admitted on the issue of the offenders character, conduct and attitude, all 
  proper factors to be taken into consideration on sentencing.  It was particularly 
  relevant in light of the expert evidence of good character introduced by the 
  offender.  The court was satisfied that the trial judge had not placed undue 
  reliance upon the evidence.  It is implicit that the Supreme Court was satisfied 
  that the trial judge had not increased the sentence because of uncharged or 
  unproved offences.</p>

  it was held that in imposing sentence for manslaughter, the trial judge was 
  entitled to take into account similar fact evidence led by the Crown at the 
  trial.  This evidence concerned the offenders conduct with six other women.  
  The court said this, at p.&nbsp;363: </p>

  this evidence was inadmissible.  He also referred, apparently with approval, 
  to a decision of the Newfoundland Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. J.C.L. </i>(1987), 
  36 C.C.C. (3d) 32.  In that case, the accused had pleaded guilty to a single

  adduced evidence from the victim and other family members designed to show that 
  the accused had repeatedly sexually assaulted the victim.  ONeill J.A. held 
  that the evidence should not have been admitted.  He discussed at length the 
  various cases bearing on this issue and he was critical of the course taken 
  by this court in <i>Roud</i>.  Thus, after referring to the passage from <i>Roud</i>

  Code</i>, the <i>Code </i>must prevail.  However, I think it is possible to 
  reconcile the <i>Code</i> provisions with the earlier decisions in <i>Roud, 
  Lees, Jones</i> and many of the other decisions.</p>

  </span></span> As is the case with evidence generally, admissibility depends 
  upon the purpose for which the evidence is adduced. In this case, the Crown 
  was not entitled to lead the evidence of Ms. Powell and Ms. Firth for the purpose 
  of increasing the punishment that would otherwise be appropriate for the offence 
  of attempted murder.  To do so would offend the provisions of ss. 718.1 (proportionality) 
  and 725 (taking other offences into account).  The prosecution was also not 
  entitled to lead this evidence to attempt to extract some punishment for those 
  untried and uncharged offences.  That would offend the presumption of innocence 
  and s. 725.  It is no answer to say that the Crown should be able to use the 
  evidence for those purposes if it proves the conduct beyond a reasonable doubt.  
  Such reasoning undermines the basic tenet of our system that, absent compliance 
  with s. 725, an offender can only be sentenced for crimes that have been properly 
  charged and proved at a trial of those offences.</p>

  </span></span> In my view, evidence that discloses the commission by the offender 
  of other untried offences is admissible for the purpose of showing the offenders 
  background and character as that background and character may be relevant to 
  the objectives of sentencing.  That being said, the trial judge must have a 
  discretion to refuse to admit the evidence where necessary to ensure that the 
  accused has a fair hearing.</p>

      which the offender was convicted;</p>

      defending against the allegations in the proposed evidence;</p>
    <p>(iv)            the danger that the sentence hearing will be unduly prolonged;</p>

      to be diverted from the true purpose of imposing a fit sentence for the 
      charged offence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and 
      the degree of responsibility of the offender in accordance with s. 718.1;</p>
    <p>(vi)            whether, as in <i>Lees</i>, the offender has adduced evidence

  </span></span> This is not intended to be an exhaustive list and, as different 
  cases present themselves involving different issues, no doubt other factors 
  will have to be taken into account.  Before applying these factors to this case, 
  I will consider the proposed use of the evidence of untried offences.  This 
  depends, in part, on application of the <i>Hill</i> principle and I will turn 
  to that question now.</p>
<p class=headingtitle>The use of the evidence:  The <i>Hill</i> principle</p>

  </span></span> The proper use of the proposed evidence from Ms. Powell and Ms. 
  Firth was to show the character and background of the respondent and the circumstances 
  of the offence.  The respondents character and background were of particular 
  importance in considering the sentencing objectives of rehabilitation and the 
  need to separate the respondent from society.  The Crown submits that the sentence 
  of life imprisonment is required because of the evidence of the respondents 
  background.  This submission is based on the decisions of this court grounded 
  on the principle in <i>R. v. Hill, supra.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>R. v. Hill</i>, this court imposed a sentence of life imprisonment 
  on an offender who had pleaded guilty to rape and wounding.  The facts of the 
  offences were horrific.  The offender broke into a home, raped the 14-year-old 
  victim, beat her with his fists and then repeatedly stabbed her in the face, 
  eyes and throat until the knife broke.  The offender had no relevant criminal 
  record.  Extensive psychiatric evidence was led at sentencing and indicated 
  that the 26-year-old offender suffered from a personality disorder and would 
  represent a continuing danger to the public for a very long time (at least until 
  some time in his fifties when he might start to burn out).  There was some suggestion 
  in the evidence that alcohol was a trigger for the violent behaviour and that 
  if the offender could overcome his problem of alcohol abuse it would be safe 
  to release him somewhat earlier.  Speaking for the court at pp. 147-48, Jessup 
  J.A. explained the rationale for imposing a life sentence in these circumstances:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>When an accused has been convicted of a serious crime 
      in itself calling for a substantial sentence and when he suffers from some 
      mental or personality disorder rendering him a danger to the community but 
      not subjecting him to confinement in a mental institution and when it is 
      uncertain when, if ever, the accused will be cured of his affliction, in 
      my opinion the appropriate sentence is one of life.</span></u> Such a sentence, 
      in such circumstances, amounts to an indefinite sentence under which the 
      parole board can release him to the community when it is satisfied, upon 
      adequate psychiatric examination, it is in the interest of the accused and 
      of the community for him to return to society.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The accused appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada.  The issue 
  on that appeal was whether the Court of Appeal had jurisdiction to increase 
  a sentence on an appeal by the accused, in the absence of a Crown appeal.  (Hill 
  had originally received a sentence of twelve years' imprisonment.)  A majority 
  of the Court held that the Court of Appeal had the jurisdiction to do so in 
  certain circumstances.  In the course of giving his reasons, Ritchie&nbsp;J. 
  said the following at p. 859:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The deterrent effect which the sentence may have on others and to some 
      extent the standards which have been established in other cases of a like 
      kind, are also relevant and in the present case the <u>stark horror of the 
      crime</u> itself would of necessity be compelling consideration.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In subsequent decisions, this particular application of the <i>Hill</i> 
  principle has often been characterized as involving cases of stark horror.  
  See, for example, <i>R. v. Mesgun</i> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 439 (Ont. C.A.), 
  <i>R. v. Simpson (No. 3)</i> (1981), 58 C.C.C. (2d) 308 (Ont. C.A.), <i>R. v. 
  Horvath</i> (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 196 (Ont. C.A.), <i>R. v. Everingham</i>, 
  [1976] O.J. No.&nbsp;634 (C.A.), and <i>R. v. Marwick</i>, [1977] O.J. No.&nbsp;611 
  (C.A.).  The dominant feature in these cases is the horrific nature of the very 
  offence for which the accused is being sentenced.  Often, there is also some 
  expert evidence demonstrating that the offender suffers from a mental disorder 
  that shows he or she represents a continuing danger to the public and that there 
  is little likelihood of successful treatment during the course of a fixed sentence.  
  In these cases, the life sentence is justified on the theory that the parole 
  board will be in the best position to decide when to release the very dangerous 
  offender who is capable of inflicting the gravest type of harm and where at 
  the time of sentencing the possibility of successful rehabilitation is at least 
  uncertain and at best lies many years in the future.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the circumstances of the attempted murder in this case 
  are very serious, the Crown did not press the case as being one within the stark-horror 
  branch of the <i>Hill</i> principle.  At this point in the process, I would 
  not disagree with that position.  I also consider that the absence of expert 
  evidence as to the prognosis of successful rehabilitation of the respondent 
  tells against the imposition of a life sentence on the stark horror principle.  
  See <i> R. v. Hatton</i> (1978), 39 C.C.C. (2d) 281 (Ont. C.A.) at 302-04.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second type of case where a life sentence has been justified 
  on the <i>Hill</i> principle can be described as the pattern-of-violent-behaviour 
  case.  Such cases involve the repeated commission of crimes of very serious 
  violence that do not, however, reach the level of stark horror.  There is often 
  expert evidence about the offenders continued dangerousness, but the repeated 
  commission of these very serious crimes itself will often provide the court 
  with the information necessary to find that the offender represents a continuing 
  danger.  See <i>R. v. J.E.A., </i>[1999] B.C.J. No. 1661 (C.A.) at para. 53.  
  There are several examples of this kind of case.  In <i>R. v. Haig</i> (1974), 
  26 C.R.N.S. 247 (Ont. C.A.) the offender, while on parole for rape, committed 
  two further rapes and expert evidence showed that he was a continuing danger 
  to women.  In <i>R. v. Pontello</i> (1977), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 262 (Ont. C.A.), 
  the accused committed three offences within about a month and a half.  The first 
  two involved rape of the victims at knife point.  On the last occasion, the 
  accused was prevented from raping the victim because a police cruiser happened 
  along.  The accused had stabbed the victim before the police intervened.  The 
  accused had no prior record but expert evidence showed that he represented a 
  continuing danger to women and was likely untreatable.  At p. 268, MacKinnon 
  J.A. explained the rationale for the life sentence in this type of case:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In a case of rape unaccompanied by acts of unusual violence, brutality 
      or cruelty, the evidence of a psychiatrist, however eminent, with respect 
      to the accuseds continuing or potential danger to the physical safety of 
      others, would not justify a Court in categorizing the offence as one calling 
      for a sentence outside the usual range of sentence for such offences. However, 
      in this case, <u>the cumulative effect of three separate attacks, the use 
      of a knife and the appellants readiness to inflict injury with it to achieve 
      his purposes, clearly indicate a serious personality disorder</u> which 
      required the expert opinion evidence to be taken into consideration at arriving 
      at an appropriate sentence.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> So far as I can tell, this branch of the <i>Hill</i> principle 
  has been applied where the pattern of behaviour has been demonstrated by actual 
  convictions or perhaps through resort to the s. 725-type procedure.  See for 
  example, <i>R. v. Kempton</i> (1980), 53 C.C.C. (2d) 176 (Alta. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A concern with this type of case is that imposing a life sentence 
  for the most recent offence may offend the proportionality principle.  In <i>R. 
  v. Hastings</i> (1985), 19 C.C.C. (3d) 86 (Alta. C.A.) at 89-90, Kerans J.A. 
  seemed to acknowledge this possibility; he would insist on this sentence being 
  imposed only where there is compelling, usually expert, evidence of future dangerousness.  
  As he said at p. 90:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>I acknowledge that there must be and are stringent 
      limits on the rule simply because it involves going beyond what is fit for 
      the crime. It is invoked only when the accused is dangerous, and not just 
      when he is incorrigible</span></u>. Also, of necessity, he must be guilty 
      of a crime sufficiently grave that a life sentence is available because 
      when the maximum sentence is a term of years this does not permit true preventive 
      detention. Dangerousness is a factor in sentencing only when a true sentence 
      of preventive detention can be made. The authorities add that a finding 
      of dangerousness is usually not made unless there is some evidence of mental 
      disorder supported by a record of violent crime I do not rule out cases 
      where a finding could be made without such a record, for that is essentially 
      a matter of evidence and weight of evidence: see, for example, <i>R. v. 
      Sinitoski</i>, [1983] 6 W.W.R. 247, 46 A.R. 206, 27 Alta. L.R. (2d) 141. 
      <u>What is settled is that such a sentence should not be resorted to unless 
      there is clear evidence that the offenders return to society would put 
      the innocent to substantial and violent risk.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Perhaps because application of the <i>Hill</i> principle in the 
  pattern of violent behaviour cases is problematic where imposition of a life 
  sentence may appear inconsistent with the proportionality principle, this court 
  has on several occasions stated that the <i>Hill</i> principle is not a substitute 
  for the strictures and safeguards of the dangerous offender procedure.  For 
  example, in <i>R. v. Horvath</i>,<i> </i>at p. 205, Martin J.A. said this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u><span lang=EN-US>The subsequent decisions of this court have emphasized 
      that the principle enunciated in <i>R. v. Hill</i>,<i> supra</i>, was not 
      to be used as an alternative to invoking the former dangerous sexual offender 
      provisions and the present dangerous offender provision of the Code, and 
      that a life sentence should be imposed only where the circumstances of the 
      offence are such as to justify a sentence of life imprisonment.</span></u> 
      Those circumstances may exist where the offence has been accompanied by 
      unusual features of brutality or cruelty, or where the offence is part of 
      a pattern of violent behaviour which threatens the physical safety of others. 
      Mr. Justice Ritchies graphic phrase the stark horror of the crime has 
      been used to broadly describe offences falling within the first category, 
      although it does not constitute an exclusive definition.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> On two occasions, the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>obiter </i>has 
  expressed some doubt about the use of the <i>Hill</i> principle to avoid the 
  difficulties of complying with the dangerous offender regime.  Lamer C.J.C. 
  summarized this concern in <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 
  (S.C.C.) at 372:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Lyons</i>,<i> supra</i>, I was in substantial agreement 
      with the majority judgment of La Forest J. that there may indeed be circumstances 
      where a life sentence, motivated in large part by the dangerousness of the 
      offender, may be undesirable in light of Parliaments creation of a separate 
      and distinct dangerous offenders regime. Prior to <i>Lyons</i>, a number 
      of appellate court decisions, most notably <i>R. v. Hill</i> (1974), 15 
      C.C.C. (2d) 145 (Ont. C.A.); affirmed 25 C.C.C. (2d) 6, 62 D.L.R. (3d) 193, 
      [1977] 1 S.C.R. 827, had suggested that a trial judge should exercise his 
      or her discretion to impose a sentence of life imprisonment (if available) 
      when faced with a patently dangerous offender who enjoys no prospects for 
      rehabilitation. </span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Lyons</i>, however, this court cast serious doubt 
      on the continuing validity of the Hill principle. As La Forest J. stated, 
      at p. 23:</span></p>
    <p>It is true that the <i>Hill</i> principle, which amounts to judge-made 
      dangerous offender law, has clearly been limited by subsequent decisions. 
      However, the basis of the retrenchment has not been a rejection of the principle 
      of indeterminate detention for dangerous offenders. <i>Rather, it has been 
      the concern that the Hill principle not be used to circumvent the provisions 
      of Part XXI [now Part XXIV] with its attendant safeguards for the offender</i>.

  </span></span> In <i>R. v. Robinson</i> (1997), 121 C.C.C. (3d) 240 (B.C.C.A.) 
  at 253, Esson J.A. suggested that in light of <i>Lyons</i> and <i>M. (C.A.)</i> 
  one circumstance where imposition of a life sentence would circumvent the protections 
  of Part XXIV is where the accused had no prior record but where there was some 
  psychiatric or psychological evidence indicating future dangerousness.  He did 
  not think use of a life sentence would circumvent Part XXIV, however, where 
  the prior criminal record, considered along with the facts of the offence for 
  which sentence is being imposed, would support a conclusion that a life sentence 
  is called for in order to protect society.  Similarly, I think that, in general, 
  imposition of a life sentence on the <i>Hill</i> principle would tend to circumvent 
  Part XXIV where the pattern of behaviour is sought to be proved primarily on 
  untried offences, particularly in light of s. 753 of the <i>Code</i>, which 
  appears to expressly contemplate admission of evidence of untried conduct as 
  a basis for finding that the accused is a dangerous offender.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To conclude, in my view, imposition of a life sentence on the 
  pattern-of-violent-behaviour branch of the <i>Hill </i>principle is justified 
  where, in accordance with s. 718.1, the offence is sufficiently grave and the 
  degree of responsibility of the offender is such that a life sentence would 
  not be disproportionate and the offence is part of a pattern of conduct demonstrating 
  that the offender represents a substantial risk for committing similar serious 
  violent offences in the foreseeable future.  Where the Crown seeks a life sentence 
  on this basis it ought to provide expert evidence on risk.  I am also of the 
  view that to avoid conflict with the principle limiting use of evidence of untried 
  offences to proof of background and character, the pattern of violent behaviour 
  should be demonstrated in the offenders criminal record or the very offences 
  for which the life sentence is sought.  While I would not rule out the use of 
  untried offences for this purpose in all cases, it seems to me that those circumstances 
  would be very rare.  In such a case, resort to Part XXIV of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> is called for if the Crown, in effect, is seeking a sentence of indeterminate 
  detention.  One case where resort to the <i>Hill</i> principle might be appropriate, 
  although the prior conduct has not resulted in previous convictions, is where 
  the offence for which the offender is convicted is not only serious in its own 
  right, but represents the culmination of a pattern of similar serious conduct 
  with this very victim.  To insist that the Crown lay multiple charges representing 
  each incident over a period of months or years might be redundant.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have indicated, the Crown sought to justify admission of 
  the evidence of untried acts on the pattern of violent behaviour branch of the 
  <i>Hill </i>principle.  Thus, in considering whether to exercise the discretion 
  to exclude the evidence, the sentencing court would have to take into account 
  the likely application of this principle to the facts of this case.  I think 
  it would have been preferable had the trial judge reviewed the nature of the 
  proposed evidence as set out in the statements before ruling on its admissibility.  
  In fairness to the trial judge, it is not clear to me that Crown counsel asked 
  him to do so.  Fortunately, because the Crown filed the transcripts of the police 
  interview, this court is in a good position to make a preliminary assessment 
  of the admissibility of the evidence.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I will start with the proposed evidence of Ms. Powell.  There 
  were a number of factors, some of which were mentioned by the trial judge, that 
  told against the admission of this evidence.  It related to events some eighteen 
  years earlier and while the relationship between the respondent and Ms. Powell 
  was similar to the relationship between the respondent and the victim of the 
  attempted murder, the conduct was different.  The apparent hiring of someone 
  else to assault the victim was a very different element.  Most importantly, 
  the respondent would encounter considerable difficulty in defending himself 
  against allegations that related to conduct in another country many years earlier.  
  A proper inquiry into whether the respondent committed all of the acts alleged 
  against him, and particularly whether he was the person who initiated the acid 
  attack, would also tend to divert the sentence hearing from its true purpose 
  of determining a fit sentence for the attempted murder of Ms. Firth.  The respondent 
  for his part had not put his character in issue as in <i>Lees</i>.  Finally, 
  the admissibility of this evidence as showing a pattern of violent behaviour 
  so as to invoke the <i>Hill</i> principle was, in my view, tenuous.  These uncharged 
  and untried allegations related to a different victim and the Crown apparently 
  did not propose to call any expert evidence.  Having regard to these considerations, 
  especially the difficulty in the respondent defending himself against the allegations, 
  I would not interfere with the trial judges decision to refuse to admit the 
  evidence.</p>

  </span></span> The other evidence that the trial judge refused to admit was 
  the allegations of earlier assaults by the respondent upon Ms. Firth.  In some 
  cases, charges were laid but were later withdrawn.  While some of these assaults 
  were serious, they did not demonstrate a pattern of violent behaviour that would 
  justify a life sentence under the <i>Hill </i>principle.  Since the evidence 
  was not admissible for that purpose, which was the only purpose for which it 
  was proffered, I do not see how the trial judge can be faulted for refusing 
  to admit it.  Having said that, in my view, the trial judge, if asked to do 
  so, could have admitted this evidence, as in <i>Roud,</i> to show the background 
  and character of the respondent.  This evidence could properly be used to show 
  that this latest incident was not an isolated one and indicated a pattern of 
  violence and an attempt to control and manipulate Ms.&nbsp;Firth.  I will return 
  to the question of the use of the evidence under the heading of The effect 
  of the Crown's position at trial.</p>

  </span></span> The final piece of evidence about the respondents prior conduct 
  concerned the facts underlying his 1986 convictions for assault and threatening 
  of Ms. Johnson.  This evidence went in without objection, but was not referred 
  to by the trial judge in his reasons for sentence.  I will return to that issue 
  below when I consider the effect of the Crowns position at trial.  As to its 
  relevance on the <i>Hill </i>principle, even when combined with the evidence 
  of the earlier assaults on Ms. Firth, it is doubtful that this conduct would 
  be sufficient to justify a life sentence absent evidence of some mental or personality 
  disorder rendering the respondent a continuing danger to the community, especially 
  to other partners.  The absence of any expert evidence to demonstrate the risk 
  of dangerousness looms as a serious gap in the factual record.  As Kerans J.A. 
  said in <i>R. v. Hastings</i> at p. 90, a life sentence in the pattern of conduct 
  case should not be resorted to unless there is clear evidence that the offenders 
  return to society would put the innocent to substantial and violent risk.<i>.</i></p>

  </span></span> This brings me to the final issue in this case.  It seems to 
  me that the Crowns position at trial may have been misconceived.  For the reasons 
  I have expressed, the trial judge could properly, in the exercise of his discretion, 
  exclude Ms.&nbsp;Powell's evidence.  In any event, it could not be used to found 
  a life sentence on the <i>Hill</i> principle.  The Crown had, in a sense, bargained 
  itself into a corner by conceding that if it could not prove a pattern of conduct, 
  the appropriate sentence was ten years less time for pre-sentence custody.  
  In light of the Crowns position as to the length of sentence, the trial judge 
  did not err in failing to mention the prior conviction involving Ms. Johnson.  
  I also do not think that the failure of the trial judge to admit and consider 
  the evidence of the other assaults on Ms. Firth was an error in principle.  
  The Crown, in conceding that ten years was an appropriate sentence, must have 
  had in mind s. 718.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and been of the view that such 
  a sentence was proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of 
  responsibility of the offender.  Evidence of the respondents background and 
  character could not elevate the sentence beyond what was proportionate without 
  violating the principle that the offender cannot be punished for past untried 
  acts.  As Arbour J. said in <i>R. v. Knoblauch </i>(2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 1 
  (S.C.C.) at 13:  The limit of the reach of the criminal sanction is to address 
  what offenders have done. At that stage, dangerousness is but one factor to 
  be considered in the assessment of the appropriate sentence. Even extreme dangerousness 
  cannot, in and of itself, justify imposing the maximum punishment in order to 
  elevate the protection of society above all other considerations.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I am also of the view that the trial judge did not err in acceding 
  to what became, in effect, a joint submission of ten years less time spent in 
  pre-sentence custody.  The trial judge could reject that submission if he was 
  of the view that the ten-year sentence was unfit: <i>R. v. Wood</i> (1988), 
  43 C.C.C. (3d) 570 (Ont. C.A.).  But, he could not do so without giving it serious 
  consideration.  </p>

  </span></span> Similarly, I do not think it appropriate for this court to increase 
  the sentence in view of the Crowns position at trial.  We were not privy to 
  the negotiations that went on in this case.  We do not know why the Crown took 
  the two extreme positions of either ten years or life.  Generally speaking, 
  on appeal the Crown will not be entitled to repudiate the position taken at 
  trial:  <i>R. v. Wood,</i> at p. 574.  In fairness, I did not understand Ms.&nbsp;Ficek 
  to be repudiating the position taken by Crown counsel.  She argued this case 
  on the point of principle based on the admissibility of the evidence of the 
  prior acts, particularly Ms. Powells evidence.  In those circumstances, I do 
  not consider this an appropriate case to expound upon when, if ever, this court 
  should permit the Crown to repudiate its position at trial, even though I am 
  bound to say that the sentence of eight years was extremely lenient given the 
  gravity of the conduct, the serious breach of trust, the respondents criminal 
  record and his character and background as disclosed in the abusive nature of 
  his relationship with Ms. Firth.</p>
