<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the convictions imposed by Justice S. Casey 
  Hill dated April 8, 1999.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>BY THE COURT:</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0><b><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></b></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant, Raymond Emes, was tried at Brampton before the 
  Honourable Mr.&nbsp;Justice S.C. Hill, sitting without a jury, on his plea of 
  not guilty to charges of unlawful cultivation of a narcotic and possession of 
  a narcotic for the purpose of trafficking. The appellant was found guilty of 
  both counts on April 8, 1999, was sentenced to a conditional sentence of imprisonment 
  of three months and was fined $1500.  The appellant now appeals against his 
  convictions.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In terms of background, on January 11, 1997, the police executed 
  two search warrants.  One warrant was executed at 5 Nina Street in Toronto (“Nina”), 
  and the other warrant was executed at Unit #240, 7280 Darcel Avenue in Mississauga 
  (“Darcel”).  A marijuana growing operation was located at Darcel.  The police 
  seized numerous pieces of paper with various writings upon them at Darcel.  
  Similarly, numerous pieces of paper with various writings upon them were seized 
  at Nina. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Ms. Esther Salomon, who had administrative duties in the property 
  management office of the Darcel Condominium, identified Raymond Emes, in the 
  courtroom, as a tenant whom she had dealt with in the past.  Ms. Salomon originally 
  showed Mr. Emes apartment #240 at 7280 Darcel Avenue.  The trial judge summarized 
  the evidence of Ms. Salomon as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The witness, refreshing her memory from a number of documents, testified 
      that Mr. Emes had rented the apartment from December 15, 1993 to January, 
      1997.  While Ms. Salomon’s evidence was confusing as to whether a tenancy 
      agreement existed with Mr. Emes in January of 1997, the witness testified 
      that payment for the January, 1997 rent was received.  Ms. Salomon further 
      stated that when Mr. Emes’ February cheque was returned NSF, she considered 
      the tenancy terminated.</p>
    <p>Ms. Salomon testified that, over the years, Mr. Emes would drop into the 
      business office to hand in rent cheques and visit with staff.  To the witness’ 
      recall, she last saw Raymond Emes in November or December of 1996.  Ms. 
      Salomon was unable to positively state whether Raymond Emes was actually 
      resident in apartment #240 on January 11, 1996.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Salomon was able to identify at least one rental document 
      relating to apartment #240 signed in her presence by Mr. Emes. …</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Salomon testified that tenants of the Darcel Ave. 
      buildings were only permitted to sublet with approval. … The import of the 
      witness’ evidence was that as of January, 1997 there was no authorized sublet 
      for apartment #240. …</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Ms. Salomon testified that Mr. Emes had placed a double 
      lock on his apartment door – he had to be present in order for building 
      personnel to enter the apartment.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The theory of the Crown was that Mr. Emes was residing in the 
  basement apartment at Nina and that, as a tenant at Darcel, he used those premises 
  for a hydroponics operation in order to cultivate the narcotic marihuana.  In 
  order to establish its case at trial, the Crown relied heavily upon documents 
  seized at Nina and Darcel.  Crown counsel submitted that the Crown was not relying 
  on proof arising from truth-of-contents inferences raised by the “business records” 
  or “document found in possession” doctrines.  Rather it maintained that certain 
  inferences were legitimately available arising from the discovery of documents 
  bearing the appellant’s name and/or describing certain subjects or transactions 
  and that the seized documents were probative as a form of circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The defence position at trial was that the seized 
  documents had no probative value as circumstantial evidence, or alternatively, 
  that the inferences which were sought to be drawn were of such trifling value 
  as to be dangerously unsafe and misleading.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Before this court, it was argued on behalf of 
  the appellant that the trial judge erred in ascribing any value whatsoever to 
  the majority of the documents that were seized from Nina and Darcel, and erred 
  in accepting the Crown’s argument that the various documents and the writings 
  contained thereon could be considered as circumstantial evidence.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><b><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></b></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our opinion, Hill J. was correct in his appreciation of the 
  admissibility and use to be made of the materials seized from the Nina Street 
  and Darcel Avenue addresses that were central to the Crown’s case against the 
  appellant.  He characterized the import and relevance of that evidence as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The seized documents in this case have relevance to a 
      material issue – whether Mr. Emes had a sufficient connection to the Darcel 
      Ave. apartment to permit the court to be satisfied, beyond a reasonable 
      doubt, that the accused was in possession of the marihuana.</span></p>
    <p>The documents are effectively relevant for the fact of their existence 
      as real or tangible evidence.  The probative value relates to circumstantial 
      inference-drawing apart from the truth of the contents of the seized documents:  
      see <i>Regina v. Lydon</i> (1987), 85 Cr. App. R. 221 (C.A.) at 223-225 
      <i>per</i> Woolf L.J.; <i>Regina v. Rice</i>, [1963] 1 Q.B. 857 (C.C.A.) 
      at 869-973 <i>per</i> Winn J., Ewart D., <i>Documentary Evidence in Canada</i> 
      (1984), at pp. 20-21; Sopinka J., Lederman, S., Bryant, A., <i>The Law of 
      Evidence in Canada</i> (1992), at p. 20.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After reviewing the items of evidence, Hill J. set out his reasons 
  for accepting the seized documents as circumstantial evidence.  He held that:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Personal papers are, as a general rule, maintained in a location to which 
      a person has access and control.  When documents such as income tax forms, 
      invoices, cancelled cheques, leases, insurance papers and the like are located 
      in a residential premise it is surely a fair inference that the person identified 
      in the documents is an occupant with a significant measure of control.  
      This is a matter of logic and common sense.  While the existence of the 
      papers at the location in question could be as a result of the documents 
      being stolen, or simply stored there, or abandoned, such explanations do 
      not, in my view, accord with the factual probabilities of the circumstances 
      here.</p>
    <p>Likewise, the finding of documents relating to the subject matter of marihuana 
      cultivation, found in close proximity to those personal papers identifying 
      Mr. Emes, suggests that the documents are his as well.  The inference to 
      be drawn from a person’s possession of documents characteristic of one operating 
      a hydroponics venture is not terribly dissimilar to the inference which 
      might be drawn from finding an individual in possession of physical items 
      such as ballast, fans, grocubes, water trays, fans, heaters, various chemicals, 
      PH compound, transformers, high wattage bulbs and reservoirs.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Having assessed the cumulative effect of the circumstantial evidence, 
  Hill J. found that the only reasonable conclusion was that the appellant had 
  knowledge and control of the marijuana at the Darcel apartment.  In coming to 
  this conclusion, he noted that the appellant did not testify or call evidence.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:
normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>We can see no error in the reasons of the trial 
  judge and, accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</span></p>
