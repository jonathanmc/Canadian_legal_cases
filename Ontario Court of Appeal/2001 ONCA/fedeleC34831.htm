      <p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Joseph W. Quinn 
        dated July 12, 2000.</span></p>
      <h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span> </span>Mr. Barat argued that the trial judge ought 
        to have rejected the respondent’s claim for wrongful dismissal.  In his 
        submissions, he emphasized the appellant’s statutory obligations and the 
        respondent’s contractual obligations as warranting her dismissal as a 
        matter of law.  The difficulty with this argument is that there were specific 
        findings by the trial judge that the termination of the respondent’s employment 
        was dictated not by any breach of the appellant’s rules but by its desire 
        to get rid of long-serving employees, including the respondent, and that 
        the allegations against the respondent were not sincere but rather were 
        motivated by that desire.  It was open to the trial judge to make those 
        findings on the evidence before him and, in our view, they are a complete 
        answer to Mr.&nbsp;Barat’s submissions.<span lang=EN-GB></span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span> </span>With respect to the issue of damages for 
        slander, there was evidence before the trial judge, in comments made in 
        the appellant’s letter to the Ministry of March 24, 1998 and made at the 
        1999 annual meeting of its members, to support the trial judge’s conclusion 
        that the appellant had defamed the respondent.  Mr. Barat submitted that, 
        if slander were proved, the words were communicated on occasions of qualified 
        privilege.  In our view, the remarks of the trial judge in the closing 
        paragraph of his reasons for judgment are the clear equivalent of a finding 
        of malice, which vitiates any qualified privilege that would otherwise 
        attach.  </p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span> </span>The respondent cross-appealed, seeking first, 
        an increase in the damages awarded for slander; second, an award of punitive 
        and aggravated damages; and third, damages for intentional infliction 
        of mental distress.  In our view, the damages which the trial judge saw 
        fit to award for slander and his award to the respondent of her costs 
        of the action on a solicitor and his own client scale reflected his denunciation 
        of the appellant’s conduct, and were not out of the acceptable range so 
        as to warrant the intervention of this court by awarding the further damages 
        sought on the cross-appeal.  </p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span> </span>For these reasons, the appeal and the cross-appeal 
        are dismissed.  The respondent is entitled to her costs of the appeal, 
        and the appellant to its costs of the cross-appeal, both on a party-and-party 
        scale, forthwith after their assessment.</p>
