<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have had the advantage of reading the draft reasons prepared 
  by my colleague, Doherty J.A., in this appeal.  With respect and regret, I do 
  not agree with his proposed disposition of the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is much in my colleague’s reasons with which I agree.  
  I begin by stating in point form the areas of agreement so that I can use them 
  as the departure point for a brief articulation of the basis for my disagreement 
  with my colleague’s ultimate conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>First, I agree that the only live issue on this 
  appeal is the component of the trial judge’s charge relating to reasonable doubt.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Second, I agree with my colleague’s summary 
  of the leading cases relating to reasonable doubt, notably <i>R. v. Lifchus</i>, 
  [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320, <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144, <i>R. v. Russell</i>, 
  [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731, and <i>R. v. Avetysan</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 745.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Third, I agree that the task for this court 
  in reviewing the trial judge’s charge on reasonable doubt in a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> 
  case “is to determine whether those instructions are in substantial compliance 
  with the principles set down in <i>Lifchus</i>”.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Fourth, I agree that substantial compliance “is measured by reference 
  to the overall effect of the instruction”.  It is important to consider the 
  component of the jury charge relating to reasonable doubt in the context of 
  the trial judge’s entire charge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Fifth, I agree with the two defects in the jury 
  charge identified by my colleague:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>First, he misdirected the jury when he told them that reasonable doubt 
      had “an ordinary natural meaning” and no “special connotation”.  Second, 
      the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that proof beyond a reasonable 
      doubt requires more than proof of probable guilt.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Sixth, the presence of one or more <i>Lifchus</i> errors in a 
  pre-<i>Lifchus</i> jury charge is not necessarily fatal.  The important question 
  is whether there has been substantial compliance with the principles set down 
  in <i>Lifchus.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Seventh, I agree that a useful departure point 
  for assessing the reasonable doubt component of the jury charge in this case 
  is the most recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in this domain, <i>R. 
  v. Pan</i> (2001), SCC 42, in which a unanimous court approved the trial judge’s 
  jury charge.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Against this background of areas of agreement, I can briefly 
  state my reasons for disagreeing with my colleague’s proposed disposition of 
  the appeal, namely to allow it and order a new trial.  Essentially, I disagree 
  for three reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, if <i>Pan</i> is the yardstick (and I am prepared to accept 
  that it is) then there are <i>fewer Lifchus</i> problems in the charge relating 
  to reasonable doubt in this case than in <i>Pan</i>.  In both cases, the two 
  errors identified by my colleague were made.  However, in <i>Pan</i> the trial 
  judge defined reasonable doubt in terms of moral certainty, which <i>Lifchus</i> 
  cautioned against.  The trial judge in the present appeal did not commit this 
  error.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In a related vein, the jury charge in <i>Pan</i> contained this 
  admonition: “It must not be a speculative, fanciful, imaginary or illusory doubt 
  conjured up in the mind of a timid juror so that he or she may avoid their plain 
  duty or responsibility”.  In <i>R. v. Karthiresu</i> (2000), 129 O.A.C. 291, 
  a decision rendered several years after the trial in <i>Pan</i>, this court 
  disapproved of this instruction, saying that “it was fraught with risk and ought 
  to be avoided . . . it may carry the implication that jurors who acquit are 
  timid and may be avoiding their responsibilities, while courageous jurors convict” 
  (at para. 8).  The trial judge in the present appeal did not employ the “timid 
  juror” language in his charge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Second, in <i>Lifchus</i> Cory J. spoke in strong 
  terms about the linkage between reasonable doubt and the presumption of innocence 
  (at p. 332):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>First, it must be made clear to the jury that the standard of proof 
      beyond a reasonable doubt is vitally important since it is inextricably 
      linked to that basic premise which is fundamental to all criminal trials: 
      the presumption of innocence . . . <i>[T]hey must be presented together 
      as a unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i> <i> </i></span><span
lang=EN-US>[Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge in the present appeal did precisely that – and 
  on two occasions.  His instruction in this regard – and it was delivered in 
  1994, long before <i>Lifchus</i> – is a model of clear and strong linkage between 
  these two fundamental concepts of criminal law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Third, and most importantly, in my view the trial judge’s overall 
  charge in this case was, in a word, excellent.  As my colleague notes, this 
  was not a complex case; it was a single issue case – did the Crown prove that 
  the appellant did not act in self-defence?  The trial judge delivered a well-organized 
  and well-worded charge.  He expressed matters in plain English.  His review 
  of the evidence was clear and fair.  In particular, his presentation of the 
  defence case was meticulous.  His discussion of the relevant legal principles, 
  especially self-defence, was sound; indeed experienced defence counsel made 
  <i>no</i> objection to <i>any</i> of the legal principles discussed by the trial 
  judge.  In this context, I am satisfied that the jury must have understood that 
  if, after consideration of all the evidence, and particularly the appellant’s 
  evidence, they had a doubt as to whether the Crown had negated the defence of 
  self-defence, they were required to acquit the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For these reasons, I cannot conclude that, in 
  the language of <i>Russell</i> and<i> Pan</i>, the accused did not have a fair 
  trial; nor do I have a serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mr. Feeley also appeals his sentence.  In reviewing the fitness 
  of that sentence, I have considered the additional material provided to us by 
  Mr. Feeley.  I cannot say that the trial judge erred in principle in extending 
  the parole ineligibility period to 13½ years.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>I would dismiss the appeal from conviction and 
  sentence.<b></b></span></p>

  </span></span> The appellant was convicted of second degree murder and sentenced 
  to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 13 1/2 years.  He was 
  sentenced over 6 years ago and launched this appeal from conviction and sentence 
  in February 1996.  It would appear that he was refused Legal Aid for the appeal 
  and was unable to retain counsel.  The appeal proceeded under the rules governing 
  inmate appeals: Criminal Appeal Rules SI/93-169.  Under those rules, the appeal 
  record does not include a transcript of the evidence from the trial.  It does, 
  however, include the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At trial, the appellant admitted that he shot and killed the 
  deceased, a long time acquaintance.  He and the deceased had argued before the 
  shooting and the appellant claimed that he acted in self-defence.  The trial 
  judge left self-defence as defined in s. 34(1) and s. 34(2) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> with the jury.  He also instructed the jury on the partial defence 
  of provocation.  The jury deliberated for about 5 1/2 hours before returning 
  a verdict of guilty of second degree murder.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant filed written material outlining his grounds of 
  appeal.  He also provided the court with various letters and other documentation, 
  much of which was relevant only to his sentence appeal.  The grounds of appeal 
  advanced in writing by the appellant referable to the charge to the jury are 
  without merit.  Other grounds set out by the appellant, such as ineffective 
  representation by counsel and improper contact among witnesses, have not been 
  substantiated by him. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> During oral argument, the appellant was assisted by Mr. Ducharme 
  who served as duty counsel at this sitting of the inmate appeals.  Mr. Ducharme 
  made submissions alleging three deficiencies in the charge to the jury.  I need 
  consider only one of those submissions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge instructed the jury in December 1994.  He explained 
  reasonable doubt in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It’s rarely possible to prove anything with absolute certainty.  So the 
      burden of proof on the crown is only to prove guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  
      <u>When I speak of reasonable doubt I use the words in their ordinary natural 
      meaning not as a legal term having some special connotation.</u>  A reasonable 
      doubt is an honest and a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense.  
      It’s a real doubt not an imaginary or frivolous doubt which might be conceived 
      by a juror to avoid that juror’s plain duty.</p>
    <p>The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt does not apply to the individual 
      items of evidence which make up the Crown case but to the total body of 
      evidence upon which the Crown relies to prove the guilt of the accused.  
      [Emphasis added.]</p>

lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The trial judge repeated this direction at the 
  end of his comprehensive instructions to the jury. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In September 1997, about 2 1/2 years after this trial was completed, 
  the Supreme Court of Canada released its judgment in <i>R. v. Lifchus</i> (1997), 
  118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  In <i>Lifchus</i>, the court, speaking through 
  Cory J., dealt at length with what juries should and should not be told about 
  the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Cory J. identified certain words 
  and phrases which were best avoided when defining reasonable doubt and provided 
  a comprehensive model instruction.  </p>

  </span></span> The instruction set down in <i>Lifchus</i> effectively communicates 
  to juries the meaning and significance of the reasonable doubt standard.  <i>Lifchus</i> 
  has, however, given rise to unavoidable difficulties when appellate courts are 
  required to consider the adequacy of reasonable doubt instructions given prior 
  to <i>Lifchus</i>.  Not surprisingly, those instructions do not track the model 
  charge.  Most contain some of the elements of the model charge, usually in combination 
  with words and phrases which, after <i>Lifchus</i>, are best avoided.  </p>

  </span></span> In <i>Lifchus</i>, at p. 14, Cory J. was careful to stress that 
  no one verbal formulation was required to adequately convey the meaning of reasonable 
  doubt.  Later cases have stressed that the adequacy of the reasonable doubt 
  instruction must be determined by the overall meaning conveyed by the instruction 
  and not by the particular words used:  <i>R. v. Avetysan</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 
  745 at 748;  <i>R. v. Starr</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 144 at 264-65.</p>

  </span></span> The task for appellate courts reviewing reasonable doubt instructions 
  given prior to <i>Lifchus</i> is to determine whether those instructions are 
  in substantial compliance with the principles set down in <i>Lifchus</i>:  <i>R. 
  v. Starr, supra</i>, at p. 269;  <i>R. v. Russell</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 731 at 
  pp. 741-42.  Substantial compliance is measured by reference to the overall 
  effect of the instruction.  As Iacobucci J. said in <i>R. v. Russell, supra</i>, 
  at p. 743:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The appellate assessment of substantial compliance with the <i>Lifchus</i> 
      principles in cases where the trial judge did not have the benefit of that 
      decision, and may have used, in parts of the charge, language that will 
      likely be discontinued in the future or omitted parts recommended in <i>Lifchus</i>, 
      is not a mechanical task.  Rather, it is a judgment call on whether the 
      deficiencies in the charge fall below the <i>Lifchus</i> standard such as 
      to cause serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead 
      to the conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial.  </p>

  </span></span> The testing of pre-<i>Lifchus</i> reasonable doubt instructions 
  against the substantial compliance standard has spawned an ever-growing line 
  of authority that is most notable for the subtlety of the distinctions drawn 
  among various jury instructions which appear very similar.  This case now joins 
  that line.  </p>

  </span></span> Relying on the principles set down in <i>Lifchus</i>, as explained 
  in <i>R. v. Starr, supra</i>, Mr. Ducharme submits that the trial judge’s instruction 
  on reasonable doubt reveals two errors.  First, he misdirected the jury when 
  he told them that reasonable doubt had “an ordinary natural meaning” and no 
  “special connotation”.  Second, the trial judge failed to instruct the jury 
  that proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires more than proof of probable guilt.  
  Mr. Ducharme submits that although the jury was told that proof to a certainty 
  was not required, they were left to their own devices to decide how far below 
  absolute certainty they should set the reasonable doubt bar.  I agree with Mr. 
  Ducharme that the trial judge made both of the errors alleged.  I do not understand 
  the Crown to suggest otherwise.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Mr. Ducharme goes on to argue that the misdirection 
  (reasonable doubt has an ordinary meaning) combined with the non-direction (failure 
  to instruct the jury that probable guilt was not enough) gives rise to the reasonable 
  likelihood that the jury misapprehended the requisite standard of proof and 
  necessitates a new trial.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The misdirection and non-direction relied on by Mr. Ducharme 
  appear in combination in many of the post-<i>Lifchus</i> decisions.  In several 
  cases, the combination considered in the context of the entire charge has been 
  held to amount to reversible error:  <i>R. v. Starr, supra</i>;  <i>R. v. Avetysan, 
  supra</i>;  <i>R. v. Thompson</i> (2001), 152 C.C.C. (3d) 527 (Ont. C.A.);  
  <i>R. v. Taylor</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.);  <i>R. v. L.(F.L.)</i> 
  (2001), 153 C.C.C. (3d) 146 (Ont. C.A.).  The reasonable doubt instructions 
  given in these cases are very similar to the instruction given in this case.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In several other cases, the same two defects have been found, 
  upon a review of the entire charge, not to constitute reversible error.  In 
  these cases the courts have found that other language used to explain reasonable 
  doubt effectively overcomes the risk that the non-direction and misdirection 
  denied the accused a fair trial:  <i>R. v. Russell, supra</i>;  <i>R. v. Tombran</i> 
  (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 182 (C.A.);  <i>R. v. Phillips</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d)

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In <i>R. v. Pan, supra</i>, the most recent 
  decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in which the adequacy of a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> 
  reasonable doubt instruction was considered, the trial judge provided the following 
  reasonable doubt instruction:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>What is meant by “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”?  It has been said, 
      members of the jury, that the term explains itself.  It is achieved when 
      you, as jurors, feel sure of the guilt of the accused.  It is that degree 
      of proof which convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience so you, as 
      conscientious jurors, feel bound or compelled to act upon it.  You must 
      be able to say to yourself, “He is really guilty.  Of that I am morally 
      certain.”  I said morally certain, not mathematically certain, for it is 
      not the obligation of the prosecution in this or any criminal case to prove 
      guilt to a mathematical certainty.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>On the other hand, should the evidence which you have 
      heard leave you, as a responsible juror, with some lingering or nagging 
      doubt with respect to the proof of some essential element of the offence 
      with which the accused is charged or any offence which is included in it, 
      so that you are unable to say to yourself that the Crown has proven the 
      guilt of the accused in respect of that offence beyond a reasonable doubt, 
      as I have defined those words, your duty is then to find the accused not 
      guilty in respect of the offence about which you have such reasonable doubt.</span></p>
    <p>The doubt, members of the jury, I emphasize, must be reasonable.  It must 
      be a reasonable doubt based upon the evidence that you have heard in this 
      case.  It must not be a speculative, fanciful, imaginary or illusory doubt 
      conjured up in the mind of a timid juror so that he or she may avoid their 
      plain duty or responsibility.  It must be, as well, with regard to an essential 
      element of the crime, not in respect of some unessential matter.  It must 
      not be a doubt born of sympathy for or of prejudice against either the accused 
      or the deceased.  To put the matter shortly, it must be reasonable doubt 
      founded upon the evidence adduced, neither speculative, fanciful, illusory, 
      imaginary, born of sympathy, nor animated by prejudice.  </p>

  </span></span> The reasonable doubt instruction in <i>Pan</i> contained the 
  non-direction complained of in this case.  The trial judge did not tell the 
  jury that proof beyond a reasonable doubt required more than proof of probable 
  guilt.  The instruction in <i>Pan</i> also used words that strongly suggested 
  the misdirection complained of in this case.  The trial judge in <i>Pan</i> 
  told the jury that “[i]t has been said … that the term explains itself”.  These 
  words clearly imply that the term has no special legal meaning.  In addition, 
  some of the words and phrases used in <i>Pan</i> are among those disapproved 
  of in <i>R. v. Lifchus, supra,</i> (eg. “morally certain”).  </p>

  </span></span> Despite these errors, this court unanimously held that the reasonable 
  doubt instruction in <i>Pan</i> was adequate.  In dismissing the appeal from 
  that decision, Arbour J., speaking for a unanimous Supreme Court of Canada, 
  said at para. 128:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In reviewing Watt J.’s charge on the meaning of reasonable doubt, the Court 
      of Appeal noted that the trial took place prior to this Court’s judgment 
      in <i>Lifchus, supra</i>, and, as a result, Watt J. did not have the benefit 
      of Cory J.’s discussion concerning the elements that should be included 
      and those that should be avoided in explaining reasonable doubt to the jury.  
      For its part, the Court of Appeal did not have the benefit of this Court’s 
      reasons in the recent cases of <i>Starr, supra, Beauchamp</i> [2000 2 S.C.R. 
      720]; <i>Russell, supra,</i> and <i>Avetysan, supra</i>, concerning the 
      application of the <i>Lifchus</i> principles to cases decided prior to <i>Lifchus</i>.  
      <u>While some of the required elements in <i>Lifchus</i> were omitted from 
      Watt J.’s charge and some of the terms that should have been avoided were 
      included, I do not think that the deficiencies are such that they “cause 
      serious concern about the validity of the jury’s verdict, and lead to the 
      conclusion that the accused did not have a fair trial”:</u>  <i>Russell, 
      supra</i>, at para. 23.  For the reasons given in the recent cases from 
      this Court, I agree with the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that this ground 
      of appeal should be dismissed.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> Unlike many of the decisions that preceded <i>Pan</i>, Arbour 
  J. did not undertake a microscopic word-by-word comparison of the language used 
  in the impugned charge with the words described as either appropriate or inappropriate 
  in <i>Lifchus, supra</i>.  Instead, Arbour J. fixed on the effect of the totality 
  of the reasonable doubt instruction on the validity of the verdict and the fairness 
  of the process.  I will do the same.</p>

  </span></span> This was essentially a single issue case – did the Crown prove 
  that the appellant did not kill in self-defence?<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a>  The evidence supporting the self-defence claim came exclusively 
  from the appellant.  Even on his evidence, the defence was problematic.  I think 
  that at best from the defence perspective, the evidence could have left the 
  jury with a reasonable doubt.  It was essential to the conduct of a fair trial 
  that the jury understand the meaning of reasonable doubt and the burden of proof 
  that it imposed on the Crown.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge’s explained reasonable doubt in five sentences.  
  For convenience, I will repeat the relevant part of his instruction:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It’s rarely possible to prove anything with absolute certainty.  So the 
      burden of proof on the crown is only to prove guilty beyond reasonable doubt.  
      When I speak of reasonable doubt I use the words in their ordinary natural 
      meaning not as a legal term having some special connotation.  A reasonable 
      doubt is an honest and a fair doubt based upon reason and common sense.  
      It’s a real doubt not an imaginary or frivolous doubt which might be conceived 
      by a juror to avoid that juror’s plain duty.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first two sentences caution against placing the reasonable 
  doubt bar too high by distinguishing between absolute certainty and the Crown’s 
  burden which is “only” to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  The third 
  sentence erroneously invites jurors to apply the standard of decision-making 
  used in their day-to-day lives.  The fourth sentence is an appropriate instruction 
  and would assist the jury in understanding the meaning of reasonable doubt.  
  The final sentence in the instruction is a warning against the misuse of the 
  reasonable doubt standard in favour of the accused and did not assist in understanding 
  the term.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Considering the instruction in its entirety and its overall tenor 
  as opposed to the individual words used by the trial judge, I do not think it 
  provides adequate insight into the high degree of proof needed to satisfy the 
  reasonable doubt standard.  Unlike the instruction in <i>Pan</i>, which despite 
  its shortcomings, stressed the heavy burden on the Crown and the correspondingly 
  low level of uncertainty required to leave a reasonable doubt, this instruction 
  was inadequate and misleading.  The misdirection and non-direction identified 
  by Mr. Ducharme, considered in combination and in the context of the totality 
  of the instruction, does give rise to the reasonable likelihood that the jury 
  misunderstood the meaning of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  There must, therefore, 
  be serious concern as to whether the accused received a fair trial.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In resisting the appeal, Mr. Hubbard advanced an argument which 
  I would describe as a submission that any error in the instruction as to reasonable 
  doubt occasioned no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  Mr. Hubbard 
  argued that even on the appellant’s version of events, the claim of self-defence 
  was farfetched to say the least.  Mr. Hubbard also observed that the appellant 
  did not rely on the defence of provocation at trial.  </p>

  </span></span> While, at least theoretically, the <i>curative proviso</i> can 
  be applied to any error of law including one as fundamental as a misdirection 
  on the meaning of reasonable doubt, the importance of the reasonable doubt standard 
  in the criminal law makes it very difficult, if not impossible, for the Crown 
  to demonstrate that a failure to properly define the standard of proof occasioned 
  no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice:  <i>R. v. Lifchus, supra</i>, 
  at p. 16;  <i>R. v. Taylor, supra</i>, at p. 280.  Furthermore, the analysis 
  of the adequacy of pre-<i>Lifchus</i> instructions followed in <i>Pan, supra</i>, 
  and <i>R. v. Russell, supra</i>, imports <i>curative proviso</i> considerations 
  into the determination of whether the instruction was so flawed as to necessitate 
  the quashing of a conviction.  </p>

lang=EN-GB>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even if a separate <i>curative proviso</i> analysis is appropriate, 
  the Crown cannot meet the heavy burden imposed by that analysis here.  The transcript 
  of the evidence is not available.  The trial judge’s review of the evidence 
  was detailed and no doubt accurate, but it does not provide a satisfactory basis 
  upon which to evaluate the evidence to the degree necessary to conclude that 
  the Crown’s case was as overwhelming as Mr. Hubbard suggests.</p>
