  </span></span> Peter Fraser and his two co-accused, Ryan Menard and Donald Earhart, 
  were tried for second degree murder with a judge and jury.  Fraser was convicted 
  as charged and the co-accused were acquitted.  Killeen J. sentenced Fraser to 
  life imprisonment with no parole for 15 years.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> Fraser appeals against his conviction on the basis of three alleged 
  errors in the trial judges instructions to the jury.  He alleges error in (i) 
  the reasonable doubt instruction, (ii) the after-the-fact conduct instruction, 
  and  (iii) the refusal to give a rolled-up charge on the issue of intent.  
  With respect to sentence, Fraser appeals the period of parole ineligibility 
  imposed by the trial judge.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown appeals against the acquittals of 
  Earhart and Menard on the basis that the trial judge erred by instructing the 
  jury that they could not convict them of the lesser and included offence of 
  manslaughter if they convicted the principal, Fraser, of second degree murder.</span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> I am of the opinion that, with respect to Fraser, the trial judges 
  instruction on after-the-fact conduct amounts to misdirection and I would quash 
  the conviction and order a new trial on this basis.  Although I will comment 
  on the reasonable doubt issue and whether a  rolled up charge should have been 
  given, it is not necessary for me to decide whether these errors in the charge 
  would themselves give rise to a new trial and I do not propose to do so. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I would dismiss the appeals from the acquittals 
  of Menard and Earhart on the basis that the Crown has not demonstrated with 
  a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdicts may well have been affected 
  by the trial judges error in the charge.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As a new trial must be ordered with respect 
  to Fraser and the grounds of appeal relate to the charge to the jury, I will

  </span></span> In the early morning of March 18, 1995, Menard, Earhart and Fraser 
  were involved in an altercation with the victim, Jamie Williamson, on the streets 
  of downtown London, Ontario.  After the fight, the three accused fled the scene, 
  leaving Williamson fatally stabbed on the sidewalk.  He died almost immediately.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> Some twenty-three witnesses testified at the trial.  It was common 
  ground that Menard was the first to get involved in the fight with Williamson.  
  Fraser acknowledged that he stabbed Williamson while the latter was fighting 
  with Menard and relied on the defence of extreme intoxication negativing the 
  voluntariness of his actions.  Alternatively, Fraser relied on the defence of 
  intoxication relating to the requisite intent for murder.  Menard relied on 
  the defence of intoxication and self defence.  Earharts position was that the 
  Crown had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he was involved in 
  the killing by participating in beating Williamson after he had fallen to the 
  ground.  </p>

    <p>On the other hand, certain references to the required standard of proof 
      should be avoided.  For example:</p>

    <p>The applicability of these guidelines to jury instructions delivered before 
      <i>Lifchus</i> was addressed in <i>Russell</i>, <i>Avetysan</i>, <i>Starr</i> 
      and <i>Beauchamp</i>, all <i>supra</i>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  The majority of this Court in <i>Starr</i> held 
      that [a] court reviewing a pre-<i>Lifchus</i> jury charge must examine 
      it to make sure that it was in substantial compliance with the principles 
      set out in that case (para. 237).  Appellate review of a charge to the 
      jury is not a mechanical task, but rather an assessment of whether the deficiencies 
      in the charge, as compared to the <i>Lifchus</i> standard, cause serious 
      concern about the jurys verdict.  However, the failure of such charges 
      to reflect <i>Lifchus</i> principles cannot be taken to raise by that alone 
      the spectre of an unfair trial or miscarriage of justice (<i>Russell</i>, 
      <i>supra</i>, at para. 24).  Rather, the key question to ask is whether 
      the charge in question substantially complies with the principles expressed 
      in <i>Lifchus</i>, so that, as a whole, it does not give rise to the reasonable 
      likelihood that the jury misunderstood the correct standard of proof [footnote 
      added].</p>

  </span></span> In this case, the trial judge charged the jury on reasonable 
  doubt in accordance with the manner in which reasonable doubt is defined in 
  the United Kingdom.  He told the jurors that reasonable doubt meant they must 
  each be sure of the guilt of the accused as follows:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>In a criminal case, the accused is presumed to be innocent until the crown 
      has proven his or her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  That is, the crown 
      must prove the guilt of the accused and it is not for the accused to prove 
      his innocence, not at all.  If the crown fails to prove guilt beyond a reasonable 
      doubt on the charge before the court against one or all accused, then you 
      must acquit.  Must, not may, because that burden of proof on guilt or innocence 
      remains throughout on the crown, and theres no corresponding obligation 
      on the accused person to prove anything.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Now, you will ask, what does proof beyond a reasonable 
      doubt mean?</span></p>
    <p>Mr. Libis, during his remarks, helpfully pointed out, I thought, that you 
      should approach that phrase, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, in a common 
      sense way.  That standard of proof resting upon the crown, proof beyond 
      a reasonable doubt, is couched in very simple common sense language that 
      any juror, I think, instinctively understands.</p>
    <p>Its dangerous to define in other language because of its simplicity and 
      because jurors, I think, have instinctively understood how to apply it in 
      a criminal case through the centuries of its use.  And it has been used 
      by juries for hundreds of years throughout the Commonwealth world.</p>
    <p>Let me give you an analogy for how to approach a case using the standard 
      of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Ask yourselves this question, having 
      anxiously considered the evidence and made your findings of fact, Am I 
      sure, am I sure on this evidence that the accused is guilty as charged?  
      If your answer is yes, I am sure on this evidence that he is guilty as charged, 
      then you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.  If you are not sure, 
      then you have a reasonable doubt and you must acquit.  Its as simple as 
      that.  We dont need to get into a philosophical examination of a simple 
      standard of proof, a heavy standard of proof, but a simple one, proof beyond 
      a reasonable doubt, remembering that that proof standard applies to the 
      Crown.  They must satisfy you, each one of you, beyond a reasonable doubt 
      on the evidence in this case, that the accused persons are guilty as charged 
      on the evidence.</p>
    <p>You should remember that proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean 
      proof to an absolute certainty, because there is virtually nothing in human 
      affairs where absolute certainty can be established.  But having said that 
      proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof to absolute certainty, 
      I say it is a high standard and you can analogize it to the answer to the 
      question Am I sure on this evidence that the accused is guilty as charged?  
      And if your answer is yes, I am sure, convict; no, I am not sure, acquit.</p>

  </span></span> The trial judge did tell the jurors that proof beyond a reasonable 
  doubt did not mean proof to an absolute certainty.  He also told the jury it 
  was a high standard.  However, at this point in his charge, the trial judge 
  did not define for the jurors the standard on which they must be sure; namely, 
  that it was more than a balance of probabilities.  Later, when instructing the 
  jury on the defence of intoxication and the defence burden of proof on a balance 
  of probabilities, the trial judge did explain: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Proof on a balance of probabilities is less than proof beyond a reasonable 
      doubt.  It means that the accused must satisfy you, must persuade you that 
      it is more probably true than not that at the time of the killing, Fraser 
      did not have an operating mind.  If he fails to satisfy you on the evidence 
      according to that lesser standard of proof, more probable than not, as I 
      have explained it to you, then you must reject this defence.  </p>

  </span></span> The jury would not necessarily have juxtaposed the trial judges 
  later comments concerning the accuseds burden of proof on a balance of probabilities 
  with the earlier instruction the trial judge gave concerning the Crowns burden 
  of proof.  Nor was the jury told that proof beyond a reasonable doubt is closer 
  to absolute certainty than proof on the balance of probabilities.  In addition, 
  by repeatedly telling the jurors that proof beyond a reasonable doubt was a 
  simple concept, the trial judge undermined its importance.  The trial judges 
  references to juries instinctively understanding the concept and instinctively 
  understanding how to apply the concept in a criminal case suggested that the 
  standard was subjective, not objective.  In addition, the jury was not told 
  that a reasonable doubt is based on reason and common sense and that it is logically 
  connected to the evidence or absence of evidence.</p>

  doubt are serious.  Appellate assessment as to whether, despite these deficiencies, 
  the charge substantially complies with the <i>Lifchus </i>principles requires 
  a judgment call as to whether the deficiencies cause serious concerns about 
  the validity of the jurys verdict and lead to the conclusion the accused did 
  not have a fair trial:  <i>Russell, supra, </i>at para. 23.  In this case I 
  need not make that judgment call because, as indicated, I would order a new 
  trial on the next ground of appeal.  I also note that Earhart and Menard were 
  acquitted and, in respect to them, the jury appears to have understood the correct 
  standard of proof.  </p>

  the trial judge instructed the jury: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>So, roughly there is the evidence of the alleged flight, if you find it 
      to be flight.  As I say, if you find it to be flight and not just panic 
      by young people who became scared or upset and unthinkingly moved away from 
      this area in an emotional state, if you find that there was intentional 
      flight, then it is open to you to use that as consciousness of guilt against 
      one or every one of the accused depending on your approach to what each 
      one of them did.  I re-emphasize, someone might well attempt to flee out 
      of fear and not out of consciousness of guilt, or for some other reason 
      that has absolutely nothing to do with consciousness of guilt, and so you 
      should carefully consider the circumstances surrounding the movements of 
      these three young men after they left the scene of the alleged crime, to 
      decide whether or not this conduct should be used by you as consciousness 
      of guilt.</p>
    <p>You must keep in mind that any inference you draw to that effect, that 
      the flight was to evade the consequences of an offence, is not by itself 
      sufficient to prove the guilt of any of the accused.  It is just one piece 
      of evidence that you can make use of in deciding, if you want to make use 
      of it, whether each of the accused persons is guilty as charged.</p>

  </span></span> At the time the trial judge charged the jury, he did not have 
  the benefit of  <i>R. v. Peavoy</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 226 (Ont. C.A.); 
  <i>R. v. White </i>(1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. MacKinnon 
  </i>(1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont. C.A.).  These cases indicate that the 
  potential probative value of after-the-fact conduct depends on the factual context 
  of the case and, in particular, the positions of the parties in relation to 
  the issues in the case:  <i>Peavoy</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>at para. 25; <i>White</i>,<i> 
  supra</i>, at para. 26; <i>MacKinnon</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>at para. 14.  
  Thus, in relation to each accused, the trial judge ought to have told the jury 
  the issues to which the evidence of flight was relevant.  After-the-fact conduct 
  is a type of circumstantial evidence.  The trial judge did tell the jury that 
  the evidence of flight was just one piece of evidence.  Unfortunately, the 
  trial judge went on to say that the jury could use this evidence in deciding 
  whether each of the accused persons is guilty as charged.  This was misdirection.

  </span></span> Given that Fraser admitted he stabbed Williamson, the evidence 
  of flight has no relevance with respect to the commission of the physical act.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  Nor does this evidence help in 
  determining Frasers level of culpability; that is, whether he is guilty of 
  manslaughter or second degree murder: <i> R. v. Arcangioli </i>(1994), 87 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 289 (S.C.C.).  Unlike the situation in <i>Arcangioli</i>,<i> </i> Fraser 
  did not admit culpability for any act.  He did, however, commit the act that 
  resulted in death.  As such, one could, as a matter of human experience or logic, 
  view the evidence that Fraser fled the scene as being more consistent with his 
  having committed a culpable act than with a non-culpable act:  see <i>Peavoy</i>,<i> 
  supra</i>,<i> </i>at paras. 29-30; <i>MacKinnon</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>at 
  para. 14; <i>R. v. Schell </i>(2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 219 at paras. 37-42 (Ont. 
  C.A.).  The evidence is also relevant to rebut the defences put forward by Fraser 
  based on his alleged absence of any culpable mental state:  see <i>Peavoy</i>,<i> 
  supra</i>, at para. 31; <i>R. v. Mulligan </i>(1997), 115 C.C.C. (3d) 559 at 
  paras. 28-29 (Ont. C.A.).  The defence contended that the Crown had not proven 
  the requisite mental state for murder due to Frasers drinking throughout the 
  day and his intoxication at the time of the killing.  The evidence of Frasers 
  flight could be used in support of the inference that, despite his intoxication, 
  he was functioning cognitively and his flight was purposeful conduct that could 
  be viewed as antithetical to intoxication.  This evidence is capable of supporting 
  an inference that Fraser had a particular state of mind:<i> MacKinnon</i>, <i>supra</i>, 
  at para. 14,<i> </i>citing <i>White</i>,<i> supra</i>, at paras. 24-32.  Unfortunately, 
  the trial judge did not direct the jury as to the proper use to which the evidence 
  of after-the-fact conduct could be put. </p>

  </span></span> As a result of the trial judges misdirection respecting after-the-fact 
  conduct, there is a danger that the jury might erroneously reason that Fraser 
  fled <i>because</i> he committed murder as opposed to manslaughter.  In these 
  circumstances, the Crown has not met the burden of showing that, despite the 
  error, there would be no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  There 
  is a reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been different absent 
  the error.  This is particularly so in light the cumulative effect of the error 
  with respect to the issue of reasonable doubt.  Accordingly, the appeal must 
  be allowed.</p>

  </span></span> Fraser testified that he had no recollection of what had happened 
  due to his intoxication.  His defence was that his actions in stabbing Williamson 
  were involuntary due to intoxication:  see <i>R. v. Daviault </i>(1994), 93 
  C.C.C. (3d) 21<i> </i>(S.C.C.).  A second defence based on intoxication was 
  also put forward; namely, that due to intoxication he lacked the necessary intent 
  to commit murder:  see <i>R. v. Robinson </i>(1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.).</p>

  </span></span> At the conclusion of the trial, defence counsel requested that 
  the trial judge provide a rolled-up charge on the issue of intent in his pre-charge 
  submissions.  In his closing submissions to the jury, defence counsel submitted 
  that the jury was entitled to acquit the appellant pursuant to s. 27 of the 
  <i>Criminal Code</i>, which deals with the defence of others.  This section 
  allows a person to use as much force as is reasonably necessary to prevent the 
  commission of an offence on oneself or a nearby person.  On the evidence at 
  this trial, the trial judge properly told the jury that this defence had no 
  application to this case.  Frasers evidence was that he could not remember 
  what had happened.  On the evidence, Fraser could not have believed it was necessary 
  for him to intervene to prevent the commission of a crime.  Furthermore, the 
  fight between Menard and Williamson was, on the evidence, a consensual fight.  
  There was no offence being committed for which a person might have been arrested 
  without a warrant until Fraser intervened.  A pre-condition to the use of force 
  under s. 27 is that the accused person believes on reasonable grounds that an 
  offence is being committed for which a person might be arrested without a warrant.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> In telling the jury that the defence did not apply, the trial 
  judge focused on whether a crime, as opposed to a consensual fight, was taking 
  place.  He told the jury:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>There is no evidence in this case that Mr. Williamson 
      was an aggressor or that he assaulted or was intending to assault anyone.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:normal;'>This is not entirely accurate.  
  There is evidence that Menard was the aggressor when an initial exchange of 
  blows between Williamson and Menard took place.  Fraser broke up that initial 
  exchange.  There is further evidence that, following this, Menard, Fraser, and 
  Earhart walked away from Williamson and around the corner of the street, and 
  that Williamson came after them saying Lets go.  Lets go. Williamson also 
  is alleged to have said something about getting the Outlaws.  The fight between 
  Williamson and Menard then resumed and was, on the evidence, a consensual fight 
  at that point.  Menard was losing the fight badly when Fraser intervened and 
  stabbed Williamson.  There was some evidence that, notwithstanding this, Williamson 
  continued to beat Menard and that, seeing this, Fraser intervened and again 
  stabbed Williamson.  In all, Williamson received a total of ten stab wounds.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> The trial judge correctly charged the jury with respect to the 
  <i>Daviault</i> defence.  He also told them that, if they rejected that defence, 
  they were to go on and consider the <i>Robinson</i> defence.  He did not, however, 
  tell the jury what evidence was relevant on the issue of intent if they rejected 
  the <i>Robinson</i> defence.  The trial judge told the jury at various points 
  to consider all the surrounding circumstances to the events in the case and 
  to consider all the evidence and all the circumstances surrounding the stabbing 
  acts, the evidence of intoxication and the other factors bearing on Frasers 
  mental state.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> The Crown submits that, in the circumstances of this case, there 
  were no defences other than intoxication and that the rolled-up charge did not 
  have to be given.  Self-defence was not an issue.  Defence of others had no 
  foundation in the evidence.  Any provocation by Williamson was not directed 
  at Fraser and, in any event, Fraser did not intervene in the heat of the moment 
  after these comments were made.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

  </span></span> The purpose of a rolled-up charge is, however, to bring to the 
  attention of the jury evidence linking the evidence of intoxication with other 
  evidence on the issue of intent:  <i>Robinson</i>, <i>supra</i>.  Ordinarily, 
  evidence that has a bearing on the issue of intent will already have been raised 
  by way of a justification defence such as self-defence, or there may be evidence 
  of provocation directed towards the accused.  See <i>e.g.</i> <i>Robinson</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>;<i> Schell</i>,<i> supra</i>;<i> R. v. Allegretti</i>,<i> </i>[1994] 
  O.J. No. 172 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Clow</i> (1985), 44 C.R. (3d) 228 (Ont. C.A.); 
  <i>R. v. Bob </i>(1990), 78 C.R. (3d) 102 (Ont. C.A..); <i>R. v. Nealy</i> (1986), 
  30 C.C.C. (3d) 460 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. v. Desveaux </i>(1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 
  88 (Ont. C.A.).  While the jury may have rejected each individual defence, they 
  may still have a reasonable doubt about the accuseds intent to commit murder 
  having regard to the cumulative effect of the evidence as a whole.  The purpose 
  of a rolled-up charge is to prevent the jury from compartmentalizing the evidence 
  and to draw to the jurys attention those pieces of evidence that have a bearing 
  on intent so that they may assess its cumulative effect.  The cumulative effect 
  of the evidence bearing on intent may result in the verdict being one of manslaughter 
  as opposed to murder.</p>

  </span></span> Because the charge was second degree murder, it was incumbent 
  on the trial judge to instruct the jury on the circumstances that had a bearing 
  on Frasers intent when he stabbed Williamson.  The trial judge did tell the 
  jury in his charge to consider the factors bearing on Frasers mental state.  
  At the very least, it would have been preferable for the trial judge to have  
  instructed the jury that, with respect to the issue of intent for murder, even 
  if they rejected the <i>Daviault</i> and <i>Robinson</i> defences, they should 
  consider the evidence of Frasers alcohol consumption together with Frasers 
  earlier intervention in breaking up the fight between Menard and Williamson, 
  the confrontational nature of the second incident, its spontaneity, the fact 
  Menard was being badly beaten, the number of times Fraser stabbed Williamson, 
  and the location of the wounds.  As stated in <i>Nealy</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 
  468-69, it will be preferable in most cases, and essential in some, for the 
  trial judge to give a rolled up charge bringing to the jurys mind the pertinent 
  facts in resolving the issue of intent.  It would have been preferable for the 
  trial judge to have done so in this case. </p>

  Williamson and that the respondents aided and abetted him with subjective foresight

  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Alternatively, even if there was a reasonable 
  doubt about subjective foresight of death, the Crowns position was that the

  bodily harm was objectively foreseeable and that they were therefore guilty

      the requisite intention at the time of the stabbing based on all the evidence, 
      including the evidence going to his state of intoxication or because you 
      have a reasonable doubt on these issues of aiding and abetting or intent, 
      you must go on to consider whether he can be convicted of manslaughter as 
      an aider and abettor. <b><i>Now this last option would, I emphasize, only 
      arise if you found the co-accused, Fraser, guilty of manslaughter and not 
      second degree murder.  </i></b></p>

  </span></span> The trial judge told the jury to apply the same instruction to 
  the respondent Earhart.  Toward the end of the charge, he summarized the possible 
  verdicts and said this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>If you find Fraser guilty of second degree murder, the verdicts open to 
      Menard are as follows: if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that 
      Menard aided and abetted Fraser in second degree murder, including rejecting 
      the defence of lower level intoxication, you should find Menard guilty as 
      charged.  If you have a reasonable doubt about whether Menard aided and 
      abetted Fraser in second degree murder, you should find him not guilty as 
      charged.  If you find him not guilty as charged, you must consider whether 
      he is guilty or not guilty of aiding and abetting manslaughter, <b><i>but 
      only if you have convicted Fraser of manslaughter as well</i></b>.  </p>
    <p>As to Earhart, the verdict considerations are the same as for Menard, but 
      remember, he has not raised a defence of lower level drunkenness as has 
      Menard.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> At the conclusion of the charge, all counsel were given an opportunity 
  to voice objections.  After counsel for Earhart voiced various objections, Mr. 
  Royle, counsel for Fraser, entered several objections, one of which was stated 
  in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Also, I object to the fashion in which Your Honour linked the liability 
      of Menard to the issue of whether, of what Frasers liability was, specifically, 
      Your Honour instructed the jury that if Fraser was only convicted of manslaughter, 
      that they couldnt convict Menard of any higher offence. </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
    <p>Thats the highest result that can happen for Menard in terms of his liability, 
      or alternatively, Frasers liability reduces Menards liability.  Now, in 
      my submission, Your Honour, it is incumbent on you to instruct the jury 
      that they must consider the potential liability of each accused independently 
      of one another.  It is conceivable, perfectly conceivable, that a sober 
      man intending certain consequences could assist a drunk man, who is incapable 
      of forming any intent.  In other words, its available to the jury to find 
      Peter Fraser not guilty or guilty of manslaughter because of his state of 
      drunkenness, and still find that Mr. Menard intended to, fully intended 
      to assist a drunken man in carrying out either an unlawful act or carry 
      out a killing, a murder.</p>

  </span></span> Counsel for Menard voiced a number of objections and criticized 
  the charge as a whole as it related to Mr. Menard and the issue of specific 
  intent and the issue of aiding and abetting as between murder, manslaughter 
  and acquittal.  Mr. Libis, on behalf of Earhart, adopted the other objections 
  raised by counsel as it related to his client.  When Crown Counsel was given 
  an opportunity to object and to respond to defence objections, he stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The one issue raised by Mr. Royle that I agree is one that must be addressed 
      is his ninth point about linking the liability of Menard or Earhart to Frasers 
      liability.  Your Honour said to the jury that  the only way you consider 
       whether [Menard is] guilty of manslaughter, is if Fraser has been found 
      guilty of manslaughter, and Your Honour made it clear that if you acquit 
      Fraser altogether, that is accept the automaton defence, then you acquit 
      everyone. And in my submission, the liability of each accused does not depend 
      on the findings made with respect to the others, and I point specifically 
      with respect to, Your Honour, what you were saying to the jury was, the 
      only way you consider Menard on manslaughter is if you have found Fraser 
      guilty only of manslaughter, and in my submission, I agree with Mr. Royle 
      that theyre completely independent. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The passage read to the trial judge from <i>Jackson</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'>holds that a</span> 
  party can be convicted of a different offence than the principal if the party 
  aids and abets the commission of the <i>actus reus</i> but lacks the required 
  <i>mens rea</i> for the more serious offence.  In the present case, Fraser was 
  found guilty of second degree murder and the jury therefore concluded that he 
  stabbed Williamson with subjective foresight of death or that he meant to cause 
  him bodily harm and was reckless whether death ensued or not.  The Supreme Court 
  of Canada decided in <i>Jackson</i> that a verdict of manslaughter is available 
  in this situation if the jury finds that the parties aided and abetted the unlawful 
  act and that non-trivial bodily harm was an objectively foreseeable consequence 
  of that act but that the parties lacked the intent for murder.  In addition 
  to the quote brought to the attention of the trial judge and referred to above, 
  the unanimous Court stated at paras. 17&#8209;21: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>I turn first to Davys potential liability for manslaughter as an aider 
      and abettor under s. 21(1)(b) and (c).  A person is a party to an offence 
      if he or she aids or abets the commission of it.  In this case, Jackson 
      committed  the offence of murder.  It was open on the evidence for the jury 
      to find that Davy aided and abetted him in that offence, and is guilty under 
      s.&nbsp;21(1)(b) and (c) of the Criminal Code.  If he possessed the necessary 
      <i>mens rea</i> for murder he could be guilty of murder.  In the event that 
      the jury did not find the intent required for murder, the question arises 
      whether and in what circumstances Davy could be convicted under s. 21(1) 
      for the lesser offence of manslaughter.</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US></span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>I agree with the Court of Appeal that the jury could have 
      convicted Davy of manslaughter under these sections while convicting Jackson 
      of murder. </span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US></span></p>
    <p>[A] person may be convicted of manslaughter who aids and abets another 
      person in the offence of murder, where a reasonable person in all the circumstances 
      would have appreciated that bodily harm was the foreseeable consequence 
      of the dangerous act which was being undertaken.  I further conclude that 
      Davy might fall within this rule on the evidence presented at trial.<span

  </span></span> While deliberating, the jury requested definitions of murder 
  and manslaughter.  Before responding to the inquiry, the trial judge sought 
  the assistance of counsel.  At that point, the Crown had a further opportunity 
  to ask the judge to correct his error with respect to the availability of the 
  verdict of manslaughter in relation to Earhart and Menard.  The fact that the 
  Crown omitted to do so is, in my opinion, a strong suggestion that the Crown 
  did not consider the verdict of manslaughter a likely verdict.  Nevertheless, 
  I will address the Crowns submissions.</p>

  </span></span> The respondent Earhart concedes that the learned trial judge 
  erred in instructing the jury as he did on this issue.  He contends, however, 
  that the Crown has not discharged the onus of establishing with a reasonable 
  degree of certainty that the outcome may well have been affected by the error.  
  The issue with respect to Earhart was whether he had participated in the fight.  
  The jurys verdict of not guilty of murder demonstrates that the jury was not 
  satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Earhart was involved in the fight.  
  The Crown has not discharged its burden of proof in relation to Earhart.</p>

lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent Menard also concedes that the trial judge erroneously 
  instructed the jury with respect to party liability for manslaughter where the 
  principal is convicted of murder.  On the particular facts of this case, however, 
  Menard submits manslaughter was an unlikely verdict and the Crown has not discharged 
  its onus to establish with a reasonable degree of certainty that the verdict 
  may well have been affected by the error. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown submits there was a reasonable basis on which to infer 
  that  Menard was well aware of what Fraser was doing and that Menard knew that 
  Williamson had been stabbed by Fraser when Williamson fell to the sidewalk and 
  Menard continued to beat him.</p>
<p class=Headingnumber0 style='line-height:

lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 21(1)(b) and (c) require proof of a specific intent to 
  aid and abet.  The facts do not support the Crowns position that Menard beat 
  Williamson for the purpose of aiding and abetting Fraser.  It was Fraser who 
  intervened in the fight between Menard and Williamson, not the reverse.  There 
  was simply no basis for finding that Menard did anything for the purpose of 
  aiding and abetting Fraser.</p>

lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal against 
  both respondents on the basis that the Crown has not discharged the onus of 
  establishing with a reasonable degree of certainty that the outcome may well 
  have been affected by the error.</span></p>

  the Crown has not discharged its onus of showing with a reasonable degree of
