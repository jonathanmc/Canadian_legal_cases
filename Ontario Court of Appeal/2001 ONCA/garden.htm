    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The plaintiff, Stanley M. Garden (“Garden”), 
    appeals from the order of the Honourable Madam Justice Swinton granting the 
    motion for summary judgment brought by the defendants, Apotex Inc. (“Apotex”), 
    Minto Yorkville Inc. (“Minto”), 1149362 Ontario Limited (“1149362”), Sherfam 
    Inc. (“Sherfam”), and Barry Sherman (“Sherman”).</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The action arose out of the purchase by 1149362 
    of a property located at 4 Prince Arthur Avenue, 30&#8209;54&nbsp;Avenue Road 
    and 5&#8209;7 Lowther Avenue, in the City of Toronto (the “Property”), and 
    the subsequent sale of the Property to Minto.</span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 23, 1995, Garden entered into an 
    agreement with Sherman, who was acting on behalf of Apotex, which the appellant 
    alleges included both a written agreement as well as other oral terms (the 
    “Agreement”).  Under the Agreement, in return for Garden’s release of his 
    rights to or in the Property, Apotex consented to pay for the purchase and 
    development of the Property, and to allow Garden to develop and manage the 
    Property with Apotex financing subject to the discretion of Apotex.  According 
    to the appellant, Apotex subsequently purchased the Property but refused to 
    allow Garden to develop it, later selling the Property to Minto. Garden sued 
    the defendants for, <i>inter alia</i>, breach of contract, misrepresentation, 
    deceit, wrongful dismissal, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy and intentional 
    interference with economic relations.  </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The defendants brought a motion for summary 
    judgment and on May 5, 2000, Swinton&nbsp;J. dismissed all of Garden’s claims, 
    except for the claim for wrongful dismissal as against Apotex and as against 
    1149362.  </span></p>
  <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In our opinion this was not a proper case for 
    resolution by summary judgment motion.  This matter involves an assessment 
    of the conflicting evidence of Garden and Sherman.  At the heart of the controversy 
    is the question of whether Sherman acted in good faith when he terminated 
    the Agreement in order to pave the way for the subsequent sale of the Property 
    to Minto.  Swinton J. conducted an analysis into this critical question, but, 
    in so doing, she was obliged to make findings of fact, weigh conflicting evidence 
    and at least implicitly resolve issues of credibility, none of which are properly 
    done on a motion for summary judgment.  This case involved a number of causes 
    of action that could not be resolved without first making the kind of findings 
    that were made by Swinton J., but in doing so, regrettably she performed functions 
    outside the capacity of a motions judge and acted more like a trial judge. 
    The appellant is correct that she presided over a paper trial.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the 
    cross-appeal is dismissed.  The order of Swinton J. is set aside and replaced 
    by an order that the motion for summary judgment is dismissed.  The appellant 
    is entitled to his costs before Swinton J. on a solicitor-and-client basis 
    pursuant to Rule 20.06(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, 
    Reg.&nbsp;194.  Further, the appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal 
    and cross-appeal in this court on a party-and-party basis.</span></p>
