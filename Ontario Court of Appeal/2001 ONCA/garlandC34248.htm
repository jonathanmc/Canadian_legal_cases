  </span> This appeal arises from an intended class proceeding started in 1994 
  by the plaintiff, Gordon Garland, against the gas distribution company, Consumers’ 
  Gas Company Limited (“Consumers’ Gas” or “CG”).   The plaintiff seeks a restitutionary 
  payment of $112 million, representing late payment penalties (“LPPs” or “LPP”) 
  paid by over 500,000 of CG’s customers since 1981.  The plaintiff’s personal 
  claim is for the sum of $75, representing the approximate amount that he and 
  his wife paid in LPPs to Consumers’ Gas.  The plaintiff also seeks declaratory 
  relief in the form of a declaration that the LPP charged by Consumers’ Gas offends 
  s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, is illegal, and need 
  not be paid by the proposed plaintiff class.   The rates and payment policies 
  of Consumers’ Gas, including its LPP, are governed by the Ontario Energy Board 
  (“Board”).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The basis for the intended class action is the plaintiff’s contention 
  that s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which came into effect on April 1, 
  1981,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a> applies 
  to the LPP.   Section 347 makes it an offence to receive a payment at a criminal 
  rate of interest, which is defined as an effective annual rate of interest that 
  exceeds sixty per cent. CG’s  customers who fail to pay their gas bills by a 
  specified due date are charged an LPP of five per cent of the unpaid charges 
  for the month.   Actuarial evidence indicates that the vast majority of late-paying 
  customers pay their bills within a time period during which the interest rate 
  represented by the LPP is greater than sixty per cent per year.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The issue raised by the plaintiff as to whether s. 347 of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> applies to the LPP charged by Consumers’ Gas has already proceeded 
  through the courts.  In 1998, the Supreme Court of Canada accepted the plaintiff’s 
  contention that s. 347(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> applies to the LPP:  
  <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas Co</i>., [1998] 3 S.C.R. 112.   The Supreme Court 
  remitted the case to the Ontario Court (General Division), now the Ontario Superior 
  Court of Justice, for a determination of the validity of various defences raised 
  by CG to the proposed class action. These defences are premised on the fact 
  that the Board prescribes the LPP in its rate orders.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>         Justice Winkler 
  presided over these proceedings.  In a decision dated April 19, 2000 and now 
  reported at (2000), 185 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 536 (Ont. S.C.J.), he determined 
  that there are three reasons why the plaintiff’s proposed action cannot succeed, 
  even though s. 347 applies to the LPP:  </p>

    </p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The plaintiff’s claim for restitutionary 
      relief cannot succeed because the Board’s orders represent a valid juristic 
      reason for the enrichment created by the LPP. </span></p>

      </span></span> Section 18 of the <i>Ontario Energy Board Act,</i> R.S.O.

  also seeks leave to appeal Winkler J.’s decision dated May 15, 2000 (reported 
  at [2000] O.J. No. 1684), in which costs of the action were awarded to Consumers’ 
  Gas to be paid by the plaintiff on a party and party basis.    </p>

  </span> Toronto Hydro-Electric Systems (“Toronto Hydro”) was granted leave to 
  intervene in this appeal as a friend of the court.  Toronto Hydro’s interest 
  in the proceeding arises from its position as a defendant in two other proceedings 
  under the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6 involving issues 
  related to late payment charges.  Toronto Hydro supports the position of CG 
  that the plaintiff’s action was properly dismissed by the motions judge.   </p>

  Rule 12.04(3) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  
  It is providing the plaintiff with funding for this action and is thus responsible 
  for paying the costs award.  The Law Foundation asks this Court to overrule 
  the costs award against the plaintiff.  </p>

  that the plaintiff’s action is a collateral attack on the Board orders, nor 
  do I agree that the provisions of the <i>Ontario Energy Board Act</i> constitute 
  a bar to the proposed class action. I would also allow the plaintiff’s appeal 
  from Winkler J.’s costs order.  However, I agree with Winkler J.’s holding that 
  the plaintiff’s claim for restitutionary relief, which is based on the principle 
  of unjust enrichment, cannot succeed.  I am of the view that two of the three 
  elements of the cause of action for unjust enrichment cannot be established 
  by the plaintiff. </p>

  Energy Board Act, 1998</i> (“<i>OEBA</i>”) and the <i>Municipal Franchises Act</i>, 
  R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 55.  Section 36(1) of the <i>OEBA</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span> [2] </span></a> prohibits CG from selling its gas except in accordance 
  with an order of the Board.  Section 126(1)(c) makes it an offence for CG to 
  impose rates and charges other than those approved by the Board.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> 
  [3] </span></a>  Section 36(2) of the <i>OEBA</i><a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"
title=""><span> [4] </span></a> provides that the Board may make orders approving 
  or fixing just and reasonable rates for the sale of gas.  “Rate” is defined 
  in s. 3 to mean “a rate, charge or other consideration and includes a penalty 
  for late payment.”   The Board typically holds rate hearings on an annual basis 
  at which it sets the rate that CG may charge for gas, including the LPP.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

    <p>When payment in full is not made within sixteen (16) days of the date of 
      mailing, or hand delivery of the bill, a penalty of five per cent (5%) of

  </span>     From 1989 onwards, the Board orders have contained or adopted by 
  reference the provisions of the CG’s Handbook of Rates and Distribution Services, 
  which states with respect to the LPP:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Payment in full should be received by the Company, or by an institution 
      authorized by the Company to accept payments on its behalf, on or before 
      the due date specified in the monthly bill, which date is at least ten (10) 
      days (sixteen (16) days in the case of Rates 1, 2, 6 and 9), after the date 
      of rendering the bill.  A penalty of five (5) per cent of the unpaid portion 
      of the current amount billed shall be added to the amount due if payment 
      is not received as outlined above.  When payment is mailed, the penalty 
      will be added if the postmark on the envelope containing such payment is

  </span> The Board implemented the LPP in 1975 following an application by CG.  
  The Board observed that the primary purpose of the LPP is to encourage customers 
  to pay their bills promptly, thereby reducing the cost to CG of carrying accounts 
  receivable.  The Board concluded that such costs, as well as collection costs 
  related to late payments, should be borne by the customers that caused them.  
  The Board rejected the alternative of imposing a daily interest charge on overdue 
  accounts, concluding that it would not provide sufficient incentive to pay bills 
  on a timely basis and might result in higher collection costs.  The Board recognized

  </span> Because the LPP is a one-time charge, the effective rate of interest 
  that it represents depends on when the customer pays an overdue bill.  The actuarial 
  evidence presented by the plaintiff shows that the vast majority of late-paying 
  customers pay within a time period during which the interest rate represented 
  by the LPP is greater than sixty per cent per year.  </p>

  the balance of the hearing.  In reasons reported at (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 451 
  (Gen. Div.), he held that s. 347 did not apply to the LPP and dismissed the 
  entire action.  He concluded that the payment of the LPP could not give rise 
  to an offence under s. 347 because it was a voluntary act within the meaning 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Nelson v. C.T.C. Mortgage Corp.</i>,

  overturned this court’s decision and decided the threshold issue in favour of 
  the plaintiff.  The majority held that the LPP imposed by CG represents interest 
  charges within the meaning of s. 347(2).  It then ruled that s. 347(1)(a) is 
  not applicable to the LPP because the contracts between CG and its customers 
  do not on their face require the payment of interest at a criminal rate.  However, 
  in its central ruling, the majority rejected the view that payment of the LPP 
  is a voluntary act within the meaning of <i>Nelson</i>.  Major J. concluded 
  that the receipt by CG of the LPP falls within the scope of s. 347(1)(b). </p>

  </span> Winkler J. held that the plaintiff’s claim is an impermissible and inappropriate 
  collateral attack on the Board’s rate orders.  The source of the Board’s jurisdiction 
  over the essence of the plaintiff’s action, according to the motions judge, 
  lies in the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction to fix the LPP as part of its rate-setting 
  function under the <i>OEBA</i>.  The LPP was sanctioned by the Board and is 
  an inextricable part of the rate for gas:  a variation of the LPP will affect 
  revenue levels of the utility company, which in turn will affect the determination 
  of the appropriate rate. The motions judge concluded that the courts have no 
  jurisdiction to entertain the plaintiff’s claim, since the legislature has given 
  exclusive jurisdiction over rates, including penalties for late payment, to 
  the Board.  In this regard, s. 19(6) of the <i>OEBA</i> states:  “The Board 
  has exclusive jurisdiction in all cases and in respect of all matters in which 
  jurisdiction is conferred on it by this or any other Act.”  Winkler J. ruled 
  that the plaintiff should have availed himself of the appeal and review mechanisms 
  available under the <i>OEBA</i> to challenge the Board orders directly rather 
  than bringing his complaint to the courts.  He concluded at p. 562:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]his matter, while framed as a private dispute between two contractual 
      parties, is in reality an impermissible collateral attack on the validity 
      of OEB [Board] orders.  The LPPs arise out of the Board’s orders and are 
      an inextricable part of the rates set at the Board hearings.  It would be 
      inappropriate for the court to engage in an extensive analysis and interpretation 
      of matters that fall squarely within the jurisdiction and authority of the 
      OEB.  Since the LPPs are authorized by the OEB, the Board is in the best 
      position to deal with the LPPs and with the plaintiff’s request.  Whether 
      the plaintiff should be granted a remedy, and the manner in which that remedy 
      should be effected, are all matters of policy over which the Board has exclusive 
      jurisdiction.  The decision of the Supreme Court with respect to the validity 
      of the LPPs in light of section 347 of the Criminal Code, provides the Board 
      with ample legal guidance to deal with the matter.</p>

  </span> I would first observe that the motions judge’s alternative holding overlooks 
  that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction in respect of all matters in which 
  it has jurisdiction, pursuant to s. 19(6) of the <i>OEBA</i>.  Accordingly, 
  there can be no issue of concurrent jurisdiction in the courts and the Board.

  </span> The nature of the claim and the basis for the relief sought in this 
  class action are derived from principles of restitution:  the essential character 
  of the dispute concerns a restitutionary issue arising from the receipt by CG 
  of LPPs for the past twenty years.  The proposed class action is not a collateral 
  attack on the rate orders of the Board but rather is a claim based on unjust 
  enrichment for the return to CG’s customers of monies that the plaintiff says 
  were illegally collected and retained by CG.  As such, the action raises an 
  issue over which the courts have jurisdiction.  </p>

  Ltd.</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 706 and <i>R. v. Al Klippert Ltd.</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 
  737, which were cited by the motions judge.   In those cases, the appellants 
  were the subject of orders made by provincial regulatory authorities which the 
  appellants had failed to obey.   Rather than make use of the available statutory 
  right to appeal those orders to the appropriate administrative tribunal, the 
  appellants instead chose to attack the merits of the orders in subsequent penal 
  proceedings instituted against them because of their lack of compliance.  The 
  Supreme Court of Canada concluded that such a course of action was an impermissible 
  collateral attack on the administrative orders having regard to the following 
  factors:  the wording of the statute under the authority of which the order 
  was issued, the purpose of that legislation, the availability of an appeal, 
  the kind of collateral attack in light of the expertise of the tribunal and 
  the penalty on a conviction for failing to comply with the order.     </p>

  </span> Unlike in <i>Maybrun Mines</i> and <i>Klippert</i>, in the instant case 
  the Board’s orders were not directed at the plaintiff and there is no issue 
  of non-compliance on the plaintiff’s part.  The motions judge did not note this 
  significant distinction before considering the <i>Maybrun</i> factors as to 
  whether a collateral attack is permissible.  The Board orders bind CG and that 
  fact may undermine or provide a defence to all or part of the plaintiff’s restitutionary 
  claim, as will be discussed below.  But the fact that the intended defendant 
  is bound by the order of a provincial regulatory authority does not mean that 
  the plaintiff’s action is a collateral attack on the order.  The plaintiff has 
  not challenged the merits or the legality of the Board order in his statement 
  of claim.  Rather, the plaintiff is seeking restitution of monies collected 
  from him by a party acting under the authority of the Board order.  In these 
  circumstances, the collateral attack doctrine does not apply.</p>

  </span> The decision in <i>Sprint Canada Inc. v. Bell Canada</i> (1997), 79 
  C.P.R. (3d) 31 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.), aff’d (1999), 116 O.A.C. 296, relied on 
  by the motions judge, is also distinguishable.  There, the collateral attack 
  doctrine was applied to dismiss an action at common law brought by the plaintiff, 
  Sprint Canada, for damages arising from the very complaint that had been the 
  subject of a detailed hearing before the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications 
  Commission (“CRTC”).  In dismissing the action, MacPherson J., then sitting 
  in the Ontario Court (General Division), observed that Sprint’s proposed action 
  covered the same subject matter as did the CRTC decision.  He also noted that 
  Sprint could have sought “damages-like” compensation from the CRTC, pursuant 
  to its very broad jurisdiction to grant relief under s. 60 of the <i>Telecommunications 
  Act</i>, S.C. 1993, c. 38.  That section provides:  “The Commission may grant 
  the whole or any portion of the relief applied for in any case, and may grant 
  any other relief in addition to or in substitution for the relief applied for 
  as if the application had been for that other relief”.   Having forgone this 
  opportunity, Sprint could not later seek compensation in a different forum.  
  In upholding MacPherson J.’s decision, this court agreed that Sprint’s action 
  raised the same issue that had been before the CRTC and was thus an impermissible 
  collateral attack on the CRTC’s decision.  </p>

  </span> In contrast, the plaintiff here is not attempting to raise a matter 
  that has been dealt with in a Board hearing.  Also unlike in <i>Sprint</i>, 
  it is not at all clear that the Board has statutory power to make the type of 
  compensatory order sought by the plaintiff.   Section 36(2) of the <i>OEBA</i> 
  permits the Board to “make orders approving or fixing just and reasonable rates 
  for the sale of gas…”.  Section 23 permits the Board in making an order to “impose 
  such conditions as it considers proper” and provides that “an order may be general 
  or particular in its application.”   But the Board’s jurisdiction to fix rates 
  for gas and to set penalties for late payment does not empower it to impose 
  a restitutionary order of the type sought by the plaintiff.  The Board’s power 
  to fix rates is forward-looking, while the subject matter of this dispute is 
  primarily about an alleged unjust enrichment related to the level at which the 
  LPP has been set since 1981.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The conclusion that the plaintiff’s action is not an impermissible collateral 
  attack is supported by the fact that the statutory scheme of the <i>OEBA</i> 
  does not contemplate resolving the dispute between the class members and CG, 
  nor does it provide an adequate adjudicative mechanism for resolving the private 
  law claim that is prompted by the Board’s rate order.  While the Board’s practice 
  permits an individual to apply for intervener status at rate hearings, nothing 
  in the <i>OEBA</i> permits a member of the public to commence a proceeding before 
  the Board.  The Board’s <i>Rules of Practice and Procedure</i> provide that 
  anyone who is not a party to a Board proceeding must obtain leave from the Board 
  to bring a motion to review or rehear any matter or to vary any Board order.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span> 
  [5] </span></a>  It is open to the Board at a rate hearing to refuse a request

  </span> Allowing the plaintiff to bring this action in the courts does not encroach 
  on the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction over setting the LPP.  Regardless of the 
  success of the plaintiff’s claim for restitutionary relief, the Board will need 
  to design a new penalty for late payments that does not have the capacity to

  <blockquote>
    <p>An order of the Board is a good and sufficient defence to any action or

  </span> The motions judge held that even if the plaintiff is right that the 
  claim against CG is not an impermissible collateral attack on the Board’s rate 
  order, s. 18 nonetheless bars his action because CG acted in compliance with 
  the Board’s order in applying the LPP.  In coming to this conclusion, the motions 
  judge rejected the plaintiff’s submission that permitting CG to rely on s. 18 
  in this instance is contrary to the intention of the Ontario legislature because 
  it effectively permits CG to retain the proceeds of crime.  The motions judge 
  considered it a misnomer to refer to proceeds of crime in civil proceedings 
  and commented that no criminal proceedings have been contemplated.    In addition, 
  he did not accept the plaintiff’s submission that interpreting s. 18 as barring 
  the plaintiff’s claim interferes with the federal power over criminal law and 
  interest.   He concluded that any interference is clearly an incidental effect 
  and does not go to the pith and substance of s. 18.  Finally, the motions judge 
  rejected the plaintiff’s argument that CG cannot rely on s. 18 because it did 
  not strictly comply with the Board orders.  He found that CG acted in strict 
  compliance with the central elements of the Board orders in setting the LPP 
  rate at five per cent and in imposing that penalty sixteen days after the payment 
  is due.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before this court, the plaintiff placed considerable weight on the argument 
  that CG failed to act in accordance with the Board orders and thus cannot rely 
  on s. 18 because that section makes a Board order a defence to a proceeding 
  only “<u>insofar as</u> the act or omission that is the subject of the proceeding 
  <u>is in accordance with the order</u>” [emphasis added by the plaintiff.].    
  The plaintiff argues that the Board orders required that the postmarks on payments 
  made by mail had to be checked to determine if the LPP applied.   The plaintiff 
  points to evidence that since 1991, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (“CIBC”) 
  has processed bill payments on behalf of CG and does not individually check 
  the postmarks on payments by mail, except for those of large volume billing 
  customers.  The CIBC service manual states the following with respect to ordinary 
  payments:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The system will determine whether a payment is late or on-time based on 
      the system processing date, the due date on the remittance stub and the 
      grace period table.  Initially, the grace period table will be set for 3 
      business days for all mail.</p>

line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before 1991, CG processed bills itself and the plaintiff contends that 
  it developed a practice of allowing a variable grace period of up to three business 
  days before imposing the LPP, rather than checking the postmarks of each payment 
  sent by mail.  The state of the evidentiary record regarding the practice before 
  1991 does not permit a finding on this point, since there is also evidence suggesting 
  that CG did examine postmarks between 1981 and 1991. </p>

line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> CG is also said to depart from the Board orders by waiving the LPP for 
  all “Golden Age Service” customers and for about 650 other customers who are 
  experiencing financial difficulties. <sup> </sup>The Board has not specifically 
  authorized either waiver program. </p>

  </span>  In my view, the non-compliance argument does not affect the applicability 
  of s. 25 of the <i>OEBA</i> in this case.  In waiving the LPP, CG was refraining 
  from receiving interest that was capable of contravening the <i>Criminal Code</i>.    
  This form of non-compliance does not assist the proposed plaintiff class.  In 
  applying a three-day grace period, CG may on occasion have imposed the LPP even 
  though the  postmark on the payment was in compliance with the due date prescribed 
  by the Board order.  This scenario is possible because a delay in mail delivery 
  could have exceeded the three-day grace period.  </p>

  </span> I do not agree with the plaintiff that the non-compliance by CG with 
  this element of the Board’s order destroys the foundation for its s. 18 defence. 
  The evidence does not show the frequency with which CG imposed the LPP when 
  it should not have.  Moreover, the essence of the plaintiff’s complaint is not 
  that CG imposed the LPP when the repayment period had not elapsed, but that 
  the LPP is illegal even when it is applied in accordance with the Board order.   
  It does not follow that because on occasion CG may have failed to be in strict 
  compliance with the Board’s order, it is not entitled to rely on s. 18 for the 
  instances when it did comply.    </p>

  </span> The plaintiff next submits that there is no precedent for interpreting 
  a general provision like s. 18 of the <i>OEBA</i> as a bar to civil claims resulting 
  from criminal acts.  He further argues that the wording of s. 18 would need 
  to be more explicit to be read as barring civil recovery in the circumstances 
  of this case.  </p>

  </span> In response, Consumers’ Gas points to the Divisional Court’s decision 
  in <i>Union Gas Ltd. v. Dawn (Township)</i> (1977), 2 M.P.L.R. 23, where that 
  court interpreted the <i>OEBA</i> as indicating the legislature’s intent to 
  vest the Board with the widest powers to control the supply and distribution 
  of natural gas to the people of Ontario “in the public interest.”  The Divisional 
  Court concluded that s. 18 of the former <i>OEBA</i> precludes a municipality 
  from enacting a by-law that would affect the production, transmission or storage 
  of natural gas.  </p>

  act as a defence to a civil action arising from conduct prohibited by the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.   The provincial legislature has constitutional jurisdiction to place 
  restrictions on the right of members of the public to bring civil proceedings.  
  Examples of the exercise of this jurisdiction are found in provincial statutes 
  prescribing limitation periods and in provisions prohibiting proceedings for 
  damages against Crown employees for acts done in good faith in the execution

  under s. 347 of the <i>Code</i>, I agree that the doctrine of paramountcy would 
  apply and s. 25 would be ineffective to the extent that it purported to serve 
  as a defence to the charge of receiving interest at a criminal rate.  However, 
  in the civil context, s. 25 of the <i>OEBA</i> does not have the effect of legalizing 
  the receipt of interest at a criminal rate, but only speaks to the scope of 
  civil proceedings that may be commenced in relation to a Board order.  There

  as a result of each LPP, Consumers’ Gas has more money than it had previously 
  and accordingly is enriched.  He went on to conclude at p. 574 that the third 
  element was not satisfied because the Board orders represent a valid juristic 
  reason for the enrichment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Confederation Life Insurance Co.</i>

      reason” as “some underlying justification grounded in a legal or equitable 
      base”.  The defendant seeks and receives LPPs from its customers pursuant 
      to and in compliance with OEB [Board] orders.  The orders specifically authorize 
      the defendant to charge the 5% penalty.  I find that the OEB orders are 
      the juristic reason for the enrichment.  Neither the plaintiff nor any other 
      party has sought to challenge these orders, and as discussed above, the 
      orders are valid and binding if and until such time when they are reversed 
      or invalidated.  By framing his case in such a way as to avoid challenging 
      the rate orders directly, the plaintiff has placed himself in a position 
      where he cannot meet the third element of the test for unjust enrichment, 
      namely the absence of a juristic reason for the enrichment.<span lang=EN-GB></span></p>

  payment of money is an example of conferring a benefit on a defendant. She further 
  states that “…without a benefit which has ‘enriched’ the defendant and which 
  can be restored to the donor in specie or by money, no recovery lies for unjust

  CG cites the following statement from the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Garland,

  nor seeks to profit from them”.  This observation is said to reflect the evidence

  regulatory context of this case to decide whether CG has been thereby enriched.   
  Under the regulatory scheme in which CG operates, the Board approves at rate 
  hearings the rates that may be charged by CG for the transmission, distribution 
  and storage of gas.  These rates are designed to recover CG’s overall revenue 
  requirement.   The greater the amount of the revenue requirement that is recovered 
  by LPPs, the lesser the amount of the revenue requirement that needs to be covered 
  by the other rates.   Had a lower amount of revenue been recoverable through 
  the LPP, then the amount to be recovered in other rates would have been higher 
  in order to recoup the overall revenue requirement.   The enrichment that follows 
  from the receipt of LPPs is passed on to all CG customers in the form of lower 
  gas delivery rates.   I am thus of the view that the receipt of LPPs by CG did 
  not constitute an enrichment capable of giving rise to a restitutionary claim.</p>

  </span>  I do not think that this analysis involves a departure from a straightforward 
  economic approach to enrichment.   Rather, it is a recognition of the role of 
  the Board in regulating the overall revenue of Consumers’ Gas.  Nonetheless, 
  in the event that I am wrong in my analysis of enrichment, I will go on to consider 
  the absence of juristic reason branch of the analysis and will assume for these 
  purposes that the receipt of LPPs constituted an enrichment.    </p>

  </span> The plaintiff cites Lord Denning’s decision in <i>Kiriri Cotton Co. 
  Ltd. v. Dewani</i>, [1960] A.C. 192 (J.C. P.C.) for the proposition that in 
  cases where a statutory scheme renders a transaction unenforceable, recovery 
  in restitution is allowed where the plaintiff can establish that the statutory 
  scheme was enacted for the protection of persons in the plaintiff’s situation, 
  provided that the plaintiff is not <i>in pari delicto</i> with the defendant.  
  The <i>Kiriri Cotton</i> decision established an exception to the general rule 
  at common law that restitution is not available to a party to an agreement rendered 
  unenforceable by reason of illegality:  see <i>Holman v. Johnson</i> (1775), 
  98 E.R. 1120.  The plaintiff argues that since the policy of s. 347 is to protect 
  members of the public from having to pay usurious interest, it would violate 
  that policy to allow CG to retain the LPPs collected in contravention of s. 
  347(1)(b) and thus restitution must be ordered.    </p>

  at p. 990 that moral and policy questions are properly considered under the 
  juristic reason branch of the inquiry:  “It is in connection with the third 
  element – absence of juristic reason for the enrichment – that such considerations 
  may more properly find their place.  It is at this stage that the court must 
  consider whether the enrichment and detriment, morally neutral in themselves, 
  are ‘unjust’.”   The concept of injustice in the restitutionary context was 
  elaborated by McLachlin J. in <i>Peel, supra</i> at p. 804:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>First, the injustice lies in one person’s retaining something which he 
      or she ought not to retain, requiring that the scales be righted.  Second, 
      the required injustice must take into account not only what is fair to the 
      plaintiff;  it must also consider what is fair to the defendant.  It is 
      not enough that the plaintiff has made a payment or rendered services which 
      is was not obliged to make or render;  it must also be shown that the defendant 
      as a consequence is in possession of a benefit, and it is fair and just 
      for the defendant to disgorge that benefit.  </p>

  </span>  The plaintiff’s argument assumes that restitution is necessary to give 
  effect to the policy represented by s. 347(1)(b).   However, as pointed out 
  by McLachlin J., the required injustice for purposes of the juristic reason 
  branch of the unjust enrichment analysis must consider not only what is fair 
  to the plaintiff, but also what is fair to the defendant. In this regard, it 
  is necessary to consider the statutory regime in which CG operates and the policy 
  considerations that arise from the existence of this regime.</p>

  </span> Consumers’ Gas was required by statute to apply the LPP.   Failure on 
  its part to abide by a Board rate order constitutes an offence under the <i>OEBA</i>.   
  The Board orders, the <i>vires</i> of which have not been challenged by way 
  of judicial review or otherwise, required the collection of LPPs by Consumers’ 
  Gas.  While it is true that CG could have asked the Board to modify the LPP 
  structure, the decision as to whether the LPP was part of a just and reasonable 
  rate for gas lay with the Board and the Board’s order in this regard was binding 
  on CG.   The overall rate structure designed by the Board was based on the LPP 
  as a component of  CG’s revenue requirement.    It would be contrary to the 
  equities of this case to require Consumers’ Gas to repay to late-paying customers 
  all LPPs collected since 1981, which a provincial regulatory authority ordered 
  it to collect and which were taken into account by the Board in making its rate 
  orders.   Moreover, were CG now required to repay the LPPs received since 1981,  
  the cost implications would affect all of CG’s customers, including the vast 
  majority who consistently pay their accounts on time. These considerations of 
  public policy arising from the defendant’s position as a regulated utility company 
  lead me to conclude that there is a juristic justification for the enrichment 
  conferred by the LPPs.  </p>

  it receives pending the resolution of this action, but with a right to use those 
  sums for business purposes in the interim.  In the event that the plaintiff’s 
  action were successful, CG would be obliged to repay the LPPs with interest.  
  The motions judge postponed the hearing of the preservation order motion pending 
  his decision on the applicability of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The

  in his claim for restitution, the preservation order would serve a practical

  </span> My finding that there is no basis for ordering CG to make restitution 
  of the LPPs that it has collected makes it unnecessary to deal at any length 
  with the request for a preservation order since this finding applies to LPPs 
  collected both before and after this action was commenced.  The plaintiff’s 
  claim for declaratory and injunctive relief, which is discussed below, does 
  not alter this result.  In addition, I would refuse to grant the preservation 
  order sought by the plaintiff on the basis it would serve no practical purpose, 
  considering that the requested order would give CG the right to spend the moneys 
  at stake.  As the Supreme Court of Canada held in <i>Amax Potash Ltd. v. Saskatchewan</i>, 
  [1977] 2 S.C.R. 576 at 598:</p>
<blockquote>

      dollars which the appellants will get back if they are successful.  It the 
      meantime, the respondent will have the use of the dollars.  All of this 
      is inapposite to the preservation of property…such an order, however, would 
      be novel, in giving the stakeholder the right to spend the moneys at stake, 
      and I cannot see that it would serve any practical purpose…</p>

  LPPs offend s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, are illegal and void and need 
  not be paid by the proposed class.  The plaintiff also seeks an interim, interlocutory, 
  and permanent injunction restraining CG from imposing the LPP and from terminating 
  the supply of gas to any member of the class for failure to pay the LPP.  Before

  protracted history of these proceedings cast some doubt on the wisdom of hearing 
  a case in instalments, as was done here.  Before employing an instalment approach, 
  it should be considered whether there is potential for such a procedure to result 
  in multiple rounds of proceedings through various levels of court.  Such an

  raised in this round of summary judgment proceedings, the motions judge did 
  refer to it, indicating that he would have refused to grant such relief.  He 
  referred to the plaintiff’s request for a permanent injunction and declaration 
  as “clearly illustrative of the fact that the plaintiff’s action is a collateral 
  attack on the Board orders, and not a simple case in contract, as described

  the appellant makes the following concession:  “At an absolute minimum the court 
  should order Consumers Gas to stop collecting illegal LPPs effective when the 
  current Board Order expires”.  CG submits that Board orders do not expire and 
  thus any declaratory or injunctive relief would still conflict with the existing 
  Board order.  It also argues that any declaration would interfere with the Board’s 
  exclusive jurisdiction to determine the issue at first instance.  While CG is 
  technically correct that Board orders do not have an expiry date, there can 
  be no dispute that the Board generally reviews its rate orders on an annual 
  basis:  see <i>Garland v. Consumers’ Gas</i> (2000), 185 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)

  the factors identified in s. 31(1) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i> and found 
  by the motions judge to be present in the first round were also present in the 
  second round.  These proceedings involved novel issues including whether the

  The appellant requested, <i>inter alia</i>, a declaration that the LPPs offend

  paid by the class members and judgment based on the declaration, awarding the 
  class members restitutionary payments of $85.7 million, or such other amount 
  as the court may determine.  In February, 1995, Winkler J. held that the LPPs 
  did not offend s. 347.   As the Chief Justice has indicated, in October, 1998, 
  the Supreme Court of Canada reached the opposite conclusion.  As a result, the 
  hearing of the parties’ motions for summary judgment and other relief continued 
  in March, 2000, when the first seven issues outlined in paragraph 24 of the 
  Chief Justice’s reasons were argued before Winkler J., who allowed the respondent’s 
  motion.  This resulted in the judgment from which this appeal is taken, and 
  which reads as follows:</p>

  20.04(4) which permits the court to resolve questions of law when such questions 
  are the only genuine issues arising in a motion for summary judgment under Rule 
  20.  Therefore, for the respondent to succeed in its motion for summary judgment, 
  it was required to satisfy the motion judge on the basis of the evidence in 
  the record, and as a matter of law, that either it had not gained a benefit 
  through the receipt of the LPPs it received from the class members, that it 
  had not gained the benefit at the expense of the class members, or, if it had 
  gained a benefit at the expense of the class members, there existed a juristic

  LPPs, he found that the rate orders of the Ontario Energy Board (“OEB”) constituted 
  “the juristic reason for the enrichment” as the orders remained “valid and binding

  country, which converge in the resolution of this appeal.  They are: (1) the 
  nature and purpose of class proceedings; (2) restitution based on the principle 
  of unjust enrichment; and (3) the effect on commercial obligations of a finding 
  that interest payable under a contract offends the charging or receipt of interest 
  payable at a criminal rate prohibited by s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  
  In my view, these three areas cannot be considered in isolation and must also 
  be considered in the context of the general principles of appellate review.  
  In reaching the conclusion that CG has failed to demonstrate, on the basis of 
  the evidentiary record before the motion judge, that as a matter of law the

      be applied on a motion for summary judgment is satisfied when the applicant 
      has shown that there is no genuine issue of material fact requiring trial, 
      and therefore summary judgment is a proper question for consideration by 
      the court”.  See also, <i>V.K. Mason Construction Ltd. v. Canadian General 
      Insurance Group Ltd.</i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 618 (C.A.); and <i>Transamerica

      (3d) 97, 173 D.L.R. (4th) 468 (C.A.).</p>
    <p>In the case at bar, since both parties are seeking summary judgment, there 
      is general agreement that there are no factual disputes regarding the subject 
      issues.  The controversial matters are essentially issues of law that may 
      be decided on this motion according to rule 20.04(4).  All parties agreed 
      that summary judgment was the proper procedure for determination of the 
      issues on this motion.</p>
    <p><i>Disposition</i></p>
    <p>In my view this is an appropriate case for summary judgment under rule 
      20.04(4).  On the undisputed facts, the plaintiff’s claim cannot succeed 
      in law.  I find that there is no serious issue to be tried.  With respect 
      to the defences raised by Consumers’ Gas and Toronto Hydro, I find that 
      neither the “Regulated Industries Defence”, nor section 15 of the <i>Criminal 
      Code</i> provides Consumers’ Gas with a good and complete defence against 
      the plaintiff’s action.  I do find, however, that the plaintiff’s claim 
      is an impermissible collateral attack, and as such, cannot proceed.  Further, 
      I find that section 18 of the OEBA provides the defendant with a complete 
      defence to the plaintiff’s action.  For both these reasons, the defendant’s 
      motion for summary judgment succeeds, and the plaintiff’s claim is dismissed.</p>
    <p>While it is unnecessary for me to determine the validity of the plaintiff’s 
      claim for restitution, I nonetheless have concluded that there is a juristic 
      reason for the enrichment, and as such, the claim for restitution cannot 
      succeed.  A juristic reason has been defined as a legal or equitable underlying 
      justification for the enrichment.  I agree with the plaintiff that there 
      has been both an enrichment and a corresponding deprivation, but I cannot 
      accede to the submission that there is no juristic reason to support such 
      an enrichment.  It is clear that the OEB orders represent a valid juristic 
      reason for the demand and receipt of the late payment penalties.</p>

  </span> Because the motion judge found that the appellant’s claim could not 
  succeed as it represented “an impermissible collateral attack” on the rate orders 
  of the OEB which permitted CG to collect LPPs from its customers, and because 
  he also found that s.&nbsp;18 of the <i>Ontario Energy Board Act</i>, R.S.O., 
  c. O.13 (<i>“OEBA”</i>) provided CG with a complete defence to the appellant’s 
  claim, he provided brief reasons on what he described as “the validity of the 
  plaintiff’s claim in restitution”.  His reasons, in full, are found on p. 574:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While I have found that the plaintiff’s claim is an impermissible collateral 
      attack and is barred by section 18 of the OEBA, I will, nonetheless, deal 
      with the validity of the plaintiff's claim for restitution.  The courts 
      have found that unjust enrichment exists when the plaintiff establishes 
      the following: (1) that there has been an enrichment of the defendant; (2) 
      that there has been a corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff; and (3) 
      that there is an absence of a juristic reason for the defendant’s enrichment.  
      See <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980 at 987, 101 D.L.R. (4th) 
      621.</p>
    <p>In the case at bar, the parties conceded that the plaintiff did suffer 
      a deprivation; however, they disagreed with respect to factors (1) and (3).  
      While both the plaintiff and the defendant made extensive submissions with 
      respect to whether Consumers’ Gas benefits from the collection of the late 
      payment penalties, I find that the defendant did and continues to benefit 
      from the payment of the LPPs.  Simply stated, as a result of each LPP received 
      by Consumers’ Gas, the company has more money that it had previously and 
      accordingly was enriched.</p>
    <p>While the plaintiff has satisfied me that there has been a benefit to Consumers’ 
      Gas and a corresponding detriment to Mr. Garland, there is a juristic reason 
      for such an enrichment.  In <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Confederation 
      Life Insurance Co.</i> (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 717 (Gen. Div.), Justice Blair 
      defines a “juristic reason” as “some underlying justification grounded in 
      a legal or equitable base”.  The defendant seeks and receives LPPs from 
      its customers pursuant to and in compliance with OEB orders.  The orders 
      specifically authorize the defendant to charge the 5% penalty.  I find that 
      the OEB orders are the juristic reason for the enrichment.  Neither the 
      plaintiff nor any other party has sought to challenge these orders, and 
      as discussed above, the orders are valid and binding if and until such time 
      when they are reversed or invalidated. By framing his case in such a way 
      as to avoid challenging the rate orders directly, the plaintiff has placed 
      himself in a position where he cannot meet the third element of the test 
      for unjust enrichment, namely the absence of a juristic reason for the enrichment.</p>

  </span> Before leaving the motion judge’s reasons, I wish to observe that in 
  deciding the parties’ motions for summary judgment on the basis that the only 
  genuine issues for trial were issues of law based on undisputed facts, the motion 
  judge did what the parties requested and acted within the power provided by 
  rule 20.04(4).  In this respect, this case is distinguishable from <i>Kilpatrick

  He drew on what was said by the Supreme Court of Canada on an issue of support

  J. applied the following passage from the reasons of L’Heureux-Dubé J. in paragraph 
  12 of <i>Hickey</i>:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Though an appeal court must intervene when there is a material error, a 
      serious misapprehension of the evidence, or an error in law, it is not entitled

  </span> Bastarache J. added in paragraph 13 that “an appellate court may only 
  intervene in the decision of a trial judge if he or she erred in law or made 
  a material error in the appreciation of the facts”.  Because the British Columbia 
  Court of Appeal had transgressed in its review of the decision of the trial 
  judge, Bastarache J. found that it was “necessary for [the Supreme Court of 
  Canada] to state explicitly that the scope of appellate review does not change 
  because of the type of case on appeal”. (Paragraph 14).  In paragraph 15 Bastarache 
  J. cautioned that an appellate court cannot reconsider the evidence relied on 
  by a trial judge unless it appears that in considering the evidence he or she 
  committed a material error.  For example, if there is an indication that the 
  trial judge did not consider relevant factors or evidence, this will constitute 
  a material error “if it gives rise to the reasoned belief that the trial judge 
  must have forgotten, ignored or misconceived the evidence in a way that affected

  <i>Western Canadian Shopping Centres Inc. v. Bennett Jones Verchere</i> (2001), 
  201 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (S.C.C.), a case which concerned an application by the 
  defendants for an order striking out the plaintiffs’ claim to sue in a representative 
  capacity under Rule 42 of the <i>Alberta Rules of Court</i> (which is similar 
  to former Rule 75 in Ontario), McLachlin C.J.C. reviewed the history and functions 
  of class actions.  At pp. 397-398, McLachlin C.J.C. summarized the nature and 
  purpose of class proceedings:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The class action plays an important role in today’s world.  The rise of 
      mass production, the diversification of corporate ownership, the advent 
      of the megacorporation, and the recognition of environmental wrongs have 
      all contributed to its growth.  A faulty product may be sold to numerous 
      consumers.  Corporate mismanagement may bring loss to a large number of 
      shareholders.  Discriminatory policies may affect entire categories of employees.  
      Environmental pollution may have consequences for citizens all over the 
      country.  Conflicts like these pit a large group of complainants against 
      the alleged wrongdoer.  Sometimes, the complainants are identically situated 
      <i>vis-à-vis</i> the defendants.  In other cases, an important aspect of 
      their claim is common to all complainants.  The class action offers a means 
      of efficiently resolving such disputes in a manner that is fair to all parties.</p>
    <p>Class actions offer three important advantages over a multiplicity of individual 
      suits.  First, by aggregating similar individual actions, class actions 
      serve judicial economy by avoiding unnecessary duplication in fact-finding 
      and legal analysis.  The efficiencies thus generated free judicial resources 
      that can be directed at resolving other conflicts, and can also reduce the 
      costs of litigation both for the plaintiffs (who can share litigation costs) 
      and for the defendants (who need litigate the disputed issue only once, 
      rather than numerous times): see W.K. Branch, <i>Class Actions in Canada</i> 
      (1998), at para. 3.30; M.A. Eizenga, M.J. Peerless and C.M. Wright, <i>Class 
      Actions Law and Practice</i> (1999), at § 1.6; Bankier, <i>supra</i>, at 
      pp. 230-31; Ontario Law Reform Commission, <i>Report on Class Actions</i> 
      (1982), at pp. 118-19.</p>
    <p>Second, by allowing fixed litigation costs to be divided over a large number 
      of plaintiffs, <i>class actions improve access to justice by making economical 
      the prosecution of claims that would otherwise be too costly to prosecute 
      individually.  Without class actions, the doors of justice remain closed 
      to some plaintiffs, however strong their legal claims</i>.  Sharing costs 
      ensures that injuries are not left unremedied:  see Branch, <i>supra</i>, 
      at para. 3.40;  Eizenga, Peerless and Wright, <i>supra</i>, at § 1.7; Bankier, 
      <i>supra</i>, at pp. 231-32; Ontario Law Reform Commission, <i>supra</i>, 
      at pp. 119-22.</p>
    <p>Third, class actions serve efficiency and justice <i>by ensuring that actual 
      and potential wrongdoers do not ignore their obligations to the public.  
      Without class actions, those who cause widespread but individually minimal 
      harm might not take into account the full costs of their conduct, because 
      for any one plaintiff the expense of bringing suit would far exceed the 
      likely recovery</i>.  Cost-sharing decreases the expense of pursuing legal 
      recourse and <i>accordingly deters potential defendants who might otherwise 
      assume that minor wrongs would not result in litigation</i>:  see “Developments 
      in the Law – The Paths of Civil Litigation: IV. Class Action Reform: An 
      Assessment of Recent Judicial Decisions and Legislative Initiatives&quot;

  is not the occasion to enter into a lengthy discussion of the legal principles 
  that apply to restitution based on unjust enrichment.  Clearly, there is no 
  need to do so as entire treatises have been written on the subject, notably, 
  Goff and Jones, <i>The Law of Restitution</i>, 5th ed. (1998, Sweet and Maxwell), 
  and in this country, Maddaugh and McCamus, <i>The Law of Restitution</i> (1990, 
  Canada Law Book).  However, some consideration of the authorities is necessary 
  because a simple statement of the three elements of unjust enrichment, as articulated 
  by Dickson J. in <i>Pettkus v. Becker</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834 at 844, belies 
  the difficulties that often attend upon the determination of these elements 
  in individual cases.  In my view, the discussion that follows provides support 
  for my conclusion that the motion judge erred in concluding that CG had established 
  the absence of a genuine issue for trial on whether CG was unjustly enriched 
  by the payment of LPPs by the class members.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  is helpful to repeat Dickson J.’s articulation of the elements of unjust enrichment 
  in <i>Pettkus</i> at p. 844:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>As a matter of principle, the court will not allow any man unjustly to 
      appropriate to himself the value earned by the labours of another.  That 
      principle is not defeated by the existence of a matrimonial relationship 
      between the parties; but, for the principle to succeed, the facts must display 
      an enrichment, a corresponding deprivation, and the absence of any juristic 
      reason – such as a contract or disposition of law – for the enrichment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>In <i>Sorochan v. Sorochan</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 38 at 44, Dickson C.J.C., on 
  behalf of the Supreme Court of Canada, repeated in similar terms this statement 
  of the three elements of the principle of unjust enrichment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  would appear from the development of the Canadian law of unjust enrichment that 
  it has been the element of juristic reason that has driven the result reached 
  in most cases.  While courts have generally decided the elements of deprivation 
  and enrichment by applying a literal formulation of these terms, courts are 
  divided in their analytical approach to “juristic reason”.  While some judges 
  have taken the <i>Pettkus</i> formulation literally and have attempted to decide 
  cases by finding a “juristic reason” for a defendant’s enrichment, other judges 
  have decided cases by asking whether the plaintiff has a positive reason for 
  demanding restitution.  See L. Smith, “The Mystery of ‘Juristic Reason’” (2000), 
  12 S.C.L.R. (2d) 211 at 219-229.  This was recognized by McLachlin J. in her 
  reasons for judgment in <i>Peel (Regional Municipality) v. Canada; Peel (Regional 
  Municipality v. Ontario</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 762 in which she emphasized the 
  various tensions inherent in the law of restitution, pointing out at p. 804 
  that the law of restitution is aimed at re-establishing an equilibrium between 
  an individual who has suffered a loss and an individual who has enjoyed an unjustifiable 
  gain.  At pp. 784-786, she stated that the courts must effect a balance between 
  the traditional “category” approach according to which a claim for restitution 
  will succeed only if it falls within an established head of recovery, and the 
  modern “principled” approach according to which relief is determined with reference 
  to broad principles.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Similar 
  views were expressed earlier by Dickson J. in <i>Pettkus</i> when he observed 
  at pp. 847-848:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The principle of unjust enrichment lies at the heart of the constructive 
      trust.  “Unjust enrichment” has played a role in Anglo-American legal writing 
      for centuries.  Lord Mansfield, in the case of <i>Moses v. MacFerlin</i> 
      (1760), 2 Burr. 1005, put the matter in these words: “… the gist of this 
      kind of action is that the defendant, upon the circumstances of the case, 
      <i>is obliged by the ties of natural justice and equity to refund</i> the 
      money”.  It would be undesirable, and indeed impossible, to attempt to define 
      all the circumstances in which an unjust enrichment might arise …. The great 
      advantage of ancient principles of equity is their flexibility: the judiciary 
      is thus able to shape these malleable principles so as to accommodate the 
      changing needs and mores of society, in order to achieve justice.

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  <i>Peel</i>, McLachlin J. completed her analysis at pp. 788-789:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>At the heart of the doctrine of unjust enrichment, whether expressed in 
      terms of the traditional categories of recovery or general principle, <i>lies 
      the notion of restoration of a benefit which justice does not permit one 
      to retain</i>.  As Goff and Jones, <i>supra</i>, put it at p. 12: “Most 
      mature systems of law have found it necessary to provide, outside the fields 
      of contract and civil wrongs, for the restoration of benefits on grounds 
      of unjust enrichment”.  Thus for recovery to lie, something must have been 
      given, whether goods, services or money.  The thing which is given must 
      have been received and retained by the defendant.  And the retention must 
      be without juristic justification, to quote Dickson J. in <i>Pettkus v. 
      Becker</i>.</p>
    <p>The tri-partite principle of general application which this Court has recognized 
      as the basis of the cause of action for unjust enrichment is thus seen to 
      have grown out of the traditional categories of recovery.  It is informed 
      by them.  It is capable, however, of going beyond them, <i>allowing the 
      law to develop in a flexible way as required to meet changing perceptions 
      of justice</i>.</p>
    <p>It follows from this that the traditional categories of recovery, while 
      instructive, are not the final determinants of whether a claim lies.  In 
      most cases, the traditional categories of recovery can be reconciled with 
      the general principles enunciated in <i>Pettkus v. Becker, supra</i>.  <i>But 
      new situations can arise which do not fit into an established category of 
      recovery but nevertheless merit recognition on the basis of the general 
      rule</i>.                                                  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  the payment of money by the plaintiff to the defendant will seldom pose any

  a benefit, illustrate the range of problems encountered by the courts in determining 
  whether a defendant has obtained a benefit.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Each 
  treatise provides a helpful summary of the considerations that apply in answering 
  what is a benefit.  Goff and Jones state on p. 16:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A restitutionary claim is for the <i>benefit</i>, the <i>enrichment</i>, 
      gained by the defendant at the plaintiff’s expense; it is not one for loss 
      suffered.  As will be seen, in English law the concept of <i>benefit</i> 
      is not synonymous with that of objective enrichment (in the sense that the 
      wealth of the defendant has increased), but also embraces expense saved 
      and “requested for performance.”</p>
    <p>Whether a plaintiff’s claim is successful may depend on the nature of the 
      benefit conferred.  Different principles govern claims arising from the 
      payment of money from claims based on the receipt of services or the delivery 
      of goods.  Moreover, at one time it was thought that a plaintiff had to 
      demonstrate that the defendant had gained a positive, as distinct from a 
      negative, benefit.  Today few would deny that the saving of expense is a 
      legal as well as an economic benefit.  So, if you use my electrical equipment 
      without my consent you must compensate me for its use even though I may 
      never have used it; and it has been long recognised that the essence of 
      a claim for contribution or recoupment is that the plaintiff has discharged 
      the defendant’s duty to make a payment to a third party.</p>

    <p>In summary, <i>discernment of the existence of a benefit will pose little 
      difficulty in cases where money has been paid to the defendant</i> or where 
      the benefit has been conferred under an ineffective transaction or acquired 
      by the defendant acting in breach of a duty owed to the plaintiff.  Such 
      difficulties as do arise are best resolved by adopting the notion that requested 
      services constitute a benefit whether or not they produce wealth in the 
      defendant’s hands and by application of the concept of incontrovertible 
      benefit.  The range of the kinds of items that might be considered to be 
      benefits in the requisite sense is no more limited than the range of benefits 
      that could be the subject-matter of a bargain.  Relief has been granted

  I have indicated earlier, Dickson J. in <i>Pettkus</i> at p. 844 described the 
  third element of unjust enrichment as “the absence of any juristic reason – 
  such as a contract or disposition of law – for the enrichment”.  In <i>Campbell 
  v. Campbell</i> (1999), 173 D.L.R. (4th) 270 (Ont. C.A.), in which this court 
  considered the concept of juristic reason, the court observed at p. 278:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Perhaps the most difficult requirement to apply is the absence of a juristic 
      reason for the enrichment.  It has been left to the judiciary to give shape 
      and content to the concept of juristic justification, and to develop its 
      limits.  Ultimately, it is up to the courts to determine when there is justification 
      for an enriched defendant to retain the benefit based on the circumstances 
      of each case.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  my view, what the case law discloses is that term “juristic reason”, although 
  connoting a reason for an enrichment designed to have, and capable of having, 
  a legal effect, has also taken on the meaning of whether the defendant’s acceptance 
  or retention of a benefit under the circumstances of the case, would make it 
  inequitable for a defendant to retain the benefit.  To Dickson J. in <i>Pettkus</i> 
  at p. 848: “It must, in addition [to the first two elements of unjust enrichment], 
  be evident that the retention of the benefit would be ‘unjust’ in the circumstances 
  of the case.”  To McLachlin J. in <i>Peter v. Beblow</i> (1993), 101 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 621 (S.C.C.) at 645: “It is at this stage that the court must consider 
  whether the enrichment and detriment, morally neutral in themselves, are ‘unjust’…. 
  The test is flexible, and the factors to be considered vary with the situation 
  before the court.”  She added that a fundamental concern will always be the 
  legitimate expectation of the parties.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  commenting on the concept of juristic reason in a relatively early article, 
  “The Emergence of Unjust Enrichment as a Cause of Action and the Remedy of Constructive 
  Trust” (1988), 26 Alta. L. Rev. 407 at 451, Professor Litman foreshadowed the 
  Supreme Court’s approach to this concept:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In formulating juristic justification, the primary focus of the courts 
      should be the narrow question of fairness as between the parties.  Courts 
      should consider whether, having regard to the particular circumstances giving 
      rise to an enrichment and to subsequent events, it is fair for the defendant 
      to retain the benefit …</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  is in <i>Peel</i> at pp., 803-804 that McLachlin J. highlighted the core meaning 
  of juristic justification for retaining a benefit:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>This is not to say that the concepts of justice and equity play no role 
      in determining whether recovery lies.  It is rather to say that the law 
      defines what is so unjust as to require disgorgement in terms of benefit, 
      corresponding detriment and absence of juristic reason for retention.  Such 
      definition is required to preserve a measure of certainty in the law, as 
      well as to ensure due consideration of factors such as the legitimate expectation 
      of the parties, the right of parties to order their affairs by contract, 
      and the right of legislators in a federal system to act in accordance with 
      their best judgment without fear of unforeseen future liabilities.</p>
    <p>Additionally, conscience and fairness may play a role in the development 
      of the relevant legal principles.  When questions arise as to the scope 
      of the principles, <i>the balance of equities between the parties may determine 
      the outcome</i>.  Thus Maddaugh and McCamus (<i>The Law of Restitution</i> 
      (1990), “Compulsory Discharge of Another’s Liability”), considering a series 
      of cases where the defendant shared a legal liability for the payment made 
      with the plaintiff, opine at p. 740 that “[s]o long as that benefit is bestowed 
      by a plaintiff in circumstances such that the defendant cannot, in all good 
      conscience, retain it, restitutionary relief ought to be awarded.”  But 
      this is quite different from the assertion that “good conscience” is the 
      only requirement for recovery.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingQUOTE align=center style='text-align:center'>. . . . .</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The concept of “injustice” in the context of the law of restitution harkens 
      back to the Aristotelian notion of correcting a balance or equilibrium that 
      had been disrupted.  The restitutive form of justice is distinct from the 
      analysis particular to tort and contract law, in the sense that questions 
      of duty, standards, and culpability are not a central focus in restitution.  
      Speaking in highly general terms, Stevens suggests that contract and tort 
      claims deal with punitive or distributive measures, whereas restitution 
      claims deal with an “unusual receipt <i>and</i> a retention of value” (“Restitution, 
      Property, and the Cause of Action in Unjust Enrichment: Getting By With 
      Fewer Things (Part I)” (1989), 39 <i>U.T.L.J.</i> 258, at p. 271; see also 
      Wingfield, “The Prevention of Unjust Enrichment: or How Shylock Gets His 
      Comeuppance” (1988), 12 <i>Queen’s L.J.</i> 126, at p. 134).  Thus, restitution, 
      more narrowly than  tort or contract, focuses on re-establishing equality 
      as between two parties, as a response to a disruption of equilibrium through 
      a subtraction or taking.  <i>This observation has dual ramifications for 
      the concept of “injustice” in the context of restitution.  First, the injustice 
      lies in one person’s retaining something which he or she ought not to retain, 
      requiring that the scales be righted.  Second, the required injustice must 
      take into account not only what is fair to the plaintiff; it must also consider 
      what is fair to the defendant.  It is not enough that the plaintiff has 
      made a payment or rendered services which it was not obliged to make or 
      render; it must also be shown that the defendant as a consequence is in 
      possession of a benefit, and it is fair and just for the defendant to disgorge 
      that benefit.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Although 
  Professor Smith may not agree with my characterization of how Canadian jurisprudence 
  has come to view and apply the element of juristic reason, he has, in his thorough 
  and helpful article, analyzed the various approaches Canadian courts have taken 
  in applying this element in the resolution of individual claims.  There is much 
  to be said for his observation at the outset of his article at p. 211:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>It is not at all clear that anyone knows the meaning of ‘juristic reason’.  
      Certainly, no judge appears even to have attempted an exhaustive definition.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, to Professor Smith, at p. 215, it is not entirely clear why Canadian 
  common law was given the “juristic reason” formulation in <i>Pettkus</i>.  At 
  p. 219, he opines:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote> 
    <p>It seems possible that Dickson C.J.C. chose the formulation “absence of 
      juristic reason” rather than “unjust” in order to emphasize that the matter 
      under consideration was not one to be resolved by the conscience of the 
      judge, but rather by doctrine; in other words, by legal reasoning.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  would agree with this observation.  It is to be remembered that in <i>Pettkus</i> 
  at p. 844, in describing the third element of unjust enrichment, Dickson J. 
  used the words “the absence of any juristic reason – <i>such as a contract or 
  disposition of law</i>”. [Emphasis added.]  In using the examples of a contract 
  or a disposition of law to illustrate the meaning of a juristic reason, it is 
  my respectful opinion that Dickson J. was referring to a reason that has a legal 
  effect, and is capable thereof.  A contract undoubtedly has legal effect, and 
  a judge’s ruling or decision is commonly referred to as a disposition.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [119]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> This 
  interpretation of juristic reason, in my view, conforms with the test applied 
  in England when restitution is claimed on the ground that the defendant was 
  unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.  The first two elements of 
  unjust enrichment are the same in England and Canada.  However, in England the 
  third element of unjust enrichment is stated differently: if it would be unjust 
  or unfair to order restitution, the claim should fail.  This element was explained 
  by Lord Goff of Chieveley in <i>Lipkin Gorman v. Karpnale Ltd.,</i> [1991] 2 
  A. C. 548 (H.L.).  In that case the plaintiff, a firm of solicitors, sought 
  to recover from the defendant gambling club money stolen from the firm by one 
  of its partners, and used to fund his gambling at the club.  The club advanced 
  several grounds in support of its position why it would be unfair to hold it 
  liable to the solicitors.  In rejecting the club’s position, at p. 578 Lord 
  Goff of Chieveley stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I accept that the solicitors’ claim in the present case is founded upon 
      the unjust enrichment of the club, and can only succeed if, in accordance 
      with the principles of the law of restitution, the club was indeed unjustly 
      enriched at the expense of the solicitors.  The claim for money had and 
      received is not, as I have previously mentioned, founded upon any wrong 
      committed by the club against the solicitors.  But it does not, in my opinion, 
      follow that the court has carte blanche to reject the solicitors’ claim 
      simply because it thinks it unfair or unjust in the circumstances to grant 
      recovery. The recovery of money in restitution is not, as a general rule, 
      a matter of discretion for the court.  A claim to recover money at common 
      law is made as a matter of right; <i>and even though the underlying principle 
      of recovery is the principle of unjust enrichment, nevertheless, where recover 
      is denied, it is denied on the basis of legal principle</i>.

  Goff of Chieveley continued at p. 578, in a statement of which I will return 
  later in my reasons:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is therefore necessary to consider whether Mr. Lightman’s submission 
      can be upheld on the basis of legal principle.  In my opinion it is plain, 
      from the nature of his submission, that he is in fact seeking to invoke 
      a principle of change of position, asserting that recovery should be denied 
      because of the change in position of the respondents, who acted in good 
      faith throughout.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For 
  the purpose of these reasons, the real value of Professor Smith’s analysis of 
  “juristic reason” is to be found in its illustration of the absence of a uniform 
  judicial application of the concept and the presence of some unanswered questions 
  in its application.  In addition, he points out that there are defences available 
  that must be considered even if unjust enrichment is established, such as the 
  defence of change of position, recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in 
  <i>Rural Municipality by Storthoaks v. Mobil Oil Canada Ltd.</i>, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 
  147, and relied on by the respondent in this appeal.</p>

line-height:normal'> [122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> One 
  of the important issues considered by Professor Smith is whether the Canadian 
  law of unjust enrichment is oriented towards reasons for keeping enrichments, 
  or whether it is committed to the view that the plaintiff must show a reason 
  for reversing the transfer of wealth.  His conclusion is that the position is 
  totally unclear as a matter of authority.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Closely 
  related to this issue is the question on which party the burden lies to prove 
  “absence of juristic reason”.  At p. 228 he states:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Normally, it is for the plaintiff to prove its cause of action, and for 
      the defendant to prove any defences.  If “absence of juristic reason” is 
      understood as an element of the cause of action, then the plaintiff must 
      prove it.  The few judgments which have addressed this issue suggest that 
      this is the correct analysis.  And yet how can the plaintiff prove a negative?  
      To prove that there is no juristic reason, one would need a closed list 
      of such reasons; otherwise it would be impossible to be sure that none was 
      applicable.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He opines that “the logic of the matter … suggests the opposite”.  The burden 
  of proof is somewhat complicated in this case because the determination of the 
  absence of juristic reason arose in the context of a motion for summary judgment 
  in which the burden rested on the respondent to prove that there was no genuine 
  issue for trial as to the existence of a juristic reason permitting it to retain 
  the LPPs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Another 
  issue addressed by Professor Smith is whether Canadian law should commit itself 
  to a doctrine of “juristic reason”, or whether it should continue to develop 
  as it has historically, by seeking to clarify those positive reasons which require 
  that an enrichment must be reversed.</p>

  have considered as capable of constituting a juristic reason justifying a defendant’s

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> When 
  this case was before the Supreme Court of Canada ((1998), 165 D.L.R. (4th) 385), 
  in observing that while the ostensible purpose in enacting s. 347 was to aid 
  in the prosecution of loan sharks, Major J. stated that it has developed a broader 
  use.  He said at p. 396:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>However, it is clear from the language of the statute – e.g., its reference 
      to insurance and overdraft charges, official fees, and property taxes in 
      mortgage transactions – that s. 347 was designed to have a much wider reach, 
      and in fact the section has most often been applied to commercial transactions 
      which bear no relation to traditional loan-sharking arrangements.  Although 
      s. 347 is a criminal provision, the great majority of cases in which it 
      arises are not criminal prosecutions.  Rather, like the case at bar, they 
      are civil actions in which a borrower has asserted the common-law doctrine 
      of illegality in an effort to avoid or recover an interest payment, or to 
      render an agreement unenforceable.  For this reason, the provision has attracted 
      criticism from some commercial lawyers and academics, and calls have repeatedly 
      been made for its amendment or repeal.  See, e.g., J.S. Ziegel, “The Usury

      it is now well settled that s. 347 applies to a very broad range of commercial 
      and consumer transactions involving the advancement of credit, including 
      secured and unsecured loans, mortgages and commercial financing agreements.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It 
  is worth repeating that s. 347 describes the offence of charging or receiving 
  a criminal interest rate.  The offence is committed by anyone who enters into 
  an agreement or arrangement to receive interest at a criminal rate, or who actually 
  receives a payment or partial payment of interest at a criminal rate.  Major 
  J., at p. 408, concluded that an LPP “is an ‘interest’ charge within the meaning 
  of s. 347 and <i>is subject to that law’s prohibitions against requiring or 
  receiving interest at a criminal rate”</i>.  [Emphasis added.]  He completed 
  his reasons at p. 413 by finding that “the LPP charged by Consumers’ Gas comes 
  within the scope of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>”.</p>

  Major J. noted, s. 347 has come to play a significant role in commercial law.  
  However, as Cullity J. observed in <i>Transport North American Express Inc. 
  v. New Solutions Financial Corp</i>. (2001), 200 D.L.R. (4th) 560 at 576 (Ont. 
  S.C.J.), “the law governing the civil consequences of an offence under s. 347 
  is still in an early stage of its development”.  This is well illustrated by 
  the cases in which recourse has been had to s. 347 to have a loan agreement 
  or a mortgage declared illegal in requiring interest to be paid at a criminal 
  interest rate.  I will refer to three cases as illustrative of the recourse 
  that has been had to s. 347 in commercial cases.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  1 S.C.R. 749, in which an action was brought by a mortgagor and the guarantors 
  of the mortgage for a declaration that the mortgage was void because it charged 
  a criminal rate of interest.  The declaration was denied for the reason that 
  the interest rate did not offend what was then s. 305.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>

  guarantees of a loan were void because the effective rate of interest under 
  the loan agreement exceeded the criminal rate of interest proscribed by s. 347; 
  and (2) if so, whether the prohibited interest could be severed from the loan

  the <i>Small Loans Act</i>, S.C. 1939, c. 23, s. 2, and discussing the nature 
  of the offence created by s. 347(1)(a), Blair J.A. at p. 6 found that the effective 
  rate of interest payable under the loan agreement was over 60% and was proscribed 
  by s. 347.  He added:  “There is no doubt that the [lender] committed an offence

  J.A.’s conclusion on this issue is found on p. 7:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Since the respondent company [committed] the very offence prohibited by 
      s. 347 of entering into an agreement to receive interest at a criminal rate, 
      it follows that it cannot enforce payment of interest in civil proceedings.  
      The ancient maxim <i>ex turpi causa non oritur actio</i> applies.  <i>The 
      agreement to receive a criminal rate of interest is prohibited by statute 
      and the courts have consistently held that such agreements are void and 
      unenforceable</i>:  see S. Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts</i>, 2nd ed. 
      (1984), at p. 421.  This principle was recognized by an early decision of 
      the Supreme Court of Canada, cited with approval by Professor Waddams, in 
      <i>Bank of Toronto v. Perkins</i> (1883), 8 S.C.R. 603, where Ritchie C.J. 
      said at p. 610:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>It would be a curious state of the law if, after the Legislature had 
          prohibited a transaction, parties enter into it, and, in defiance of 
          the law, compel courts to enforce and give effect to their illegal transactions.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Strong J. expressed the principle even more forcefully at p.&nbsp;613:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>Whenever the doing of an act is expressly forbidden by statute, whether 
          on grounds of public policy or otherwise, the English courts hold that 
          act, if done, to be void, though no express words of avoidance are contained 
          in the enactment itself.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  the second issue, Blair J.A. considered whether the loan agreement could be 
  severed so that the agreement to repay the principal amount of the loan could 
  be enforced even though the agreement to pay a criminal rate of interest was 
  void.  He concluded on the facts of the case and the considerations to which 
  I will refer, that it was a proper exercise of the court’s discretion that was 
  in accordance with the principles governing the intervention of public policy 
  to strike down illegal contracts, to enforce the payment of the principal amount 
  of the loan and sever from the contract the provisions that resulted in the 
  payment of a criminal rate of interest.</p>

  reaching this conclusion, Blair J.A. reviewed developments in the law that had 
  resulted in a departure from an earlier view that public policy rendered entire 
  contracts unenforceable if illegality was present, and concluded at p. 10:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In every case where a court is called upon to exercise its discretion in 
      determining whether a contract is void for reasons of public policy, the 
      exercise of that discretion must be guided by principles which command general 
      acceptance.  What principles apply and the weight to be given to them will 
      depend on the circumstances of each case.  In my opinion the four considerations 
      referred to above are important in this case.</p>

  four considerations referred to by Blair J.A. were stated by him at p. 8:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The important question is whether public policy prevents the severance 
      of the agreement because it is tainted by illegality.  In deciding whether 
      the agreements in this case are capable of severance and partial enforcement, 
      a number of principles from the decided cases must be taken into account.  
      They include the object and policy of s. 347; whether that object and policy 
      would be subverted by a partial performance of the agreements; whether one 
      or both parties intended to break the law; whether the parties were in an 
      equal bargaining position and were professionally advised; and whether one 
      party would be unjustly enriched if the contract were not enforced.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At 
  p. 10, Blair J.A. expressed the opinion that the court has a broad discretion 
  in determining whether a contract tainted by illegality under s. 347 is enforceable.  
  He stated that this was to be decided on a case by case approach, adding at 
  p. 12:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Whether or not a contract tainted by illegality is completely unenforceable 
      depends upon all the circumstances surrounding the contract and the balancing 
      of the considerations discussed above and, in appropriate cases, other considerations.</p>

  the lead of this court in <i>Thomson</i>, it is not uncommon for the court to 
  sever all or part of the interest tainted by s. 347 from the main loan obligation.  
  One example of a case in which this court approved the severing of s. 347 tainted 
  interest from a loan agreement and enforced payment of the principal amount 
  of the loan is <i>Milani v. Banks</i> (1997), 32 O.R. (3d) 557 (C.A.).  Cullity 
  J., in <i>Transport North</i>, went one step further.  He reduced the illegal 
  rate of interest to 60% and enforced payment of the interest at the reduced 
  rate.  He thus read down the interest provision of the loan transaction in that 
  case so that the criminal rate of interest would not be exceeded.  See, also,

  <i>Horvat v. Artell Developments Ltd.</i>  The issue in this case was whether 
  an amount payable under a mortgage constituted a criminal rate of interest within 
  the meaning of s. 347(1)(a).   Blair J.A. found that it did.  He concluded as 
  follows at p. 345:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Since the agreement to pay the sum of $1,300,000 provides for a “criminal 
      rate” of interest in contravention of s. 347, it cannot, for reasons of

  Antle’s article, “A Practical Guide to Section 347 of the Criminal Code – Criminal 
  Rates of Interest” (1994), 23 C.B.L.J. 323 contains a helpful review of the 
  case law on s. 347 up to 1994.  At p. 337, he provides the following assessment 
  of the effect of s. 347 in commercial transactions:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Contravening s. 347 can also have important civil consequences.  Entering 
      into an agreement to receive a criminal rate of interest is an illegal act.  
      The courts will not enforce payment of a criminal rate of interest.  To 
      do so would approve an illegal act, one prohibited by statute.  It would 
      also violate the principle that no one should profit from his own wrongdoing.</p>

line-height:normal'> [142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  case law is helpful as it illustrates the evolving application of s. 347 on 
  commercial obligations in circumstances where borrowers have resisted the repayment 
  of debt obligations on the ground that the interest payable on their debts constituted 
  a criminal rate of interest.  This case, of course, is different as the class 
  members seek to invoke s. 347 both to avoid payment of a contractual obligation 
  and to recover money that they paid to CG that the Supreme Court of Canada has 
  found to be tainted under s.&nbsp;347(1)(b).  In my view, the case law that 
  has considered the effect of a contravention of s. 347 on commercial obligations 
  is central to whether there is a juristic reason that permits CG to retain the 
  LPPs.  In this regard, the important feature of the cases is that the court 
  will not permit a party to benefit from its own wrongdoing  where a contractual 
  obligation infringes s. 347, although it appears to be in the discretion of 
  the court whether it will relieve against the payment of the entire amount of 
  the tainted interest, or only the amount by which the interest exceeds 60% per 
  annum.</p>
<h3 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Earlier 
  in my reasons, I stated that central to the resolution of this appeal is the 
  convergence of three areas of the law: (1) the nature and purpose of class proceedings; 
  (2) restitution based on unjust enrichment; and (3) the effect of the infringement 
  of s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> on the enforceability of commercial obligations.  
  In reaching the conclusion that the appeal should be allowed, I have considered 
  and  endeavoured to apply a standard of review of the decision of the motion 
  judge that is informed by these areas of the law.  In doing so, it is my view 
  that there is no reason to interfere with his finding the CG obtained a benefit, 
  or was enriched, by the LPPs it received from the members of the plaintiff class.  
  However, it is my opinion that the motion judge erred in law in finding that 
  the rate orders of the OEB constituted a juristic reason for CG’s retention 
  of the LPPs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At 
  the heart of the appellant’s case, which is now buttressed by the decision of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada, is the following proposition. As the LPPs received 
  by CG are capable of constituting a criminal rate of interest contrary to s. 
  347(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, that part of the contract between CG 
  and its customers under which they have agreed to pay LPPs is unenforceable, 
  with the result that CG must make restitution to its customers for the total 
  amount of the LPPs.  The appellant contends that CG should not be permitted 
  to profit from its breach of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Moreover, the appellant 
  places emphasis on the purpose of s. 347, which is to protect consumers from 
  harsh interest rates.  Although CG has been neither charged, nor convicted, 
  of an offence contrary to s.&nbsp;347(1)(b), the appellant seeks to uphold the 
  established rule of public policy that no person should profit from his or her 
  own wrongdoing.  In <i>Demeter v. Dominion Life Assurance Co.</i> (1982), 35 
  O.R. (2d)  560 at 562 (C.A.), MacKinnon A.C.J.O. described the rule of public 
  policy:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The basic rule of public policy which is not disputed is that the courts 
      will not recognize a benefit accruing to a criminal from his crime nor to 
      anyone claiming through the criminal.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As 
  I have stated, the scope of appellate review of the decision of a trial judge 
  or a motion judge is narrow.  As Bastarache J. stated in <i>Van de Perre</i> 
  at paragraph 13, “an appellate court may only intervene in the decision of a 
  trial judge if he or she erred in law or made a material error in the appreciation 
  of the facts”.  At p. 574 of his reasons, the motion judge found that “as a 
  result of each LPP received by Consumers’ Gas, the company has more money than 
  it had previously and accordingly is enriched”.  In my view, the respondent, 
  which challenged this finding, provided no reason to interfere with it.  It 
  is supported by both the evidence and the authorities, and is not based on a 
  material error by the motion judge in his appreciation of the facts.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> However, 
  I am satisfied that the motion judge erred in law in finding that the rate orders 
  of the OEB providing for a 5% LPP constitute a juristic reason entitling CG 
  to retain the LPPs.  He did so on the following ground, found at p. 574 of his 
  reasons: “Neither the plaintiff nor any other party has sought to challenge 
  these orders, and as discussed above, the orders are valid and binding if and 
  until such time when they are reversed or invalidated.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  finding that the rate orders constitute a juristic reason for CG’s enrichment 
  the motion judge failed to consider the effect on the rate orders of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada’s decision that an LPP “is an ‘interest’ charge within the meaning 
  of s. 347 [of the <i>Criminal Code</i>] and is subject to that law’s  prohibitions 
  against requiring or receiving interest at a criminal rate”. (p. 408).  I have 
  no doubt on the basis of the authorities that I have discussed that, but for 
  the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada, the rate orders of the OEB would 
  have constituted a juristic reason.  However, given the decision of the Supreme 
  Court of Canada, the rate orders ceased to have any legal effect insofar as 
  they enabled CG to levy a 5% LPP on the class members.  Whether the rate orders 
  were valid and binding because they had not been challenged by the plaintiff 
  became irrelevant in the face of the Supreme Court’s finding that the LPPs were 
  tainted under s. 347(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Thus, on the basis 
  of that line of authority discussed by Professor Smith that seeks to take the 
  <i>Pettkus</i> formulation of “juristic reason” literally, when the LPPs were 
  found to come within the scope of s.&nbsp;347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> by 
  the Supreme Court of Canada, the rate orders ceased to be a juristic reason 
  justifying CG’s enrichment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Moreover, 
  to conclude that the rate orders constitute a juristic reason is to permit the 
  orders of a provincial regulatory agency to override federal criminal law and 
  would remove a substantial reason for compliance with s. 347.  In this regard, 
  I refer to the Chief Justice’s observation in paragraph 34 of his reasons, with 
  which I agree: “Regardless of the success of the plaintiff’s claim for restitutionary 
  relief, the [Ontario Energy] Board will need to design a new penalty for late 
  payments that does not have the capacity to result in a contravention of s. 
  347(1)(b).”  Apposite, as well, is the further observation of the Chief Justice 
  in paragraph 48 of his reasons in holding that s. 18 of the <i>OEBA</i> does 
  not constitute a defence to the plaintiff’s claim, with which I also agree:  
  “The wording of s. 18 is very broad, but I am unwilling to interpret it as providing 
  a defence to an action for restitution arising from a Board order authorizing 
  conduct that is contrary to the <i>Criminal Code</i>.”  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  Chief Justice’s conclusion that s. 18 of the <i>OEBA</i> does not serve as a 
  defence to the appellant’s claim by virtue of the Supreme Court of Canada’s 
  decision that the LPPs are capable of infringing s.&nbsp;347(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> is, of course, an application of the paramountcy doctrine.  See, <i>e.g., 
  M&amp;D Farm Ltd. v. Manitoba Agricultural Credit Corp.,</i> [1999] 2 S.C.R. 
  961.  Because there is a conflict between the rate orders of a provincial regulatory 
  agency approving a 5% LPP, which I observe was requested by CG, and federal 
  legislation precluding CG’s receipt of a 5% LPP, the federal legislation will 
  prevail according to the paramountcy doctrine.  The conflict arises because 
  to permit the provincial rate orders to prevail will displace the legislative 
  purpose of Parliament.  See <i>Law Society of British Columbia v. Mangat</i>, 
  2001 S.C.C. 67, <i>per</i> Gonthier J. at paragraphs 23 and 69.  For the same 
  reason that the OEB rate orders are not an effective defence to the appellant’s 
  claim by virtue of s. 18 of the <i>OEBA</i>, they do not constitute a juristic 
  reason for CG’s enrichment.  See, also,<i> R. v. Jorgensen</i>, [1995]&nbsp;4&nbsp;S.C.R.&nbsp;55.  
  In my view, it would be wrong to say that the rate orders do not provide CG 
  with a defence under s.&nbsp;18 of the <i>OEBA</i> because they have been rendered 
  inoperative by the doctrine of federal paramountcy, and then to breathe life 
  into them for the purpose of finding that they constitute a juristic reason 
  for CG’s enrichment.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> A 
  further consideration relevant to whether the rate orders of the OEB constitute 
  a juristic reason is the body of case law that has considered the effect of 
  a violation of s. 347 on the enforceability of commercial obligations.  As part 
  of this consideration, it may be necessary to determine the date from which 
  restitution should be calculated – for example, from when s. 347 was proclaimed 
  in force in 1981, from when this action was commenced, from when the reasons 
  for judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada were released, or from some other 
  date.  As well, there may be an issue whether restitution should be required 
  for the entire amount of the LPPs, or only for the amount by which the LPPs 
  exceed the annual criminal rate of interest of 60%.  This analysis reflects 
  the line of cases which have approached the concept of juristic reason from 
  the perspective of circumstances which would render it unfair or unjust for 
  a defendant to retain a benefit.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  as well, to the role of s. 347 in the determination of whether the facts of 
  this case disclose a juristic reason for CG’s enrichment is that s. 347 is in 
  the nature of consumer protection legislation, its purpose being to protect 
  consumers from paying exorbitant rates of interest.  There is authority that 
  appears to support the proposition that legislative purpose is a relevant factor 
  for the court to consider in deciding whether to grant restitutionary relief.

  payment of an LPP that results in the payment of a criminal rate of interest 
  just as a mortgagor can refuse to pay interest on a mortgage at a rate that 
  contravenes s.&nbsp;347.  Because the provision in a customer’s contract by 
  which he or she has agreed to pay a 5% LPP on an overdue account is illegal 
  by virtue of s. 347(1)(b), it cannot be enforced by CG.  Subject to the considerations

  slightly differently, CG cannot as against its customers retain the LPPs save 
  by relying on the rate orders of the OEB by which CG levied LPPs on its customers 
  if their account was not paid by its due date.  Although, as the motion judge 
  stated, the rate orders were valid and subsisting in the sense that they were 
  issued under the authority of the <i>OEBA</i> and have not been set aside or 
  otherwise declared to be invalid, the LPPs which they permitted CG to collect 
  from its customers have been found to infringe s.&nbsp;347(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code</i>.  To say that the rate orders nevertheless permit CG to retain the 
  LPPs would be to achieve a result that is both contrary to the federal paramountcy 
  doctrine and the authorities that have applied s. 347 in relation to commercial 
  obligations.  Moreover, to do so would be to permit CG to profit from its own 
  wrongdoing.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  summary, therefore, there are two reasons why the rate orders of the OEB do 
  not constitute a juristic reason for CG’s retention of the LPPs.  First, when 
  the Supreme Court of Canada held that the LPPs come within the scope of the 
  s. 347 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> the rate orders ceased to have any legal 
  effect insofar as they enabled CG to levy a 5% LPP on the class members.  Second, 
  on the basis of the authorities that have considered the effect of s. 347 on 
  commercial obligations, it would be inequitable to permit CG to retain the LPPs 
  as to do so would be to enable CG to profit from its own wrongdoing.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Before 
  this court the respondent argued that if the appellant succeeds in his appeal, 
  it should not be required to repay the LPPs on the ground that it had altered 
  its position to its detriment in reliance on the OEB rate orders.  This is known 
  as the “change of position” defence which, as I have indicated, has been judicially 
  recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Storthoaks</i>.  The defence 
  was also recognized by the House of Lords in <i>Lipkin Gorman</i> in which it 
  was described in the following way by Lord Goff of Chieveley at pp. 579-580:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The answer must be that, where an innocent defendant’s position is so changed 
      that he will suffer an injustice if called upon to repay or to repay in 
      full, the injustice of requiring him so to repay outweighs the injustice 
      of denying the plaintiff restitution.  If the plaintiff pays money to the 
      defendant under a mistake of fact, and the defendant then, acting in good 
      faith, pays the money or part of it to charity, it is unjust to require 
      the defendant to make restitution to the extent that he has so changed his 
      position.  Likewise, on facts such as those in the present case, if a thief 
      steals my money and pays it to a third party who gives it away to charity, 
      that third party should have a good defence to an action for money had and 
      received.  In other words, bona fide change of position should of itself 
      be a good defence in such cases as these.  The principle is widely recognized 
      throughout the common law world.</p>

  <blockquote> 
    <p>I am most anxious that, in recognizing this defence to actions of restitution, 
      nothing should be said at this stage to inhibit the development of the defence 
      on a case by case basis, in the usual way.  <i>It is, of course, plain that 
      the defence is not open to one who has changed his position in bad faith, 
      as where the defendant has paid away the money with knowledge of the facts 
      entitling the plaintiff to restitution; and it is commonly accepted that 
      the defence should not be open to a wrongdoer.</i>  These are matters which 
      can, in due course, be considered in depth in cases where they arise for 
      consideration.  They do not arise in the present case.  Here there is no 
      doubt that the respondents have acted in good faith throughout, <i>and the 
      action is not founded upon any wrongdoing to the respondents</i>.  It is 
      not however appropriate in the present case to attempt to identify all those 
      actions in restitution to which change of position may be a defence.  A 
      prominent example will, no doubt, be found in those cases where the plaintiff 
      is seeking repayment of money paid under a mistake of fact; but I can see 
      no reason why the defence should not also be available in principle in a 
      case such as the present, where the plaintiff’s money has been paid by a 
      thief to an innocent donee, and the plaintiff then seeks repayment from 
      the donee in an action for money had and received.  At present I do not 
      wish to state the principle any less broadly than this:  that the defence 
      is available to a person whose position has so changed that it would be 
      inequitable in all the circumstances to require him to make restitution, 
      or alternatively to make restitution in full.  I wish to stress however 
      that the mere fact that the defendant has spent the money, in whole or in 
      part, does not of itself render it inequitable that he should be called 
      upon to repay, because the expenditure might in any event have been incurred 
      by him in the ordinary course of things. [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:LEFT'>In <i>Lipkin Gorman</i> 
  it was found that the defence of change of position was not available to the 
  respondent gambling club.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [156]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The 
  respondent submitted that the defence should be applied in this case on the 
  basis of the following argument.  The OEB, through its rate orders, designed 
  a rate structure, including LPPs, to recover the revenue requirement of CG.  
  The rate structure would have been different, and CG would have been in a different 
  position, if CG had not been able to recover part of its revenue requirement 
  through LPPs in accordance with the rate orders.  Therefore, it would be inequitable 
  to require CG to refund LPPs received since 1981 when it cannot go back and 
  alter its rate structure to account for that loss of revenue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Although 
  this argument is attractive, it is not available to the respondent as the LPPs 
  upon which it relied as a component of its revenue requirement in its rate order 
  applications to the OEB have been found by the Supreme Court of Canada to contravene 
  s. 347(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It is simply another way to attempt 
  to justify the retention of the LPPs received in contravention of the criminal 
  law.  As Lord Goff of Chieveley has pointed out, the change of position defence 
  should not be open to a wrongdoer.  In <i>Storthoaks,</i> the Supreme Court 
  of Canada refused to allow a municipality to make use of this defence when it 
  clearly would have designed a different tax structure in order to meet its “revenue 
  requirement” if it had recognized that it would not be able to retain the lease 
  payments in issue in that case, even though the municipality could not later 
  go back and alter its tax structure to account for its loss of revenue.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There 
  is a final factor that I believe it is appropriate to consider in determining 
  whether CG has been unjustly enriched.  I refer to the fact that this is a proposed 
  class action, which accounts for my earlier review of the nature and purpose 
  of class proceedings.  I appreciate, depending on the result of this appeal, 
  that the class proceeding remains to be certified.  Nevertheless, I believe 
  that at this stage of the proceedings, because this is a proposed class action, 
  the determination of whether the class members are entitled to recovery should 
  not be considered on the basis of the representative appellant’s claim for $75.  
  Rather, it should be considered in the context of a class proceeding, assuming 
  that the proceeding is certified.  In expressing this opinion, I appreciate 
  that a motion for summary judgment is procedurally permitted before certification, 
  and in a proper case, can provide a useful role in dismissing a case at an early 
  stage where it is clear that a trial is unnecessary to resolve a significant 
  issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [159]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In 
  my view, there are two features of class proceedings that have relevance to 
  whether CG was unjustly enriched by the LPPs paid by the class members.  First, 
  a class action provides access to the courts for a group of persons who have 
  been wronged by a defendant, none of whom could afford to sue separately.  In 
  this case, for example, it is unlikely that the appellant, or any other class 
  member, who paid about $75 in LPPs could afford to sue CG separately.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [160]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second, 
  class actions enforce the law by requiring a violator to bear the costs it inflicts 
  on a class of consumers for its wrongful conduct, costs that it could otherwise 
  avoid because, as in this case, each victim’s injury is too small to warrant 
  suit.  There are two American cases, which parallel this case, that are frequently 
  cited as illustrative of this point.  In <i>Daar v. Yellow Cab Co.</i> (1967), 
  67 Cal. 2d 695, 443 P. 2d 732, the class members sought recovery of overcharges 
  collected by the defendant’s setting its taxicab meters to operate at rates 
  higher than an ordinance had authorized.  In <i>State v. Levi Strauss &amp; 
  Co.</i> (1986), 41 Cal. 3d. 460, 715 P. 2d 514, recovery was sought of overcharges 
  as a result of the defendant’s unlawful pricing of its products.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [161]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For 
  the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment dismissing 
  the appellant’s claim and order that the respondent’s motion for summary judgment 
  be dismissed.  In addition, I would order:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><i>(a)       </i>that there be a declaration that the charging and receipt 
      of LPPs by Consumers’ Gas violates s. 347(1)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
      and that LPPs need not be paid by the appellant;<i></i></p>
    <p><i>(b)</i>       that the respondent repay the appellant the amount of 
      the LPPs received from him, such amount to be determined by the trial judge.<i></i></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>The appellant is thus to have partial summary judgment in 
  respect to liability and is required to proceed to trial in respect to the proof 
  of damages.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I 
  would also award the appellant his costs of the motion, which are to include 
  his costs of the partial summary judgment, and his costs of this appeal.  I 
  must point out that the Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appellant’s appeal 
  to that court “with costs in the cause”.  In the circumstances, failing agreement 
  among counsel, I believe that the better course to follow is to provide counsel 
  for the parties the opportunity to make submissions on interest and costs after 
  judgment has been delivered. Accordingly, I will consider this award of costs 
  to be provisional until counsel are heard from.</p>
