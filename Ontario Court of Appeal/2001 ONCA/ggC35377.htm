  </span></span> The appellant was convicted of one count of sexual assault and 
  one count of sexual exploitation.  The complainant was the appellant’s 15 year 
  old stepdaughter.  The appellant admitted that sexual contact had occurred. 
  He testified that on the night in question, he had had sex with his wife and 
  went back to sleep.  His wife left the bed, and according to the appellant, 
  he was woken up by someone he thought to be his wife straddling him.  The complainant 
  gave a very different version testifying that the appellant entered her bedroom 
  following which a non-consensual sexual acts occurred.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant asks that we admit as fresh evidence a videotape 
  of a statement given to the police by the complainant.  It is the appellant’s 
  contention that this statement should have been used at trial to cross-examine 
  the complainant to demonstrate certain inconsistencies in her version of the 
  incident in question.  The appellant says that he acquired a copy of the videotaped 
  statement during the trial, after the close of the Crown’s case, but that his 
  trial counsel declined to make any use of it.  According to the respondent, 
  the videotape was made available to the appellant’s trial counsel as part of 
  the Crown’s disclosure months in advance of the trial.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Even if we were to accept the appellant’s version, he fails to 
  satisfy the test for the admission of fresh evidence in <i>R. v. Palmer,</i> 
  [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 as the evidence was available at the time of trial.  If 
  the appellant has a complaint, it is with his trial counsel. The appellant has 
  not taken the requisite steps to raise the competence of his trial counsel as 
  a ground of appeal.  Accordingly, we decline to admit the videotape as fresh 
  evidence on appeal.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant also raises two other grounds which indirectly 
  impugn the conduct of his trial counsel.  He alleges that he was not afforded 
  the right to elect trial by judge alone and that his case should have been stayed 
  on grounds of unreasonable delay pursuant to s. 11 of the Charter.  The record 
  before us makes it clear that on Friday, November 8, 1998, the appellant’s counsel 
  elected trial by judge and jury and that when the case came on for trial, there 
  was no attempt to reelect.  No motion was made to the trial judge to have the 
  charges stayed on grounds of unreasonable delay.  As these points were not raised 
  at the appropriate time, it is not open to the appellant to bring them forward 
  now.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in failing 
  to instruct the jury that the appellant’s honest but mistaken belief of fact 
  could amount to a defence to the sexual assault charge.  The trial judge did 
  instruct the jury on the relevance of the mistake of fact defence with respect 
  to the sexual exploitation charge but expressly stated that it did not bear 
  upon the sexual assault charge.  In our view, there is no error in this regard. 
  Mistake of fact did bear upon the sexual exploitation count as consent is not 
  a defence to that charge and if the appellant’s version were accepted by the 
  jury, his alleged mistake as to the identity of the person with whom he was 
  engaged in sexual activity would have a bearing on his liability.  Mistake of 
  fact had no bearing, however, on the sexual assault count.  On the appellant’s 
  version of the incident, the complainant initiated sexual contact with him.  
  If that version were accepted, there could be no issue as to the complainant’s 
  consent with respect to the sexual assault charge.  The defence of mistake of 
  fact simply does not arise.  The trial judge clearly instructed the jury that 
  if they accepted the appellant’s version of the events or if they had a reasonable 
  doubt as a result of his evidence, they were to acquit him. There was no error 
  in the trial judge’s instructions.  </p>

  </span></span> Finally, we see no error in the manner in which the trial judge 
  dealt with the out of court statement of Linda Jinkerson.  </p>
