<p class=MsoHeader style='text-align:justify;'><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from 
  the judgment of Justice Wailan Low dated January 26, 2001.</span></b></p>
<p class=MsoHeader><b><span lang=EN-US>BORINS J.A.:</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This is an appeal by Scott Grant from the summary 
  judgment granted by Low J. dismissing his claim for damages for defamation against 
  the respondent Jenny Cormier-Grant, who is the former wife of his brother.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant alleged that he was defamed when the respondent 
  accused him of sexually assaulting her daughter, J., who is the appellant’s 
  niece.  The respondent made the alleged defamatory statement in a telephone 
  conversation with her daughter’s physician, Dr. Steven Lau.  The respondent 
  raised two defences: (1) any words that were spoken to Dr. Lau were spoken on 
  an occasion of qualified privilege; (2) because any words spoken to Dr. Lau 
  did not identify the appellant as the person who had sexually assaulted her 
  daughter, the words were not spoken of and concerning the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motion judge found that the evidence disclosed no genuine 
  issue for trial.  Accordingly, she dismissed the appellant’s claim.  Her principal 
  reason for doing so was that, although the evidence disclosed that the respondent 
  made a defamatory statement to Dr. Lau, it was not the statement pleaded by 
  the appellant.  She concluded that “technically speaking” the variance between 
  the evidence and the statement of claim put an end to the appellant’s claim 
  “in the absence of an amendment to the pleading by the plaintiff alleging publication 
  in accordance with the evidence and alleging by way of true innuendo facts establishing 
  that the words were understood to have been published of and concerning the 
  plaintiff”.  However, the motion judge did not consider whether leave should 
  be granted to the appellant to amend his statement of claim to conform with 
  the evidence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The motion judge then considered the two defences 
  raised by the respondent, qualified privilege and lack of identification.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> She found as a matter of law that as the respondent and Dr. Lau, 
  “parent and physician of the child J., respectively, have a reciprocating duty 
  and interest to give and receive communications concerning J.’s health and welfare”, 
  the respondent’s communication was protected by qualified privilege.  She concluded 
  that as the appellant had not pleaded that the respondent made the communication 
  maliciously, which if proved would defeat the defence of qualified privilege, 
  his action should be dismissed.  She added that even if the appellant had pleaded 
  malice, she would have come to the same result as the appellant had failed to 
  adduce any evidence to support the proposition that the respondent knew the 
  statement to be false or that she published it reckless as to its truth or falsity.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As for the defence of lack of identification, the motion judge 
  found that the appellant had provided no evidence that “Dr. Lau understood the 
  words to have referred to the plaintiff nor that he had the information to so 
  deduce”.  She held that the appellant’s “bald allegation” that Dr. Lau understood 
  the words to refer to him was insufficient to raise a genuine issue for trial 
  on whether the words spoken by the respondent identified the appellant as the 
  person defamed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant raised three grounds of appeal.  He contended that 
  the motion judge erred:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In failing to grant leave to amend the statement 
      of claim to conform with the evidence of the statement made by the respondent 
      to Dr. Lau.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In finding that he failed to plead malice 
      in respect to the defence of qualified privilege and that there was no evidence 
      that in making the statement the respondent was actuated by malice.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In concluding that there was no genuine 
      issue for trial concerning the identification of the appellant as the person 
      defamed.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>For the reasons that follow, I would give effect to each 
      of these grounds.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although the motion judge was satisfied that the evidence disclosed 
  that the respondent had made a defamatory statement to Dr. Lau, the motion judge 
  nevertheless dismissed the appellant’s claim because that statement differed 
  from the defamatory statement pleaded by him.  In reaching this conclusion the 
  motion judge overlooked the special circumstances that apply in defamation actions 
  where there is a variance between the words published and the words pleaded.  
  Particularly in actions of slander, although precise words must be pleaded in 
  the statement of claim, the plaintiff does not have to prove that these precise 
  words were in fact published.  As stated in <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i>, 
  9th ed., (1998, Sweet &amp; Maxwell) at p. 807:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is sufficient if [the plaintiff] proves a material and defamatory part 
      of them or words which are substantially to the same effect.  In such a 
      case, if the words proved convey to the mind of a reasonable [person] practically 
      the same meaning as the words set out, the variance will be immaterial.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We were not told the nature of the variance between the defamatory 
  words pleaded and those disclosed by the evidence.  I have been unable to discern 
  the nature of the variance from examining the motion record.  Given that at 
  trial considerable tolerance is afforded to a plaintiff in a slander action 
  where there is a variance between pleading and proof, in my view the motion 
  judge should not have dismissed the plaintiff’s claim.  The proper course for 
  her to have followed was to give the appellant an opportunity to amend his statement 
  of claim to conform with the evidence of the words spoken by the respondent.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the second ground of appeal, the parties do not 
  contest the motion judge’s finding that the words complained of were spoken 
  by the respondent to Dr. Lau on an occasion of qualified privilege.  However, 
  the appellant submitted that the motion judge erred in finding that he failed 
  to plead malice and that even if malice had been pleaded, that he had failed 
  to adduce evidence of malice.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the appellant’s submission on the issue of malice 
  and would give effect to this ground of appeal.  Malice is pleaded in paragraph 
  6 of the statement of claim.  Whether the respondent was actuated by malice 
  when she spoke the words in issue requires that the trier of fact determine 
  her state of mind at that time.  I also agree with the appellant, on the basis 
  of the evidence summarized in his factum, that there is evidence that raises 
  a genuine issue for trial whether the respondent was actuated by malice when 
  she spoke the words complained of to Dr. Lau.  In most cases there is rarely 
  direct evidence of malice, and this case is no exception.  In my view, there 
  is extrinsic evidence from which the trier of fact could infer that the respondent 
  was actuated by malice.  I would add that malice can take the form of any improper 
  motive for speaking the words complained of, and is not limited to knowledge 
  that the statement was false or that it was published reckless as to its truth 
  or falsity as the motion judge appeared to believe.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, malice could be inferred from the following evidence: 
  (1) the respondent made the communication to Dr. Lau after she had been advised 
  that the respondent had not been at home during the weekend in question and 
  that J. had told her father that the allegations were a “fib”; (2) the respondent 
  did not notify the police about the allegations; (3) the respondent refused 
  to take J. to a doctor or to a hospital, despite requests made by the child’s 
  father; (4) the respondent permitted J.’s father to continue having access to 
  J. in the appellant’s home subsequent to the alleged sexual assault.  It is 
  the appellant’s position that this evidence is capable of supporting the inference 
  that the respondent was motivated to defame him when she contacted Dr. Lau. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, I do not agree with the motion judge’s conclusion that 
  there is no genuine issue for trial concerning the identification of the appellant 
  as the person defamed.  As I will explain, the motion judge applied an incorrect 
  analysis in deciding this issue.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before considering the law that pertains to identification, referred 
  to by the authorities as the colloquium, it is helpful to examine the evidence 
  of identification that was before the motion judge.  In my view, there was evidence 
  that was capable of establishing that Dr. Lau understood the words spoken to 
  have referred to the appellant.  However, as I will explain, in approaching 
  the issue of identification from the perspective of whether Dr. Lau knew the 
  words spoken referred to the appellant, the motion judge did not apply the correct 
  analysis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In his responding affidavit the appellant stated:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Although Dr. Lau indicates that he was not provided with 
      a name he was told by [the respondent] that the assault was committed by 
      J.’s uncle, [the respondent’s] ex-husband’s brother, which I verily believe 
      is, in the circumstances, sufficiently specific to identify me.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant attached to his affidavit a copy of a letter from 
  Dr. Lau to his lawyer, as well as a copy of Dr. Lau’s clinical notes.  In the 
  letter to the appellant’s lawyer, Dr. Lau said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>On 23 Oct. 1998 [the respondent] came to see me and informed that J. said 
      her uncle touched her (J.) in her private area with his hand and penis.  
      [The respondent] did not mention any name.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>In his clinical notes of October 23, 1998, Dr. Lau wrote:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>According to Jenny, mother, last weekend [J.] was with 
      Dad (17-18 Oct. 98) and J. said uncle (ex-husband’s brother) touched her 
      in her private area; touched her with his hand and penis.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In October 1998, J.’s father was living with the appellant in 
  the appellant’s home.  He had weekend access to his daughter who spent the weekends 
  with her father in the appellant’s home.  There is a third brother in the appellant’s 
  family.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The law with respect to the test which the trier of fact must 
  apply in deciding whether the defamatory words were published of and concerning 
  the plaintiff is contained in two leading cases:  <i>Knupffer v. London Express 
  Newspaper Ltd.</i>, [1944] A.C. 116 (H.L.) and <i>Morgan v. Odhams Press Ltd.</i>, 
  [1971] 2 All E.R. 1156 (H.L.).  <i>Knupffer</i> was applied by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada in <i>Arnott v. College of Physicians &amp; Surgeons (Saskatchewan)</i>, 
  [1954] S.C.R. 538.  The legal principles are conveniently summarized in <i>Gatley 
  on Libel and Slander, supra</i>, at pp. 161-164 and pp. 808-811 and R.E. Brown, 
  <i>The Law of Defamation in Canada, </i>2nd ed., (loose-leaf, 1999, Carswell) 
  at Vol. 1, pp. 6-1 to 6-47.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> An essential element of the tort of defamation is proof that 
  the defamatory statement was published of and concerning the plaintiff.  Where, 
  as in this case, the plaintiff’s name does not appear in the defamatory statement, 
  “it must be shown that the words used, or the circumstances attending the publication 
  are such as, would lead reasonable persons to understand that it was the plaintiff 
  to whom the defendant referred”:  See Brown at p. 6-2.  I would adopt and apply 
  the following statement of the law in Brown at pp. 6-2 to 6-3:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In an action for defamation, it is the plaintiff’s reputation that must 
      be adversely affected.  Therefore, in order to recover, the plaintiff must 
      plead and prove that he or she is the one to whom the defamatory statement 
      refers, that is, it must be shown to have been published ‘of and concerning’ 
      the plaintiff.  The defamatory publication ‘must refer to some ascertained 
      or ascertainable person, and that person must be the plaintiff.’  It must 
      refer to or concern him personally.  The test in every case is whether the 
      ordinary sensible person to whom the words were published would understand 
      them as referring to the plaintiff.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In respect to identifying the plaintiff as the 
  person defamed, Brown states at pp.6-5 to 6-6:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>It is not necessary that the plaintiff be identified by his or her proper 
      name, or even mentioned at all, if it is otherwise shown that the words 
      would be reasonably understood to refer to the plaintiff.  He or she may 
      be referred to in the guise of some fictional or historical character or 
      by a play on words.  It may be clear from other evidence that he was the 
      one alluded to, but he must satisfy the court in that regard.  This may 
      be done by introducing evidence, apart from the publication, connecting 
      the plaintiff with the defamatory publication.  The question in such a case 
      is whether or not the words used are such as to lead an ordinary sensible 
      person, or reasonable persons, who pay reasonable attention to the contents 
      of the communication, to understand that it was the plaintiff to whom the 
      defendant referred.</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p>The test of whether words that do not specifically name the plaintiff 
          refer to him or not is this:  Are they such as reasonably in the circumstances 
          would lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he 
          was the person referred to?  That does not assume that those persons 
          who read the words know all the circumstances or all the relevant facts.  
          But although the plaintiff is not named in words, he may, nevertheless, 
          be described so as to be recognized; and whether that description takes 
          the form of a word-picture of an individual or the form of a reference 
          to a class of persons of which he is or is believed to be a member, 
          or any other form, if in the circumstances the description is such that 
          a person hearing or reading the alleged libel would reasonably believe 
          that the plaintiff was referred to, that is a sufficient reference to 
          him.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

  the defamatory statement was published of and concerning the plaintiff is found 
  in <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander, op.&nbsp;cit.,</i> at p. 161: “The test is 
  whether the plaintiff may reasonably be understood to be referred to by the 
  words.”  The authority provided for the test is the same passage from the reasons 
  of Isaacs J. in <i>David Syme &amp; Co. v. Canavan</i> quoted by Brown at pp. 
  6-5 to 6-6.  At pp. 163-164 the discussion of the test continues:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Where the plaintiff is referred to in an indirect way or by implication 
      it will be a question of degree how far evidence will be required to connect 
      the libel with him.  At one extreme, if there is a libel on “the Prime Minister” 
      that officer does not need to produce witnesses to testify that they know 
      who he is.  At the other extreme, the plaintiff may only be identifiable 
      by reason of extrinsic facts which are not generally known, in which case 
      there is no actionable publication unless it is shown that the words were 
      communicated to persons with such knowledge.  Even in the latter type of 
      case, however, it is not enough that the recipients of the statement did 
      understand it to refer to the plaintiff: the issue is whether reasonable 
      people with their knowledge would so understand it. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

  </span></span> In the United states the authorities support a similar test regarding 
  the identity of the plaintiff as the subject of a defamatory statement.  The 
  test is described in <i>Prosser and Keeton on The Law of Torts</i>, (5th ed., 
  1984, West) at p. 783:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A publication may clearly be defamatory as to somebody, and yet on its 
      face make no reference to the individual plaintiff.  In such a case the 
      plaintiff must sustain the burden of pleading and proof, by way of “colloquium,” 
      that the defamatory meaning attached to him.  If he fails to do so, he has 
      not made out his case.  He need not, of course, be named, and the reference 
      may be an indirect one, with the identification depending upon circumstances 
      known to the hearers, and it is not necessary that every listener understand 
      it, so long as there are some who reasonably do; but the understanding that 
      the plaintiff is meant must be a reasonable one, and if it arises from extrinsic 
      facts, it must be shown that these were known to those who heard. [Footnotes

  at p. 554:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span> </span>As in <i>Knupffer v. London Express,</i> there are two questions 
      involved in the attempt of the appellant to identify himself as the person 
      defamed by the words here complained of.  The first question is one of law, 
      namely, in the words of Viscount Simon L.C., in the above case, at p. 121,</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>can the article, having regard to its language, be regarded as capable 
          of referring to the appellant?</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>It is only when that question is answered in the affirmative 
      that the second question, one of fact, arises, namely,</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote>
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>does the article, in fact, lead reasonable people, who know the appellant,

      case:</span></p>
    <p><span

  </span></span> It is clear from the decision of the House of Lords in <i>Morgan</i> 
  that the test is an objective one, whether on the evidence an ordinary sensible 
  person would draw the inference that the words referred to the plaintiff.  As 
  pointed out in <i>Gatley on Libel and Slander</i> at p. 809, in cases like <i>Morgan</i> 
  and this case where the plaintiff’s name does not appear in the defamatory statement, 
  “extrinsic evidence must be given ‘to connect the libel with the plaintiff’, 
  evidence from which it would be reasonable to deduce that the defamatory words 
  ‘implicated’ the plaintiff”.  The House of Lords in <i>Morgan</i>, reversing 
  the Court of Appeal, found that it would not have been unreasonable for a hypothetical 
  sensible reader who knew the special facts to infer that the article referred 
  to the plaintiff.  The House of Lords was satisfied that the articles complained 
  of had to contain something which, to the mind of a reader with knowledge of 
  the relevant circumstances, contained defamatory imputations and pointed to 
  the plaintiff as the person defamed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I would observe that although the cases to which 
  I have referred considered the issue of identification in the context of a libel 
  case, and, indeed the legal treatises also discuss the issue in that context, 
  I can see no reason in principle why the test to be applied in determining whether 
  a defamatory statement refers to the plaintiff should not be the same in slander 
  cases.</span></p>

  </span></span> It is also helpful to consider the roles of the judge and jury 
  in respect to the issue of identification.  Brown describes them as follows 
  at pp. 6-45 to 6-46:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The initial question in each of these cases is whether or not the language 
      used in the publication is capable of referring to the plaintiff.  This 
      is a question of law for the trial judge to decide.  Once a judge has determined 
      that the publication is reasonably capable of referring to the plaintiff, 
      it is then for the jury to decide whether or not it did, in fact, refer 
      to him or her, and whether the persons testifying that they understood the 
      words to refer to the plaintiff were right in that belief.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>We were not told whether this action is to be tried by a jury.  If there 
  is no jury, then it will be the trial judge who must decide, as a question of 
  fact, whether the defamatory statement referred to the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motion judge held that there was no genuine issue for trial 
  in respect to identification because there was no evidence that “Dr. Lau understood 
  the words to have referred to the plaintiff nor that he had the information 
  to do so”.  In my view, the motion judge failed to apply the proper test in 
  determining whether there was sufficient evidence to allow the action to proceed 
  to trial on the issue whether or not the defamatory statement referred to the 
  appellant.  As the authorities indicate, the test is an objective one and, in 
  the circumstances of this case, is not confined to whether only Dr. Lau could 
  identify the defamatory statement with the appellant.  As stated in J.G. Fleming, 
  <i>The Law of Torts</i>, 9th ed., (1998, LBC Information Series 1998), at pp. 
  593-594:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>If the allegation is ex facie defamatory and refers by 
      name to the person defamed or, without mentioning him by name, describes 
      him in such a way that the man in the street would know to whom it referred, 
      it is unnecessary to prove that the person to whom it was published had 
      any knowledge of the plaintiff or that the allegation led him to think the 
      less of him.</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p style='
text-align:justify'><span lang=EN-US>See, also, <i>Clerk &amp; Lindsell on Torts</i>, 
  18th ed., (2000, Sweet &amp; Maxwell) at pp. 22-17 to 22-18.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Although it is true that the name Scott Grant does not appear 
  in the words spoken by the respondent to Dr. Lau, he was indicated “by designation 
  or description”, to use the expression adopted in the cases which I have reviewed.  
  He was indicated by his relationship to the respondent as her ex-husband’s brother 
  and the uncle of J.  Although it will be for the trial judge to decide, there 
  can be little doubt that there is evidence that the words complained of referred 
  to the appellant.  This is the first of the two questions involved where the 
  plaintiff is required to identify himself or herself as the person defamed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It would appear that in this case the more significant issue 
  is the second question which requires the appellant to satisfy the trier of 
  fact whether the respondent’s words are such as would reasonably lead sensible 
  persons with knowledge of the relevant or special circumstances to believe that 
  he was the person to whom the respondent referred.  In this regard, the relevant 
  or special circumstances are:  (1) the appellant’s brother had been divorced 
  from the respondent, and was residing with the appellant in the appellant’s 
  home; (2) the appellant’s brother had access to his daughter, J., on weekends; 
  and (3) J. lived with her father in the appellant’s home during the times when 
  he had access to her.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Given the respective roles of the judge and jury in determining 
  whether a defamatory statement in fact refers to the plaintiff and applying 
  the principles that pertain to Rule 20 motions for summary judgment stated by 
  this court in such cases as <i>Dawson v. Rexcraft Storage and Warehouse Inc</i>. 
  (1998), 164 D.L.R. (4th) 257 (Ont. C.A.), I am satisfied that the words spoken 
  by the respondent can be regarded as capable of referring to the appellant and 
  that the record is sufficient to permit a jury, applying the proper test, to 
  find that the words referred to the appellant.  Thus, an issue of fact is raised 
  of whether a person hearing the words which the respondent spoke to Dr. Lau 
  would reasonably understand that the words were spoken of and concerning the 
  appellant.  It follows that the motion judge erred in finding that the respondent 
  had established that there was no genuine issue for trial on the issue of identification.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the judgment 
  dismissing the appellant’s claim, and dismiss the respondent’s motion for summary 
  judgment.  In addition, the appellant is granted leave to amend his statement 
  of claim, if so advised.  The appellant is entitled to his costs of the motion 
  and the appeal.</p>
