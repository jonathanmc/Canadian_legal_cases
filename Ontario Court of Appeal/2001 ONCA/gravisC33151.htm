      <p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Helen 
        K. MacLeod, sitting without a jury, dated June 11, 1999 and from the sentence 
        imposed by Justice MacLeod dated March 10, 2000.</span></p>

        </span></span> <span> </span>The appellant’s counsel was critical of the 
        reasons of the trial judge in convicting the appellant.  He appeared to 
        think that there was an obligation on the trial judge to give herself 
        the same detailed instruction that would be required of her in charging 
        a jury.  We are aware of no such obligation.</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> The trial judge made a detailed summary of the witnesses’ 
        evidence <i>seriatim</i> and then made definite findings of fact relating 
        to the issues.  In doing so, she made no errors of law of any consequence 
        and we are not prepared to assume that she made errors in her thinking 
        that are not recorded in her reasons.  </p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appeal against conviction is dismissed.</span></p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> The trial judge sentenced the appellant to three years 
        in the penitentiary for sexual assault followed by two years of probation.  
        Despite the reference by the trial judge to the lack of remorse of the 
        appellant, we are not persuaded that the sentence of three years for sexual 
        assault was unfit.  As to the probation order which she imposed for the 
        common assault, the Crown concedes that a two-year probation order following 
        the sentence of three years is an illegal sentence.  We would impose a 
        sentence of six months for that assault and make it concurrent with the 
        three years to be served in the penitentiary.</p>
      <p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span></span> Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal 
        is allowed and the reference to the probation order is deleted.  In all 
        other respects, the appeal against sentence is dismissed.</p>
