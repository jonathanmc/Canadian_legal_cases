  February 9, 2001, upholding the appellant's conviction by Justice Vibert Lampkin 
  for breach of probation dated November 22, 1999.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant Raffaele Greco appeals from his 
  conviction on a charge of breach of probation. He seeks to have the conviction 
  overturned and an acquittal entered for two reasons. First, he submits that 
  he was not required to comply with the terms and conditions of his probation 
  order while outside of Canada. Second, he argues that even if he was required 
  to comply with his probation order while outside of Canada, s.&nbsp;6(2) of 
  the <i>Criminal Code</i> prevents him from being convicted because the offence 
  was committed in Cuba, not Canada. For reasons that follow, I would not give 
  effect to either argument and I would dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
<p><b><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND FACTS</span></b></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On December 28, 1998, the appellant and his 
  female companion, Trisha Smith, both residents of Ontario, travelled from Toronto 
  to Cuba for a one-week vacation. In the early morning hours of January 4, 1999, 
  the day of their scheduled return to Toronto, Mr.&nbsp;Greco viciously assaulted 
  Ms. Smith in a fit of jealous rage. The attack left Ms.&nbsp;Smith with grave 
  injuries to her face and head, including a fractured cheek bone and a deviated 
  nose.</span></p>
<p><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Manifestly, the assault was serious. If committed in Canada, 
  it would most likely have attracted a charge of aggravated assault punishable 
  by a term of imprisonment not exceeding fourteen years. As it is, the Cuban 
  authorities, though duly contacted by Ms.&nbsp;Smith, chose not to become involved.  
  Instead, they arranged for the police in Canada to meet the appellant and Ms. 
  Smith upon their return to Toronto later that day.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>After meeting with the police in Toronto, Ms. 
  Smith was advised that the appellant could not be charged with assault in Canada 
  because the physical attack upon her had occurred in Cuba. However, follow-up 
  investigation revealed that as of January 4, 1999, the date of the alleged assault 
  upon Ms.&nbsp;Smith in Cuba, the appellant was subject to a probation order 
  issued by a judge of the Ontario Court of Justice on May 7, 1997 following his 
  convictions for assault and threatening death. In accordance with s. 732.1(2)(a) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, a term of that order required that the appellant 
  keep the peace and be of good behaviour. Satisfied that his conduct in Cuba 
  amounted to a breach of that provision, the police laid an information against 
  the appellant on March 4, 1999, charging that:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Raffaele Greco, on or about the 4 day of January 1999, 
      at the country of Cuba, did while bound by a probation order made by Provincial 
      Court Regional Municipality of Peel, on the 7 day of May 1997, fail without 
      reasonable excuse to comply with such order, to wit keep the peace and be 
      of good behaviour, contrary to the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i> 733.1(1).</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The Crown elected to proceed by way of summary 
  conviction and the trial proceeded before Lampkin J. of the Ontario Court of 
  Justice. At his trial, the appellant moved to have the charge stayed on the 
  basis that the court lacked jurisdiction to try the offence. In a nutshell, 
  it was his position that since the conduct forming the alleged breach of probation 
  occurred in Cuba, a court in Ontario lacked jurisdiction to try the offence 
  in light of s. 6(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which reads:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>6.(2)  Subject to this Act or any other Act of Parliament, no person shall 
      be convicted or discharged under section 730 of an offence committed outside 
      Canada.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On May 21, 1999, Lampkin J. dismissed the motion 
  to stay for reasons reported at (1999) 136 C.C.C. (3d) 271. On November 22, 
  1999, following a trial on the merits, Lampkin J. found the appellant guilty 
  as charged. His reasons for conviction are reported at (1999) 141 C.C.C. (3d) 
  36. On December 2, 1999, the appellant was sentenced to nine months imprisonment 
  and probation for three years. In addition, a ten year prohibition order under 
  s. 110 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> was imposed. </span></p>

  appeal to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice and on February 9, 2001, MacKinnon 
  J. released written reasons reported at (2001) 152 C.C.C. (3d) 17, dismissing 
  his appeal from both conviction and sentence. On February 15, 2001, the appellant

  &lt;p style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Lampkin J. addressed this issue in his May 21, 
  1999 ruling. As his reasons indicate, he recognized that there were no authorities 
  directly on point and that &quot;this case is new&quot;. In the end however, 
  it was his considered opinion that probation orders, while in force, follow 
  probationers wherever they go:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the old common law there was a broad division of court orders into two 
      categories: orders <i>in rem</i> and orders <i>in personam</i>. Orders <i>in 
      rem</i> were orders that were applicable against the whole world. Thus decrees 
      of divorce which affected the status of the parties or orders of custody 
      were said to be orders <i>in rem</i>. Those were orders binding on the whole 
      world  By contrast, orders <i>in personam</i> were orders which affected 
      particular individuals. Thus an order for one spouse to pay maintenance 
      to the other was an order <i> in personam</i>. If the payor spouse left 
      Canada, it may be difficult to enforce the order in the absence of some 
      reciprocal enforcement of orders statute between Canada and that person's 
      new country of residence. But the order is extant and is enforceable if 
      the defaulter returns to Canada. A probation order made against a particular 
      individual is of the nature of an order <i>in personam.</i> It orders the 
      probationer to do or refrain from doing certain things. On this analysis, 
      I agree with the Crown that a probation order, while it is in force, follows 
      the probationer wherever he goes.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In his reasons for conviction dated November 
  22, 1999, Lampkin J. expanded somewhat on his earlier analysis as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US> Ordinarily, a citizen who is not subject to the terms 
      of a probation order need only observe the laws of a foreign country where 
      he happens to be. But a citizen in a foreign country who is obligated to 
      observe the terms of a probation order has a double obligation. He must 
      (a) observe the laws of the country where he happens to be; and (b) observe 
      the terms of the probation order. If he breaches the terms of the probation 
      order by committing an offence under <i>the law of Canada</i>, then he is 
      answerable for that breach in Canada.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><u><span lang=EN-US>Reasons of MacKinnon J. on appeal</span></u></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>MacKinnon J. agreed with Lampkin J. that probation 
  orders follow probationers wherever they go and that the terms and conditions 
  of such orders must be adhered to both at home and abroad:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span> </span> Breach of probation is a crime in Canada only because it 
      is prohibited by Canadian law. It is of consequence only to Canada as the 
      original sentencing jurisdiction. It is an order imposed as part of a criminal 
      sentence and is a means of maintaining control over an offender beyond the 
      sentencing date. It is logical that the issuing court maintain jurisdiction 
      to prosecute a breach regardless of where it was committed. The location 
      of the committing acts may make the proof in Canada more difficult, but 
      that is not the question. A probation order is an order in personam and 
      follows the probationer wherever she or he goes. Probation was a component 
      of the appellant's sentence and his sentence was not complete until he obeyed 
      the conditions for the duration of its term. The condition to keep the peace 
      and be of good behaviour meant that the appellant was not to violate any 
      law of Canada for the length of the probation order. It matters not whether 
      he is in Cuba or Germany - if he commits an offence which would be punishable 
      in Canada he may be  prosecuted for failure to keep the peace and be of 
      good behaviour. The trial judge correctly observed that placing a person 
      on probation requires that person to be subject to the criminal law of Canada, 
      and that a vacationing probationer is also required to observe the local 
      laws of the foreign state in which he finds himself. The probationer is 
      not free to disregard local laws, but rather faces the additional burden 
      of being subject to two sets of laws under which he must govern his conduct. 
      This interpretation demonstrates no disrespect for the laws of Cuba.</p>

<p><u><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></u></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The issue at hand is one of first impression. 
  I know of no authority directly on point. In the end, I believe that Lampkin 
  J. came to the correct conclusion.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>To begin, I know of no rule or principle of 
  international law that would deprive a judge of the Ontario or Superior Court 
  of Justice of jurisdiction to make a probation order binding the conduct of 
  a probationer both at home and abroad. To be sure, the principle of &quot;extraterritoriality&quot;, 
  which is defined by James R. Fox in <i>The Dictionary of International and Comparative 
  Law</i> (1997), at p. 47 as the &quot;operation of laws upon persons or rights 
  beyond the territorial limits of the state enacting such laws&quot;, may impact 
  on Canada's ability to enforce such orders.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For example, if a probationer commits a breach of the order while 
  abroad and fails or refuses to voluntarily return to Canada, then, absent a 
  right of extradition or some other co-operative arrangement with the foreign 
  state, Canada would likely be powerless to bring the offender to justice. Likewise, 
  if the &quot;offensive conduct&quot; abroad is conduct that the probationer 
  is required to engage in or refrain from under the laws of the foreign state, 
  prosecution in Canada could well constitute an affront to the requirements of 
  international comity and result in our courts declining jurisdiction.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> But these limitations on the ability of the court to enforce 
  its orders should not be confused with the jurisdiction of the court in the 
  first instance to prescribe orders that bind the conduct of probationers both 
  at home and abroad. In my view, the distinction is an important one and it is 
  essential to a proper understanding of the principle of territoriality. That 
  principle, sometimes referred to as the principle of &quot;the sovereign equality 
  of states&quot;, is succinctly summarized by Cory and Iacobucci JJ. at p. 17 
  of their majority opinion in <i>R. v. Cook</i> (1998), 128 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.):<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span> 
  [2] </span></a></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US> In essence, the principle of the sovereign equality 
      of states generally prohibits extraterritorial application of domestic law 
      since, in most instances, the exercise of jurisdiction beyond a state's 
      territorial limits would constitute an interference under international 
      law with the exclusive jurisdiction of another state.</span><span>                                                                       
      </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The principle of territoriality is also discussed 
  at some length by Bastarache J. in his concurring reasons in <i>Cook</i>. In 
  the course of that discussion, at pp. 55 and 56, he identifies and explains 
  the important distinction to which I have referred between &quot;jurisdiction 
  to enforce&quot; and &quot;jurisdiction to prescribe&quot;:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US>Any discussion of territoriality begins with the fundamental 
      distinction between a purported enforcement of domestic law in the territory 
      of a foreign state (jurisdiction to enforce), and an attempt to give effect 
      in domestic law to actions, people or things outside of the territory governed 
      by domestic law (jurisdiction to prescribe)</span></i><span lang=EN-US>. 
      Attempts to enforce domestic law directly in the territory of a foreign 
      state are prohibited in all but the most exceptional circumstances. In the 
      words of Professor Brownlie, discussing &quot;Extra-territortorial Enforcement 
      Measures&quot;:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span lang=EN-US>The governing principle is that a state cannot take 
          measures on the territory of another state by way of enforcement of 
          national laws without the consent of the latter. Persons may not be 
          arrested, a summons may not be served, police or tax investigations 
          may not be mounted, orders for production of documents may not be executed, 
          on the territory of another state, except under the terms of a treaty 
          or other consent given.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>See Ian Brownlie, <i>Principles of Public International 
      Law</i> (4<sup>th</sup> ed. 1990), p. 307. It was in this sense that the 
      Permanent Court of International Justice observed in <i>The case of the 
      S.S. &quot;Lotus&quot;</i> (1927), P.C.I.J. Ser. A, No. 9, pp. 18-19:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span
lang=EN-US>Now the first and foremost restriction imposed by international law 
          upon a State is that - failing the existence of a permissive rule to 
          the contrary - it may not exercise its power in any form in the territory 
          of another State. In this sense jurisdiction is certainly territorial; 
          it cannot be exercised by a State outside its territory except by virtue 
          of a permissive rule derived from international custom or from a convention.</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>But in the very next sentence, at p. 19, the International 
      Court makes it very clear that the term &quot;territoriality&quot; has an 
      entirely different meaning where a legal system merely purports to prescribe 
      effects within its own legal system to events taking place abroad:</span></p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i><span lang=EN-US>It does not, however, follow that international 
          law prohibits a State from exercising a jurisdiction in its own territory, 
          in respect of any case which relates to acts which have taken place 
          abroad, and in which it cannot rely on some permissive rule of international 
          law. Such a view would only be tenable if international law contained 
          a general prohibition to States to extend the application of their laws 
          and their jurisdiction of their courts to persons, property and acts 
          outside their territory, and if, as an exception to this general prohibition, 
          it allowed States to do so in certain specific cases. But this is certainly 
          not the case under international law as it stands at present.</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> Far from laying down a general prohibition to the effect that States 
          may not extend the application of their laws and the jurisdiction of 
          their courts to persons, property and acts outside their territory, 
          it leaves them in this respect a wide measure of discretion which is 
          only limited in certain cases by prohibitive rules; as regards other 
          cases, every State remains free to adopt the principles which it regards 
          as best and most suitable.</span></p>

  </span></span> Although Bastarache J. was speaking only for himself and Gonthier 
  J., I do not understand the majority to take exception with the general principles 
  outlined in the passage above. Those principles make it clear that subject to 
  certain limitations, a state can extend the application of its laws and the 
  jurisdiction of its courts to persons, property and acts outside of its territory 
  without offending against the principle of territoriality. That of course, explains 
  the various provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in which Canada has asserted 
  jurisdiction over persons who commit certain offences outside of Canada.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span> [3] </span></a> Those provisions are necessary because without 
  them, s. 6(2) of the <i>Code</i> would preclude convictions or findings of guilt 
  for offences committed outside of Canada. But for present purposes, just as 
  there is nothing in the principle of territoriality that prevents Canada from 
  enacting laws enforceable in Canada that govern the conduct of persons outside 
  of its territory, the principle of territoriality does not prevent courts from 
  issuing orders, enforceable locally, that govern conduct outside of Canada.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Nor does anything in the <i>Criminal Code</i>

  outside of Canada. Manifestly, in light of s. 6(2) of the <i>Code</i>, the fact 
  that probationers may be bound by the terms of their probation orders while 
  abroad will be of no consequence if it cannot otherwise be established that 
  the offence of breach of probation was committed in Canada. That however, is

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In support of his position that probation orders 
  only bind the conduct of probationers while in Canada and not elsewhere, the 
  appellant relies on s. 733.1(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which reads as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>An accused who is charged with an offence under subsection

      or is in custody, but where the place where the accused is found, is arrested 
      or is in custody is outside the province in which the offence is alleged 
      to have been committed, no proceedings in respect of that offence shall 
      be instituted in that place without the consent of the Attorney General 
      of that province.</span></p>

<p> <span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant submits that in enacting that 
  provision, Parliament showed deference to the principle of territoriality by 
  making it clear that probation orders are only meant to bind the conduct of 
  probationers in Canada and not elsewhere. With respect, I disagree with that 
  interpretation. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Section 733.1(2) does not speak one way or the 
  other to the question whether probation orders bind the conduct of probationers 
  while abroad as well as in Canada. Rather, it speaks to what court in Canada 
  has jurisdiction over an accused charged with breach of probation. In other 
  words, it deals with venue, not the reach of probation orders. The first part 
  of the provision simply reaffirms the common law principle that jurisdiction 
  is territorial and in the case of breach of probation, an offender may be tried 
  and punished by a court of competent jurisdiction &quot;in the place where the 
  offence is alleged to have been committed&quot;. The second part of the provision 
  broadens the jurisdictional ambit by providing that offenders can be tried and 
  punished for the offence of breach of probation by a court of competent jurisdiction 
  in any province where they are found, arrested or in custody, with the consent 
  of that province's Attorney General, even though the offence itself was not 
  committed in that province.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>There is nothing in s. 733.1(2) to suggest that 
  the offence is committed solely in the place where the conduct forming the breach 
  occurred. Indeed, if anything, I read s. 733.1(2) as recognizing, at least implicitly, 
  that the offence of breach of probation can be committed in more than one province, 
  including the province where the order is made and the province where the conduct 
  forming the breach occurred. For present purposes, however, suffice it to say 
  that just as s. 6(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is not dispositive of the issue 
  whether probation orders bind the conduct of probationers outside of Canada, 
  the same applies to s. 733.1(2) of the <i>Code.</i></span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It follows, in my view, that there is no basis 
  in international or domestic law for concluding that a judge of the Ontario 
  or Superior Court of Justice lacks the jurisdiction to issue a probation order, 
  enforceable in Canada, that binds the conduct of probationers both at home and 
  abroad. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Nor, in my view, are there policy reasons for 
  coming to a different conclusion. The notion that probationers are only bound 
  by the terms and conditions of their probation orders while in Canada and that 
  they can ignore or circumvent such orders with impunity by setting foot across 
  the border is one that I refuse to accept. Apart from being illogical, I can 
  see no justification for it once it is accepted that the requirements of comity 
  remain sacrosanct and that Canadian courts will decline jurisdiction in cases 
  where to do otherwise would result in a contravention of those requirements. 
  </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Policy considerations strongly favour an interpretation 
  that makes the order binding on probationers regardless of where they happen 
  to be. As this case vividly demonstrates, conduct outside of Canada in breach 
  of a probation order made in Canada can have a serious and immediate impact 
  within Canada. The treatment, protection and safety of the victim of this assault 
  who lives in Canada are legitimate concerns of the Canadian criminal justice 
  system. It is entirely consistent with those concerns that persons within the 
  reach of Canadian courts be held to account for breaching an order made in Canada.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> From a practical point of view, treating probation orders as 
  if they were light bulbs that can be switched on and off depending on the location 
  of the probationer, gives rise to logistical problems and fairness concerns. 
  If probation orders cease to apply to probationers when they cross the border, 
  then courts, probation officers and probationers alike would be faced with the 
  logistical nightmare of having to keep track of the precise number of days or 
  part days on which the order is operative and the days on which it is not.  
  In oral argument, counsel for the appellant conceded, correctly in my view, 
  that were a probationer only bound by a probation order when in Canada, then 
  the clock would stop ticking and the order would cease to run when the probationer 
  left Canada.</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Even more troublesome is the unfairness this 
  would occasion to those probationers who, for legitimate work, family or treatment 
  related reasons, are required to be outside of Canada during the period of probation. 
  If the appellant is right, such probationers, though in complete compliance 
  with the terms of their probation orders while outside of Canada, would nonetheless 
  receive no credit for such periods of time and the length of their probationary 
  period would be extended accordingly. For my part, I see no reason why compliant 
  probationers should be prejudiced in that way.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For these reasons, I am satisfied that the courts 
  of this province have the authority to make probation orders, enforceable locally, 
  that bind the conduct of probationers both at home and abroad. The only remaining 
  question is whether to be effective abroad, the probation order must contain 
  an express provision to that effect. In my view, it need not.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I think that a common sense inference can and 
  should be drawn that, subject to the requirements of comity, probation orders 
  are meant to apply to probationers at all times wherever they might be, absent 
  a specific term to the contrary. In this respect, I agree with Lampkin J. that 
  a probation order is an order made in respect of a particular individual and 
  so long as it remains in force, it attaches to that individual wherever he or 
  she may go.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The territorial reach of a probation order, 
  like any other court order, is a matter of interpretation. The language of the 
  order and the policies served by the order must be considered.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The order in the present case contains no reference 
  to its territorial scope. This silence provides no assistance as to the reach 
  of the order. There is no suggestion that the question of whether the order 
  should apply to conduct outside of Canada was canvassed when the order was made. 
  As there is no presumption that an order applies only to conduct within Canada, 
  the absence of any express reference in this probation order to its territorial 
  reach is not indicative of any limitation on that reach. Certainly, there is 
  nothing inherent in the nature of the term breached in this case (to keep the 
  peace and be of good behaviour) that would suggest a territorial limitation.</span></p>

  order while in Cuba. Accordingly, I would answer issue one in the affirmative.</span></p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The first link in the chain of events constituting the

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>MacKinnon J. agreed with Lampkin J. that &quot;the 
  Supreme Court decision in <i>Libman</i> governs the approach to territorial 
  jurisdiction&quot;. He then went on to explain why in his view, the facts of 
  this case satisfied the &quot;real and substantial link&quot; test identified 
  in <i>Libman</i>:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The appellant was placed on probation and signed the probation order 
      in Ontario before an Ontario court. Without that order there could be no 
      offence. It seems clear and obvious to me that only Ontario has a &quot;real 
      and substantial link&quot; to the offence. The case at bar does not raise 
      concerns about international comity given that Cuba could not have tried 
      the appellant for breaching a Canadian court order in the absence of reciprocal 
      enforcement of judgment legislation. In fact, the authorities in Cuba refused 
      to take any action with respect to the admitted behaviour of the appellant 
      and instead encouraged the victim to deal with the matter upon her return 
      to Canada.</span></p>
    <p><span>            </span>Canada has a legitimate interest in prosecuting 
      the breach in that Canada has an interest in upholding its own penal legislation. 
      The appellant's breaching acts in Cuba as directed at Trisha Smith may or 
      may not violate any Cuban law. However, in breaching his Ontario probation 
      order, the appellant violated the conditions of his Canadian sentence.</p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>. . .</span></p>
    <p><span>            </span>It could hardly be said that it would offend international 
      comity if the accused's breach of Canadian probation were to be prosecuted 
      in Canada in that it is not detrimental to the interests of Cuba to prosecute 
      the accused here in Canada for that offence. The appellant's failure to 
      keep the peace and be of good behaviour while in Cuba resulted in direct 
      harm to Trisha Smith while in Cuba and continuing on her return to Canada 
      during her recovery period. His actions in failing to keep the peace, construed 
      broadly, also bear on the integrity of the Canadian criminal justice system 
      as perceived both at home and abroad.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>It cannot be said that the charge of breach of 
      probation in Ontario would interfere with the sovereignty of Cuba by seeking 
      to prosecute and punish the appellant for conduct which has no connection 
      with Ontario. An Ontario Court made the order. The order was designed to 
      control the conduct of that Canadian who had been convicted of a violent 
      offence in Ontario. The breaching acts were perpetrated against another 
      Canadian citizen while the terms of the appellant's probation order continued 
      in effect.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>Libman, supra</i>, at p. 232, LaForest 
  J. summarized the approach to the limits of territoriality as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>As I see it, all that is necessary to make an offence 
      subject to the jurisdiction of our courts is that a significant portion 
      of the activities constituting that offence took place in Canada. As it 
      is put by modern academics, it is sufficient that there be a &quot;real 
      and substantial link&quot; between an offence and this country, a test well 
      known in public and private international law . . . [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Two additional passages from that decision assist 
  in fleshing out the meaning of the &quot;real and substantial link&quot; test 
  and the factors encompassed by it. The first is found at pp. 230-31:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Starting with <i>R. v. Ellis</i>, [1899] 1 Q.B. 230, in England, the 
      courts began to use another test: that an offence takes place where its 
      gist or gravamen occurs. This approach was particularly prevalent in Canada. 
      It is possible to explain many of the cases on this basis which, at a superficial 
      level, may seem rational. The location of the offence according to this 
      approach also corresponds to the place where the fruits of the wrongful 
      scheme are obtained, so one can easily be led into thinking that is where 
      the wrongful act takes place </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Sometimes the gist or gravamen test is associated (though the two may 
      be looked at separately) with the &quot;completion of the offence&quot; 
      or terminatory test, as in the present case, for example. This seems more 
      prevalent in England, at least in the eyes of some academics: see, for example, 
      Glanville Williams, <i>supra</i> [Professor Glanville Williams, &quot;Venue 
      and the Ambit of Criminal Law&quot; (1965), 81 L.Q.R. 266. That test may 
      have the advantage of removing criminal liability for acts that take place 
      after the offence as defined is completed, but it also has the result of 
      removing from consideration earlier acts constituting the offence, here 
      the fraudulent activities alleged to have occurred in Toronto.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>It also ignores the fact that the fruits of the transaction were obtained 
      in Canada as contemplated by the scheme. Their delivery here was not accidental 
      or irrelevant. It was an integral part of the scheme. While it may not in 
      strictness constitute part of the offence, it is, I think, relevant in considering 
      whether a transaction falls outside Canadian territory. <i>For in considering 
      that question we must, in my view, take into account all relevant facts 
      that take place in Canada that may legitimately give this country an interest 
      in prosecuting the offence. One must then consider whether there is anything 
      in those facts that offends international comity</i> [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><span lang=EN-US>The second is found at p. 232:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>            </span>Just what may constitute a real and substantial 
      link in a particular case, I need not explore. There were ample links here. 
      <i>The outer limits of the test may, however, well be coterminous with the 
      requirements of international comity</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In concluding, as I have, that the &quot;real 
  and substantial link&quot; test has been met in this case, I begin with the 
  observation that the requirements of comity, which LaForest J. believed might 
  &quot;well be coterminous&quot; with &quot;the outer limits of the test&quot;, 
  are not engaged at all on the facts of this case.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>From the outset, the Cuban authorities made 
  it clear that they had no interest in investigating or prosecuting the appellant 
  for his conduct in Cuba. Moreover, to state the obvious, there is no suggestion 
  from anyone that the appellant's violent conduct towards Ms. Smith was justified 
  or condoned, let alone required, under Cuban law; nor is there any evidence 
  that Cuba has ever registered a complaint with Canada over the prospect of the 
  appellant's prosecution in Canada for the offence of breach of probation.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>That, of course, only makes sense. Whereas Canada 
  has a vital interest in ensuring that orders made by Canadian courts are complied 
  with, Cuba has no such comparable interest. Indeed, absent some form of reciprocal 
  enforcement agreement, of which there is none here, I fail to see how Cuba would 
  have jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a probation order made by a Canadian 
  court even if of a mind to do so. </span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Once it is understood that Canada is the only 
  country that has an interest in ensuring compliance with orders made by Canadian 
  courts, little more need be said in terms of the &quot;real and substantial 
  link&quot; test. The probation order in the instant case was imposed upon the 
  appellant by an Ontario court. It required him to keep the peace and be of good 
  behaviour both at home and abroad. Importantly, the offence in issue arises 
  out of a breach of that order, a factor which I consider to be crucial in the 
  application of the &quot;real and substantial link&quot; test. To the extent 
  that he breached that order, Canada alone has an interest in bringing him to 
  justice and it may do so. The requirements of international comity do not dictate 
  otherwise.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Finally, there is no suggestion that the violent 
  assault on Ms. Smith did not constitute a breach of the term requiring the appellant 
  to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.</span></p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, I have no hesitation in concluding 
  that the offence of breach of probation was committed in Ontario and that s. 
  6(2) of the <i>Code</i> therefore has no application. It follows that the Ontario 
  Court of Justice had jurisdiction to try and to convict the appellant. </span></p>
<p style=' &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;tab-stops:list 18.0pt'> <span

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellant was bound by the terms and conditions 
  of his May 7, 1997 probation order when he violently assaulted Ms. Smith in 
  Cuba. This assault amounted to a breach of the term requiring him to keep the 
  peace and be of good behaviour. The offence was committed in Canada and there 
  are no comity requirements that would cause a Canadian court to decline jurisdiction.
