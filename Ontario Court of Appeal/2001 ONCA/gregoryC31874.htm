  </span></span> The respondent Walter Gregory asserted a claim for disability 
  benefits under an accident and sickness insurance policy issued by the appellant 
  Aetna.  The appellant purported to rescind the policy on grounds of material 
  misrepresentation.  The respondent brought this action for the policy benefits 
  and was successful after a nineteen-day trial.  The trial judge found that the 
  appellant had misrepresented material facts relating to his medical condition 
  and his income, but declined to make a finding of fraud.  The trial judge found 
  that as fraud had not been proved, the respondent was entitled to the benefit 
  of the “incontestability” clause, providing that in the absence of fraud, the 
  insurer cannot avoid the policy for misrepresentations after two years from 
  the application for insurance.  As a result, the respondent's claim for benefits 
  was allowed.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in several respects.  
  It argues that the trial judge failed to apply the proper test for civil fraud 
  and that had he done so, he would have found fraud entitling the appellant to 
  avoid the policy.  The appellant also submits that the respondent misrepresented 
  or failed to disclose facts when the policy was reinstated after having lapsed 
  for non-payment of premiums and that, as two years had not elapsed from the 
  date of reinstatement, the incontestability clause had no application.  Finally, 
  the appellant submits that the claim should have been dismissed on the ground 
  that the respondent was caught in a lie at trial on the issue of his disability.  
  The trial judge found that the appellant was gainfully employed for six months 
  during the period he claimed to be disabled from working.  The trial judge did 
  not disallow the claim on this ground, but reduced the benefits award by the 
  amount the respondent had earned.  The appellant submits that this was an error 
  of law and that the finding that the respondent was able to work when he claimed 
  he was disabled was fatal to his claim. </p>
<h3 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Facts</h3>
<p style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent took early retirement in October 1985 at age 51 
  from a large corporation.  He had a pension of approximately $40,000 and his 
  former employer hired him on a short-term contract basis to provide training 
  programs.  The respondent and two colleagues started their own company to carry 
  out this contract and to offer similar services to others.  The business was 
  unsuccessful and rather than earn income, the respondent suffered losses in 
  all years relevant to this action.  </p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1989, the respondent and his partners decided to obtain disability 
  insurance.  They applied for the insurance through Ron Jolley, a friend of one 
  of the appellant's partners.  Jolley had recently become an insurance agent, 
  selling the appellant's disability insurance products.  The respondent applied 
  for insurance in an amount sufficient to cover his mortgage and fixed living 
  expenses.  The first policy was issued in 1989, but it lapsed in October 1990.  
  The respondent applied for identical coverage that same month.  The policy was 
  delivered in January 1991 and came into effect in July 1991 when the first premium 
  was paid.  The policy lapsed for non-payment of premiums in March 1993, and 
  was reinstated on April 12, 1993 upon the respondent's application.  The respondent 
  completed a written application for reinstatement but the appellant's underwriter 
  did not require him to submit it. </p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found that the respondent had made material misrepresentations 
  on his applications for disability insurance in 1989 and 1990 with respect to 
  both his health and his income.  The respondent suffered from <i>genu varium</i>, 
  or bowed legs, causing uneven wear to his knee joints.  He had had surgery to 
  his left knee in 1985 and was advised that he would require surgery to his right 
  knee as well.  He suffered serious complications from the surgery to his left 
  knee and put off the surgery to his right knee.  The appellant required the 
  respondent to undergo a paramedical examination in December 1990 in connection 
  with his application for insurance.  The respondent disclosed that he had had 
  surgery to his left knee “due to cartilage problems” in 1985 and stated that 
  he had been “fine since”.  In fact, he had consulted a doctor with respect to 
  discomfort in his left knee in July 1990.  The respondent also described his 
  knee surgery as “cosmetic”. </p>
<p style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The misrepresentations with respect to the appellant's income 
  were more serious.  The respondent's income tax returns show that his business 
  venture lost money and that, during the entire period, he had no insurable earned 
  income.  On the 1989 application, he stated his earned income to be $100,000.  
  On the 1990 application, he stated his 1989 earned income to be $100,000 and 
  estimated his 1990 earned income to be $90,000.  In fact, the respondent's income 
  tax returns show that in 1989, he had no employment income and a net business 
  loss of $96,220.  Even after taking his pension income into account, he showed 
  a net income <i>loss</i> was $58,840.  In 1990, he earned no employment income, 
  showed a net business loss of $9,615 and, after taking his pension into account, 
  a net income <i>loss</i> of $440.  At no time from the date he applied for disability 
  insurance forward, including 1993 when he applied to have his policy reinstated 
  after it had lapsed, did the appellant have any insurable income.  His income 
  tax returns showed no income for employment for any year, and net losses in 
  every year. </p>
<p style='

  </span></span> In November 1993, the respondent underwent surgery on his right 
  knee to deal with the problem that had been identified in 1985.  Once again, 
  he suffered complications from the surgery.  A blood clot formed and further 
  surgery was required.  Since then, he has had what he claims to be disabling 
  difficulties with blood pressure, arthritis, and diabetes.  On February 15, 
  1994, he submitted a Statement of Accident or Illness to the appellant, claiming 
  benefits for the surgery under the policy.  The claim was originally approved 
  and benefits were paid.  A subsequent review by the appellant's claims department 
  revealed the medical information the respondent had failed to disclose at the 
  time of his application for insurance.  The appellant's claims officer ordered 
  that no further payments be made and by letter of May 4, 1994, advised the respondent 
  that his policy was “invalid in accordance with [its] General Provisions”.  
  The respondent pressed his claim for benefits, and the appellant countered that 
  Gregory had also misrepresented his income when applying for the insurance.<span style='text-transform:uppercase'></span></p>

  </span></span> At trial, the respondent submitted medical evidence of disability 
  and swore that he had not worked during the period for which he claimed disability 
  benefits.  The appellant led evidence to show that in fact the respondent had 
  worked for 6 months for which he had been paid approximately $18,000.<span style='text-transform:uppercase'></span></p>

  with “accident and sickness insurance” contains the following provisions under 
  the heading “misrepresentation and non-disclosure”.  The basic duty of disclosure

      if any, and in any written statements or answers furnished as evidence of 
      insurability, every fact within the person's knowledge that is material

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found that the respondent's misrepresentations 
  “as to health and income were material to the contract and might have been sufficient 
  grounds for rescission within two years, but not later.”  The trial judge held 
  that the incontestability clause applied, because more than two years had elapsed 
  from the date the policy came into effect and he was “not satisfied that Mr. 
  Gregory had any fraudulent intent at the time the insurance contract was made.”</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to health, the trial judge found that the failure 
  to disclose the 1990 visit to the Doctor “was not calculated to mislead or misrepresent.”  
  With respect to income, the trial judge found that the income information supplied 
  by the respondent was “wrong”.  The figure for income included pension income, 
  which is obviously not insurable as it is not lost upon disability.  The figure 
  also included an estimate of anticipated income.  The trial judge found that 
  “[a]t the time of the second application [in 1990], if not the first, his estimate 
  was optimistic, even unrealistic, given the apparent failure of the business 
  in whose name to policies were purchased.”  The trial judge also found that 
  it was clear that the appellant “would not have offered this policy if the application 
  had included the fact that there was no established history of earning in the 
  business [the respondent] was then engaged in.”  However, the trial judge declined 
  to make a finding of fraud against the respondent: “Nothing in the evidence 
  demonstrates that Mr. Gregory intended to defraud Aetna by means of these representations.”  
  In the absence of fraud, the trial judge found that the respondent was entitled 
  to the benefit of the two-year incontestability clause.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge rejected the appellant's contention that the 
  respondent had been guilty of misrepresentation when he applied for reinstatement 
  in 1993 after the policy had lapsed for non-payment of premiums.  This finding 
  was based on the fact that the appellant had not required a written application 
  from the respondent.  The trial judge's finding on this point was as follows: 
</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Section 310 [of the <i>Insurance Act</i>] speaks of a failure to disclose 
      or misrepresentation “at that time”, being the time of reinstatement.  I 
      interpret the policy provision as consistent with the section.  No statements 
      were made “at that time”, because [the appellant's underwriter] reinstated 
      the policy without requiring any.  A subsequent reinstatement does not restart 
      the time relative to statements made in the original application.”</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge also found that the respondent “was not truthful 
  when he testified that he had worked only as a volunteer since the onset of 
  his disability.”  Although he found that “this lack of candour before the court 
  is troubling”, he held that it did not defeat the claim under the policy, and 
  that the appropriate remedy was to reduce the claim by the amount the respondent 
  had been paid.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As a consequence of these findings, the trial judge awarded the 
  respondent damages in the amount of $154,633.50, and declared both that the 
  policy was valid and subsisting and that the appellant had been totally disabled 
  from November 24, 1993 to May 27, 1998.  The damages were reduced by $19,309.02, 
  the amount the appellant earned during the period he claimed to be disabled.  
  The appellant was also awarded pre-judgment interest.  As the trial judge found 
  that the appellant had made an unfounded allegation of fraud, the respondent 
  was also awarded solicitor and client costs.</p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>It is common ground between the 
  parties that the appropriate test for civil fraud to be applied here is that 
  stated by Lord Herschell in <i>Derry v. Peek</i> (1889), 14 A.C. 337 (H.L.) 
  at 374:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>. . . fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has 
      been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, 
      careless whether it be true or false.  Although I have treated the second 
      and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the 
      second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have 
      no real belief in the truth of what he states.  To prevent a false statement 
      being fraudulent, there must, I think, always be an honest belief in its 
      truth.  And this probably covers the whole ground, for one who knowingly 
      alleges that which is false, has obviously no such honest belief. Thirdly, 
      if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial.  
      It matters not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person 
      to whom the statement was made.</p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellant submits that the 
  trial judge failed to apply the third branch of this test relating to reckless 
  statements and that, had he done so, he would necessarily have found that the 
  respondent was reckless with respect to the truth of the representation he made 
  as to his income.</span></p>
<p style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge referred to a passage 
  from <i>Nuraney v. MBA Insurance Brokers Inc.</i>, [1989] I.L.R. 1-2439 (Ont. 
  S.C.), which in turn refers to <i>Derry v. Peek.</i>  However, in analyzing 
  the facts and making his findings, the trial judge made no reference to the 
  possibility of making a finding of fraud on the basis of recklessness.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have already noted, the trial judge found that the respondent's 
  estimate of income was “<i>unrealistic</i>”.  However, he rejected the allegation 
  of fraud on the basis that the respondent's misrepresentations were “<i>not 
  calculated</i> to mislead or misrepresent” and that “nothing in the evidence 
  demonstrates that Mr. Gregory <i>intended to defraud </i>Aetna by means of these 
  representations” (emphasis added).  The trial judge offered as a reason for 
  rejecting the allegation of fraud with respect to the misrepresentation as to 
  income the fact that the respondent “wanted coverage only in an amount sufficient 
  to cover certain fixed expenses, such as mortgage payments.”</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my respectful view, the trial judge erred both in fact and 
  in law in his treatment of the allegation of fraud.  I deal first with the facts.  
  While the respondent was estimating the income he would receive from his new 
  business venture in 1989, by the time he made the second application in 1990, 
  he must have known that he lost a significant sum in his business venture in 
  1989, yet he stated his income for that year to have been $100,000.  The trial 
  judge does not appear to have considered this point when he characterized all 
  the income figures as estimates.  In 1990 the respondent was not estimating 
  his 1989 income.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to the law, the trial judge's reasons show that 
  he failed to consider whether the appellant had made out a case of fraud on 
  the basis of recklessness.  While he referred to a case that in turn referred 
  to the test from <i>Derry v. Peek</i>, the reasons for judgment demonstrate 
  to my satisfaction that the trial judge simply did not take into account the 
  possibility that fraud could be made out if the respondent made misrepresentations 
  of material fact without regard to their truth.  The trial judge's reasons speak 
  only of an intention to defraud or of statements calculated to mislead or misrepresent.  
  He makes no reference to recklessness or to statements made without an honest 
  belief in their truth.  As <i>Derry v. Peek</i> holds, that state of mind is 
  sufficient proof of the mental element required for civil fraud, whatever the 
  motive of the party making the representation.  In another leading case on civil 
  fraud, <i>Edgington v. Fitzmaurice</i>, (1885), 29 Ch.D. 459 at 481-82 (C.A.), 
  Bowen L.J. stated: “[I]t is immaterial whether they made to statement knowing 
  it to be untrue, or recklessly, without caring whether it was true or not, because 
  to make a statement recklessly for the purpose of influencing another person 
  is dishonest.”  The failure to give adequate consideration to the contention 
  that the respondent had been reckless with the truth in regard to the income 
  figures he gave in order to obtain disability insurance constitutes an error 
  of law justifying the intervention of this court.</p>
<p style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The respondent points out that the agent Jolley did not complete 
  all the blanks on the application and did not require the respondent to provide 
  income figures from his income tax returns.  The appellant did not insist on 
  more information. However, the respondent cannot escape the consequence of the 
  seriousness of his misrepresentations on the basis that the appellant had the 
  responsibility to make inquiries and satisfy itself that the respondent had 
  supplied accurate income figures.  The admittedly casual approach of the appellant 
  must be considered in relation to grossly exaggerated income figures given by 
  the respondent.  An insured may not exaggerate his income and thereby shift 
  the burden of truthfulness into a burden on the insurer to make additional inquiries: 
  <i>Armstrong v. North West Life Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (1987), 34 D.L.R. 
  (4<sup>th</sup>) 757 at 767 (B.C. S.C.); <i>McArthur v. Prudential Life Insurance 
  Co. of America</i> (1969), 6 D.L.R. (3d) 477 at 483-84 (Ont. H.C.J).</p>

  </span></span> In view of the conclusion I have reached on the second ground 
  of appeal, it is not necessary for me to decide whether it would be appropriate 
  for this court to substitute a finding of fraud or order a new trial on this 
  first ground of appeal.  I would note, however, that there was a considerable 
  body of evidence that would support a finding a fraud.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, the trial judge described the respondent’s estimate of 
  income as “unrealistic”.  Given the obvious importance of representations regarding 
  income in an application for disability insurance, a finding that an applicant 
  for insurance gave an “unrealistic” estimate comes very close to a finding of 
  recklessness.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the respondent's income figures were not just wrong in 
  detail, they were wildly wrong.  They presented the picture of a man in a business 
  that earned him a very substantial income, whereas in truth the respondent was 
  losing a very substantial amount of money and had no income to insure.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Third, the record reveals a remarkable pattern of lack of candour 
  and deception by the respondent with regard to his dealings with the appellant 
  and other insurers.  In addition to the misrepresentations of health and income 
  on the application, the respondent lied to the court regarding his employment 
  during the period for which he claimed disability benefits.  While the appellant 
  did not require a written application for reinstatement in 1993, it was revealed 
  at trial that the respondent had in fact completed a written application for 
  reinstatement, again misstating his income, at a time when there could have 
  been no doubt about the failure of his business.  It was also shown at trial 
  that while he was claiming disability benefits from the appellant, he completed 
  no fewer than five new applications for insurance with other companies.  Three 
  of these applications were for life insurance and two were for disability insurance.  
  All five contained serious misrepresentations with respect to the respondent's 
  health or income. </p>
<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent2 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Issue 
  2:    Did the trial judge err in failing to find misrepresentation sufficient 
  to avoid the policy with respect to the application for reinstatement?</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When the respondent applied for reinstatement of the policy in 
  1993 after it had lapsed for non-payment of premiums, he had no insurable income.  
  He did not disclose that fact to the appellant.  Both s. 310 of the <i>Insurance 
  Act</i> and the policy itself expressly provide that the obligation to disclose 
  material facts and the two-year incontestability period apply to reinstatements 
  of insurance policies.  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in 
  law in failing to find that the respondent either failed to disclose or misrepresented 
  facts sufficient to avoid the policy when he applied for renewal of the policy 
  in 1993.  The respondent submits that the trial judge correctly concluded that 
  as the appellant did not require a written application, there was no misrepresentation 
  and that the respondent was under no obligation to disclose the truth about 
  his income.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I agree with the trial judge that reinstatement of the policy 
  does not restart the time under the incontestability clause with respect to 
  the original application for insurance.  The more difficult issue is whether 
  the respondent was under a positive duty to disclose the fact that he had no 
  insurable income, or whether the appellant effectively waived any obligation 
  of disclosure by not insisting upon a written application.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There appears to be no decided case directly on point.  <i>Ipapo</i> 
  v.<i> The Citadel Life Insurance Co.</i>, [1989] I.L.R. 1-2449 (Man. C.A.) dealt 
  with a life insurance policy that had lapsed for non-payment.  The insured warranted 
  in a reinstatement application that she was in good health, despite having gone 
  through treatment for cancer the previous year.  The insured died within two 
  years of the reinstatement, and the insurance company denied liability to pay 
  the insurance money to the beneficiaries on the grounds of material misrepresentation.  
  Twaddle J.A. recalled that “at common law an insurer had a right to avoid a 
  policy on discovering that the insured had misrepresented, or failed to disclose, 
  a material fact in the application for insurance.”  He then examined the provisions 
  of the Manitoba Act (essentially the same as those in Ontario’s), and held that 
  the statutory duty was the same as that at common law.  Regarding the running 
  of the two-year incontestability period, Twaddle J.A. held that “the insurer 
  has two years from reinstatement within which to avoid the policy for misrepresentation 
  or non-disclosure in the application for reinstatement.”</p>
<p style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Similarly, in <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>Eaton/Bay Life Assurance Co</i>. 
  (1984), 3 O.A.C. 238, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [1984] 1 S.C.R. ix, 
  this court dealt with misrepresentations in a written application for reinstatement.  
  Thorson J.A. held:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he finding made by the trial judge, that the medical information which 
      was later obtained by the insurer was material to the risk sought to be 
      insured and would “in all likelihood” have resulted in a refusal to reinstate 
      the policy had it been known at the time, leaves me with no choice but to 
      conclude that the insured, by not answering the question as she should have, 
      failed to disclose facts material to the insurance.  This being the case, 
      the appellant insurer was entitled to treat the contract as voidable within 
      the two-year period referred to in the “incontestability” clause in the 
      policy, and thus to void the contract as, in fact, it did.</p>

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In both <i>Ipapo</i> and <i>Johnson</i>, reference is made to 
  the insured's failure to disclose, but in both judgments the obligation was 
  being considered in relation to a written application for reinstatement.  To 
  determine whether there is an obligation to disclose material facts where no 
  written application is required, it is necessary to turn to first principles.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The duty of an insured to make full disclosure of material facts 
  is a well-established principle of insurance law.  It is discussed in relation 
  to disability insurance by M. G. Baer, <i>Study Paper on the Legal Aspects of 
  Long-Term Disability Insurance </i>(Toronto: Ontario Law Reform Commission, 
  1996) at p. 5, where Baer writes [emphasis added]:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Disability insurance contracts like other insurance contracts are said 
      to be contracts of the utmost good faith. … <i>Utmost good faith involves</i> 
      not only an obligation on the insured not to misrepresent his or her situation, 
      but also <i>a positive obligation on the insured to volunteer information 
      which the reasonable insurer would consider relevant in assessing the risk</i>.  
      In spite of its name, the requirement goes beyond a general standard of 
      honesty and fair dealing.  Over the years it has developed into a requirement 
      which extends beyond the actual or reasonable expectation of the insured 
      and failure to meet it results in the severe penalty of forfeiture of any 
      claim under the policy.</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>…</span></p>
    <p>The requirement of the utmost good faith requires the insured to disclose 
      to the insurer all material facts.  <i>The onus is on the insured to disclose 
      these facts on his or her own initiative whether or not the insurer has 
      inquired about them.</i></p>

  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Similarly, Craig Brown, <i>Insurance 
  Law in Canada</i>, looseleaf, vol. 1 (Toronto: Carswell, 1999) at p. 5-2, states:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>A person applying for insurance must disclose all matters within his/her 
      personal knowledge which are relevant in determining the nature and extent 
      of the risk.  The duty applies even in the absence of questions from the 
      insurer.  (Footnotes omitted)</p>

  </span></span> While this passage addresses the original application for coverage, 
  Brown states in vol. 2, at pp. 16-23 and 16-24, with respect to reinstatements, 
  that: “[p]olicies of accident and sickness insurance often lapse and are then 
  reinstated.  The insurer may void the policy for a misrepresentation or non-disclosure 
  made <i>at the time of the reinstatement</i>, but the incontestability provision 
  applies after two years pass.”  (Emphasis in original.) </p>
<p style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Richard Hayles, <i>Disability 
  Insurance: Canadian Law and Business Practice</i> (Carswell: Scarborough, 1998) 
  at p. 142, is clear on the point: </span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Most insurers ask insureds to submit a new application, including written 
      evidence of insurability, as a condition of reinstatement.  Even if this 
      is not done, however, <i>the insured would be subject to a duty of disclosure 
      at the time of the reinstatement</i>, and the insurer could avoid liability 
      for a failure on the part of the insured to make full disclosure of any 
      health problems existing at the reinstatement date.  (Emphasis added)</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I will explain below, the failure of an insurer to insist 
  upon a written application may have some significance.  However, I do not accept 
  the submission of the respondent that an insured is entirely absolved of the 
  obligation of good faith where the insurer does not insist upon a written application.   
  It would, in my view, be inconsistent with the terms of the statute and with 
  basic common law insurance principles to allow an insured to withhold material 
  facts that plainly bear upon insurability.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In some cases, there may be a question about whether a fact must 
  be disclosed.  In the present case, no such doubt arises.  The respondent had 
  not earned any income for at least four years before he applied for reinstatement 
  and he had no realistic prospect of earning income in the near future.  On the 
  facts of the present case, it is unnecessary to determine the full extent of 
  an insured's obligation to disclose facts when seeking reinstatement.  Here, 
  we are dealing with one of the most basic facts of insurability for disability.  
  Where, as in the present case, an insured is in possession of facts that any 
  reasonable person would know could make him or her uninsurable, there is a duty 
  to disclose those facts even if the insurer does not ask for a written application.  
  To put the point in a slightly different way, where one applies for reinstatement 
  of a disability insurance policy, there is an implicit representation that one 
  is at the very least insurable, in other words, that one is earning income that 
  can be insured, whether or not the insurer asks for a written application.</p>
<p style='
'> <span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The significance of the insurer not insisting upon a written 
  application, in my view, is similar to the failure of an insurer to ask a question 
  on the application.  As Brown points out, at 5-4, the insurer's failure to inquire 
  may provide evidence that the insurer does not consider the information relevant.  
  Similarly, where the insurer does not insist upon a written application for 
  reinstatement, any doubt regarding the materiality of undisclosed facts will 
  be resolved in favour of the insured.  No such doubt arises in the present case.</p>
<p style='

style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge erred in rejecting 
  the appellant's claim of entitlement to avoid the policy on the ground that 
  the respondent had failed to disclose material facts on his application for 
  reinstatement in 1993.  As the misrepresentation or failure to disclose was 
  within two years of the date of the reinstatement of the policy, the incontestability 
  clause has no application and it is unnecessary for the appellant to prove fraud.  
  On this basis, the policy is voidable, and the appellant is not obliged to pay 
  the benefits claimed by the respondent.</p>
