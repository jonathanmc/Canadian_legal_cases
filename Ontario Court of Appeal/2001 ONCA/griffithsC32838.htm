style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> John Griffiths sued his solicitor, Frank Zambosco, alleging negligence 
  in respect of a vendor take back mortgage to Griffiths and his then-wife, Amy 
  Griffiths, now known as Irmgard Catherine Sloan, (“Sloan”).  When Sloan refused 
  to join in Griffiths’ action as a plaintiff, Griffiths added her as a defendant 
  under Rule 5.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  
  Sloan then counterclaimed against Griffiths for occupation rent for Griffiths’ 
  occupation of the parties’ matrimonial home.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Griffiths’ claim against Zambosco and Sloan’s counterclaim against Griffiths 
  were tried by MacKenzie J.  In reasons delivered July 16, 1999, the trial judge 
  concluded that Zambosco was negligent in his work as Griffiths’ and Sloan’s 
  solicitor.  He held that Zambosco was required to pay compensatory damages to 
  both Griffiths and Sloan, which he assessed at $297,434.  He also found that 
  Griffiths was liable to Sloan for occupation rent subject to certain credits, 
  or “chargebacks”, including an $89,000 credit for three judgment debts against 
  Sloan that Griffiths purchased from the judgement creditors for $89,000, but 
  whose face value at the time was $151,000.  Having given Griffiths an $89,000 
  credit referable to the three judgments Griffiths purchased, the trial judge 
  then extinguished Griffiths’ rights against Sloan as assignee of the judgment 
  debts and ordered that the executions filed against her be lifted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I note here that the August 19, 1999 trial judgment as issued and entered 
  requires that Zambosco pay each of Griffiths and Sloan $297,434 (see paras. 
  5 and 6 of the judgment).  The trial judge’s comments and reasons are somewhat 
  confusing on the issue of the quantum of the damages caused by Zambosco’s negligence.  
  In his September 10, 1999 supplementary endorsement at paragraph 19, he referred 
  to the $297,494 as “… representing [Sloan’s] share of the damages award”.  However, 
  while the trial judge clearly meant to award damages to Sloan, it does not appear 
  to me that he in fact intended to award each of Griffiths and Sloan $297,494.  
  When the actual numbers are examined, the total loss caused by Zambosco’s negligence, 
  as found by the trial judge, was $297,494.  Indeed, when Griffiths and Zambosco 
  were debating how much interest Zambosco should pay, the trial judge adopted 
  Griffiths’ position and assessed total damages for Zambosco’s negligence at 
  $297,494.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judgment gives rise to two appeals.  First, Zambosco appeals 
  from the trial judge’s finding of solicitor’s negligence.  He further takes 
  issue with the quantum of the damages assessed by the trial judge on the ground 
  that the damages were not foreseeable.  Finally, he appeals from the trial judge’s 
  finding that Zambosco was required to pay damages to Sloan who chose not to 
  join in Griffiths’ action against him. Second, Griffiths appeals from the trial 
  judge’s finding that Griffiths was liable to Sloan for occupation rent.  Assuming 
  that Griffiths was liable to pay occupation rent, he appeals from the trial 
  judge’s related declaration extinguishing Griffiths’ rights against Sloan as 
  assignee of the three judgments against her. </p>
<p class=headingtitle><b>The Evidence</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Zambosco is a solicitor who practises in Oakville.  He is married to 
  Sloan’s sister.  Griffiths is a chartered accountant who was married to Sloan 
  at the time of the alleged negligence by Zambosco.  In May 1988, Griffiths and 
  Sloan agreed to sell an investment property that they owned jointly (the “Lakeshore 
  property”) for $800,000.  The agreement of purchase and sale (the :agreement”) 
  provided that $550,000 of the $800,000 purchase price would be paid by way of 
  a vendor take back mortgage bearing interest at 10% and having a five-year term.  
  The agreement also provided that the vendor take back mortgage would become 
  “due and payable” on any resale of the Lakeshore property, or on the demolition 
  of the building located on the property.  I will refer to this clause in the 
  agreement and mortgage back as the “due on sale” clause.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The vendor take back mortgage to Griffiths and Sloan jointly was registered 
  when the Lakeshore property deal closed on August 3, 1988.  By that time, Griffiths 
  and Sloan had separated.  The mortgage back was prepared by the purchaser’s 
  solicitors and submitted to Zambosco for his approval.  It contained a demolition 
  provision requiring the purchaser to reduce the principal of the mortgage by 
  $50,000 in the event that the building on the property was demolished.  The 
  mortgage did not include the due on sale provision contained in the agreement.  
  Zambosco testified that the purchaser, Peros, had requested or demanded that 
  the mortgage back not include the due on sale clause, and that the demolition 
  clause be modified.  The critical factual issue at trial was whether Zambosco 
  had instructions from Griffiths to delete the due on sale clause from the mortgage.  
  Zambosco testified that he did receive those instructions.  Griffiths testified 
  that he gave no such instructions to Zambosco.  Griffiths acknowledged that 
  to accommodate the purchaser’s concerns he agreed to change the demolition clause 
  in the agreement, which had provided that if the building on the property were 
  demolished, the mortgage would become due and payable.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his reporting letter to Griffiths and Sloan dated September 29, 1988, 
  Zambosco made specific reference to the revised demolition provision in the 
  vendor take back mortgage.  His letter did not refer to the deletion of the 
  due on sale clause from the mortgage.  Nor did it mention any instructions Zambosco 
  said he received from Griffiths on that subject. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>  A copy of the vendor take back mortgage was sent to Griffiths and Sloan 
  along with Zambosco’s reporting letter.  Griffiths testified that he did not 
  examine the mortgage back or turn his mind to the due on sale clause.  He simply 
  assumed that the due on sale clause was included in the mortgage.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As it turned out, there were two subsequent sales of the Lakeshore property, 
  either one of which would have triggered the due on sale clause had it been 
  made part of the mortgage.  After the sale to Peros, the subsequent sales of 
  the Lakeshore property were:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>First sale - from Peros to Quin Que Enterprises on December 15, 1988 for 
      $1,275,000;</p>
    <p>Second sale – from Quin Que to Oaklake Properties Ltd. on June 1, 1989 
      for $1,500,000.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Shortly before the first resale of the Lakeshore property, the purchaser’s 
  solicitors asked for a mortgage statement for assumption purposes.  Zambosco 
  prepared the statement and on November 2, 1988 wrote to the original purchaser’s 
  solicitors about the absence of a due on sale provision in the vendor take back 
  mortgage.  He characterized that absence as a “conveyancing error”.  This is 
  inconsistent with his trial evidence in which he clearly stated that he had 
  allowed the due on sale provision to be deleted on Griffiths’ instructions.  
  Griffiths testified that he was not aware of Zambosco’s November 2, 1988 letter, 
  or the mortgage statement Zambosco prepared.  Indeed, he said that in November 
  1988, “… I didn’t even know there was a sale happening”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Griffiths testified that he learned of the first resale of the Lakeshore 
  property in early January 1989.  He telephoned Zambosco on January 4, 1989 and 
  Zambosco told him that the mortgage was not assumable.  Griffiths then checked 
  “the documents” and telephoned Zambosco again on January 10, 1989.  Zambosco 
  said that he would try to collect the mortgage debt in full from the purchaser, 
  Peros.  If that could not be done, he said he would find out who bought the 
  Lakeshore property and obtain post-dated cheques and proof of insurance from 
  the new purchaser.  Griffiths did not put Zambosco on notice of any claim based 
  on solicitor’s negligence that Griffiths might have had against Zambosco because 
  of the missing due on sale provision.  Nor did he do anything to suggest that 
  he was waiving any claim against Zambosco.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In May 1989, Griffiths learned that the second purchaser, Quin Que, 
  was about to sell the Lakeshore property to Oaklake.  After the second resale, 
  he met with his Toronto solicitors who were dealing with his family law problems.  
  In the course of those discussions, Griffiths’ Toronto solicitors were made 
  aware of the vendor take back mortgage and Griffiths’ 50 percent interest in 
  it.  This interest was recorded on Griffiths’ net family property statement.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Griffiths continued to cash monthly mortgage cheques from the Lakeshore 
  property’s new owner, Oaklake which had purchased the property on June 1, 1989.  
  In July and September 1990, the monthly mortgage cheques were returned NSF.  
  Griffiths spoke to Zambosco and in accordance with Griffiths’ instructions Zambosco 
  requested replacement cheques from Oaklake.  Once again, Griffiths did not put 
  Zambosco on notice of any claim based on Zambosco’s solicitor’s negligence.  
  Nor did he do anything to suggest that he was waiving any claim he might have 
  had.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After the sale of the Lakeshore property by Griffiths and Sloan closed 
  in August 1988, Zambosco did not bill either Griffiths or Sloan for any of his 
  post-closing services in respect of the vendor take back mortgage.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By February 1991, the building on the Lakeshore property was boarded 
  up and the mortgage was in default.  Griffiths told Zambosco that “it was also 
  [Zambosco’s] problem” and that “all three of us were in trouble”.  Griffiths 
  also instructed Zambosco to commence power of sale proceedings.  By the time 
  the property was sold under power of sale, the real estate market had collapsed.  
  When all relevant expenses were taken into account, Griffiths’ and Sloan’s recovery 
  on the mortgage was $297,434 less than what was owing on the vendor take back 
  mortgage.  The trial judge assessed the damages caused by Zambosco’s negligence 
  in that amount.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Griffiths sued Zambosco for solicitor’s negligence.  Sloan chose not 
  to join in the action, in part because Zambosco was her brother-in-law.  When 
  she refused to join him as a plaintiff in his action against Zambosco, Griffiths 
  moved under Rule 5.03 to add Sloan as a defendant.  He did this to ensure recovery 
  of the equalization payment Sloan owed him.  Under the terms of their family 
  law settlement, Sloan owed Griffiths an equalization payment of $197,033.86.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  Assuming that he 
  would have problems collecting from Sloan, Griffiths attempted to ensure that 
  Sloan would recover damages against Zambosco for Zambosco’s alleged solicitor’s 
  negligence by bringing Sloan into the action.  Griffiths’ strategy was to then 
  apply Sloan’s recovery from Zambosco to her equalization payment debt.</p>

  </span> Griffiths learned about the three judgments against Sloan when he and 
  Sloan were in Zambosco’s office in March 1992 to discuss aspects of their family 
  law problems.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> By April 1992, the three judgment creditors had filed executions against 
  Sloan’s assets, including her interest in the matrimonial home.  At that time, 
  the three judgment debts totalled $151,000.  Between October 1994 and February 
  1998 Griffiths, through third party intermediaries, obtained assignments of 
  the three judgments.  No issue is taken with the validity of these assignments, 
  although Sloan does question Griffiths’ surreptitious approach in obtaining 
  them.  </p>

  </span> Once Sloan realized that Griffiths had obtained assignments of the three 
  judgments, she counterclaimed against Griffiths for occupation rent.  Her claim 
  was based on Griffiths’ rent-free occupation of the matrimonial home from June 
  1992 to the date of trial.  In her counterclaim, she also sought an order for 
  the judicial sale of the matrimonial home.  </p>

  </span> The trial judge found that Zambosco was negligent for failing to ensure 
  that the due on sale clause was included in the vendor take back mortgage.  
  He rejected Zambosco’s evidence that Griffiths instructed him to delete the 
  due on sale clause from the mortgage.  He assessed the damages caused by Zambosco’s 
  negligence at $297,494.58, plus prejudgment interest.  In his reasons released 
  on July 16, 1999, he found that Sloan was entitled to occupation rent of $156,000 
  less “chargebacks” of $143,429, for a net occupation rent entitlement of $12,570.  
  The “chargebacks” included the $89,000 Griffiths paid to obtain the assignments 
  from Sloan’s judgment creditors.  On September 10, 1999, after hearing counsel’s 
  submissions, the trial judge reduced Sloan’s occupation rent entitlement by 
  50 percent, but left the credits against occupational rent intact.  He also 
  declared that since Griffiths had received a credit against occupation rent 
  for the full amount that he paid for the three judgments against Sloan, the 
  three judgments were therefore satisfied and the “executions shall be removed 
  from title”.  I will refer to this aspect of the occupation rent issue shortly.</p>

  </span> As I have said, Zambosco appeals from the trial judge’s finding of solicitor’s 
  negligence and from his assessment of damages which Zambosco contends was excessive.  
  He further submits that the trial judge erred in awarding damages to Sloan in 
  light of the fact that she chose not to sue him.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> Griffiths appeals from the trial judge’s finding that he pay occupation 
  rent to Sloan and from the trial judge’s further order that once Griffiths received 
  a credit against occupation rent equal to the amount he paid to obtain assignments 
  of the three judgments, the three judgment debts were extinguished.  Griffiths 
  submits that as an assignee of the three judgments, he should be able to collect 
  the face value of the judgments from Sloan less, of course, the $89,000 for 
  which he had already been given a credit.  In March 1999 the three judgments 
  against Sloan had a face value of $371,156.</p>

  </span> In support of his submission that the trial judge’s finding of solicitor’s 
  negligence is in conflict with a “preponderance” of the evidence, Zambosco points 
  to various features of the evidence which he contends the trial judge ignored.  
  I see no need to review the evidence upon which Zambosco relies.  The critical 
  issue at trial in respect of the solicitor’s negligence claim was the credibility 
  of Zambosco and Griffiths and the reliability of their evidence on the factual 
  issue whether Griffiths did nor did not give instructions to Zambosco to delete 
  the due on sale clause from the mortgage.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In finding against Zambosco on the critical issue of credibility, the 
  trial judge attached considerable weight to Zambosco’s November 2, 1988 letter 
  to the purchaser’s solicitor.  In that letter Zambosco referred to the failure 
  to include the due on sale clause in the mortgage as a “solicitor’s error”.  
  The trial judge concluded that Zambosco’s November 2<sup>nd</sup> letter was 
  inconsistent with his trial evidence.  He said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>If Griffiths had given the instructions alleged by Zambosco, it is untenable 
      that Zambosco would have written this letter;  there would have been no 
      reason to write this letter.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge rejected Zambosco’s explanation for the letter and found 
  that Griffiths did not instruct Zambosco to delete the due on sale clause from 
  the mortgage.  He reviewed the duty of care that Zambosco owed Griffiths and 
  Sloan as their solicitor as well as the applicable standard of care.  He then 
  concluded that Zambosco was negligent for permitting the Lakeshore property 
  sale to close and the vendor take back mortgage to be registered without the 
  due on sale provision in it.</p>

  </span> In the absence of a palpable or overriding error, this court will not 
  interfere with findings of fact made by a trial judge.  It is not the function 
  of an appellate court to substitute its views on factual matters for the views 
  of the trial judge.  See <i>Equity Waste Management of Canada v. Halton Hills 
  (Town)</i> (1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.) and <i>Gottardo Properties (Dome)

  </span> I agree with the trial judge that Zambosco owed a duty of care to Griffiths 
  and Sloan and, in light of the trial judge’s findings of fact, that he breached 
  that duty.  Common sense and the expert evidence support those findings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, the trial judge did not err in his assessment of the evidence.  
  He was entitled to conclude that Zambosco’ November 2<sup>nd</sup> letter was 
  inconsistent with Zambosco’s trial evidence and to reject Zambosco’s explanation 
  for writing the letter.  I see no merit in Zambosco’s appeal on the issue of 
  liability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Zambosco further submits that after it was discovered, Griffiths waived 
  the error in the vendor take back mortgage and instead chose to look to the 
  new owners for payment of the mortgage debt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> One of the problems with Zambosco’s waiver submission is that he did 
  not plead waiver in his statement of defence.  On his appeal, he brought a motion 
  to amend his statement of defence so that waiver would be a live issue.  I do 
  not think it is necessary to specifically deal with that motion.  Waiver can 
  only arise where the evidence demonstrates that the party allegedly waiving 
  a right has full knowledge of that right and evinces an unequivocal and conscious 
  intention to abandon it.  See <i>Saskatchewan River Bungalows Ltd. v. Maritime 
  Life Assurance Co.</i>,<i> </i>[1994] 2 S.C.R. 490.  On the evidence it cannot 
  be said that Griffiths by his conduct, waived any rights he had against Zambosco.  
  In my opinion, taken at its highest, the evidence on which Zambosco relies does 
  not support a finding that Griffiths waived Zambosco’s conveyancing error and 
  decided to look for payment to the subsequent purchasers of the property instead.  
  Both Griffiths and Zambosco hoped that they could wait out the five-year mortgage 
  term without there being any loss on the mortgage.  The purchase prices on the 
  two subsequent resales supported Griffiths’ and Sloan’s assumption that they 
  had a substantial equity cushion. This “wait it out” approach, an approach Zambosco 
  seems to have supported, does not constitute waiver by Griffiths of his rights 
  against Zambosco on the issue of damages.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Zambosco’s submissions on the issue of damages centre mainly on the 
  issue of foreseeability.  In particular, Zambosco submits that the loss which 
  eventually occurred was not foreseeable when the due on sale clause was not 
  incorporated in the mortgage back.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge assessed the damages on the premise that, had the due 
  on sale provision been included in the mortgage when the Lakeshore property 
  was eventually sold under power of sale there would have been no loss, since 
  the mortgage would have been paid out in December 1998 when Peros sold the property 
  to Quin Que.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial, Zambosco challenged some of Griffiths’ interest calculations, 
  but he did not take issue with the method by which the damages were quantified.  
  I do not think that it is appropriate at this stage to attempt to introduce 
  a new method of assessing damages when the trial judge was given no real option 
  on this issue.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, it was foreseeable in this case that there might have been 
  some loss if the due on sale provision as contained in the agreement was not 
  included in the mortgage.  This is not a case where a solicitor’s negligence 
  led to a series of losses, with the result that foreseeability became a live 
  issue.  See <i>Kienzle v. Stringer</i> (1981), 35 O.R. (2d) 85 (Ont. C.A.).  
  I see no merit in Zambosco’s submissions on the issue of damages.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The most difficult issue on Zambosco’s appeal concerns Sloan’s judgment 
  against Zambosco.  Griffiths’ claim against Zambosco was based in negligence 
  arising out of an error made in the preparation and eventual registration of 
  the vendor take back mortgage.  It was not a claim under the mortgage itself.  
  In my opinion, the critical issue is therefore not the determination of the 
  total loss, which would of course include Sloan’s 50 percent interest in it.  
  Rather, the issue is who Zambosco should be required to compensate for his negligence, 
  and in what amount. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I have said, Sloan chose not to sue Zambosco.  Nor did she counterclaim 
  against him once Griffiths added her as a defendant.  The issue whether a person 
  who has not sued a defendant could nonetheless obtain judgment was considered 
  by the B.C. Court of Appeal, albeit in a quite different factual context, in 
  <i>337965 B.C. Ltd. v. Tackama Forest Products Ltd.</i> (1992), 91 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  129 at 189.  In that case partners in a venture financed by a limited partnership 
  brought an action to force a cash distribution.  Five limited partners chose 
  not to join in the action but were brought in as defendants, apparently on the 
  theory that since all of the limited partners were “joint contractors”, all 
  of them had to be in the action before any of them could succeed.  Southin J.A. 
  disagreed.  She concluded that the five limited partners who chose not to sue 
  could not obtain judgment in their favour.  She said at p. 189:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The question for us is whether these defendants [the five limited partners 
      who chose not to sue] could obtain judgment in this proceeding.  I think 
      not.  <u>I know of no authority for the proposition that judgment can be 
      given in favour of one defendant against another when the first defendant 
      has made no direct claim against the other on the pleadings.</u>  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with Southin J.A. that a party who has not sought relief in 
  the relevant pleadings cannot obtain a judgment.  In the circumstances of this 
  case, quite apart from the pleadings issue, I do not think that it follows that 
  because Zambosco breached the duty he owed to his client Griffiths, he also 
  breached the duty he owed to Sloan who held the mortgage back jointly with Griffiths.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A solicitor may breach the duty of care he owes to one joint tenant 
  without breaching the duty of care he owes to the other.  The fact that joint 
  tenants may have different interests and concerns was clear in this case, since 
  Griffiths and Sloan were separated when the Lakeshore property deal closed.  
  Manifestly, Zambosco owed a duty of care to both Griffiths and Sloan while he 
  acted for both Griffiths and Sloan on real estate matters.  He acted for Sloan 
  against Griffiths in connection with their family law problems.  In my view, 
  Zambosco should have obtained instructions from both Griffiths and Sloan before 
  he agreed to accept the vendor take back mortgage which did not contain a due 
  on sale clause consistent with the terms of the agreement. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The damages assessed by the trial judge were compensatory in the sense 
  that their purpose was to compensate Griffiths (and according to the trial judge, 
  Sloan) for Zambosco’s negligence.  As I have already mentioned, there is no 
  doubt that Zambosco owed a duty of care to both Griffiths and Sloan.  Both parties 
  were his clients on the sale of the Lakeshore property, including the vendor 
  take back mortgage component of the sale.  However, it is not clear that Zambosco 
  breached the duty of care he owed to Sloan.  In her pleadings and evidence, 
  Sloan did not suggest that Zambosco breached his duty to her.  Unlike Griffiths, 
  she did not deny that Zambosco had received instructions with respect to the 
  mortgage.  She was unable to remember much about the circumstances of the closing 
  of the sale of the Lakeshore property, including the vendor take back mortgage.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The order Griffiths obtained adding Sloan as a defendant to the action 
  did not expose Zambosco to a claim by Sloan for damages for solicitor’s negligence.  
  Although Griffiths and Sloan held the mortgage back on joint account, when it 
  came to Zambosco’s dealings with them they were two separate clients who had 
  different interests to protect.  One joint tenant is not by the existence of 
  the joint tenancy the agent of the other.  One joint tenant by his or her conduct 
  may waive a solicitor’s negligence thus exposing the solicitor to a claim in 
  negligence only by the other joint tenant.  Joint tenants have a separate, albeit 
  indivisible, interest in the jointly held asset.  One joint tenant’s interest 
  in jointly held property is exigible.  Griffiths and Sloan quickly realized 
  this when they learned that Sloan’s three judgment creditors had filed executions 
  against Sloan’s interest in the parties’ matrimonial home.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my opinion, Zambosco should not be required to compensate a defendant 
  who did not seek compensation from him in the action.  For those reasons, I 
  would give effect to this ground of Zambosco’s appeal and set aside paragraph 
  six of the judgment, which requires Zambosco to pay damages to Sloan.  Zambosco 
  is required to pay damages only to Griffiths in an amount equal to Griffiths’ 
  loss arising out of Zambosco’s negligence.  Griffiths’ loss is one-half of $297,494, 
  that is, $148,747.50.  That is his share of the loss caused by the omission 
  of the due on sale provision.</p>

  </span> Griffiths’ appeal raises two issues.  First, was the trial judge correct 
  in ordering Griffiths to pay occupation rent to Sloan from June 1992 to the 
  date of trial and beyond?  Second, did the trial judge have jurisdiction to 
  extinguish Griffiths’ rights as assignee of three judgments against Sloan, and 
  if so was he correct in extinguishing those claims?  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On August 19, 1999, after he released his original reasons, the trial 
  judge met with counsel.  In reasons released on September 10, 1999, he accepted 
  Griffiths’ submissions on the quantification of occupation rent and reduced 
  the occupation rent that he had originally ordered Griffiths to pay by 50 percent.  
  It is accepted that this change in the quantification of occupation rent was 
  correct.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did not, however, accept Griffiths’ submissions on the 
  issue of Griffiths’ rights as assignee of the three judgments against Sloan.  
  Consistent with his July 16, 1999 reasons, the trial judge concluded that one 
  of the appropriate credits against occupation rent was $89,000, that is what 
  Griffiths paid to secure the assignments.  No issue is taken with the inclusion 
  of $89,000 as one of the credits against Griffiths’ occupation rent obligation.  
  Nor is any issue taken with any of the other credits against occupation rent.  
  However, in dealing with the $89,000 credit, the trial judge held that payment 
  of the $89,000, as a credit against Griffiths’ occupation rent obligation, would 
  extinguish the three judgment debts that Griffiths held as assignee.  As I have 
  said, Griffiths submits that the trial judge was wrong in limiting his rights 
  as a judgment creditor by assignment to $89,000.</p>

  </span> The weight to be given to these and other relevant factors is a matter 
  for the trial judge to determine.  This court will not interfere with the exercise 
  of the trial judge’s discretion to order or to refuse to order occupation rent,

  </span> The trial judge gave significant weight to the length of Griffiths’ 
  rent-free occupancy of the matrimonial home.  At the same time, he was alert 
  to Griffiths’ argument that his occupation of the matrimonial home did not in 
  any real way deny Sloan access to her equity in it.  Although the trial judge 
  could have come to a different conclusion on the occupation rent issue, I am 
  not satisfied that his finding was unreasonable or that he erred in principle.  
  Accordingly, I would not give effect to Griffiths’ submission that the trial 
  judge’s order that he pay occupation rent should be set aside.</p>

  </span> The trial judge dealt with Sloan’s occupation rent claim in his reasons 
  released on July 16, 1999.  At that time he found that Sloan was entitled to 
  occupation rent and he quantified her entitlement at $156,000.  In considering 
  what should be set-off against that entitlement he concluded that Griffiths 
  should receive credits against his occupation rent obligation totalling $143,429.  
  The credits included the $89,000 which Griffiths paid to obtain assignments 
  of the three judgments against Sloan.  The trial judge included the $89,000 
  as a credit because Sloan acknowledged that the judgments assigned to Griffiths 
  compromised her equity in the matrimonial home.  In any case, no issue is taken 
  with the inclusion of the $89,000 Griffiths paid to Sloan’s judgment creditors 
  as a credit against Griffiths’ occupation rent obligation.  After deducting 
  the occupation rent credits.  from Griffiths’ gross occupation rent obligation, 
  the trial judge found Griffiths owed Sloan $12,500 for occupation rent. </p>

  </span> The occupation rent issue was revisited on August 19, 1999 when counsel 
  made submissions to the trial judge on a number of issues, including occupation 
  rent.  In reasons released on September 10, 1999, the trial judge reduced Sloan’s 
  gross occupation rent entitlement by 50%, as I previously noted.  This adjustment 
  reduced Griffiths’ occupation rent obligation to $79,500.<a

  </span> In light of the fact that Griffiths and Sloan owned their matrimonial 
  home jointly, the parties acknowledge that the trial judge was correct in reducing 
  Griffiths’ occupation rent obligation by 50 percent.  Similarly, no issue is 
  taken with the trial judge’s decision to limit the credits against the occupation 
  rent by one-half to reflect the value of Sloan’s share of the expenses connected 
  with the matrimonial home.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span> [3] 
  </span></a>  The trial judge determined that Griffiths’ gross occupation rent 
  obligation was $79,500 and that the total credits against occupation rent, including 
  the $89,000, were $143,429.  Since no issue is taken with the trial judge’s 
  quantification of either the occupation rent or the credits against occupation 
  rent, using the trial judge’s final numbers Griffiths owed Sloan nothing for 
  occupation rent.  Indeed, one arrives at a zero balance for occupation rent 
  by using only $63,929 of the total credits available to Griffiths.</p>

line-height:normal;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
    &lt;/span&gt; By way of summary, para. 8 of the formal judgment provides that Sloan 
    was entitled to $79,500 for occupation rent, subject to Griffiths’ ongoing 
    post-trial obligation to pay $1,500 per month until the matrimonial home was 
    sold.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Para. 9 of the judgment provided 
    that the credits to which I have referred be set off against Griffiths’ $79,500 
    occupation rent obligation.&lt;span style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;Subject 
    to the matter of Griffiths’ ongoing occupation rent obligation, the application 
    of these two paragraphs of the judgment leads to a zero balance for occupation 
    rent.&lt;/p&gt;

  </span> It is against that somewhat confusing background that I turn to consider 
  whether the trial judge was correct in extinguishing Griffiths’ rights as assignee 
  of the three judgments in exchange for the $89,000 set-off against his occupation 
  rent obligation.  For reasons that follow, I think that the trial judge erred 
  in relieving Sloan of her obligation to pay the face value of the three judgments 
  assigned to Griffiths.</p>

  </span> I should note at the outset that there is no reference to the extinguishment 
  of Griffiths’ rights as assignee of the three judgments in the formal judgment 
  dated August 19 or the Reasons for Judgment dated July 16, 1999.  However, the 
  trial judge made his decision clear on the extinguishment issue at para. 2 of 
  his supplementary reasons dated September 10, 1999:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The principal amount of the plaintiff’s claim for the executions against 
      the defendant Sloan registered on title to the Trafalgar Road property shall 
      be limited to $89,000.00.  <u>The allocation of such sum to the account 
      of the plaintiff shall be a satisfaction of the debts represented by such 
      executions and the executions shall be removed from title.</u>  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

  </span> Griffiths submits that there was no pleading about, or any relief sought 
  in respect of, his rights as assignee of the three judgments against Sloan.  
  He therefore contends it was not open to the trial judge to make the order he 
  did in respect of Griffiths’ rights as assignee. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By contrast, Sloan makes three submissions in support of the trial judge’s 
  conclusion on Griffiths’ rights as assignee.  First, she emphasizes that although 
  the judgments were assigned to Griffiths, the assignments were executed surreptitiously 
  through nominees.  She notes that Griffiths’ motive for purchasing the judgments 
  was to use them to extinguish her one-half interest in the matrimonial home.  
  Second, she argues that since Griffiths paid for the assignments there are now 
  no rights of any third party creditors involved.  Finally, she submits that 
  it would unjust and inequitable were Griffiths to be permitted to assert a claim 
  against Sloan representing the full value of the judgments.  She submits that 
  if Griffiths were permitted to claim the face value of the judgments against 
  her, he would be unjustly enriched at her expense.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see no merit in Sloan’s appeal on this issue.  No issue is taken with 
  the validity of the assignments of the three judgments.  Thus, in the circumstances, 
  Griffiths has a legal right to sue Sloan in his own name to recover the three 
  judgment debts.  See <i>Conveyancing and Law of Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990 
  c.C.34.  Section 53 of that Act provides:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>53(1)  Any absolute assignment made on or after the 31<sup>st</sup> day 
      of December, 1897, by writing under the hand of the assignor, not purporting 
      to be by way of charge only, of any debt or other legal chose in action 
      of which express notice in writing has been given to the debtor, trustee 
      or other person from whom the assignor would have been entitled to receive 
      or claim such debt or chose in action is effectual in law, subject to all 
      equities that would have been entitled to priority over the right of the 
      assignee if this section had not been enacted, to pass and transfer the 
      legal right to such debt or chose in action from the date of such notice, 
      and all legal and other remedies for the same, and the power to give a good 
      discharge for the same without the concurrence of the assignor.</p>

</blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my opinion, Griffiths’ motives in acquiring the assignments are not 
  of any real relevance.  First, I do no think that the absence of any third party 
  rights is determinative or even relevant to the issue whether he can recover 
  the face value of the judgments he now owns.  Under s. 53(1) the <i>Conveyancing 
  and Law of Property Act</i>, once a judgment is assigned to a third party, that 
  third party stands in the place of the original creditor with respect to any 
  lawful claim.  Unless Sloan can make an estoppel argument, as long as Griffiths 
  is entitled to stand in the shoes of the three judgment creditors he is entitled 
  to sue to recover the existing debts in his own name.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Finally, the equity issues raised by Sloan seem to me to cut both ways.  
  Even after Sloan signed the minutes of settlement in January 1992, she continued 
  to run up debts which eventually resulted in executions being filed against 
  her interest in the matrimonial home.  The doctrine of unjust enrichment does 
  not prevent Griffiths from asserting the full face value of the judgments against 
  Sloan.  Although Griffiths will profit from the three assignment transactions 
  if he collects the full value of the debts, there will be no corresponding deprivation 
  to Sloan.  Quite apart from Griffiths’ intervention, Sloan owed the three judgment 
  creditors the full face value of their judgments.  Indeed, by forgiving the 
  remaining value of her judgment debts, the difference between the face value 
  of the three judgments and the net credit Griffiths received against occupation 
  rent – the trial judge has enriched Sloan at Griffiths’ expense, not the reverse.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Given the absence of deprivation to Sloan, whether there is a juristic 
  reason for the enrichment is moot.  However, even if there is a deprivation, 
  the juristic reason that justifies what Sloan characterizes as a windfall is 
  s. 53(1) of the <i>Conveyancing in Law of Property Act</i>.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Sloan ran up debts which eventually attached to her interest in the 
  matrimonial home.  If Griffiths were to enforce those debts, Sloan does not 
  “lose” her equity.  She has already compromised her equity by incurring the 
  three judgment debts in the first place.  It is an uncontroverted fact that 
  had Griffiths not purchased the debts, Sloan would have lost her equity in the 
  matrimonial home by the time of trial.  </p>

  </span> For the foregoing reasons, I would allow Zambosco’s appeal in part by 
  setting aside that part of the judgment requiring Zambosco to compensate Sloan 
  for his negligence.  I would vary the judgment by requiring Zambosco to pay 
  damages to Griffiths of $148,747 (one-half of the total damages assessed by 
  the trial judge).  In the circumstances, Sloan should have no interest in Griffiths’ 
  $148,747 recovery.  I would give Zambosco his costs of his appeal since he has 
  achieved substantial success.</p>

  </span> On the issue of occupation rent, it is apparent that the credits against 
  occupation rent exceed $79,500, Sloan’s gross occupation rent entitlement as 
  found by the trial judge.  As far as the occupation rent debt goes, the $143,429 
  credit should, in my view, be exhausted once the credits equal $79,500.  If 
  it makes any economic sense to do so, the balance of the credits can be taken 
  into account upon the sale of the matrimonial home.  At that time, the interests 
  of Griffiths and Sloan in the matrimonial home can be adjusted.</p>

  </span> I see no proper basis to extinguish Griffiths’ rights as assignee of 
  the three judgments against Sloan.  Griffiths’ rights of assignment remain intact.  
  This will not require a variation of the judgment.</p>

  </span> I would give Griffiths’ 50 percent of his costs of his appeal.  He did 
  not have to appeal occupation rent since the trial judgment, as it stood, required 
  him to pay nothing to Sloan for occupation rent.  He was, however, successful 
  on the issue of his rights as assignee of the three judgments against Sloan.</p>
