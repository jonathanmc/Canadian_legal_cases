style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On appeal from judgment of Justice John A. Desotti dated 
  May 30, 2001.</span></b></p>
<h4 align="center"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'></span></h4>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appeal by Robert Zierler (“Zierler”) from a judgment 
  against him for $113,453 in favour of Nelson Guerette (“Guerette”), as well 
  as from a judgment dismissing his counterclaim against Susan Guerette.  In addition, 
  Demetrios Karaouzas (“Karaouzas”) appeals from a judgment against him for $89,857 
  in favour of Guerette.  The judgments resulted from a motion for summary judgment 
  brought by Mr. and Mrs. Guerette.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appellants submit that there are two grounds 
  on which their appeal should be allowed:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>That the motion judge erred in exceeding 
      the role of a judge hearing a motion for summary judgment by assessing the 
      credibility of witnesses and by making findings of fact.</span></p>
    <p> <span
lang=EN-US>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>That there exists a reasonable apprehension 
      that the motion judge was biased in favour of the respondent, Guerette.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In our view, there is merit to each ground of 
  appeal.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> These proceedings arise out of separate actions brought by Guerette 
  against Zierler and Karaouzas, as well as an application and counter-application 
  between these parties for remedies under the <i>Ontario Business Corporations 
  Act</i> <i>(“OBCA”)</i>.  The proceedings were joined together and the motion 
  judge appears to have assumed management of them.  He heard a number of interlocutory 
  motions prior to the motion for summary judgment.  In respect to procedural 
  motions that he heard on February 9, 2001 and March 29, 2001, the motion judge 
  delivered extensive reasons.  In addition, he delivered lengthy reasons allowing 
  the motion for summary judgment.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> From the record, it is clear that the dispute between the appellants 
  and the respondent centers upon their shareholdings or investments in 1145393 
  Ontario Limited (“the company”) and its operation.  The operation of the company, 
  in part, is the basis for remedies sought under the <i>OBCA</i>.  The main dispute 
  appears to center on whether Guerette advanced funds to the appellants as personal 
  loans to them, or whether the money that he advanced was in the nature of a 
  shareholder’s advance to the company.  The record relating to these issues undoubtedly 
  contains conflicting evidence from the perspective of the parties.  There is 
  no question that it discloses conflicting evidence on virtually every issue 
  raised in the three proceedings.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Notwithstanding the conflicting evidence, the motion judge made 
  findings of fact suggesting that the respondent had loaned funds to Zierler 
  and Karaouzas, who had refused , or neglected, to repay the loans.  In doing 
  so, he rejected the evidence in support of the appellants and accepted the evidence 
  in favour of the respondent.  He thereby exceeded the role of the court on a 
  motion for summary judgment, which is limited to assessing the threshold issue 
  of whether a genuine issue exists as to material facts requiring a trial.  In 
  our view, the record indicates that there is a genuine issue for trial in respect 
  to virtually every issue raised in these proceedings.  We would, therefore, 
  give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Although this is sufficient to allow the appeal, 
  there are two reasons why we are obliged to consider the second ground of appeal.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, in the interests of justice appellate courts have a supervisory 
  role in relation to the conduct of judicial proceedings which extends, in proper 
  cases, to a review of remarks made both by counsel and the presiding judge.  
  In this case, regrettably, the transcripts of the motion judge’s reasons in 
  procedural motions on February 9, 2001 and March 29, 2001, which preceded the 
  motion for summary judgment, reveal several inappropriate and unfortunate comments 
  by the motion judge that may well have created the impression that he had formed 
  prematurely a  view of the subject matter of the motion for summary judgment 
  adverse to the appellants.  In these circumstances a reasonable apprehension 
  of bias arises, warranting our intervention.  In this regard, we would affirm 
  what this court said in <i>Bisoukis v. Brampton (City)</i> (1999), 180 D.L.R. 
  (4th) 577 at 608.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, counsel for Zierler has indicated that there may be further 
  interlocutory proceedings.  In addition, based on the result of the appeal, 
  there will also be a trial.  We were asked to order that the motion judge be 
  precluded from any involvement in any further proceedings.  Although it may 
  be unusual for this Court to make such an order, regrettably, such an order 
  is warranted in this case.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Zierler has also appealed from the dismissal of his counterclaim 
  against Susan Guerette.  Having regard to the manner in which Zierler framed 
  his claims against her, we find no reason to interfere with the result reached 
  by the motion judge.  Accordingly, this aspect of Zierler’s appeal is dismissed.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For the foregoing reasons, we would allow the appeals, set aside 
  the judgment of the motion judge, except for paragraphs 1, 2 and 6, and order 
  that the motion for summary judgment against Zierler and Karaouzas be dismissed. 
   In addition, it is ordered that any subsequent proceeding in relation to these 
  three proceedings, be it by way of motion or trial, be heard by a judge other 
  than the motion judge.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As for costs, the costs of the motion are reserved to the trial 
  judge.  The appellant Zierler is entitled to his costs of the appeal.  The appellant 
  Karaouzas argued the appeal in person, and while he is entitled to costs, the 
  costs are limited to those properly recoverable by an unrepresented litigant.</p>
