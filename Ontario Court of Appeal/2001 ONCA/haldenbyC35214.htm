  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>This appeal involves the interpretation of s.&nbsp;26(1) 
  of the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule – Accidents Before January&nbsp;1st, 
  1994</i>, Ont. Reg. 672/90 (SABS) which provides the limitation period for the

  </span></span> On an application to determine the applicable limitation period, 
  the appellant argued that this section creates two separate and distinct limitation 
  periods.  Justice Kealey dismissed the application and held that the section 
  contemplates only one limitation period which begins to run from the insurer’s 
  refusal to pay the amount claimed in the application for accident benefits.  
  The appellant appeals that decision.  For the reasons that follow, the appeal 
  should be dismissed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant was involved in a motor vehicle accident on February&nbsp;25, 
  1993 and in a second motor vehicle accident on April&nbsp;1, 1993.  The appellant 
  was insured under a standard Ontario policy of automobile insurance with the 
  respondent Dominion of Canada General Insurance Company.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On March&nbsp;18, 1993, the appellant applied 
  for accident benefits and, as of March 4, 1993, received weekly income benefits 
  from Dominion pursuant to s.&nbsp;12 of the SABS. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Before her accident, the appellant was a projects and initiatives 
  analyst.  After her February 1993 accident she returned to work for nine days.  
  After the April 1993 accident she was off work until November&nbsp;1, 1993.  
  She then returned to work part-time until March&nbsp;5, 1994 when she took a 
  further month off due to her accident-related injuries.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On February 22, 1996, Dominion stopped paying weekly income benefits 
  to the appellant.  As of that date, Dominion took the position that pursuant 
  to para.&nbsp;12(5)(b) of the SABS, the appellant did not qualify for weekly 
  income benefits past the 156 week anniversary of the accident of February&nbsp;25, 
  1993, because it was not established that “the injury continuously prevents 
  the insured from engaging in any occupation or employment for which she is reasonably 
  suited by education, training or experience.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On May&nbsp;21, 1996, Dominion advised the appellant by letter 
  that it refused to pay weekly income benefits for any period in excess of 156 
  weeks subsequent to the motor vehicle accident of February&nbsp;25, 1993.  The 
  letter stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In reviewing the file, we note no official Assessment of Claim form was 
      ever sent to you upon termination of your disability benefit at the 156 
      week mark.  As you know, at 156 weeks post-accident, the criteria for disability 
      changes under the auto policy.  At this time, you would need to be unable 
      to perform any job for which you are qualified by training, education or 
      experience.  Since you are able to perform such a job, your benefits were 
      terminated 156 weeks after the accident.  I understand you were verbally 
      advised of this, however, no written confirmation was sent and for this 
      reason I am sending one now.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On May&nbsp;14, 1999, the appellant completed an application 
  for mediation of her “further weekly income benefits” claim.  The mediation 
  was conducted on August&nbsp;9, 1999.  Dominion took the position that the appellant’s 
  claim was barred by the limitation period set forth in s.&nbsp;281(5) of the 
  <i>Insurance Act</i> and s.&nbsp;26(1) of the SABS.  The mediation failed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant issued the statement of claim on August&nbsp;13, 
  1999 for further weekly income benefit payments.  On December&nbsp;22, 1999, 
  the appellant brought an application to determine when a limitation period commences 
  to run under s.&nbsp;26(1) of the SABS against an insured person in relation 
  to his or her claim for weekly income benefits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In a judgment dated November 3, 2000, the application 
  judge declared that the two-year limitation period under s. 26(1) of the SABS 
  commences to run against an insured person when the insurer first gives written 
  notice of termination of weekly benefits after the insured’s initial application 
  for such benefits.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Limitation periods play an important role in the administration 
  of justice by achieving a balance between every individual’s right to justice 
  on one hand and the systemic need for finality on the other.  In their operation, 
  limitation periods encourage the timely resolution of legal controversies and 
  reconcile the competing interests of potential claimants, potential defendants 
  and society at large. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The application judge properly outlined the three rationales 
  underlying limitation periods, as set out by La Forest J. in <i>M.(K.) v. M.(H.)</i> 
  (1992), 96 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 289 at pp. 301-2 (S.C.C.).  They are:</p>

      </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Certainty rationale: “a potential defendant 
      should be secure in his reasonable expectation that he will not be held

      </span></span> Evidentiary rationale: this “concerns the desire to foreclose 
      claims based on stale evidence.  Once the limitation period has lapsed, 
      the potential defendant should no longer be concerned about the preservation 
      of evidence relevant to the claim.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Also, in a more general sense, the SABS must be read in accordance 
  with the modern approach to statutory interpretation.  Thus, the “court’s interpretation 
  should comply with the legislative text, promote the legislative purpose, reflect 
  the Legislature’s intent and produce a reasonable and just meaning.”: <i>Ontario 
  (Minister of Transportation) v. Ryder Truck Rental Canada</i> (2000), 47 O.R. 
  (3d) 254 (C.A.).</p>
<h4>2.            Section 281(5) of the Insurance Act </h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 281(5) of the <i>Insurance Act </i>sets the general limitation 
  period for statutory accident benefits claims.  Specifically, an insured person 
  must initiate proceedings within two years of the insurer’s refusal to pay the 
  benefit claimed, or within such longer period as may be provided by the SABS.  
  The appellant says that the second half of s. 26(1) provides a longer period 
  for an insured person to initiate proceedings.</p>
<h4>3.            Section 26 of the SABS</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 26(1) of the SABS contains two triggering events for 
  the commencement of the two-year limitation period.  First, it specifies that 
  proceedings in respect of benefits must be commenced within two years from the 
  insurer’s refusal to pay the amount claimed in the application for statutory 
  accident benefits.  Second, where a person has attended school, or accepted 
  or returned to an employment in accordance with s.&nbsp;16, proceedings in respect 
  of benefits must be commenced within two years of the insurer’s refusal to pay 
  further benefits.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant submits that the two alternatives set out in s. 
  26(1) describe two distinct limitation periods.  We disagree. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As properly noted by the application judge, the relevant statutory 
  language is not free of ambiguity.  However, in our view, s. 26(1) contemplates 
  one limitation period.  It is the insurer’s refusal which triggers the limitation 
  period that can arise out of two types of situation.  Indeed, the two parts 
  of s. 26(1) apply respectively to the situations where (1) the insurer refuses 
  to pay the amount claimed by the insured; <i>or in the alternative</i> where 
  (2) the insurer refuses to pay further benefits if the claimant went to school 
  or returned to work as permitted by s. 16.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For example, the first part of s. 26(1) would apply to a claimant 
  whose initial application for benefits is refused by the insurer. That claimant 
  would then have two years from the date of that refusal to commence proceedings 
  regarding his or her claim. Also, the first part of s. 26(1) would apply to 
  situations where a claimant successfully applied for benefits and, after a period 
  of time, the insurer stops paying benefits to the claimant.  The first part 
  of s. 26(1) is designed to capture every situation in which a claimant is initially 
  refused benefits or in which a claimant received benefits until the insurer 
  refused to make further payments.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> By contrast, the second part of s. 26(1) is aimed exclusively 
  at those claimants who are receiving benefits under the Schedule and attempt 
  a return to work or school “as permitted by s. 16”. Basically, s. 16 provides 
  that a person receiving benefits under the Schedule may attend school or return 
  to work without prejudicing his or her entitlement to benefits.  It must be 
  noted that the protection offered by s. 16 applies solely to  “a person receiving 
  a benefit under this Part”.  “This Part” refers to Part IV of the Schedule, 
  that is ss. 12 to 17 inclusively.  Therefore, consideration must be given to 
  those sections when interpreting the return to work provisions of the Schedule. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 12 is particularly important.  It sets out the insurer’s 
  obligation to pay benefits [s. 12(1)], the criteria for entitlement to benefits 
  [ss. 12(2) and (3)], the amount of the benefit [ss. 12(4) and (7)], and most 
  importantly, the limits of entitlement to benefits [ss. 12(5) and (6)].</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>For the purposes of this case, s. 12(5) is determinative. 
  It provides that an insurer is not required to pay benefits to an insured for 
  any period “in excess of 156 weeks unless it has been established that the injury 
  continuously prevents the insured from engaging in any occupation or employment 
  for which he or she is reasonably suited by education, training or experience.”</span></p>
<h4>4.         The Case on Appeal</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s position is that she was a person covered by 
  s. 16(1) of the SABS who returned to work within the two years after the accident 
  and received benefits for 156 weeks, at which point in time her benefits were 
  terminated.  However, she remained employed.  She was only terminated from her 
  employment some months thereafter.  It was one and a half years after her employment 
  was terminated that she applied again for benefits and there has been no written 
  refusal from the insurer to pay those benefits since that time.  Her position 
  therefore is that as there has been no refusal, the two-year limitation period 
  has not run from the time she reapplied for further benefits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first basis for the appellant’s argument is that because 
  she remained employed after having received 156 weeks of benefits, she was not 
  eligible at that time to receive further benefits.  But once she was terminated 
  from employment as a result of accident related injuries, she could then take 
  the position that she was permanently disabled as a result of the accident, 
  and therefore entitled to further weekly benefits.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The problem with this submission is that there is no provision 
  in the Act or the SABS which allows a claimant to reapply for further benefits 
  after an insured person’s benefits have been terminated by the insurer.  The 
  only remedy for the insured person is to appeal the termination of benefits 
  within the two-year period. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 16 allows a person who was injured in an accident and 
  began to receive benefits because the person could not initially return to work, 
  to later return to work or to school without affecting the benefits.  The effect 
  of the section is to encourage people to try to return to work or to school 
  after an accident.  However, there is nothing in s. 16 which provides any right 
  to receive more benefits than are provided for under ss. 12 and 13 (“Benefit 
  if No Income”) of the SABS, nor is there any provision which allows for an application 
  for further benefits at any time.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the appellant argues that interpreting s. 26 to provide 
  for only one limitation period makes redundant the phrase at the end of the 
  section which describes the alternative situation.  We disagree.  Rather, as 
  stated above, the section clarifies the two possible scenarios for receipt of 
  weekly benefits under the section – people not working and people working or 
  attending school after a period of not working.  Claimants may only qualify 
  under s. 16 if they are already receiving benefits, i.e. people whose benefits 
  have been terminated do not qualify.  Although the phrase “further benefits” 
  is not found in the section, a person whose benefits continue after going back 
  to work can be said to receive “further benefits” following the initial weekly 
  benefits when the person was unable to work.  (Note that by s. 16(3), if a person 
  goes back to school, the insurer is not required to pay any amount for weekly 
  benefits while the person is in school.)</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Third, the appellant takes the position that s. 15, which allows 
  the insurer to deduct from benefits payable 80% of the income which a person 
  may receive from employment, can result in the benefit payment amount being 
  reduced to zero during the time the person returns to work under s. 16.  The 
  appellant argues that this may be perceived as a termination or refusal to pay, 
  triggering the limitation period and thereby forcing the person to launch an 
  appeal when the person has no complaint at the particular time.  In our view, 
  this issue does not arise out of the operation of s. 15.  By s. 24(8) a refusal 
  must be in writing and must provide reasons.  Where the amount of the benefit 
  payable is zero, that is not a refusal by the insurer to pay a benefit.  Therefore, 
  the limitation period is not triggered by the operation of s. 15.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Finally, the appellant claims that May 21, 1996 (the date of 
  the termination letter) is not the proper date by which to determine the limitation 
  period.  She submits that under the second part of s. 26(1) and s. 16, a person 
  receiving benefits can return to work for any period of time after the accident, 
  receive the full 156 weeks of benefits and, if at some time thereafter the person 
  is entirely unable to continue to work due to accident-related injuries, can 
  reassert a claim for <i>further</i> benefits at any time, and the limitation 
  period does not begin to run until the insurer refuses to pay the further benefits 
  claimed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant’s interpretation of s. 26(1) was properly rejected 
  by David Evans, the arbitrator in <i>Shirani v. Wellington Insurance Co.</i> 
  (F.S.C.O. File No. A96-000114, January 7, 1997) since it suggests that, in effect, 
  there would be no limitation period.  The appellant’s interpretation of s. 26(1) 
  would allow a person receiving benefits who has successfully returned to work, 
  to apply for <i>further</i> benefits at any time in an undetermined future.  
  The limitation period in s. 26(1) would only be engaged when such an application 
  was refused.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As noted by the application judge (para. 8), 
  the appellant’s approach would extend a claimant’s entitlement to benefits for 
  an indeterminate period of time and is “inconsistent with the Supreme Court 
  of Canada’s rationale which underlined the common sense of, and the need for 
  limitation periods.” Indeed, as discussed above, such an interpretation of ss. 
  26(1) and 16 would unreasonably controvert the systemic need for finality, certainty 
  and the principle of diligence.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In any event, the appellant’s interpretation is contrary to the 
  scheme of the SABS. Section 12(5)(b) provides that the insurer is not required 
  to pay a weekly benefit under subsection (1) for any period in excess of 156 
  weeks, unless it has been established that “the injury continuously prevents 
  the insurer from engaging in any occupation or employment for which he or she 
  is reasonably suited by education, training or experience.” The appellant’s 
  argument is that an insured person can receive benefits for 156 weeks, continue 
  to work at a job after the 156 weeks, and then apply for further benefits.  
  That would contradict the scheme of the Act which only allows payments in excess 
  of 156 weeks if the person is continuously prevented from engaging in his or 
  her employment as a result of the injury.  Clearly, if a person was working 
  after the 156 weeks, that person was not continuously prevented beyond that 
  period from working.  As a result, it would be inconsistent with s. 12(5)(b) 
  to allow a person to reapply for benefits after that time.  The person would 
  never be entitled to such benefits.  There can therefore be no extended limitation 
  period based on such a reapplication.</p>
