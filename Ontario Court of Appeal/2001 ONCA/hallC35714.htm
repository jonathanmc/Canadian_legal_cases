<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice Paul G. Philp, 
  sitting with a jury, dated November 28, 2000 and from the sentence imposed by 
  Justice Philp dated November 30, 2000.</span></p>
<h3 align="center"><span lang=EN-US>ENDORSEMENT</span></h3>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>The appellant was convicted of aggravated assault 
  and sentenced to 4½ years’ imprisonment in addition to time served treated as 
  two years for a total of 6½ years.  He appeals both his conviction and sentence.  
  The appellant raises two grounds on his appeal from conviction. <span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first issue is whether the trial judge properly instructed 
  the jury on s. 41 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  The trial judge’s simple instructions 
  on s. 41 to the jury enured to the benefit of the appellant.  We would dismiss 
  this ground of appeal. <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second ground of appeal is based on the submission that the 
  trial judge erred in allowing the Crown to cross-examine Ms. LeBlanc on her 
  prior statement pursuant to s. 9(2) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  In our 
  opinion, even if the trial judge erred in allowing the crown to cross-examine 
  Ms. LeBlanc, the jury were not misled into thinking they could use her statement 
  to the police as proof of the truth of its contents.  The jury’s question about 
  that evidence before the charge indicates that they knew they could not use 
  the statement for the truth of its contents.  The note read: “If the evidence 
  from Jeremy’s sister’s police interviews is to be disregarded, why was it introduced?  
  After all, it was introduced after much deliberations (<i>in&nbsp;camera</i>).”  
  This note indicates an enlightened jury, one that can be taken not only to have 
  understood the trial judge’s instruction that the evidence had no use, but also, 
  not to have allowed the fact that they heard the evidence to be used to the 
  prejudice of the accused.  The appeal against conviction is dismissed. </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to sentence, the accused’s record is a long one, 
  but the longest term he has served is two years.  In our view, it was an error 
  in principle to jump to 6½ years.  Even given the ferocity of this attack, we 
  think the sentence should have been five years with two years’ credit for time 
  served for an effective sentence of three years.  Accordingly, leave to appeal 
  sentence is granted, the appeal as to sentence is allowed and the sentence varied 
  to three years.</p>
