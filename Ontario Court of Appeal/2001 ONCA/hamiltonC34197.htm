  of the claimed amount of the lien, or may the owner resort to subsection 23(1)(d)

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants brought 
  this application under s. 23 of the <i>Repair and Storage Liens Act</i> on January 
  7, 2000, returnable January 13, 2000, for determination of the propriety and 
  amount of the liens claimed and for release of the vehicles. The respondent 
  then prepared and forwarded invoices in respect of the vehicles after receipt 
  of the notice of application. The invoices were calculated on January 11 to 
  include daily storage charges up to that date.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The application was 
  heard on April 7, 2000. Although the notice of application states that the application 
  was brought under s. 23 of the Act, the application judge stated that the applicants 
  claim under s. 24 of the <i>Repair and Storage Liens Act</i>. He noted that 
  subsection 24(4) requires an applicant who disputes the lien claim or its amount 
  to pay the lien amount into court, but that the applicants had not done so. 
  The applicants had argued that they were not in a position to pay the lien amounts 
  into court before launching the application because they had no invoices at 
  that time. The application judge found that by the time of the hearing, the 
  applicants had had the information for three months and could and should have 
  paid monies into court before the hearing date. He held that the court could 
  not consider the legitimacy of the liens or their quantities until the precondition 
  of payment into court has been satisfied. Finally, he stated that the applicants 
  could still proceed to make the payment into court and obtain possession of 
  the vehicles without prejudice to their right to move under s. 24 to challenge 
  the liens or their amounts.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The effect of the 
  application judges disposition in this case was to treat the application as 
  one brought under s. 24 rather than s. 23 of the <i>Repair and Storage Liens 
  Act</i>. The respondent contends that the application judge was correct in treating 
  the application in this way, because an owner cannot be allowed to avoid the 
  procedure set out in s. 24 of the Act, which requires payment of the amount 
  of the lien into court and obtaining release of the liened goods before an applicant 
  is entitled to a determination of the rights to the lien and its amount. The 
  respondent submits that this is the scheme of the Act and that an owner is not 
  entitled to resort to s. 23 of the Act in order to obtain both that determination 
  and then release of the goods, without first making the payment into court.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect to the 
  application judge, I do not agree with this submission.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>First, on a plain 
  reading of the sections, s. 23 allows any person access to the court for a determination 
  of a list of issues set out in subsections (a) through (e) respecting the rights 
  of the parties, and gives the court the authority to make such order as it 
  considers necessary to give effect to those rights. Such an order would include 
  an order for release of the liened goods upon payment of the amount of the lien 
  as determined by the court.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The only restriction 
  provided in s. 23 is in subsection (2), which prohibits an application under 
  subsection (1)(d) where an application has been made under s. 24. In this 
  case, no application was made under s. 24.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Therefore on a plain 
  reading, there is no bar to the applicants applying under s. 23 of the Act for 
  the relief sought in the notice of application.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, s. 24 provides an alternate procedure which  is optional 
  for an owner and allows an owner  an expeditious and speedy method of obtaining 
  release of the liened goods upon payment into court of all or part of the amount 
  claimed <i>without </i>appearing in court for a hearing. Once the money has 
  been paid into court and the goods have been obtained from the lien claimant, 
  it is the lien claimant, and not the owner, who then must initiate an action 
  under subsection 24(13) in order to obtain payment out of court of the disputed 
  portion (which may be all) of the amount of the lien.</p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Under s. 24, an owner 
  of an article may apply to the court. The section is not mandatory. The owner 
  may pay into court a settlement amount, which the lien claimant may accept in 
  full satisfaction of the lien. If the lien claimant does not accept the settlement 
  amount, then in order to obtain release of the goods, the owner must pay into 
  court the balance of the amount claimed for the lien and is then entitled to 
  release of the goods. The lien claimant may then obtain the settlement amount 
  out of court. If the lien claimant wishes to pursue the balance, or, if there 
  is no settlement amount, the entire amount paid into court, the lien becomes 
  a charge on the amount in court and the lien claimant has 90 days in which to 
  commence an action to recover that amount.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>In my view, it is 
  clear that the Act provides two exclusive procedures for access to the court 
  to obtain a determination of the lien rights of affected parties. Section 23 
  may be used by any person including the owner of goods or the lien claimant. 
  Section 24 is available initially only to the owner (or other person lawfully 
  entitled to the article) if the owner wishes to obtain the article back quickly 
  and is prepared to pay the claimed amount of the lien into court.</span></p>
<p> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>By using subsection 
  23(1)(d), the lien remains a charge on the goods and the owner will not be able 
  to obtain the goods back until after the court has determined the issues. When 
  s. 24 is used, the lien is transferred from the goods to the funds paid into 
  court, the owner obtains the goods back quickly and the court determines the 
  rights of the parties to the funds in court.</span></p>
<p>CONCLUSION</p>
<p> <span lang=EN-US

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The appellants were 
  entitled to proceed under subsection 23(1)(d) of the Act. I would allow the 
  appeal, with costs, set aside the order, and remit the application to the Superior 
  Court for the hearing of the application on the merits as required by that subsection.
