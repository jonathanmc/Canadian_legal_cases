  </span> The issue presented by this appeal is whether a conflict exists between 
  the provisions of The Regional Municipality of Peel By-law Number 98-91 and 
  the provisions of the June 10, 1987 Financing Agreement between Hammerson Canada 
  Inc. and others and the Region, the City of Mississauga, and others.  If there 
  is such a conflict, s. 14(4) of the <i>Development Charges Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, 
  c.&nbsp;D.9 provides that the agreement prevails “to the extent of the conflict”.  
  In comprehensive reasons, dealing with all of the matters raised by Hammerson, 
  Nordheimer J. found that there was no conflict and that Hammerson and its successors 
  were required to pay the charges on industrial/commercial developments.  Most 
  of the same arguments were renewed in this court.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Because we are in substantial agreement with the reasons of the applications 
  judge, we set out our reasons in summary form.  At best, the Financing Agreement 
  was silent with respect to lot levies/development charges to be charged by the 
  Region for non-residential development.  This was in accordance with the policy, 
  as implemented in the relevant by-laws, that the Region only charged lot levies 
  on residential development.  Some parts of the Agreement, such as section 4, 
  might be read as putting Hammerson on notice that the Region could in the future 
  seek to impose additional lot levies on other than residential property.  We 
  do not rely upon these provisions and we have considerable doubt that the applications 
  judge was right in his interpretation of section 5 of the Agreement.  However, 
  his view of the effect of those provisions was not central to his conclusion 
  that there was no conflict.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The determining feature in the circumstances of this case is that silence 
  in the Agreement about development charges on commercial/industrial development 
  does not give rise to a conflict within the meaning of s.&nbsp;14(4) of the 
  Act.  We agree with the applications judge that the factual matrix does not 
  support the appellant’s position that silence can constitute a conflict.  The 
  factual matrix or context includes the facts that the Region was not at the 
  bargaining table in 1987 and that commercial/industrial levies by the Region 
  were not in issue, nor on the table, at that time.</p>

  </span> As this court observed in <i>Ontario Cancer Treatment &amp; Research 
  Foundation v. Ottawa (City)</i> (1998), 38 O.R. (3d) 224 at 241, the purposes 
  of the Act were to bring uniformity and order into development<span lang=EN-US>/</span>growth 
  related municipal costs and to implement the underlying economic philosophy 
  that development should pay for the infrastructure costs that it generates.  
  The Act thus gave the municipalities the power to impose development charges 
  by by-law where, previously, such levies could only be imposed by agreement.  
  The provisions of existing agreements prevail over any charges imposed under 
  the new legislation but only to the extent of the conflict between the provisions 
  of the by-law and the provisions of the agreement.  The appellant can point 
  to no provision of the Financing Agreement that presents any such conflict.  
  The Agreement and the By-law can stand together.  The former does not address 
  development charges on non-residential development.  The latter does.  There 
  is no conflict.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant placed particular reliance upon <i>Slice Construction 
  Ltd. v. City of Ottawa</i> (1983), 16 O.M.B.R. 506 (H.C.J.) affirmed (1985), 
  18 O.M.B.R. 350 (C.A.).  In our view, the applications judge properly distinguished 
  that case.  The issue of industrial/commercial development charges was simply 
  not the subject of bargaining in 1987.  This is therefore not a case where a 
  bargain is being unilaterally varied.</p>
