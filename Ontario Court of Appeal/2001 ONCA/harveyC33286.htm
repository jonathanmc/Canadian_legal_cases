  </span> The appellant was convicted of sexual assault by Hansen J. of the Ontario 
  Court of Justice.  The Crown then brought a dangerous offender application.  
  Hansen J. dismissed that application but found that the appellant was a long-term 
  offender under s. 753.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  She sentenced the appellant 
  to 3 years in the penitentiary followed by 10 years of community supervision.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant appeals his conviction and the Crown appeals the dismissal 
  of the dangerous offender application.  As the conviction on the sexual assault 
  charge was a condition precedent to the bringing of the dangerous offender application, 
  the Crown appeal becomes moot if the sexual assault conviction is quashed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contended that the conviction, based almost entirely on 
  an identification made at a photographic line-up some 2 1/2 years after the 
  assault, was unreasonable.  The Crown submitted that the evidence supported 
  the verdict.  The Crown further submitted that if the verdict was unreasonable, 
  the appropriate order would be a new trial and not an acquittal.  The Crown 
  argued that the trial judge had erred in excluding “similar fact” evidence tendered 
  by the Crown at trial, and that had she admitted that evidence there would have 
  been ample evidence to justify a conviction.  The Crown contended that if the 
  verdict was unreasonable it was entitled to a new trial where it could tender 
  the improperly excluded similar fact evidence.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span>

  </span> There was no evidence capable of confirming or supporting the identification 
  evidence given by the complainant.  The appellant testified and denied that 
  he attacked the complainant.  He said that he was at a friend’s house on the 
  evening of the attack and recalled that the police visited him the next morning.  
  The trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence as untrue, based in part on 
  certain reply evidence called by the Crown.  I see no reason to disagree with 
  her assessment of the appellant’s evidence.  The reasonableness of the verdict 
  must be approached on the basis of the evidence tendered by the Crown.  The 
  rejection of the appellant’s evidence does not add weight to the Crown’s case.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant testified that she went to bed about 12:30 a.m. on the 
  night of the assault.  She slept in a small pup tent with her brother.  Her 
  parents and two other siblings slept in a larger tent pitched nearby.  At some 
  point after falling asleep, the complainant “half awoke” thinking that there 
  was an animal in her shirt.  She swung her arms and made contact with someone.  
  She realized that there was a male intruder on top of her.  She felt his hands 
  inside her shirt squeezing her breasts.  She looked at the man’s face for five 
  or six seconds from a distance of about 1 1/2 feet.  The complainant lifted 
  her head slightly and bit the intruder’s hand.  The intruder said “bitch”, jumped 
  up and left the tent.  The complainant saw his face for about another second 
  and then started to scream.  She was so afraid she was unable to open the tent.  
  Her parents rushed to the tent and the complainant immediately told her father 
  that there was a man in her tent.  Her father searched the area but found no 
  one.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The assault occurred at about 4:00 a.m.  It was still dark out, although 
  there was some light in the area where the tents were pitched coming from a 
  service centre located about 120 yards away.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The intruder exited through a hole in the back of the pup tent.  It 
  would appear that he also entered through that hole.  There was another hole 
  ripped in the side of the pup tent.  Those holes were apparently made by the 
  intruder.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A fingerprint was lifted from one of the tent poles on the outside of 
  the tent and footprints were found near the tent.  Neither was connected to 
  the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant was interviewed about an hour after the assault.  She 
  described the intruder as having “greyish or whitish wavy” hair that was “combed 
  back at the front”.  She also said that the intruder was wearing dark track 
  pants.  She provided no further description of her assailant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The complainant was shown a photo line-up containing a picture of the 
  appellant some 28 months after the incident.  She acknowledged that in the almost 
  2 1/2 years that passed between the incident and her viewing of the photo line-up 
  there were occasions on which she could no longer recall what the intruder looked 
  like.  As she put it:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I remembered the face of the person I saw.  I didn’t totally forget the 
      face I just couldn’t bring it to mind.  I couldn’t sit there and think and 
      remember exactly what he looked like, I couldn’t bring it to my mind.  I 
      basically thought I forgot what he looked like.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before viewing the photo line-up, the complainant’s mother cautioned 
  her against identifying anyone unless she was sure of her identification.  The 
  officer who showed the complainant the photo line-up stressed to her that she 
  should not feel any obligation to select a photograph and that her attacker 
  may or may not be in the photo line-up.  The complainant appreciated the seriousness 
  of what she was being asked to do when she was shown the photo line-up.  She 
  did not want to identify the wrong person.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The photo line-up contained 12 pictures.  It was a fair line-up in the 
  sense that the appellant’s photograph (#8) did not stand out in any way and 
  the individuals depicted in the other photographs were similar in appearance 
  to the appellant.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The officer who showed the complainant the photo line-up testified that 
  the appellant looked at the photographs for some time, pointed to number 8 (the 
  appellant) and said “I think it’s him”.  She then said: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>That’s the one.  That just popped into my mind when I looked at the picture.  
      It’s the eyes.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The officer then asked her if there was anything else about the picture 
  that led her to believe that it was her attacker and she said “the hair, the 
  way it’s back so far”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A few minutes later, the complainant asked to see the pictures again.  
  She explained in her evidence that she wanted to see the photographs again because 
  she was concerned that she had not looked closely enough at the photographs 
  other than number 8.  She wanted to be sure that she had picked out the right 
  one.  The officer would not allow her to look at the line-up again.  He offered 
  no explanation for the refusal.   </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In her testimony at trial, the complainant gave a somewhat more detailed 
  description of her intruder.  She said that he was a white male in his early 
  fifties.  She described his hair as short, combed back at the front and “all 
  grey, basically white”.  She could not remember anything about the intruder’s 
  face except his eyes.  She described his eyes as “really bright blue and they 
  just stuck right out”.  She also identified the appellant in the courtroom.</p>
<p class=headingsubtitle>(ii)  The reasonableness of the verdict</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A verdict will be said to be unreasonable pursuant to s. 686(1)(a)(i) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i> if an appellate court is satisfied that the verdict 
  is one that a properly instructed trier of fact, acting judicially, could not 
  have rendered:  <i>R. v. Yebes</i> (1987), 36 C.C.C. (3d) 417 at 430 (S.C.C.);  
  <i>R. v. Biniaris</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 20-25 (S.C.C.).  As Arbour 
  J. observed in <i>R. v. Biniaris, supra</i>, the appellate court must look at 
  the evidence through “the lens of judicial experience” which gives the appellate 
  court an appreciation of the kinds of evidence, the types of witnesses, and 
  other features of the trial process which have historically been shown to lead 
  triers of fact outside the realm of reasonableness:  <i>R. v. Biniaris, supra</i>, 
  at pp. 21-24.  Judicial experience has taught that convictions that rest on 
  honest and apparently reliable eyewitness evidence are sometimes wrong and demand 
  close appellate scrutiny:  eg. see <i>R. v. Miaponoose</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 445 at 452 (Ont. C.A.);  <i>R. v. Tat</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at 
  515-16 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A finding that a verdict is unreasonable does not depend on a demonstration 
  of error in the course of the trial proceedings.  An error-free trial may still 
  result in an unreasonable verdict:  <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 193 at 220 (Ont. C.A.).  Practically speaking, however, an appellant will 
  have a difficult time demonstrating that a verdict reached by a judge, sitting 
  without a jury, is unreasonable unless the appellant can show either an absence 
  of reasoning, or an error in the reasoning process that led to the conviction.  
  In drawing the connection between a review of a trial judge’s reasons and the 
  reasonableness of a verdict, in <i>R. v. Biniaris, supra</i>, at p. 21, Arbour 
  J. said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… [T]he reviewing appellate court may be able to identify a flaw in the 
      evaluation of the evidence, or in the analysis, that will serve to explain 
      the unreasonable conclusion reached, and justify the reversal. …</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> A review of the trial judge’s reasons satisfies me that she misapprehended 
  a significant feature in the evidence and that her misapprehension figured prominently 
  in her decision to convict the appellant.  The trial judge referred to the complainant 
  as having given a “detailed description of her attacker in her statement to 
  the police”.  The complainant’s statement to the police taken about an hour 
  after the incident referred only to the attacker’s hair and his pants.  It was 
  not a “detailed description”.</p>

  complainant had referred to her attacker’s “clear blue eyes” and the distinctiveness 
  of those eyes in her initial statement to the police.  Had she given that information 
  to the police, it would have significantly enhanced the reliability of her identification.  
  A perusal of the photo line-up reveals that the appellant’s eyes are probably 
  his most distinguishing feature.  Had the complainant referred to this feature 
  before seeing the photograph, one could place considerably more reliance on 
  her identification.  Her reference to the eyes has much less probative value 
  when it was made only after she saw a photograph in which the eyes are a prominent 
  feature.</p>

  only five or six seconds to observe him and the conditions under which the observations 
  were made were far from ideal.  It was dark, the complainant had been fast asleep 
  immediately before the attack, and she was understandably very frightened when 
  she realized what was happening.  The complainant’s description of the intruder 
  provided to the police on the night of the attack referred only to his hair 
  and his pants and provided very little which could assist in identifying the

  </span> The circumstances in which the assault occurred and the absence of much 
  detail in the complainant’s initial description required that the Crown place 
  great weight on the complainant’s identification of the appellant in the photo 
  line-up.  The police followed the proper procedure in conducting that line-up 
  and it was a fair line-up.  For some reason, however, even though the appellant 
  was a suspect within days of the incident, the line-up was not conducted for 
  almost 2 1/2 years.  The long time span between the incident and the line-up 
  severely undermines the value of the identification made in that line-up.  I 
  do not think that much reliance can be placed on a witness’s honest assertion 
  that a picture viewed some 2 1/2 years after a brief encounter in a darkened 
  tent with a stranger, is a picture of that stranger.  The complainant understood 
  the dangers inherent in trying to identify someone so long after the incident.  
  Unfortunately, when she asked to look at the line-up a second time, the officer 
  refused to allow her to do so.</p>

  the nature of the Crown’s case and advised her that identity would be the sole 
  issue at trial.  He then summarized the evidence he proposed to call concerning 
  the prior sexual assault:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The similar fact evidence is something from June of 1985.  This is an offence 
      that Mr. Harvey pled guilty to.  In June of 1985 the complainant or the 
      victim in that case was a young lady named [M.P.].  At the time of the offence 
      against her she was 11 years old.  She was camping with a group of Girl 
      Guides and Pathfinders as well as adult supervisors at Beavermeade Park, 
      which is in the area of Peterborough.  This group who went camping were 
      in various tents with the adults being in large tents and a group of the 
      Girl Guides were in five or six pup tents.</p>
    <p>She would give evidence that she was in her tent, a pup tent, alone.  In 
      the early morning hours the accused person Mr. Harvey unzipped her tent.  
      He walked in the tent and he told this girl, [M.P.] that he was a gardener 
      for the campsite or for the park.  He then undid her pyjamas.  He then fondled 
      her breasts and her vagina.  He attempted to make her touch his penis, she 
      refused by pulling her hand back and the accused person then left.</p>
    <p>She would say that she then left her tent, went to the tent of another 
      Girl Guide, told this other Girl Guide about what happened.  The next morning 
      the parents or the counselors, the adult counselors were told about what 
      happened.  There was an examination done of the tents in the area and it 
      was found that the tent that [M.P.] was in was not cut but that all of the 
      – I’m sorry.  The tent that [M.P.] was in was not cut, it was a pup tent.  
      The tent she went into after the accused assaulted her was also a pup tent.  
      It was not cut.  There were also adult tents there, full size tents.  They 
      were not cut but all of the rest of the pup tents which she would say was 
      around five or so pup tents were all cut and that they had a cut in them 
      in an “L” shape with a flap.</p>

  </span> There were several similarities between the 1985 incident and this incident.  
  Both involved sexual attacks on young girls while they were sleeping in tents 
  at campgrounds.  Both occurred in the dead of night.  While they did not occur 
  at the same campsite, both were located in the eastern part of Ontario.  Both 
  victims were fondled by their attacker, although the physical activity in 1985 
  went beyond that which occurred in this case.  The victims were both in tents 
  in which there were no adults and in both cases the supervising adults were 
  in nearby tents.  Finally, in both incidents, one or more tents at the scene 
  of the assaults were slashed in an “L”-shaped fashion.  In the 1985 incident, 
  the victim’s tent was not slashed, but some of the other tents were slashed.  
  In this incident the victim’s tent was slashed in two places and the other tent 
  at the campsite was not slashed.</p>

  </span> The trial judge had the benefit of full and focused argument.  The Crown 
  argued that the similarities between the two incidents were sufficient to make 
  it unlikely that the offences were committed by two different people.  Counsel 
  for the appellant argued that while there were similarities, those similarities 
  were not in relation to unique or distinct matters.  He also referred to several 
  differences between the two incidents and the long period of time between the 
  two events (6 years).  Both counsel put the issue to the trial judge as one 
  involving a consideration of the potential probative value of the evidence on 
  the issue of identity weighed against the potential prejudice to the accused 
  inherent in evidence of prior misconduct.  They acknowledged the potential prejudice 
  of evidence that the appellant had previously sexually molested a young girl.  
  The real dispute centered on the potential probative value of the evidence.</p>

  </span> The trial judge ultimately determined that she had “doubts” as to the 
  probative value of the evidence which she considered to be potentially “highly 
  prejudicial”.  She excluded the evidence saying in part:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>On a superficial level the cutting of a pup tent may be viewed as a badge, 
      a unique, as a modus of operating for an offender who assaults pubescent 
      girls who are in tents.  However, as defence counsel suggested sexual attacks 
      in camp parks are not that uncommon and I have to agree with that.</p>
    <p>One may also deduce that cutting a pup tent is not that different from 
      say, in another type of offence, smashing a window or putting a boot to 
      a door, and I do not consider the cutting of an “L” shape flap a unique 
      badge.</p>
    <p>This leaves the sexual assaults themselves and their location, which are 
      not entirely similar, that unusual.</p>
    <p><u>Considering the highly prejudicial effect of similar evidence in cases 
      of this kind and in offences where public disapproval is extremely high.  
      And considering the doubts I have expressed as to its actual probative value 
      as similar fact evidence, I have concluded that the balance tilts in favour 
      of not admitting the evidence tendered by the Crown.  And I therefore hold 
      it is not admissible.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> Cory J. also observed in <i>R. v. Arp, supra</i>, at p. 350, that unlike 
  most evidentiary rulings, a ruling on the admissibility of similar fact evidence 
  requires a trial judge to weigh the tendered evidence to determine its admissibility.  
  This weighing process requires both an evaluation of the probative value of 
  the evidence and a balancing of that probative value against the prejudicial 
  effect of the evidence. In considering probative value, trial judges must decide 
  what similarities exist between the similar fact evidence and the alleged offence 
  and the extent to which those similarities support the inference that the acts 
  were committed by the same person.  In making this evaluation, individual trial 
  judges will decide what significance should be attached to any given similarity 
  and to the sum total of the similarities.  The determination of probative value 
  is based on the trial judge’s individual impression of the evidence and is, 
  to some degree at least, an intuitive assessment that reflects that individual 
  judge’s experience and sense of what is fair.  The test for the admissibility 
  of similar fact evidence inevitably means that in some cases different judges 
  could come to different conclusions with respect to the admissibility of the 
  same similar fact evidence.</p>

  </span> The fact that the admissibility of similar fact evidence turns on assessments 
  as to the probative value of the evidence and its prejudicial effect, explains 
  the high degree of deference which appellate courts must give to trial judges’ 
  rulings on the admissibility of similar fact evidence.  In <i>R. v. B.(C.R.), 
  supra</i>, at p. 23, McLachlan J. said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>A third feature of this court’s treatment of the similar fact rule since 
      <i>Boardman</i> [[1975] A.C. 421 (H.L.)] is the tendency to accord a high 
      degree of respect to the decision of the trial judge, who is charged with 
      the delicate process of balancing the probative value of the evidence against 
      its prejudicial effect.</u> …  This deference to the trial judge may in 
      part be seen as a function of the broader, more discretionary nature of 
      the modern rule at the stage where the probative value of the evidence must 
      be weighed against its prejudicial effect.  As a consequence of the rejection 
      of the category approach, the admissibility of similar fact evidence since 
      <i>Boardman</i> is a matter which effectively involves a certain amount 
      of discretion. …  <u>Generally, where the law accords a large degree of 
      discretion to a trial judge, courts of appeal are reluctant to interfere 
      with the exercise of that discretion in the absence of demonstrated error 
      of law or jurisdiction.</u>   [Emphasis added.] </p>

  </span> There is no suggestion that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence 
  relevant to the determination of the admissibility of the similar fact evidence.  
  Counsel does argue that the trial judge erred in law by misapplying the concept 
  of prejudice in determining the admissibility of the similar fact evidence.

  </span> I do not think that this passage signals any misunderstanding of the 
  prejudice to be considered in determining the admissibility of the similar fact 
  evidence.  Crown counsel’s argument that the trial judge focussed on the prejudice 
  inherent in the charge of sexual assault rather than the prejudice created by 
  the similar fact evidence, does not make sense in this case. The conduct alleged 
  in the charge and the conduct described in the similar fact evidence both refer 
  to sexual assaults on young girls.  The distinction which the Crown claims led 
  to the trial judge’s misapprehension of the concept of prejudice simply does 
  not arise in this case.  </p>

  </span> The trial judge’s reference to “cases of this kind” seems to me to be 
  no more than an honest acknowledgement that in cases involving the sexual abuse 
  of children, there is a real risk of improper propensity reasoning if the Crown 
  is allowed to adduce evidence that the accused had sexually abused a child on 
  another occasion.  The reference to “public disapproval” is again an honest 
  acknowledgement that in cases involving the sexual abuse of children there is 
  a risk that the verdict will reflect public disapproval of the crime rather 
  than an objective assessment of the accused’s culpability for the crime.  That 
  concern is properly captured by the concept of prejudice as used in the determination 
  of the admissibility of similar fact evidence.  I find no error in the trial 
  judge’s consideration of the potential prejudice of this evidence.</p>

  </span> Crown counsel also argued that even if the trial judge did not misapprehend 
  the evidence and did apply the correct legal test, her ruling is so clearly 
  wrong that this court should interfere.  Counsel contends that the similarities 
  between the similar fact evidence and this alleged offence are so many and so 
  distinctive that a proper application of the test for admissibility could result 
  only in a ruling that the evidence was admissible.  I take this to be a submission 
  that the trial judge’s ruling is unreasonable.  </p>

  </span> In advancing this submission, Crown counsel must contend with the deference 
  doctrine.  I think that doctrine can accommodate Crown counsel’s argument.  
  If an appellate court is satisfied that on a proper appreciation of the evidence 
  and a proper application of the applicable test for admissibility there is only 
  one reasonable result, either admission or exclusion, the appellate court should 
  intervene if the trial judge did not arrive at that result.  If, however, the 
  case is one in which the evidence is such that different trial judges acting 
  reasonably could come to different conclusions as to the admissibility of the 
  evidence depending on their assessments of probative value and prejudicial effect, 
  then the appellate court must defer to the decision of the trial court.</p>

  </span> I am not prepared to hold that the trial judge’s ruling excluding the 
  evidence reaches the point of unreasonableness.  The similarities relied on 
  in this court were referred to by the trial judge in her ruling.  She was not 
  as impressed by the combination of these similarities as the Crown thinks she 
  should have been.  Perhaps the key similarity is the slashing of the tents.  
  The Crown referred to the slashing of the tents as the intruder’s “badge or 
  calling card”.  The trial judge considered that evidence, but described it as 
  more akin to evidence of a broken window or kicked in door in a break and enter 
  case.  In this regard, she does not appear to have accepted the contention that 
  the way the tents were ripped was somehow distinctive.  She simply did not accept 
  that the slashing of tents at both campsites was a unique or distinctive feature.  
  I think this is exactly the kind of assessment which must be left to trial judges.  
  Certainly, this court is in no better position than the trial judge to assess 
  the significance of the evidence concerning the slashing of the tents.  </p>

  </span> It must be stressed that the trial judge was not blind to the similarities 
  between the two incidents and the support those similarities afforded for the 
  Crown’s claim that the two assaults were committed by the same person.  She 
  was not, however, so impressed by those similarities as to be satisfied that 
  they gave the similar fact evidence sufficient probative value to <u>clearly</u> 
  outweigh the significant prejudicial effect flowing from admission of the evidence.  
  The six-year gap between the incidents was also germane to the potential probative 
  force of the evidence.</p>

  </span> The fact that this trial judge was not prepared to give the similar 
  fact evidence the probative value that other trial judges acting reasonably 
  might well have given it does not constitute reversible error.  I think the 
  trial judge’s ultimate assessment that the probative value did not clearly outweigh 
  the prejudicial effect was within the broad range of what should be considered 
  reasonable in the circumstances.  I would defer to her decision.</p>

  evidence, the conviction cannot be supported and must be set aside.  However, 
  as I take a different view as to the trial judge's ruling on the admissibility

  is to enter an acquittal.  In my view, the ruling of the trial judge refusing 
  to admit the similar fact evidence reveals reversible error.  If admitted, the 
  similar fact evidence, together with the identification evidence, would be capable 
  in law of supporting a guilty verdict, and accordingly, rather than enter an 
  acquittal, I would direct a new trial.</p>

  </span> When she made her ruling, the trial judge did not have the benefit of 
  the Supreme Court of Canada's decision in <i>R. v. Arp</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 321, the leading Canadian authority on the use of similar fact evidence 
  where identity is at issue.  In <i>Arp</i> at p. 340, Cory J. distinguished 
  between similar fact evidence that merely shows disposition, i.e., that the 
  accused<i> “is the type of person”</i> to commit the offence, and similar fact 
  evidence that shows that “<i>the accused is the very person </i>who committed 
  the crime” (my emphasis).  Similar fact evidence in the former category is inadmissible; 
  although relevant, the prejudicial effect of disposition evidence outweighs 
  it probative value.  Similar fact evidence will fall into the second category 
  and may be admitted if, as Cory J. stated, “the high degree of similarity between 
  the acts renders the likelihood of coincidence objectively improbable.” </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Cory J. at p. 342 elaborated the test to be applied, describing “a principled 
  approach” in which the admissibility turns “on the finding that the accused’s 
  involvement in the alleged similar acts or counts is unlikely to be the product 
  of coincidence”.  It is the “objective improbability that the accused’s involvement 
  in the alleged acts is the product of coincidence” that gives the evidence its 
  probative force.  Cory J. noted that where similar fact evidence is adduced 
  on the issue of identity “there must be a high degree of similarity between 
  the acts for the evidence to be admitted.”  Of particular importance to the 
  present appeal is the following passage which makes it clear that while a unique 
  trade mark or badge is sufficient to warrant admission of the similar fact evidence, 
  it is not a necessary condition for admissibility : </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… a unique trade mark or signature will automatically render the alleged 
      acts “strikingly similar” and therefore highly probative and admissible.  
      In the same way, <i>a number of significant similarities, taken together, 
      may be such that by their cumulative effect, they warrant admission of the 
      evidence</i> [emphasis added].  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Cory J. went on to state at pp. 353-4 that “the correct approach to 
  a consideration of similar fact evidence by a jury is the 'cumulative' or 'pooling' 
  approach” in which the jury should be instructed as follows: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… once they have concluded that there is sufficient likelihood that the 
      same person committed the alleged similar acts, they may consider all the 
      evidence relating to the similar acts in considering whether the accused 
      is guilty of the act in question.</p>

line-height:normal'> [62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I read her ruling, the trial judge applied a stricter test for admissibility 
  than that set out by Cory J.  She ruled that the similar act evidence in question 
  should not be admitted as it did not amount to “a unique badge”.  As the passages 
  I have quoted show, <i>Arp</i> holds that while a unique trade mark or signature 
  will <i>automatically</i> render the evidence admissible, a unique trade mark 
  or signature is not <i>required</i>.  Rather, a “pooling” approach is appropriate 
  and if there are a number of significant similarities that when taken together 
  establish an objective unlikelihood of coincidence, the evidence may be admitted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While I accept that a high level of deference must be accorded to the 
  rulings of trial judges on the admissibility of similar fact evidence, such 
  rulings are not immune from appellate review if the trial judge erred by applying 
  incorrect legal principles: see, eg. <i>R. v. Hardy</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 
  257 (C.A.); <i>R. v. McDonald</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 273 (Ont. C.A.).  
  I would also note certain features of the nature and circumstances of the ruling 
  at issue here that seem pertinent to the issue of deference.  The ruling at 
  issue was made at the very outset of the trial, before any evidence had been 
  heard.  Crown counsel outlined the nature of the proposed similar fact evidence 
  and gave a very brief sketch of other evidence he proposed to call.  Both counsel 
  made their submissions and the trial judge gave her brief oral ruling immediately 
  thereafter.  The ruling was not influenced by any particular advantage the trial 
  judge had in appreciating the impact the evidence would have on the trial.  
  Nor did the ruling turn on any advantage the trial judge had in appreciating 
  the balance between prejudicial effect and probative value.  In these circumstances, 
  the case for appellate deference is less compelling than where the ruling is 
  made during the course of a trial in circumstances where the trial judge uniquely 
  well-placed to appreciate the significance and impact it is likely to have.</p>

  </span> As the trial judge erred in law by failing to consider these similarities 
  in the manner required by the <i>Arp</i> test, it is open to this court to review 
  her ruling.  The trial judge dismissed the similarities of the time, place and 
  type of assault by agreeing with defence counsel's suggestion that “sexual attacks 
  in camp parks are not that uncommon.”  Given this list of similarities, the 
  similar act evidence was significantly more distinctive than a “routine” sexual 
  assault in a park.  The trial judge also dismissed the “L” shaped slashes in 
  the tents as being the equivalent of “smashing a window or putting a boot to 
  a door.”  I cannot accept this as a reasonable conclusion on the evidence.  
  Smashing a window or kicking in a door are common methods of gaining access 
  to a building for illicit purposes.  The same cannot be said of slashing tents 
  in a particular and distinctive manner for in conjunction with sexual assaults 
  on pubescent girls in the middle of the night.  Indeed, it seems to me that 
  the manner of slashing the tents could well amount to “a unique badge”, although 
  I need not go that far.  Even if it did not, when combined with the other similarities 
  as to place and nature of the assaults, the evidence did in my view satisfy 
  the <i>Arp</i> test and establish the objective unlikelihood of coincidence.

  </span> I conclude, accordingly, that the trial judge erred by applying the 
  wrong legal test, and that the application of the correct test yields a different 
  result.  It is my view that the significant similarities, when pooled together, 
  were sufficient to establish the objective improbability of coincidence and 
  to show that it was more likely than not that the same person had committed 
  the similar acts.</p>
