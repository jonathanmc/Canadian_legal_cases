  Higginbottom was declared a dangerous offender and sentenced to a determinate 
  sentence totaling eleven years imprisonment in addition to the time he spent 
  in pre-trial and pre-disposition custody. His parole eligibility was fixed by

  under s.100 and s.161 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, C.&nbsp;C-46 
  were imposed for life. Mr. Higginbottom appeals against the conviction. The 
  Crown appeals against sentence. I will deal with each appeal in turn.</span></p>

  complainant asked the appellant if he could borrow $10 for cigarettes. The complainant 
  went with the appellant to an instant bank machine. The appellant withdrew $100

  refused and the appellant punched him in the jaw, knocking him off his bike. 
  The complainant swore at the appellant and rode away. After the incident with 
  the complainant, the appellant approached the complainants friends, exposed 
  his penis, and masturbated in front of them. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>At trial, after a <i>voir dire</i>, the Crown 
  was permitted to introduce evidence of prior discreditable conduct that consisted 
  of three sexual assaults to which the appellant had pleaded guilty. The evidence 
  was introduced by means of the transcripts from the guilty plea. The evidence 
  is summarized in the Crowns factum as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>On December 6, 1987, the victim Jed, a 14 year old boy was walking home 
      in Hamilton at 8:00 p.m. The appellant stopped his car and waited for the 
      victim to walk towards him. When the victim was near, the appellant jumped 
      out and asked Jed if he wanted to make $10. The victim said yes. The appellant 
      then said that he wanted to take pictures of him for $10. The victim declined. 
      The appellant grabbed the victim by the arms, pulled him down some steps, 
      into the city yard and placed him on the ground. The appellant pulled his 
      pants down and pulled the victim's pants down.  He then laid on top of the 
      victim and simulated intercourse by rubbing his penis against Jed.  After 
      a few minutes the appellant ejaculated into the ground. The victim asked 
      why he was doing this. The appellant said that he liked boys over girls. 
      <i><span lang=EN-GB></span></i></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>On April 16, 1988, at 5:30 p.m., the victim, Cary, a 12 year old boy 
      and his friend, were playing in a field in Oakville. The appellant approached 
      them with a Polaroid camera and made &quot;small talk&quot;. He then asked 
      whether they would allow him to photograph them with their pants off for 
      $10. Both boys refused. They were afraid. The appellant grabbed Cary and 
      forced him to the ground, held him down and started to kiss his lips. The 
      victim struggled but he could not get away. The appellant tried to place 
      his hands down the front of the victim's pants but was unsuccessful. The 
      friend tried to push the appellant off but was unable to. He then threw 
      the appellant's camera away, allowing them to run away when the appellant 
      retrieved it.</span></p>
    <p>The appellant approached the victim, Paul, a 10 year old boy, on August 
      21,1988 and asked him for directions. Paul was on his bike in Burlington. 
      It was 8:15 am. The appellant then grabbed his handlebars, took him around 
      a dumpster and told Paul he would pay him to take a picture and lick his 
      genitals.  Paul told him to stop.  The appellant placed Paul on his back 
      and got on top of him. He pulled down Paul's pants and fondled his genitals 
      and buttocks for a few minutes.  Paul yelled no. The victim yelled louder, 
      the appellant let go and the victim drove away. Paul looked back and saw 
      the appellant exposing himself. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On a second <i>voir dire</i>, the defence challenged the constitutionality 
  of the search and seizure of Mr.&nbsp;Higginbottoms apartment pursuant to sections 
  8 and 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. The search was made pursuant to a search 
  warrant that itemized various items in eighteen paragraphs.  Paragraph 18, which 
  listed items described as &quot;pedophile material&quot;, resulted in the seizure 
  of the material that forms the subject-matter of one of the convictions. The 
  trial judge found that paragraph 18 lacked specificity and that section 8 of 
  the <i>Charter</i> had been violated to that extent. He concluded, however, 
  that the police had acted in good faith and that the warrant was executed in 
  a professional manner. He further found that since the offences were serious, 
  admitting the evidence would not bring the administration of justice into disrepute. 
  Consequently, he ruled that the evidence should not be excluded under s.24(2) 
  of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant raises three main grounds of appeal. He submits 
  that the trial judge erred, first, in admitting the evidence of prior discreditable 
  conduct under the similar fact rule, second, in finding that the assault was 
  sexual in nature, and third, in failing to exclude the pornographic material 
  seized from his apartment.  The appellant argues further that the verdict is 
  unreasonable. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>I would not give effect to any of the grounds 
  of appeal. My reasons can be stated briefly as follows. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>A trial judges decision on the admissibility 
  of evidence of prior discreditable conduct involves a delicate balancing of 
  the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect and is entitled 
  to a high degree of deference upon appellate review: see <i>R. v. B.(C.R.)</i>, 
  [1990] 1 S.C.R. 717 at 733-34. It is apparent from the trial judges reasons 
  that he viewed the proposed evidence as sufficiently similar to be probative 
  on the question whether the assault that formed the subject-matter of the charge 
  before the court was sexual in nature. He was also alive to the potential prejudice 
  arising from this kind of evidence. In my view, the trial judges assessment 
  of the evidence and his conclusion that its probative value exceeded its potential 
  prejudicial effect were reasonable. I see no reason to interfere with the exercise 
  of his discretion in admitting the evidence at trial. In any event, I note that 
  it does not appear from the trial judges reasons that he placed much weight, 
  if any, on the evidence of prior discreditable conduct in arriving at his verdict 
  on the sexual offences.</span></p>

  </span></span> More importantly, it is my view that it was entirely open to 
  the trial judge to conclude that the assault in question in this case was sexual 
  in nature based solely on the evidence relating to the charge before the court. 
  The words spoken by the appellant when he invited the complainant to perform 
  fellatio on him were clearly sexual in nature. These words, coupled with the 
  intentional application of force upon the complainant immediately following 
  the complainants refusal to comply, constitute a sufficient basis for the trial 
  judges finding that the assault was sexual in nature: see <i>R. v. Chase</i> 
  (1987), 37 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.); and <i>Bernard v. The Queen</i> (1988), 
  45 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In <i>R. v. Chase</i>, the Supreme Court of 
  Canada defined sexual assault as follows (at 103):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Sexual assault is an assault within any one of the definitions of that 
      concept in s. 244(1) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>which is committed in circumstances 
      of a sexual nature, such that the sexual integrity of the victim is violated. 
      The test to be applied in determining whether the impugned conduct has the 
      requisite sexual nature is an objective one: &quot;Viewed in the light of 
      all the circumstances, is the sexual or carnal context of the assault visible 
      to a reasonable observer?&quot;  <i>The part of the body touched, the nature 
      of the contact, the situation in which it occurred, the words and gestures 
      accompanying the act, and all other circumstances surrounding the conduct, 
      including threats which may or may not be accompanied by force, will be 
      relevant: </i>see S.J. Usprich, &quot;A New Crime in Old Battles: Definitional 
      Problems with Sexual Assault&quot;, 29 Crim. L.Q. 200 at p. 204. The intent 
      or purpose of the person committing the act, to the extent that this may 
      appear from the evidence, may also be a factor in considering whether the 
      conduct is sexual. If the motive of the accused is sexual gratification, 
      to the extent that this may appear from the evidence it may be a factor 
      in determining whether the conduct is sexual. It must be emphasized, however, 
      that the existence of such a motive is simply one of many factors to be 
      considered, the importance of which will vary depending on the circumstances.

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Wilson J. in <i>Bernard v. The Queen</i> described 
  sexual assault in the following terms (at 39):</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Sexual assault is a crime of violence.  There is no requirement of an intent 
      or purpose beyond the intentional application of force.  It is first and 
      foremost an assault.  It is sexual in nature only because, objectively viewed, 
      it is related to sex either on account of the area of the body to which 
      the violence is applied or on account of words accompanying the violence.</p>

  by the Quebec Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Alceus</i> (2000), 151 C.C.C. (3d) 
  91<i>.</i>  In that case, the accused struck the complainant, with whom he was 
  then having a sexual encounter in his bed, for refusing to perform fellatio 
  on him. The trial judge acquitted him of sexual assault and convicted him of 
  assault simpliciter. The Quebec Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the Crown 
  and substituted a conviction for sexual assault, finding that the striking of 
  the complainant upon her refusal to perform oral sex constituted a violation 
  of her sexual integrity. The court held (at 96):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>When a denial of sexual gratification is punished by physical harm, the 
      sexual integrity of the victim is no less violated than when compliance 
      is secured by force.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appeal against conviction on the charge

  in refusing to exclude the evidence under s.24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>. In 
  particular, the appellant takes issue with the finding that the police acted 
  in good faith. The trial judge accepted the police officers testimony that 
  identity was an issue at the time the warrant was issued and that he believed 
  that the impugned material would assist in that regard. </span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, it was open to the trial judge to 
  make this finding. The officer was relying on evidence that the appellant was 
  in the habit of making diaries with respect to his sexual encounters. Paragraph 
  18, in part, targeted the appellants own writings. Although paragraph 18 in 
  its totality was far too wide in scope, which the trial judge recognized in 
  finding that the search was unreasonable, that fact, in and of itself, does 
  not detract from the reasonableness of the trial judges finding on the good 
  faith of the officer as contended by counsel. The trial judges findings are 
  entitled to deference and should not be interfered with on appellate review 
  absent an error in principle or an unreasonable finding. I see no reason to 
  interfere with the trial judges exercise of discretion in admitting the evidence 
  of pornographic material. </span></p>

  </span></span> The evidence on the dangerous offender application was extensive 
  and overwhelmingly in support of the trial judges finding that Mr. Higginbottom 
  is a dangerous offender. Indeed, at the conclusion of the dangerous offender 
  hearing, counsel for Mr. Higginbottom conceded that his client was a dangerous 
  offender and that finding is not an issue on this appeal.  The sole issue is 
  whether the trial judge erred in imposing a determinate sentence rather than 
  an indeterminate one.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is not disputed that, on the basis of the 
  <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions that were in force at the time, the trial judge 
  had a residual discretion to impose a determinate sentence. He chose to exercise 
  this discretion for the following reasons:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>In the case at bar, given that Mr. Higginbottom has not been previously 
      incarcerated in a Federal penitentiary, I am inclined to agree with Dr. 
      Ben&nbsp;Aron that it is premature to say that Mr. Higginbottom is an untreatable 
      dangerous offender.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>Perhaps a penitentiary treatment program will be a conducive environment 
      to help him overcome his denial and accept responsibility for his behavior, 
      as well as help him to recognize the damaging effects his behavior has on 
      young boys.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>On all the evidence a dangerous offender finding is obviously appropriate. 
      However, it is simply too soon to say that Mr.&nbsp;Higginbottom is untreatable 
      in light of Dr. Barberry's testimony that denial can be treated quite successfully 
      in 80% of the cases. Given Dr. Barberry's evidence, there is reason to be 
      less skeptical that Mr. Higginbottom will, in fact, have little or no access 
      to the treatment necessary to ensure both his potential rehabilitation and 
      protect society's future interests.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>. . . .</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>This will be the accused's first penitentiary term. The emotional and 
      psychological repercussions to his victims were clearly obvious in this 
      courtroom. Fortunately for the accused the concomitant physical violence 
      often seen in other situations of this nature was not present to a significant 
      degree. Given all of these particular circumstances, I am inclined to the 
      view that this is an exceptional case which merits a determinate sentence 
      at this time.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge also made the following observation:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-GB>I have also considered the issue of the individual's potential incentive 
      to accept and respond to the program offered. An indefinite sentence is 
      not given the same priority as a determinate sentence where earlier access 
      may assist in driving home the reality of a need to change and prepare for 
      a responsible return to the community.</span></p>
    <p><i><span lang=EN-US>Indeed, as I recall the evidence of Dr. Barberry, the 
      indeterminate sentence may mean that an inmate, subject to other vicissitudes 
      of the penitentiary life would have no access to treatment for up to 17 
      years.</span></i><span lang=EN-US> [Emphasis added].</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is common ground between the parties that the trial judge 
  misapprehended the evidence in making the latter remark. Dr. Barberry testified 
  that, on average, an offender who receives an indeterminate sentence is likely 
  to serve 17 years in jail, not that he is likely to wait 17 years before receiving 
  treatment. The Crown submits that the trial judges erroneous belief that Mr. 
  Higginbottom, if sentenced to an indeterminate term, would not receive any treatment 
  for 17 years may well have misled him in imposing a  determinate sentence despite 
  the fact that the evidence did not support the imposition of such. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge made reference to two items 
  of evidence in support of his conclusion that this was an exceptional case that 
  warranted the imposition of a determinate sentence: Dr. Ben-Arons opinion that 
  it was premature to say that Mr.&nbsp;Higginbottom was untreatable; and Dr. 
  Barberrys statement that denial can successfully be treated in 80% of the cases. 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In my view, this evidence cannot support the 
  trial judges finding. When Dr. Ben-Arons opinion is considered in context, 
  it is clear that he was simply expressing some hope for Mr. Higginbottoms future 
  treatment. While Dr. Ben-Aron disagreed that the hope of treating Mr. Higginbottom 
  was negligible because he had demonstrated some control over his pedophilia 
  from 1991 to 1996, he agreed that the fact that he had not reoffended over this 
  five-year period was no guarantee for the future. Dr. Ben-Aron testified that 
  Mr. Higginbottoms biggest difficulty was the <i>tenacity </i>of his denial 
  that he has a problem. Dr. Ben-Aron was of the view that until Mr. Higginbottom 
  accepted that he has a problem, <i>he would respond poorly </i>to any future 
  treatment effort. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Dr. Barberrys evidence about the treatability of persons in 
  denial was general in nature and did not relate to Mr. Higginbottoms situation. 
  The trial judges reliance on this general statement as an indicator of Mr. 
  Higginbottoms chances at rehabilitation cannot be supported in light of the 
  uncontradicted evidence, accepted by the trial judge, that Mr. Higginbottom 
  had not even begun to recognize the seriousness of his condition.  Dr. Klassens 
  diagnosis, which was also uncontradicted, was that Mr. Higginbottoms dominant 
  condition consisted of pedohebephilia, an attraction to prepubescent and pubescent 
  individuals. Dr. Klassen testified that Mr. Higginbottom showed signs of <i>severe 
  </i>pedohebephilia as he appeared to be entirely overwhelmed by his pedohebephilic 
  interests, having <span
lang=EN-GB>abandoned most normal activities of daily living in the service of 
  pursuing paedophilia. Dr. Klassen further </span><span
lang=EN-US>testified that Mr. Higginbottom had absorbed little from previous treatment, 
  that there was <i>no realistic prospect</i> that he could be treated, and that 
  any hope in this respect was negligible. His devotion to his deviant sexual 
  impulses and that subculture made him a substantial risk to the community with 
  the likelihood of re-offending approaching 100%. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span> </span>In my view, the trial judge erred in exercising 
  his discretion to impose a determinate sentence in the absence of any evidence 
  specific to Mr. Higginbottom that he could be rehabilitated within a fixed period 
  of time. In fact, the evidence relating to the treatment possibilities overwhelmingly 
  pointed to the opposite conclusion. Just as this court concluded in <i>R. v. 
  Poutsoungas</i>, (1989), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 388 (Ont. C.A.), it is my view that 
  the trial judges error in law in the exercise of his discretion, on the facts 
  of this case, has resulted in a failure to give effect to the basic purpose 
  of the dangerous offender provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the protection 
  of the public. </p>
