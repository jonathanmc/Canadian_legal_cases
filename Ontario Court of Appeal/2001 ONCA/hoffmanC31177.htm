<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice David S. Crane dated November 16, 1998.</p>
<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>BY THE COURT:</span></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In November 1995, the respondent Peter Hoffman was hired to be the general 
  manager of the appellant VRP Web Technology Inc., a start-up research and development 
  company.  He signed an employment contract, which by its terms, could be terminated 
  by either party on three months’ notice.  In February 1997, Hoffman was summarily 
  dismissed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> He sued VRP Web for damages for wrongful dismissal and for a declaration 
  that his employment contract was unenforceable. He also sued the appellants 
  Rotoflex International Holdings Ltd. and its two principals, Reinhard Muhs and 
  Valentine Rimas, who together controlled VRP Web, for damages for misrepresentation.  
  The trial judge concluded that Hoffman had been dismissed without cause, and 
  that his employment contract was unenforceable because of misrepresentations 
  made by all the appellants.  He ordered that the appellants pay Hoffman damages 
  equivalent to one year’s salary.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants advance two main grounds of appeal:  first, the trial 
  judge erred in failing to find that Hoffman was dismissed for cause; and second, 
  the trial judge erred in holding that the employment contract was unenforceable.  
  We do not agree with the appellants’ first ground of appeal, but we do agree 
  with the second.  In our view, Hoffman’s damages are limited to the equivalent 
  of three months’ notice against VRP Web, as stipulated in his employment contract.</p>
<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>BACKGROUND</span></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Hoffman, Muhs and Rimas met at a trade show in Germany in May 1995.  
  At the time, Rotoflex had a $10 million research contract with the Ontario government 
  under its R2000 or SciTech program.  Muhs and Rimas proposed that Hoffman join 
  them in forming a new company – VRP Web – that would do the research for the 
  R2000 contract and then develop into a free-standing research and development 
  company.  Hoffman would manage the company and own 35% of the shares; Muhs, 
  Rimas and Rotoflex would own the other 65%.  Hoffman was to be paid a salary 
  of $120,000 per year plus a percentage of the revenues in the R2000 contract 
  to a maximum of $5,000 per month.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The parties discussed the proposal over the next few weeks.  In August 
  1995, Hoffman and his family moved from Germany to Canada.  In early November 
  1995, Muhs and Rimas presented Hoffman with a draft employment contract, which 
  he signed on November 7, 1995.  This contract became the focal point of the 
  lawsuit.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Disputes arose between the parties, principally centering on whether 
  VRP Web was properly capitalized, on Hoffman’s desire for more authority, and 
  ultimately on his desire to purchase the appellants’ shares in VRP Web.  In 
  early February 1997, after Hoffman refused to sign a letter of resignation, 
  he was fired.</p>
<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>DISCUSSION</span></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found Hoffman to be a “highly credible witness” and 
  preferred his evidence where it differed from that of the appellants.  The appellants 
  do not challenge this finding of credibility on appeal.  Therefore, we must 
  examine the appellants' grounds of appeal in light of the trial judge’s credibility 
  finding.</p>
<h4>(i)            Cause for Dismissal</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge concluded that the appellants had failed to prove they 
  had cause to dismiss Hoffman.  In the trial judge’s words:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>On the issue of cause, I find that the Defendants failed to prove cause.  
      I find as fact, that the Plaintiff sought only a negotiation for corporate 
      re-structuring and a more central role for himself in VRP.  I reject the 
      Rimas evidence of an ultimatum.  I find the Plaintiff was loyal to his employment.  
      As a shareholder, he had every right to ask for a negotiation on a proposal 
      to purchase more shares.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants have not persuaded us of any basis to interfere with 
  this conclusion.  Therefore, the trial judge’s finding that Hoffman was wrongfully 
  dismissed stands.</p>
<h4>(ii)            The Enforceability of the Employment Contract</h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found that Hoffman’s employment contract was unenforceable 
  for two reasons.  First, he found that Muhs and Rimas misrepresented Hoffman's 
  job description and compounded their misrepresentation by failing to include 
  a job description in the written employment contract.  Second, he found that 
  Muhs, Rimas and Rotoflex failed to invest in VRP Web, when they represented 
  they would do so, thereby undermining VRP Web’s viability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The question we must answer on appeal is whether these two findings 
  are reasonably supported by the evidence, taking into account the trial judge’s 
  general finding of credibility in favour of Hoffman.  In our view, neither of 
  these findings is supported by the evidence, even by Hoffman’s own testimony.</p>
<p class=headingblank>            (a)            Alleged Misrepresentations Concerning 
  Hoffman’s Position</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Admittedly, the employment contract provided that it would include as 
  an Appendix “A” Hoffman’s job description, yet no Appendix “A” was attached 
  to the contract.  However, even without an Appendix “A”, paragraph 3 of the 
  contract specifically set out Hoffman’s duties and responsibilities.  In his 
  evidence in chief, he acknowledged that this paragraph was “an accurate statement” 
  of those duties and responsibilities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge seemed concerned that the appellants misrepresented 
  the extent to which Hoffman would control the operations of VRP Web.  Even apart 
  from the “entire agreement” clause in the employment contract, which is not 
  mentioned by the trial judge, the contract itself set out a long list of limits 
  on Hoffman’s authority and his obligation to seek the approval of the Board 
  of Directors for a wide array of transactions.  Hoffman was a minority shareholder 
  in VRP Web.  The appellants controlled the company and formed it initially to 
  help Rotoflex complete the R2000 contract.  Although Hoffman may have wanted 
  more control, when he signed his employment contract the limits on his authority 
  were made clear to him.  He could not realistically think that he would be given 
  free rein to run VRP Web.  In our view, the evidence at trial, including the 
  documentary evidence, does not support the trial judge’s finding of misrepresentations 
  concerning Hoffman’s position in the company.</p>
<p class=headingblank>            (b)            Failure to Invest</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> According to Hoffman, during the discussions preceding the signing of 
  the employment contract, Muhs and Rimas represented that they would inject a 
  minimum of $500,000 in start-up capital.  In effect, the trial judge found that 
  the appellants failed to honour this representation.  Again, even Hoffman’s 
  evidence does not support the trial judge’s finding.  Rotoflex injected nearly 
  $800,000 in VRP Web in its first year of operation.  It did so by paying the 
  invoices rendered by VRP Web.  Hoffman acknowledged in his cross-examination 
  that the appellants never specified, either orally or in writing, the form of 
  the VRP Web financing.  The business plan for the new company prepared in late 
  September 1995 contemplated that the initial financing for the new company would 
  come from Rotoflex’s work.  The plan said, “In order to initiate the business, 
  the Rotoflex Group will act as the first customer and will therefore supply 
  this new venture with the necessary funds.”  Therefore, the trial judge’s finding 
  that the appellants failed to invest in VRP Web cannot stand.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence does show that while Hoffman was employed with VRP Web, 
  the company was constantly in need of cash.  Proper capitalization was an ongoing 
  problem, a problem that is perhaps typical of most start-up research and development 
  companies.  But we are satisfied that the appellants met the financing obligation 
  that the trial judge found to exist.</p>
<h1><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>CONCLUSION</span></h1>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The two bases for the trial judge’s conclusion that the employment contract 
  was unenforceable are not reasonably supported by the evidence.  Therefore, 
  this conclusion cannot stand.  Nor can his conclusion that Rotoflex, Muhs and 
  Rimas are liable to Hoffman.  Having been wrongfully dismissed, Hoffman is limited 
  to his remedy under his employment contract:  three months’ salary or $45,000 
  in lieu of notice to be paid by VRP Web.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge found that Hoffman had earned $34,000 in the year following 
  his dismissal, and deducted this amount from the award of damages.  But he made 
  no express finding on how much Hoffman earned in the first three months after 
  he was fired.  Hoffman, however, testified that he spent these first three months 
  looking for work and only after that period did he begin doing contract work.  
  Accepting Hoffman’s evidence, we conclude that no amount should be deducted 
  from our $45,000 damages award.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, the judgment of Crane J. is varied as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> (i)         Paragraph 3 is varied to provide that VRP Web shall pay Hoffman 
      $45,000 plus pre-judgment interest.</p>
    <p> (ii)       Paragraph 4 is set aside.</p>
    <p> (iii)      Subject to any offers to settle, paragraph 6 is varied to provide 
      that VRP Web shall pay the respondents their costs of the action in the 
      amount ordered by the trial judge, $38,331.42.</p>
    <p> (iv)       The action is dismissed without costs against Rotoflex, Muhs 
      and Rimas.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants are entitled to the costs of the appeal.  Hoffman may 
  set off these costs against the money owed to him by VRP Web.</p>
