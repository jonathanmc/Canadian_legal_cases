<p class=MsoHeader><b><span lang=EN-US>AUSTIN J.A.:</span></b></p>
<h3><u><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></u></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Robert Timothy Holden (“Holden”) appeals from 
  his conviction on charges of sexual assault and kidnapping following a trial 
  before Daudlin J. with a jury and from the sentence imposed of eight years imprisonment.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appeal from the appellant’s conviction following a 
  second trial.  The first trial, which resulted in a hung jury, was held in January, 
  1997.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the appellant advanced their argument respecting 
  the appeal against conviction on a variety of grounds, namely unreasonable verdict; 
  weaknesses and conflicts in identification; collusion and collaboration among 
  the witnesses; the trial judge’s failure to allow a challenge for cause relating 
  to publicity that occurred on the occasion of the earlier trial; the judge’s 
  failure to respond to a question from the jury; and the dismissal of a <i>Corbett</i> 
  application.  However, the focus of the appellant’s submission is that the verdict 
  reached by the jury was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence.  
  After carefully reviewing the evidence, I would give effect to this ground of 
  appeal.  Based on my analysis of the evidence which follows, I would allow the 
  appeal, set aside the verdict of the jury and enter an acquittal on all charges.</p>
<h3><u><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></u></h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown’s case was that the complainants, K.C. and C.R., then 
  ages 13 and 14  respectively, attended a Hallowe’en party at a school in or 
  near Windsor, Ontario, returning to K.C.’s home after 9 p.m. on October 27, 
  1995.  K.C.’s parents were away on holidays and her grandparents were caring 
  for her and her brother J.C., age 18.  K.C. had arranged with her grandparents 
  for C.R. to stay overnight.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The girls got into a verbal and physical altercation with J.C. 
  and his friend David Kelly and then decided to go for a walk to cool off.  K.C.’s 
  home was in a rural location.  According to both K.C. and C.R., they left the 
  house at about 1:30 a.m.  They did not have any plan and just kept walking down 
  Highway 18 until about 2:30 a.m.  Although there was little traffic, a few of 
  the cars that passed by stopped and the occupants offered them a ride.  Each 
  time they refused.  The girls said that eventually they decided to go to the 
  home of D.B., a friend of C.R., because they did not want to return to the K.C. 
  home.  D.B. lived on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Concession.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the way to D.B.’s,  K.C. said that a man in a pick-up truck 
  with “some kind of piping” (consistent with roll bars) stopped and offered to 
  take them “back to [his] brother’s house on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Concession”.  
  He mentioned that the girls probably knew his brother’s children, Heather and 
  Chris Holden, or went to school with them.  C.R. did not remember any piping 
  on the truck, but testified that the driver said that “his brother is a Holden, 
  just lived down the road”.  The girls declined the offer, the truck left and 
  they continued on their way to D.B.’s house. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> K.C. testified that just before they reached the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
  Concession a car pulled off the road beside them.  The driver asked them if 
  they were sure they did not want a ride.  C.R. testified that this occurred 
  about ten minutes after the pick-up truck had stopped.  Both girls testified 
  that they said “no” and that the occupant of the vehicle said they had better 
  get in the car as he had a gun pointed at them.  K.C. further testified that 
  the driver then said he had a gun pointed at their heads and if they didn’t 
  get in he would blow their heads off.  The complainants saw a long barrelled 
  type of gun pointing out of the window behind the passenger side.  The gun was 
  aimed at them.  They both got in the front seat of the car, C.R. first and then 
  K.C., and the driver drove off in the direction opposite to that in which they 
  had been walking.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to the complainants, the driver took them to two houses, 
  first the “farmhouse” and then the “white house”.  At the farmhouse, the driver 
  just pulled into the driveway and said he had to check for hunters.  He did 
  not get out of the car.  According to K.C., he told them he had just been divorced 
  and was required to move out of the house he was living in the following day.  
  He said he was going to get the girls to clean his house and pay them $25.00 
  each.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainants testified that after stopping briefly at the 
  farmhouse, they returned to the highway and headed towards Harrow.  They then 
  went to another property with a “white house” on it.  Their abductor told K.C. 
  to go into the house and to turn on the lights inside the front door.  He said 
  that if she tried to run away he would be able to find her and would kill her.  
  K.C. left the vehicle and went to the front door of the house.  The door was 
  not locked and she went inside.  She turned on one of the light switches, which 
  turned on the porch light, and stood inside the house waiting for the driver 
  and  C.R. to enter.  According to K.C., the abductor and C.R. then entered the 
  home from the side door.  The driver turned on the lights in the house. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The driver ordered them to sit on the couch.  He suggested that 
  one of them could clean the pots, but then changed his mind and told them to 
  go into the bedroom and sit on the bed.  K.C. testified that their captor followed 
  them into the bedroom.  He told her to stand in the corner and he lifted up 
  her shirt and fondled her chest.  He then  told her to sit on the bed and he 
  left the room with C.R. for about a minute.  They returned and he took an air 
  mattress out of the corner to block the window.  He then retrieved a knife from 
  the back of the bedroom door but put it back saying that he would not need it.  
  He then retrieved handcuffs from a “fanny” pouch that was kept in the bedroom.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The captor put the handcuffs on K.C.’s wrists behind her back.  
  According to K.C., he retrieved a brown towel off the back of the door and cut 
  strips off of it with the knife.  C.R. testified that their captor retrieved 
  the towel when he left the room with her and went to the utility room.  He tied 
  C.R.’s hands behind her back and put one of the strips around her mouth.  Then 
  he gagged K.C. with a strip of towel.  According to K.C., the captor asked both 
  her and C.R. if they had been with a man before, to which they replied, “No”.  
  Next he said that because K.C. had been “sassy in the car” she was going to 
  be the one.  He told C.R. to sit on the floor at the end of the bed.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> According to K.C., the assailant took off her pants and underwear.  
  C.R. closed her eyes.  The captor told K.C. to spread her legs, which she did.  
  She said she heard what she believed to be a condom wrapper being opened.  Thereafter, 
  the captor forcibly had sexual intercourse with K.C.  She closed her eyes and 
  told him it hurt a lot.  When he was done, she saw him wearing a condom.  K.C. 
  told him not to hurt C.R. and he said he wouldn’t because he took it all out 
  on her.  C.R. testified that they were in the residence for approximately 20 
  to 30 minutes.   K.C. estimated the time at the white house to be half an hour 
  to an hour. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The abductor then drove the complainants back to the farmhouse.  
  According to K.C., when they arrived at the farmhouse, he told them to go into 
  the shed and to count to 100.  He told them if they told anyone what had happened, 
  he would find them and kill them.  The assailant pulled away but came back after 
  a couple of seconds.  He asked the complainants their last names.  C.R. said 
  “D.” and K.C. said “N.”  He also asked where they lived.  K.C. said on Willow 
  Beach and C.R. said on the 3<sup>rd</sup> Concession, each of which were false.  
  K.C. testified that the assailant asked, “Who is my brother?” The girls responded 
  that they did not know.  He said that he (their abductor) was the same guy who 
  had stopped in the pick-up truck and had offered to take them to his brother’s 
  house.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The complainants waited in the shed for a little while before 
  resuming their walk to D.B.’s  house.  When a vehicle approached, the complainants 
  would hide and wait for it to pass.  D.B. testified that K.C. and C.R. woke 
  him by banging on the door.  He said he looked at the clock in his bedroom and 
  that it was 3:00 a.m.  According to K.C., she and C.R. had agreed that they 
  would not tell anybody what had happened, although D.B. testified that the complainants 
  were a little upset.  They were going to try to act “perfectly normal” and pretend 
  the abduction and sexual assault had never happened.  The complainants said 
  they told D.B. about the fight with K.C.’s brother, but not about the abduction 
  or sexual assault.  They watched television until about 4:30 a.m. and then went 
  to sleep.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> When they woke up, K.C., instead of telephoning home, which would 
  have awakened her grandparents, paged her brother J.C. to come and pick her 
  up.  He arrived with David Kelly who had stayed at the C. home overnight.  Kelly 
  and K.C.’s brother testified that they were unaware that K.C. and C.R. had left 
  the house.  Kelly and J.C. said that they went to bed after 1:00 a.m. and heard 
  a radio playing and two young women talking in K.C.’s room.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> K.C. left D.B.’s with her brother and Kelly.  They went into 
  town to get gas and then returned home.  Her grandparents were up.  K.C. did 
  not tell them what had happened overnight, but said simply that she and C.R. 
  had gotten up early because C.R. had to be somewhere else that day.  K.C. also 
  told her grandparents that C.R. would be by later to pick up her stuff. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Later that day, while going to the bathroom, K.C. noticed a three 
  inch spot of blood on her underwear.  She testified that she washed her underwear 
  with detergent and bleach to clean it and to “get out all traces of him”.  K.C. 
  did not save the underwear with the result that it was not available for forensic 
  testing. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After K.C. left the D.B. residence on the morning of October 
  28, C.R. told D.B. what had happened.  She was crying and shaken when she talked 
  to him. The day after the assault, K.C. testified that she became concerned 
  because she had told the assailant that her last name was N. and that she lived 
  on Willow Beach.  She had a friend with that name, J.N., who lived on that street.  
  She therefore decided to tell her friend what had happened to her and C.R., 
  which she did on the following Monday, October 30, 1995.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The same day D.B. and J.N. spoke on the telephone about what 
  they each had learned from K.C. and C.R.  Based on the description they had 
  been given of the assailant, they concluded that the appellant was the person 
  responsible.  They knew the appellant was the uncle of Chris Holden Jr. and 
  that he was residing at Chris Holden Jr.’s home.  They decided to confront the 
  appellant that evening.  </p>

  </span></span> When they went to confront the appellant, he opened the door 
  to the residence and J.N. asked him where he was on Friday night.  She further 
  confronted him with an accusation alleging abduction and sexual assault.  He 
  indicated that he had been at the residence all night and that he did not know 
  what they were talking about.  J.N. then asked to speak to Chris Holden Jr. 
  and again asked the appellant where he was on Friday night to which he responded 
  “I was here”.  She also asked him if he remembered two girls walking down the 
  highway late at night at approximately 1:40 a.m.  He looked at her as if she 
  were crazy and said “I was here”.  She also asked him if the name “N.” rang 
  a bell, the name K.C. had given to her assailant, to which he responded, “No, 
  I only know a little kid named N.”  J.N. also accused the appellant of raping 
  two of her friends.</p>

  </span></span> Over the next couple of days, D.B. and J.N. had frequent conversations 
  with C.R. and K.C. about reporting the matter to the police. D.B. and J.N. told 
  the complainants about their confrontation with the appellant and that they 
  believed that the appellant matched the description of the assailant.  D.B. 
  testified that the four of them (K.C., C.R., D.B. and J.N.) had talked so much 
  he could probably have written a book about it.  He further testified that he 
  recalled K.C. bringing up the possibility of reporting the matter through Crime 
  Stoppers and perhaps receiving money for the tip.  Both C.R. and K.C. denied 
  raising the issue of getting money by reporting the matter through Crime Stoppers 
  and explained that they only discussed going to Crime Stoppers because it was 
  anonymous.  </p>

  </span></span> On November 2, 1995, six days after the alleged assault, the 
  complainants together with D.B. and J.N., told Mr. Usher, a guidance counsellor 
  at their high school, what had happened.  Mr. Usher testified that K.C. was 
  most distressed.  He contacted the local Amherstburg Police Department and P.C. 
  Smith interviewed the complainants.  Ultimately, because of jurisdictional concerns, 
  the matter was transferred to the O.P.P. in Malden.  P.C. Wollison was the first 
  officer to investigate the matter for the O.P.P.  </p>

  </span></span> On November 2, 1995, prior to taking statements from the complainants, 
  P.C. Wollison took both complainants in his cruiser in an attempt to find the 
  properties where they had been taken.  He testified that they guided him by 
  telling him when and where to turn, although P.C. Wollison could not recall 
  who told him what.  First, they led him to the house where the assault was alleged 
  to have taken place.  When he turned into the driveway he testified that the 
  girls said: “That’s the house”, and started crying.  It was the home out of 
  which the appellant was moving.  After locating that property, they then attempted 
  to find the home where the complainants said they were released.  They took 
  him to the farmhouse.  Neither complainant told P.C. Wollison that in fact they 
  had been taken to this house first.  After identifying these places, K.C. and 
  C.R. were asked to draw sketches of the room where the assault took place, which 
  they each did independently of the other.  Separate statements were then taken 
  from them.  </p>

lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The police executed a search warrant at the white house and attempted 
  to find evidence linking the complainants to the residence and the appellant 
  to the assault.  This included a search of the appellant’s garbage in an attempt 
  to find the handcuffs, towel, pouch or condom.  No incriminating evidence was 
  found.  It was later discovered that the side door of the white house through 
  which K.C. testified C.R. and the assailant had entered the house, was nailed 
  and painted shut and had not been opened in years.  K.C. identified a photograph 
  of a bedroom in the white house as the room where the assault took place.</p>

  </span></span> The appellant was arrested on November 3, 1995.  He had been 
  told by friends that the police were looking for him and he voluntarily attended 
  at the police station.  He testified that he thought that the police wanted 
  to speak to him about an injured deer which he had shot a couple of weeks prior.  
  Upon arrival at the police station, he was arrested for the abduction and sexual 
  assault.  Without having consulted counsel, he voluntarily gave a statement 
  to the police, that was not tendered by the Crown at his trial.  The appellant 
  also consented to a search of his vehicle, a 1976 Chrysler New Yorker.  </p>

  </span></span> P. C. Hall testified that on November 3, 1995 he examined the 
  house where the alleged assault took place.  He examined for fingerprints the 
  light switch that K.C. testified she had touched to turn on the light on the 
  night of the assault.  He testified that the prints on the plate were too degraded 
  or smudged to render a suitable comparison.  P.C. Hall also testified that he 
  was not asked to examine any other parts of the house, and further, that he 
  made a decision not to examine the appellant’s vehicle for prints because of 
  the time that had elapsed between the commission of the alleged offences and 
  their disclosure.  P.C. Hall testified that he made no efforts to collect hair 
  samples from the car or the residence to make DNA comparisons with samples from 
  the complainants.  There was no fingerprint, foot impression, tire impression, 
  or DNA evidence linking the appellant to the offences or the complainants to 
  the farmhouse, the white house or the appellant’s car.  </p>

  </span></span> Dr. Brigitte Ala was called by the Crown to give expert opinion 
  evidence concerning her gynecological examination of K.C.  She examined the 
  complainant on December 14, 1995 and noted that there was no evidence of trauma 
  or scarring in the vaginal area including the hymen.  Dr. Ala opined that she 
  would not necessarily expect to see any signs of acute trauma in the area unless 
  forced intercourse had caused a permanent change or left a scar.  Ultimately 
  she concluded that there “was no positive evidence” found during her examination 
  of the complainant to support her claim that she had been sexually assaulted.  
  She also noted that studies suggest that there “is at least a 20% to 25% rate 
  of normal exam” in cases of forced sexual intercourse with a virgin.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>While s. 686(1)(a) provides three distinct bases upon which this court

      which is the product of a miscarriage of justice cannot stand.  Section 
      686(1)(a)(i) is concerned with the most obvious example of a miscarriage 
      of justice, a conviction which no reasonable trier of fact properly instructed 
      could have returned on the evidence adduced at trial.</p>

      or unsupported by the evidence does not depend upon the demonstration of 
      any errors in the proceedings below.  The verdict is the error where s. 
      686(1)(a)(i) is properly invoked.  A misapprehension of the evidence does 
      not render the verdict unreasonable.  Nor is a finding that the judge misapprehended

    is “unreasonable” within the meaning of that section.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    J., speaking for the court said at paragraphs 38 through 42:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section2><span lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>The 
      exercise of appellate review is considerably more difficult when the court 
      of appeal is required to determine the alleged unreasonableness of a verdict 
      reached by a jury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>If there are 
      no errors in the charge, as must be assumed, there is no way of determining 
      the basis upon which the jury reached its conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
      </span>But this does not dispense the reviewing court from the need to articulate 
      the basis upon which it finds that the conclusion reached by the jury was 
      unreasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is insufficient 
      for the court of appeal to refer to a vague unease, or a lingering or lurking 
      doubt based on its own review of the evidence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This “lurking doubt” may be a powerful trigger 
      for thorough appellate scrutiny of the evidence, but it is not, without 
      further articulation of the basis for such doubt, a proper basis upon which 
      to interfere with the findings of a jury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
      </span>In other words, if, after reviewing the evidence at the end of an 
      error-free trial which led to a conviction, the appeal court judge is left 
      with a lurking doubt or feeling of unease, that doubt, which is not in itself 
      sufficient to justify interfering with the conviction, may be a useful signal 
      that the verdict was indeed reached in a non-judicial manner.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that case, the court of appeal must<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>proceed further with its analysis.</span></div>
    <div class=Section2><span lang=EN-US>[39]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>When 
      a jury which was admittedly properly instructed returns what the appeal 
      court perceives to be an unreasonable conviction, the only rational inference, 
      if the test in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Yebes</i> is followed, 
      is that the jury, in arriving at that guilty verdict, was not acting judicially.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This conclusion does not imply an impeachment 
      of the integrity of the jury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It 
      may be that the jury reached its verdict pursuant to an analytical flaw 
      similar to the errors occasionally incurred in the analysis of trial judges 
      and revealed in their reasons for judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>Such error would of course not be apparent on the face of the verdict 
      by a jury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But the unreasonableness 
      itself of the verdict would be apparent to the legally trained reviewer 
      when, in all the circumstances of a given case, judicial fact-finding precludes 
      the conclusion reached by the jury.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Judicial 
      appreciation of the evidence is governed by rules that dictate the required 
      content of the charge to the jury.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">  </span>These rules are sometimes expressed in terms of warnings, mandatory 
      or discretionary sets of instructions by which a trial judge will convey 
      the product of accumulated judicial experience to the jury, who, by definition, 
      is new to the exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>For instance, 
      a judge may need to warn the jury about the frailties of eyewitness identification 
      evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Similarly, years of judicial 
      experience has revealed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>the possible 
      need for special caution in evaluating the evidence of certain witnesses, 
      such as accomplices, who may, to the uninitiated, seem particularly knowledgeable 
      and therefore credible. Finally, judicial warnings may be required when 
      the jury has heard about the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>criminal 
      record of the accused, or about similar fact evidence.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But these rules of caution cannot be exhaustive, 
      they cannot capture every situation, and cannot be formulated in every case 
      as a requirement of the charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Rather, 
      after the jury has been adequately charged as to the applicable law, and 
      warned, if necessary, about drawing possibly unwarranted conclusions, it 
      remains that in some cases, the totality of the evidence and the peculiar 
      factual circumstances of a given case will lead an experienced jurist to 
      conclude that the fact-finding exercise applied at trial was flawed in light 
      of the unreasonable result that it produced.</span></div>
    <div class=Section2><span lang=EN-US>[40]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>When 
      an appellate court arrives at that conclusion, it does not act as a “thirteenth 
      juror”, nor is it “usurping the function of the jury”.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In concluding that no properly instructed jury 
      acting judicially could have convicted, the reviewing court inevitably is 
      concluding that these particular jurors who convicted must not have been 
      acting judicially.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In that context, 
      acting judicially means not only acting dispassionately, applying the law 
      and adjudicating on the basis of the record and nothing else.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It means, in addition, arriving at a conclusion 
      that does not conflict with the bulk of judicial experience.<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This, in my view, is the assessment that must 
      be made by the reviewing court.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It 
      requires not merely asking whether twelve properly instructed jurors, acting 
      judicially, could reasonably have come to the same result, but doing so 
      through the lens of judicial experience which serves as an additional protection 
      against an unwarranted conviction.</span></div>
    <div class=Section2><span lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='mso-tab-count:1'> </span>It 
      is not particularly significant to describe this judicial oversight as either 
      objective or subjective.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is exercised 
      by an appeal court and therefore it will invariably draw on a collection 
      of judicial experiences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Because 
      of its judicial character, and because it purports to identify features 
      of a case that will give experienced jurists cause for concern, it is imperative 
      that the reviewing court articulate as precisely as possible what features 
      of the case suggest that the verdict reached by the jury was unreasonable, 
      despite the fact that it was not tainted by any erroneous instructions as 
      to the applicable law.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In some cases, 
      the articulation of the grounds upon which an appellate court concludes 
      that a conviction was unreasonable may elucidate previously unidentified 
      dangers in evidence and give rise to additional warnings to the jury in 
      subsequent cases.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Most of the time, 
      it will simply point to a case that presented itself with several causes 
      for concern, none of which, in isolation, might have required that the jury 
      be warned in any particular way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>There 
      are many illustrations from the case law of verdicts having been found unreasonable 
      essentially on the strength of accumulated judicial experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:

    could reasonably have rendered the verdict. This appellate function requires 
    that this question be asked through the lens of experienced jurists and it 
    requires that the conclusion reached not conflict with the bulk of judicial 
    experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It is imperative that 
    the court of appeal articulate the basis upon which it concluded that the 
    jury reached an unreasonable verdict;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it 
    is insufficient for the court to simply express that there is a “lurking doubt”. 
    While vague unease or a lingering doubt may be a signal that the verdict was 
    reached in a non-judicial manner, the court must proceed with an analysis 
    of the evidence to justify interfering with the conviction. </span></p>

    <span lang=EN-GB>As was stated in <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Biniaris, supra</i>, reaching the conclusion that the verdict is unreasonable 
    does not imply an impeachment of the integrity of the jury. In this case, 
    it also may be that there was some evidence upon which a jury could have convicted 
    the appellant. However, a reviewing court is to examine the totality of the 
    evidence through the lens of judicial experience when determining whether 
    the verdict is reasonable. The bulk of judicial experience clearly indicates 
    that no jury properly instructed and acting judicially could have reasonably 
    convicted the appellant when the totality of the evidence and all of its frailties 
    have been considered. </span></p>

    <span lang=EN-GB>The references to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

    judge not to re-charge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>In fairness,

    warning, as I have stated, that fell short of the mark.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
