<p><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the order of Regional Senior Justice Eugene 
  B. Fedak, made in the Divisional Court and dated May 29, 2000.</span></b></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is one of two appeals heard by this court that raise issues 
  concerning civil liability of the Brantford Police Services Board for conduct 
  of police officers employed by the Board.  The cases involve entirely different 
  incidents but each turns on the alleged illegality of the arrest of the respective 
  plaintiffs.  The reasons in the other case, <i>Collins v. Brantford Police Services 
  Board,</i> are being released concurrently with these reasons.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Brantford Police Services Board appeals from the decision 
  of the Divisional Court allowing an appeal from the decision of the Brantford 
  Small Claims Court.  Deputy Judge Ditchfield had dismissed the plaintiff’s claim 
  for damages for unlawful entry and unlawful arrest.  Fedak R.S.J. allowed the 
  appeal, found that there had been an unlawful arrest and detention and remitted 
  the case to the Deputy Judge for determination of damages.  This court granted 
  leave to appeal from the decision of Fedak R.S.J.  Leave to appeal was limited 
  to the issue concerning the application of s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code.</i>  
</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the early morning hours of Christmas Eve 1997, Constables 
  Wheeler and Stachurski of the Brantford Police Services went to the home of 
  the plaintiff and his mother.  They intended to arrest the plaintiff, William 
  James Hudson, for failing to remain at the scene of an accident that had occurred 
  a short time earlier.  The officers had ample information to form a reasonable 
  belief that the plaintiff had been involved in a collision with a parked car 
  and had failed to remain.  The officers knocked on the door and the plaintiff’s 
  mother answered the door.  There was a factual dispute at trial as to whether 
  Mrs. Hudson invited the officers in or whether they entered without permission.  
  The trial judge resolved this issue in favour of the plaintiff and found that 
  Mrs. Hudson did not consent to the officers’ entry into the apartment.  She 
  also found the officers were not in hot pursuit at the time, nor were there 
  exigent circumstances that would justify a warrantless entry in accordance with 
  the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Feeney</i> (1997), 115 
  C.C.C. (3d) 129 and the applicable provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After entering the apartment, the officers went to the plaintiff’s 
  bedroom where they woke him up, and, following a scuffle, handcuffed him and 
  removed him from the bedroom.  While the plaintiff was being removed from the 
  apartment he spit at one of the arresting officers.  At the police station, 
  he spit at a staff sergeant.  The police charged the plaintiff with leaving 
  the scene of an accident, two counts of resisting arrest and two counts of assaulting 
  a police officer (for the spitting incidents).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On June 11, 1998, the plaintiff pleaded guilty to the two counts 
  of assaulting a police officer in the execution of his duty.  The Crown withdrew 
  the other charges.  On June 15, 1998, the plaintiff brought his claim for damages 
  for unlawful arrest and detention.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As I have indicated, the trial judge found that the police officers’ 
  entry into the plaintiff’s apartment was unlawful.  The Board does not dispute 
  this finding.  The trial judge then went on to consider the lawfulness of the 
  arrest for failing to remain at the scene of an accident contrary to s. 252 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  She found that the arrest could have been authorized 
  by s. 495(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides that a peace officer 
  may arrest without warrant a person who has committed an indictable offence.  
  However, she also held that the arrest was unlawful because of the provisions 
  of s. 495(2) which provide as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(2) A peace officer <u>shall not arrest</u> a person without warrant 
      for</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(b) an offence for which the person may be prosecuted by indictment 
      or for which he is punishable on summary conviction, or</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>… </span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>in any case where</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(d) he believes on reasonable grounds that the public interest, having 
      regard to all the circumstances including the need to</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(i) establish the identity of the person,</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(ii) secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(iii) prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the 
      commission of another offence,</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>may be satisfied without so arresting the person, and</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(e) he has no reasonable grounds to believe that, if he does not so 
      arrest the person, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt 
      with according to law. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge found that none of the conditions in paragraphs 
  (d) and (e) were satisfied and accordingly, the officers should not have arrested 
  the plaintiff.  The trial judge then considered the effect of s. 495(3) which, 
  in the following terms, deems an officer to have acted lawfully even though 
  the officer has failed to comply with s. 495(2):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a peace officer acting under subsection 
      (1) is deemed to be acting lawfully and in the execution of his duty for 
      the purposes of</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(a) any proceedings under this or any other Act of Parliament; and</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(b) any other proceedings, unless in any such proceedings it is alleged 
      and established by the person making the allegation that the peace officer 
      did not comply with the requirements of subsection (2).</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the plaintiff had 
  met the burden in paragraph (3)(b) of showing that the officers did not comply 
  with the requirements of s. 495(2) and accordingly, subsec. (3) offered no protection 
  to the officers.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge then turned to the effect of the guilty plea 
  for assaulting one of the arresting officers.  She noted that an element of 
  this offence is that the officer was in the execution of his duty when he was 
  assaulted.  She determined that as the officers were in uniform and were transporting 
  the plaintiff to the police station at the time he spit at one of them, they 
  were in the execution of their duty.  The trial judge held, however, that this 
  did not bar an action for unlawful entry and false arrest.  The trial judge 
  reasoned that the assault to which the plaintiff pleaded guilty was a separate 
  event from the unlawful warrantless entry and arrest and accordingly, the assault 
  did not bar the civil action for those events.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The trial judge then turned to the Board’s claim that the officers 
  were protected by s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and the common law<i>.</i>  
  With respect to the common law, the trial judge relied upon <i>Kennedy v. Tomlinson</i> 
  (1959), 20 D.L.R. (2d) 273 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1959] 
  S.C.R. ix, where it was held that an officer is protected from civil liability 
  if the officer makes an arrest based upon a reasonable person’s “reasonable 
  suspicion” the plaintiff committed an offence.  The trial judge found that based 
  upon information supplied by another officer, the arresting officers “acted 
  in good faith and believed that they had reasonable and probable grounds to 
  arrest the plaintiff with leaving the scene of an accident”.  She also held 
  that none of the actions by the officers in the apartment could be described 
  as “unreasonable or in bad faith”.  She therefore dismissed the claim without 
  costs.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Fedak R.S.J. found that the trial judge erred in holding that 
  the officers were protected either by s. 25 or the common law.  He held that 
  the finding of good faith seems to have been based on the fact that the officers 
  had not had training on the relatively new law as set out in <i>Feeney</i> and 
  the subsequent <i>Criminal Code</i> amendments.  However, Fedak&nbsp;R.S.J. 
  found that this finding could not be sustained as one of the officers testified 
  that he had received training on this law before the arrest of the plaintiff.  
  He therefore held that the trial judge erred in finding that the officers were 
  acting in good faith and were protected by s.&nbsp;25(2) of the <i>Criminal 
  Code.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Fedak R.S.J. also held that the trial judge erred in finding 
  that the officers were protected by the doctrine in <i>Kennedy v. Tomlinson</i>.  
  He pointed out that it was immaterial whether or not the officers had reasonable 
  grounds to believe the plaintiff committed a criminal offence, as this did not 
  meet the issue of the unlawful arrest because of the earlier unlawful entry.  
  He held that the trial judge erred in finding that the officers were acting 
  reasonably and in good faith.  He therefore allowed the appeal and, since the 
  trial judge had made no finding respecting damages, remitted the case to the 
  trial judge to determine damages.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant Board argues that the Divisional Court judge erred 
  in setting aside the trial judge’s findings of fact that the officers were acting 
  reasonably and in good faith.  It also argues that the actions of the officers 
  were justified by s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> or at common law.  Finally, 
  the Board argues that the plaintiff was estopped from arguing that the arrest 
  was unlawful once he pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer in the execution 
  of his duty.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I have examined the application for leave to appeal to this court.  
  The appellant proposed two bases upon which leave to appeal should be granted.  
  First, that the plaintiff was barred from recovery for wrongful arrest by virtue 
  of his guilty pleas.  Second, that, in any event, the officers’ actions were 
  justified pursuant to the common law or s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  
  As I have indicated, this court granted leave only on the s. 25 issue.  The 
  other issues are not before this court.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span>            </span>The <i>Feeney</i> decision</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> To understand the application of s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> 
  to this case it is first necessary to review the decision in <i>Feeney</i> and 
  its aftermath.  The Supreme Court of Canada released its decision in <i>R. v. 
  Feeney</i> on May 22, 1997.  In that case, a majority of the court overturned 
  the earlier decision in <i>R. v. Landry</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 145.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> [1] </span></a>  In <i>Landry</i>, the court had 
  held that police may enter a private dwelling without permission and without 
  a warrant if there are reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the person 
  sought is within the premises, proper announcement is made prior to entry and 
  a warrantless arrest as authorized by s. 495 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is 
  met.  As indicated, s.&nbsp;495 authorizes  a  police  officer to arrest without 
  warrant,  <i>inter alia</i>,  a person who the officer believes on reasonable 
  grounds has committed an indictable offence. In <i>Feeney</i>, the court held 
  that generally a warrant is required to make an arrest in a dwelling house.  
  The court held that there was at least one exception to the warrant requirement, 
  where the police were in hot pursuit of the suspect.  The majority left open 
  whether there were other exceptions for exigent circumstances.  Finally, the 
  court held that an arrest warrant alone was insufficient authorization to enter 
  a dwelling to make an arrest.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The <i>Feeney</i> decision caused some concern for the government 
  because there was now a gap in the law relating to arrest.  The Supreme Court 
  therefore agreed to stay the effect of the decision until December 19, 1997.  
  This gave Parliament time to amend the <i>Criminal Code</i> to add ss. 529 to 
  529.5.  Those provisions allow a judge or justice to include with an arrest 
  warrant an authorization to enter a dwelling house.  They also provide for certain 
  defined exceptions for the warrant or authorization requirements.  Those amendments 
  came into force on December 18, 1997.</p>

  after the <i>Feeney</i> stay period had ended and after the new <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> provisions came into force.  In this case, the trial judge found that 
  the police, who had no arrest warrant and no authorization to enter the dwelling, 
  were not in hot pursuit and that none of the statutory exceptions in the new 
  <i>Code</i> provisions applied.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"

  the police officers committed a trespass when they entered the plaintiff’s home 
  to arrest him without a warrant and authorization to enter.  This court has 
  previously held that if police officers have been trespassing at the time they 
  purport to make an arrest in a dwelling house, this renders the arrest unlawful:

  </span></span> In my view, s. 25(2) has no application in this case.  Cory J. 
  described the effect of s. 25(2) in <i>R. v. Finta</i> (1994), 88 C.C.C. (3d) 
  417 (S.C.C.) at 518-19:</p>

    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>The purpose of s. 25(2) is to provide legal protection to a police 
      officer, who, acting in good faith and on a reasonable belief that his or 
      her actions are justified by law, later finds out that those actions were 
      not authorized because the law was found to be defective.</span></u></p>
    <p><u><span
lang=EN-US>Section 25 is akin to the defence of mistake of fact.</span></u> Unless, 
      the law is manifestly illegal, the police officer must obey and implement 
      that law. Police officers cannot be expected to undertake a comprehensive 
      legal analysis of every order or law that they are charged with enforcing 
      before taking action. Therefore, if it turns out that they have followed 
      an illegal order they may plead the peace officer defence just as the military 
      officer may properly put forward the defence of obedience to superior orders 
      under certain limited conditions. The qualification is that the military 
      officer must act in good faith and must have reasonable grounds for believing 
      that the actions taken were justified. An officer acting pursuant to a manifestly 
      unlawful order or law would not be able to defend his or her actions on 
      the grounds they were justified under s. 25 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.

  </span></span> This was not a case where the law or the process under which 
  the officers were operating was later found to be defective.  The law concerning 
  limits on the powers of arrest has been laid down in s. 495(2) and its predecessors 
  since the <i>Bail Reform Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. 2 (2nd Supp.).  The law concerning 
  warrantless entry to effect an arrest was laid down by the Supreme Court of 
  Canada in <i>Feeney</i>, over six months prior to this arrest.  This arrest 
  occurred after the <i>Feeney</i> stay period had expired and after the new <i>Criminal 
  Code</i> provisions came into force.  If the officers were mistakenly operating 
  on the basis of the pre-<i>Feeney</i> law, that was not because of any defect 
  in the law or process.  Section 25(2) can offer them no protection.  Also see 
  <i>R. v. Devereaux</i> (1996), 112 C.C.C. (3d) 243 (Nfld. C.A.) at 254 and 256.</p>

  </span></span> This leaves s. 25(1) for consideration.  The Supreme Court of 
  Canada considered s. 25(1) in <i>Eccles v. Bourque</i> (1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 
  129.  <i>Eccles</i> was a claim for damages for trespass and bears some similarity 
  to this case.  Police officers entered Mr.&nbsp;Eccles’ dwelling in pursuit 
  of another man for whom there were outstanding arrest warrants.  The person 
  sought was not in the dwelling.  The police defendants relied upon s. 25(1) 
  on the basis that since they were authorized to make an arrest, s. 25(1) authorized 
  the use of any measures necessary to effect the arrest.  Dickson J., speaking 
  for four members of the court, disagreed.  He held as follows at pp. 130-31:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is the submission of counsel for [the police] that a person who is by 
      s. 450 [now s. 495] authorized to make an arrest is, by s. 25, authorized 
      by law to commit a trespass with or without force in the accomplishment 
      of that arrest, provided he acts on reasonable and probable grounds. I cannot 
      agree with this submission. <u>Section 25 does not have such amplitude. 
      The section merely affords justification to a person for doing what he is 
      required or authorized by law to do in the administration or enforcement 
      of the law, if he acts on reasonable and probable grounds, and for using 
      necessary force for that purpose.</u> <u>The question which must be answered 
      in this case, then, is whether the respondents were required or authorized 
      by law to commit a trespass; and not, as their counsel contends, whether 
      they were required or authorized to make an arrest.</u> If they were authorized 
      by law to commit a trespass, the authority for it must be found in the common 
      law for there is nothing in the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The first issue, therefore, 
      depends upon the second issue, <i>videlicet</i>, can the trespass be justified 
      on common law principles?…  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span></span> The five other members of the court, while agreeing with Dickson 
  J. in the result, expressed no opinion on the effect of s. 25(1).  In the result, 
  Dickson J. found that the police were authorized at common law to enter the 
  dwelling to execute an arrest warrant provided certain conditions were met. 
  Thus, at common law, the police were authorized to enter and commit what would 
  otherwise be a trespass, to effect a lawful arrest.  That particular holding 
  has been overtaken by <i>Feeney</i>.  It seems to me that now, in light of <i>Feeney</i>, 
  Dickson&nbsp;J. would have decided <i>Eccles</i> in favour of the plaintiff 
  and held that the officers were liable in damages for trespass.  Section 25(1) 
  would not now protect the officers from a claim for trespass, because they are 
  not authorized to trespass to execute arrest warrants, absent authorization 
  under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would point out one other aspect of <i>Eccles</i> that helps 
  define the limits of the s.&nbsp;25(1) protection.  Dickson J. held, at p. 132, 
  that the police officers were protected from civil liability although the person 
  sought was not within the dwelling.  Dickson J. contrasted the case of an officer 
  executing civil process and criminal process:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In the case of civil process the rule is that if a Sheriff's officer enters 
      the house of A to execute process against the goods of B or to arrest B 
      he enters at his peril and if the goods or B, as the case may be, are not 
      present, he is guilty of trespass. It is said the entry can be justified 
      only by the event …  <u>But in the execution of criminal process the test 
      is whether there are reasonable and probable grounds for acting. If so, 
      the entry does not become unlawful if the fugitive is not found on the premises.</u> 
      The entry of the police is legal or illegal from the moment of entry and 
      does not change character from the result….  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This corresponds with s. 25(1), which provides that a peace officer 
  who is authorized by law to do something in the enforcement of the law is justified 
  in doing what he or she is authorized to do if the officer “acts on reasonable 
  grounds”.  In effect, s.&nbsp;25(1) protects the officer from civil liability 
  for reasonable mistakes of fact and justifies the use of force.  It does not 
  protect against reasonable mistakes of law, such as mistake as to the authority 
  to commit a trespass to effect an arrest.  I have reviewed the trial judge’s 
  reasons for judgment to see whether she found a mistake of fact to which s.&nbsp;25(1) 
  might apply.  It seems to me that it is at least arguable that if the police 
  reasonably believed that they had consent to enter the apartment, this would 
  give them a defence under s. 25(1) even if, in fact, they had no consent.  There 
  was a significant factual dispute at trial as to the circumstances surrounding 
  the entry.  The trial judge found that Mrs. Hudson did not consent and that 
  at least one of the officers knew this.  The trial judge said the following:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Defendant argues that a valid consent from an occupant of the premises 
      serves as a substitute for obtaining an entry warrant.  I cannot on the 
      evidence, however, conclude that Ms. Hudson consented to entry of her apartment 
      by the police.  Ms. Hudson is clear that when she answered the door one 
      of the police officers said:  “Where’s Bill” to which she replied:  “Asleep, 
      just a minute I’ll get him”.  This would indicate that Ms. Hudson’s expectation 
      was that the police would wait outside.  <u>There was, therefore, no invitation 
      to enter the apartment.  This fact was confirmed by Wheeler in cross-examination 
      when he admitted that there was no verbal invitation from Ms. Hudson to 
      enter the residence and follow her to the Plaintiff’s bedroom.</u>  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>To summarize, the officers had no lawful right

  </span></span> Despite her findings of fact and law concerning the illegality 
  of the entry and the arrest, the trial judge dismissed the claim because of 
  her view that under s. 25 and at common law it is a defence if the officers 
  are acting in good faith and on reasonable and probable grounds.  The trial 
  judge looked at the overall conduct of the police and concluded that they had 
  reasonable and probable grounds to arrest the plaintiff, that they were not 
  acting in an overzealous manner and therefore none of their actions could be 
  described as “unreasonable or in bad faith”.  Leaving aside any common-law defence, 
  which is not in issue any longer, this is too broad an application of s. 25(1).  
  The issue is not whether the officers were acting unreasonably or in bad faith 
  generally but whether they had authorization to trespass.  They did not, and 
  s. 25(1) affords them no defence.  In view of this court’s decision in <i>Delong</i>, 
  referred to earlier, the trespass rendered the arrest unlawful.  </p>

  333 (N.S.C.A.), Jones J.A., speaking for the court, considered the application 
  of s. 25(1) in the context of criminal charges brought against police officers 
  arising out of the death of a citizen in the course of an arrest.  In that case, 
  the trial judge had instructed the jury that under s. 25 of the <i>Code</i> 
  the officers were justified in using as much force as necessary to generally 
  carry out the lawful execution of their duty.  Jones J.A. held that this was 
  an error:</p>
<blockquote>

    <p><span

      him and to give him the reasons why he was being arrested the arrest was 
      unlawful and the officers were not acting in the execution of their duty. 
      In the result they were not justified in using force by virtue of s. 25 
      of the <i>Code</i>. Their apprehension of Mr. Hollett constituted an assault 
      which he was entitled to resist at common law…</span></p>

  </span></span> In the result, the Nova Scotia Court of Appeal dismissed O’Donnell’s 
  appeal from conviction for manslaughter.  If there was misdirection on s. 25(1) 
  it was favourable to the accused.  The Court of Appeal allowed the Crown appeal 
  from Cluett’s acquittal because the trial judge had misdirected the jury on 
  s. 25 and on the liability of a party.  Cluett appealed to the Supreme Court 
  of Canada, which allowed the appeal and restored the acquittal: (1985), 21 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 318.  In the Supreme Court, counsel for Cluett accepted that the trial 
  judge had misdirected the jury on s. 25, but argued that the error did not affect 
  his client’s liability because he was in a different position from the principal 
  offender, O’Donnell.  Cluett had testified that he did not see the initial altercation 
  between the deceased and O’Donnell and only used force in the belief that his 
  partner was being assaulted by the deceased.  The Supreme Court of Canada agreed.  
  The court pointed out that Cluett was entitled to use force to arrest the deceased 
  because he reasonably believed the deceased was committing the criminal offence 
  of assaulting a police officer.  In those circumstances the direction to the 
  jury that under s. 25 the police are entitled to use as much force as necessary 
  to carry out their duties generally was of no consequence.  It seems to me, 
  however, that the court did not disagree with the statements of Jones J.A. as 
  to the scope of s. 25.</p>

  (Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Constable Smith)</i> (1996), 141 D.L.R. (4th) 
  94 (B.C.C.A.). While the facts of <i>Swansburg</i> are very different, the trial 
  judge’s approach to s. 25(1) in that case bears considerable similarity to the 
  approach of the trial judge in this case.  In <i>Swansburg</i>, the police officer 
  purported to arrest the plaintiff for impaired driving although, as he conceded, 
  he did not believe he had reasonable grounds for such an arrest.  The trial 
  judge nevertheless dismissed the claim because of his view of the “broad application” 
  of s.&nbsp;25(1).  He held, as quoted by Williams&nbsp;J.A. at p.&nbsp;103, 
  that in determining the reasonableness of the officer’s actions “the court must 
  look to all the surrounding circumstances and place the officer’s actions within 
  that matrix of circumstance”.  He further held that “one of the objects of parliament 
  in enacting s. 25(1) must be taken to have been to protect a policeman who makes 
  a mistake in the performance of his duties but who in acting, did so reasonably”.  
  Williams J.A. emphatically disagreed with this interpretation, which in his 
  view was “contrary to the fundamental principles which protect the citizen from 
  unwarranted or unlawful police action” [at p.&nbsp;104].  He adopted the view 
  of Jones J.A. in <i>R. v. O’Donnell and Cluett</i> and referred, with approval, 
  to the decision of Sherstobitoff J.A. in <i>R. v. Peters</i> (1990), 84 Sask. 
  R. 231 (C.A.):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The failure of the judge to specifically address the defence that s. 25

      force in making an arrest, while not to be condoned, could not change the 
      result, since the evidence of the witnesses which he accepted warranted 
      a finding that the appellant used more force than reasonably necessary to 
      effect the arrest, if the arrest was a lawful one.  <u>If the arrest was

  In my view, the <i>Waterfield</i> test has no application in this case. The 
  police could not claim any common-law power based on <i>Waterfield </i>to enter 
  the appellant’s dwelling to effect that arrest.  The power to enter to effect 
  an arrest has been defined by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Feeney</i> and 
  the subsequent <i>Criminal Code</i> amendments.  See <i>R. v. Godoy</i> at p. 
  140.  The police cannot ignore the dictates of the Supreme Court of Canada and 
  enter without authorization because they are generally acting in the course 
  of their duties to keep the peace and apprehend perpetrators.  They are not 
  protected from civil liability under s. 25(1) because they are unaware of that 
  law or mistaken about its application.  In any event, in light of <i>Feeney</i>, 
  the officers’ conduct in this case would have to be found to be an “unjustifiable

    addition to hot pursuit, the appellant had argued before the trial judge that 
    exigent circumstances justified a warrantless entry because the police believed 
    the plaintiff may have been impaired and they needed to arrest him to preserve 
    evidence of his blood alcohol level.  The appellant relied upon s. 529.3 of 
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>529.3 (1) Without limiting or restricting 
    any power a peace officer may have to enter a dwelling-house under this or 
    any other Act or law, the peace officer may enter the dwelling-house for the 
    purpose of arresting or apprehending a person, without a warrant referred 
    to in section 529 or 529.1 authorizing the entry, if the peace officer has 
    reasonable grounds to believe that the person is present in the dwelling-house, 
    and the conditions for obtaining a warrant under section 529.1 exist but by 
    reason of exigent circumstances it would be impracticable to obtain a warrant.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span> </span>(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 
    exigent circumstances include circumstances in which the peace officer</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>(b) has reasonable grounds to believe 
    that evidence relating to the commission of an indictable offence is present 
    in the dwelling-house and that entry into the dwelling-house is necessary 
    to prevent the imminent loss or imminent destruction of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><span lang=EN-US>The trial judge found that the police 
    did not have the requisite reasonable grounds to believe that the appellant 
    was impaired.</span></p>
