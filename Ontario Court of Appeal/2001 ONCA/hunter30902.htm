  </span> In the early evening of January 26, 1995, three plainclothes police 
  officers investigated a disturbance outside a restaurant in the Bloor and Lansdowne 
  area of Toronto. A chase ensued in which the appellant allegedly pulled out 
  a gun and attempted to shoot at one of the officers. However, the gun did not 
  fire, and the appellant was apprehended. He was charged with attempted murder, 
  use of a firearm while committing an indictable offence, aggravated assault 
  in that he endangered the life of the officer, and possession of a prohibited 
  weapon.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On October 14, 1997, the appellant’s fourth trial on these charges commenced 
  before Hamilton J. and a jury. On October 22, 1997, he was acquitted of attempted 
  murder, but convicted of the other three charges. On October 30, 1997, he was 
  sentenced to eight years imprisonment.</p>

  </span> Mr. Hunter appeals both his conviction and his sentence. In attacking 
  his conviction, the appellant raises a number of grounds. For the reasons that 
  follow, I have concluded that two of these have merit: first, that the trial 
  judge erred in admitting an utterance (“I had a gun, but I didn’t point it”) 
  purportedly made by the appellant to his lawyer and overheard by a passerby; 
  second, that the trial judge made certain comments in his charge to the jury 
  that impermissibly undermined the appellant’s right to remain silent. The appellant’s 
  conviction must therefore be set aside. In light of the relevant considerations 
  in this case, I would enter a stay of proceedings rather than direct a new trial. 
  In the circumstances, I do not think it necessary to address the other grounds 
  of appeal from conviction or the appeal from sentence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE FACTS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The case for the Crown centered on the evidence of the three police 
  officers, Constables Demkiw, Robinson and Brosnan. They testified that on January 
  26, 1995, they were working together in plainclothes. At approximately 7:35 
  p.m. they happened to be driving by Luckey’s Restaurant when a disturbance broke 
  out just outside. On exiting their vehicle, Constable Brosnan saw the appellant 
  with a gun tucked into his jeans and advised Constable Demkiw of this. When 
  Demkiw approached the appellant and ordered him not to move, the appellant fled. 
  Constable Demkiw pulled out his own gun and gave chase along with Constable 
  Robinson. Constable Brosnan returned to the car in order to pursue the appellant, 
  but made no attempt to call for backup because he said he did not know where 
  the police radio was located in the unmarked vehicle.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant ran into a narrow passageway no more than six feet wide. 
  Constable Demkiw took out his flashlight and shone it down the passageway. He 
  saw the appellant crouching on his knees and pointing a gun at him. Constable 
  Demkiw heard a clicking noise, but the gun did not fire and the appellant turned 
  to run. Constable Demkiw told Constable Robinson who had just caught up with 
  him that the appellant had a gun but did not say that he had attempted to fire 
  it. Without drawing his own gun, Robinson ran past Demkiw and grabbed the appellant 
  in a bear hug. The two officers dislodged the gun from the appellant and arrested 
  him. Constable Robinson made no mention of seeing a gun in his notes and no 
  fingerprints were found on the gun. The evidence of the officers was that on 
  arrest the appellant was advised of his rights but simply said “I’m sorry. I’m 
  sorry.”</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown sought to call Lorenzo DiCecco whose evidence was that on 
  the day of the appellant’s preliminary hearing he was walking past the appellant 
  and his lawyer, Mr. Rusonik, who were standing together in an open area of the 
  Old City Hall. Mr. DiCecco said that he overhead the appellant say “I had a 
  gun, but I didn’t point it.”  He acknowledged that he just caught that part 
  of the conversation. He agreed that that there might have been conversation 
  between the appellant and Mr. Rusonik both before and after the overheard utterance. 
  He could not give the Court the context of the utterance. The Crown took the 
  position that this evidence was very critical to its case, given the defence 
  position of police brutality and the possible planting of evidence on the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> After a <i>voir dire</i> the trial judge held this evidence to be admissible. 
  He found that the words before and after the overheard utterance were not before 
  the court. He reiterated this in his charge, telling the jury that the overheard 
  utterance was something taken out of context. However, he said that he could 
  not think of any words that might have prefaced the overheard utterance that 
  would give that utterance a meaning other than the meaning it appears to have 
  standing on its own. Hence he found that a jury could determine the meaning 
  of the overheard words. He concluded his ruling as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> I find the words are capable of giving a meaning if the jury so choose 
      to give it. It is for them to decide if it was made by the accused and what 
      value is to be given to it.</p>
    <p> I find the statement as said is relevant and probative to a fact in issue. 
      It is really an admission. That is still up to a jury.</p>
    <p> I am finding it is voluntary and admissible.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge then went on to find that the statement was not protected 
  by solicitor-client privilege. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant gave evidence in his own defence. He said that he came 
  upon the disturbance which was going on outside the restaurant and that when 
  a marked police cruiser arrived someone shouted that someone was going to get 
  arrested. The appellant fled along with everyone else. He separated from the 
  others and was taken down by two police officers. He denied having a gun but 
  alleged that the police had assaulted him on his arrest, although there was 
  no medical evidence to corroborate this. He denied ever telling his lawyer that 
  he was in possession of the gun. Mr. Rusonik’s evidence was to the same effect.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s conviction on October 22, 1997 came at the end of his 
  fourth trial on these charges. His first trial in the fall of 1996 took six 
  days. The Crown did not seek to call the DiCecco evidence. The appellant testified 
  in his own defence. After ten hours of deliberation, the jury advised that they 
  were deadlocked on all charges and a mistrial was declared.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Prior to the appellant’s second trial, the Crown indicated its intention 
  to call the DiCecco evidence, forcing Mr. Rusonik to remove himself as defence 
  counsel. The appellant was unrepresented at his second trial, having been refused 
  an adjournment to retain counsel. After seven days of trial, a mistrial was 
  declared when the trial judge became concerned about the appellant’s self-representation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The third trial commenced on October 6, 1997, and after seven days of 
  trial the trial judge discharged a juror who was having difficulty with the 
  English language. This left only ten jurors and rather than continue the trial 
  judge decided to order a mistrial and begin again immediately with 12 jurors.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Thus the fourth trial began on October 14, 1997. When sentence was passed 
  on October 30, 1997, the appellant had been in pre-trial custody for almost 
  seven months. He has remained in custody for three and one-half years since 
  then.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant’s first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred 
  in admitting the evidence of the appellant’s utterance overheard by Mr. DiCecco. 
  Relying on <i>R. v. Ferris</i> (1994), 34 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 26 (S.C.C.) 
  affirming (1993), 27 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 141 (Alta. C.A.), the appellant argued 
  that the utterance cannot meet the threshold of relevance required for admissibility 
  because its meaning cannot be determined without its context or alternatively 
  its meaning is so speculative that it ought to have been excluded because its 
  prejudicial effect outweighed its tenuous probative value. I agree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The facts in <i>Ferris</i> closely parallel this case. The accused was 
  arrested for murder and taken into police custody. He was permitted to telephone 
  his father from the police station. A police officer walked past the accused 
  on two occasions while he was on the phone. On the first occasion the accused 
  was overheard to say “I’ve been arrested” and on the second occasion, shortly 
  thereafter, “I killed David”. The police officer heard the appellant talking 
  before, after and in between the two sets of words but, apart from the quoted 
  utterances, he could not tell what was said. The trial judge ruled that the 
  officer could give evidence of the two overheard utterances.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Conrad J.A., writing for the majority in the Alberta Court of Appeal, 
  turned first to whether, in the circumstances, it was possible to ascertain 
  the meaning of these words so that they could be said to meet the relevance 
  requirement for admissibility. She pointed out that the only possible relevance 
  of these words was if they could be found to constitute an admission by the 
  accused that he killed David. However, the Crown had no evidence of the words 
  preceding or following the overheard phrases and Conrad J.A. cited examples 
  of possible surrounding words that would make the full statement innocuous rather 
  than an admission of guilt and hence not probative of any fact in issue. Given 
  that there was a verbal context for the overheard phrases but no evidence of 
  what that context was, Conrad J.A. found that a properly instructed jury could 
  not determine from the fragmented utterance which was overheard the meaning 
  either of the whole thought or of the overheard words themselves. Hence she 
  concluded that these words could not be said to be probative of a fact in issue 
  and were therefore irrelevant and inadmissible. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Conrad J.A. went on to find that since the utterance “I killed David” 
  had no probative value (given that the court did not know the words surrounding 
  it) and since the utterance was extremely prejudicial its exclusion must be 
  favoured. On this basis as well she found that the overheard words should not 
  have been admitted. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Supreme Court of Canada dismissed the appeal from this judgment. 
  The reasons of the court by Sopinka J. are as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> In our opinion, with respect to the evidence that the respondent was overheard 
      to say “I killed David”, if it had any relevance, by reason of the circumstances 
      fully outlined by Conrad J.A. [reported at (1994), 27 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
      141 (Alta. C.A.)], its meaning was so speculative and its probative value 
      so tenuous that the trial judge ought to have excluded it on the ground 
      its prejudicial effect overbore its probative value.</p>
    <p> The appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, Sopinka J.’s reasoning is anchored in the important role 
  that context can play in giving meaning to spoken words. Where an overheard 
  utterance is known to have a verbal context, but that context is itself unknown, 
  it may be impossible to know the meaning of the overheard words or to otherwise 
  conclude that those words represent a complete thought regardless of context. 
  Even if the overheard words can be said to have any relevance, where their meaning 
  is speculative and their probative value therefore tenuous yet their prejudicial 
  effect substantial, the overheard words should be excluded.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> When the principles derived from <i>Ferris</i> are applied to this case, 
  I think the evidence must be excluded as it was in <i>Ferris</i>. The only possible 
  relevance of the overheard utterance is if it could be found to constitute an 
  admission by the appellant that he had a gun. Here, as in <i>Ferris,</i> the 
  trial judge found that the overheard utterance had a verbal context, which is 
  unknown and that it was part of a fuller statement. That statement may have 
  been a statement such as “I could say I had a gun, but I didn’t point it, but 
  I won’t because it is not true” or “What if the jury finds I had a gun but I 
  didn’t point it – is that aggravated assault?”  Neither would constitute an 
  admission. Indeed, given the reasoning of the trial judge, had these possibilities 
  been pointed out to him he might well have reached a different conclusion.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, without the surrounding words, it would be impossible for 
  a properly instructed jury to conclude that the overheard utterance was an admission 
  or perhaps even what it meant. Clearly its meaning remains highly speculative. 
  The trier of fact would have to guess at the words that came before and after 
  to fix on a meaning. Since its meaning is highly speculative, its probative 
  value is correspondingly tenuous. However, the substantial prejudicial effect 
  is obvious. This balance clearly favours exclusion of the overheard utterance 
  and, as in <i>Ferris</i>, that should have been the result.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would therefore conclude that the trial judge erred in admitting the 
  overheard utterance by the appellant. As a result, I need not decide whether 
  he also erred in determining that the utterance was not protected by solicitor-client 
  privilege.</p>

  </span> The Crown argued that even if the overheard utterance was admitted in 
  error, it resulted in no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  I do 
  not agree. The Crown characterized this evidence as very critical. Moreover, 
  in the appellant’s first trial where the one significant difference appears 
  to be that this evidence was not called by the Crown, the result was a deadlocked 
  jury and a mistrial. I do not think it can be said that without this evidence 
  the verdict would necessarily have been the same.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Turning to the second ground of appeal that I propose to deal with, 
  the appellant argued that two passages in the charge to the jury impermissibly 
  undermined his right to silence. I agree. In reviewing the evidence for the 
  jury, the trial judge said this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> The accused indicated he was never advised of his rights at the scene, 
      and you heard him indicate he has been arrested before. If you have been 
      arrested before and you are walking up to Bloor Street <i>and you have done 
      nothing</i>, you may want to ask, “What am I being arrested for?” You may 
      want to ask yourself that question. You heard how long this run was along 
      the laneway down to Marguerita Street and the walk back up Marguerita to 
      go to Lucky’s [<i>sic</i>]. <i>If you have done nothing</i> and you have 
      been pinched and arrested before, you might say, “What are you arresting 
      me for?” You may ask that. He said there was no conversation to that effect. 
      “I wasn’t told why I was arrested by Robinson.” [emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Further on in the same section of his charge, the trial judge repeated 
  this thought:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> I say to you you may want to ask yourself on the way up to Bloor Street 
      why not ask, “Why am I being arrested?” if you had done nothing.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, this was an error. On the narrow question of the appellant’s 
  credibility with respect to whether the appellant had been informed of his rights 
  and made the statement attributed to him, it may have been permissible to consider 
  the appellant’s admission that he did not ask why he was being arrested. I need 
  not express a final conclusion on that issue since the trial judge did not limit 
  the use of the evidence to that narrow issue. The fact that the appellant did 
  not ask the reason for his arrest could not be used as positive evidence of 
  guilt and certainly not on the basis that if he was innocent he would have asked 
  the reason for his arrest. Following his arrest, the appellant was not obliged 
  to make any statement. The trial judge’s comments expressly invited the jury 
  to use the appellant’s exercise of his right to silence as consciousness of 
  guilt.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, there is nothing in the charge read as a whole that can be 
  said to neutralize this error. The Crown points to an earlier passage in the 
  charge where the jury was instructed that they should not draw an adverse inference 
  from the appellant saying at the conclusion of a later interview at the police 
  station with Detective Pasini that he did not want to answer any more. While 
  the trial judge instructed the jury at that point that the appellant was entitled 
  not to talk, this instruction was narrowly focussed on the evidence of what 
  the appellant said at the end of his interview with Detective Pasini. It was 
  not enough in my view to displace the implicit suggestion made to the jury by 
  the trial judge himself that if the appellant were innocent he would have asked 
  why he was being arrested.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, the error in admitting the overheard utterance of the appellant 
  and the error in inviting an infringement of the appellant’s right to silence 
  require that the appellant’s conviction be set aside. </p>

  </span> In considering whether a new trial should be ordered or a judicial stay 
  of proceedings imposed under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>, the following considerations 
  are relevant:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>(1)            If a new trial were ordered it would constitute the appellant’s 
      fifth trial based on these allegations. In <i>R. v. Jack, </i>(1997), 117 
      C.C.C. (3d) 43 (S.C.C.) the Supreme Court of Canada approved the statement 
      by the Manitoba Court of Appeal that it would be a very rare case indeed, 
      where putting an accused in jeopardy with respect to a serious charge for 
      a fourth time would not constitute a breach of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> 
      and an abuse of process sufficient to warrant a judicial stay of proceedings 
      under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>. In my view, there is nothing that 
      would put this into that very limited class of cases.</p>
    <p>(2)            The Crown’s case was not overwhelming. The fact that the 
      first jury to hear the case was deadlocked reflects this. The Crown’s case 
      relied significantly on the evidence of the three plainclothes officers. 
      However, that evidence included evidence that they had given chase to an 
      armed man without calling for backup, that the officer fired at had not 
      warned the others of this and that the officer who finally approached and 
      grabbed the appellant did not draw his own gun or make a note that the appellant 
      had a gun. Apart from the impugned evidence of the overheard utterance, 
      there was little other evidence to support the Crown’s case.</p>
    <p>(3)            The appellant spent almost seven months in pre-trial custody 
      and has served over three and one-half years since his sentence was pronounced 
      on October 30, 1997.</p>
    <p>(4)            At the hearing of this appeal the question arose as to whether 
      the appropriate charge on these facts was not aggravated assault (endanger 
      life), but the lesser charge of assault with a weapon. Suffice it to say 
      that I have serious reservations as to whether on the facts of this case 
      a charge of aggravated assault could be made out:  <i>R. v. Melargni</i> 
      (1992), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 546 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) at 552.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Taking these circumstances together, it is my view that to put the appellant 
  on trial for a fifth time would constitute an abuse of process warranting a 
  judicial stay of the proceedings against him.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In summary, for the reasons I have given, I would allow the appeal, 
  set aside the conviction and impose a stay of proceedings.</p>
