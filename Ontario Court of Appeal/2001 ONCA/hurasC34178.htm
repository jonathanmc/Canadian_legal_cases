<p class=MsoHeader style='text-align:justify;'><b><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from 
  the judgment of Justice Peter A. Cumming dated April 10, 2000.</span></b></p>
<p class=MsoHeader><b><span lang=EN-US>BORINS J.A.:</span></b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The issue on this appeal is whether an action for damages under 
  the <i>Employment Standards Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.14 commenced in the Superior 
  Court by the respondent, Cindy Huras, against the appellant, Primerica Financial 
  Services Ltd., should be stayed pursuant to s. 7(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 
  1991,</i> S.O. 1991, c. 17.  The parties signed an employment contract on August 
  26, 1996.  The contract contains an arbitration clause.  The appellant moved 
  for a stay on the ground that the matter in dispute between the parties falls 
  within the arbitration clause.  The motion judge, Cumming J., in reasons reported 
  at [2000] O.J. No. 1474, refused the stay.  The respondent contends that the 
  dispute does not fall within the arbitration clause and that the motion judge, 
  rightly refused the stay.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The answer to the question whether a dispute falls within an 
  arbitration clause in a contract depends both on the nature of the dispute and 
  the scope of the arbitration clause.  As I will explain, there is no disagreement 
  between the parties concerning the nature of the dispute, which is described 
  in the respondent’s statement of claim.  However, there is disagreement as to 
  whether the arbitration clause covers the dispute.  To decide this question 
  it is necessary to interpret the arbitration clause.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Regarding the nature of the dispute, it arises out of an intended, 
  but as yet uncertified, class proceeding by Huras against Primerica.  The proposed 
  class members are all persons who attended a mandatory Primerica training program 
  after May 18, 1993 and prior to January 1, 1998.  Huras seeks damages on her 
  own behalf and on behalf of all class members for Primerica’s failure to pay 
  a minimum wage pursuant to the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> to individuals 
  who participated in a mandatory training program.  Each member of the class 
  was required by Primerica to attend the training program in order to become 
  a licensed sales representative for the company.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the spring of 1996 Huras began her training to become a sales 
  representative for Primerica.  Although she spent approximately 30 to 40 hours 
  attending Primerica’s training sessions, she received no compensation for her 
  attendance.  She claims that under s. 23 of the <i>Employment Standard Act</i> 
  Primerica was required to pay her a minimum wage of $6.85 an hour.  Based on 
  the time she spent attending training sessions, this would amount to approximately 
  $200 to $275.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Huras successfully completed the training program and secured 
  a licence to become an insurance agent.  On August 26, 1996 she signed a standard 
  form contract with Primerica to become a licensed sales representative of that 
  company.  The provisions of the contract that are relevant to this appeal read 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>As a member of the Primerica Financial Services sales 
      force, I am an independent contractor, and not an employee of Primerica 
      Financial Services Ltd. (“PFS”) or any other PFS Company.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>. . . . . .</span></p>
    <p>15. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or another written 
      agreement between you and a PFS Company, any dispute between you and a PFS 
      Company, between you and a PFS Company affiliate (or any of their past or 
      present officers, directors or employees) or between you and another PFS 
      representative (as long as a PFS Company or a  PFS Company affiliate or 
      any of their personnel is also involved as a party to the dispute) will 
      be settled solely through good faith negotiation (as described in the then 
      current Operating Guideline on Good Faith Negotiation) or, if that fails, 
      binding arbitration.  “Dispute” means <i>any type of dispute in any way 
      related to your relationship with a PFS Company that under law may be submitted 
      by agreement to binding arbitration,</i> including allegations of breach 
      of contract, personal or business injury or property damage, fraud and violation 
      of federal, provincial or local statutes, rules or regulations.  A PFS Company 
      may exercise rights under this Agreement without first being required to 
      enter into good faith negotiations or initiate arbitration for disputes 
      covered by this section.                                               [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On May 18, 1999 Huras commenced this action.  Subsequently, in 
  reliance on s. 7(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> and s. 106 of the <i>Courts 
  of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, Primerica moved to stay the action.  
  Primerica moved for a stay on the ground that Huras’ claim, to use the language 
  of s. 7(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, is “in respect of a matter to 
  be submitted to arbitration” under clause 15(a) of the contract of August 26, 
  1996.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Primerica’s motion was dismissed by Cumming J.  It is from this 
  order that Primerica appeals.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss 
  the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The subject matter of the dispute is clear.  It is whether the 
  provisions of the <i>Employment Standards Act</i> required Primerica to pay 
  Huras a minimum wage to compensate her for 30 to 40 hours during which she was 
  required to attend Primerica’s training program in May, 1996.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The more difficult issue is whether the dispute is covered by 
  the arbitration clause in the contract of August 26, 1996.  If it is, the action 
  must be stayed and the dispute must be submitted to arbitration under s. 7(1) 
  of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, which reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>7.(1)    </b><span
lang=EN-US>If a party to an arbitration agreement commences a proceeding in respect 
      of a matter to be submitted to arbitration under the agreement, the court 
      in which the proceeding is commenced shall, on the motion of another party 
      to the arbitration agreement, stay the proceeding.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Therefore, it is necessary to interpret the arbitration clause 
  to determine whether the dispute is one which falls within its terms.  In doing 
  so it is important to bear in mind the function of an arbitration clause in 
  a contract, which is to embody the agreement of the contracting parties that 
  if any dispute arises which falls within its terms, the dispute shall be settled 
  by arbitration.  See:  <i>Heyman v. Darwins, Limited,</i> [1942] A.C. 356 (H.L.) 
  <i>per</i> Lord Macmillan at 373-74.  With respect to construing an arbitration 
  clause, Lord Macmillan said at p. 376:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>It is clear that, as the arbitration clause is a matter 
      of agreement, the first thing is to ascertain according to ordinary principles 
      of construction what the parties have actually agreed. . . </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Further guidance in interpreting an arbitration 
  clause was given by Viscount Simon L.C. at p. 366:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>An arbitration clause is a written submission, agreed 
      to by the parties to the contract, and, like other written submissions to 
      arbitration, must be construed according to its language and in the light 
      of the circumstances in which it is made. </span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=NO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>At p. 368, Viscount Simon 
  L.C. added that “the governing consideration in every case must be the precise 
  terms of the language in which the arbitration clause is framed”.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Thus, because the arbitration clause is but part of the contract, 
  it is to be interpreted in the context of that contract and the commercial legal 
  relationship which it creates.  That was the approach followed in <i>Heyman</i>.  
  It is also the approach followed by the courts of this province, including the 
  court in <i>T1T2 Limited Partnership v. Canada</i> (1994), 23 O.R. (3d) 66 (Gen. 
  Div.), which considered <i>Heyman</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In interpreting the arbitration clause contained in clause 15(a) 
  of the contract the motion judge looked to the relationship between Huras and 
  Primerica, the nature of their dispute and whether the dispute related to their 
  relationship.  He found that there were two distinct relationships between the 
  parties: first, while Huras was a trainee, and second, when she became a licensed 
  sales representative of Primerica, a relationship that was created when the 
  parties entered into the August 26 contract.  He further found that the contract 
  “cannot properly be construed as . . . applying retrospectively to the earlier 
  period of training”, that is, to the first relationship.  Thus, the motion judge 
  concluded that the provisions of the contract related to Huras’ relationship 
  as a licensed sales representative of Primerica, and not to her relationship 
  as a trainee.  The motion judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The claim advanced relates only to the training period.  For the reasons 
      given, there is no arbitration clause applicable to this time period and 
      the relationship between the parties over this time frame.  Hence, the motion 
      is dismissed on this basis.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I see no reason to interfere with the motion judge’s interpretation 
  of the arbitration clause.  In my view, interpreted in the context of the contract 
  in which it is contained and the commercial relationship it created between 
  the parties, Cumming J. reached the correct result.  The dispute raised in Huras’ 
  claim does not arise from her relationship with Primerica as a licensed sales 
  representative.  Using the language of clause 15(a) of the contract, in order 
  to be resolved by arbitration the dispute must be “in any way related to [Huras’] 
  relationship with a PFS Company”.  Interpreting this language in the context 
  of the contract in which it is contained, it is clearly a reference to the commercial 
  relationship established by that contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant contends that the phrase “any dispute between you 
  and a PFS Company” found in the first sentence of the arbitration clause is 
  broad enough to encompass virtually any dispute between the parties, regardless 
  of when it arose or its subject matter.  The appellant contends that because 
  the phrase captures the dispute that was put in issue by the respondent’s claim, 
  even though it arose before the date of the contract between the parties, it 
  must be arbitrated.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, in my view, the appellant’s contention ignores the fact 
  that the second sentence of the arbitration clause contains its own definition 
  of “dispute”.  The clause provides that a dispute is limited to one “related 
  to your relationship with a PFS Company”.  The “relationship” in reference is 
  not any relationship that may arise between Huras and a PFS Company, but the 
  relationship created by the contract – that of Huras becoming a licensed sales 
  representative of Primerica.  This is made clear by the first sentence of clause 
  1 of the contract which states: “This Basic Agreement covers important matters 
  about <i>your relationship</i> with PFS and other PFS companies”. [Emphasis 
  added.]  The balance of the contract deals with other matters that govern Huras’ 
  relationship as an independent contractor of Primerica that is created by the 
  contract.  As the motion judge found, there was a prior relationship between 
  Huras and Primerica when she was a trainee of the company.  However, the dispute 
  between the parties arises from that relationship, not from the relationship 
  created by the contract.  Thus, the dispute does not fall within the arbitration 
  clause.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As Viscount Simon L.C. said at p. 366 in <i>Heyman,</i> an arbitration 
  clause is to be construed “in the light of the circumstances in which it was 
  made”.  In this case, on August 26, 1996, after the training program required 
  by Primerica ended, Huras and Primerica entered into a contract which established 
  a new commercial relationship: Huras became Primerica’s licensed sales representative.  
  In my view, the arbitration clause, properly construed, clearly contemplates 
  a resolution by arbitration only if the dispute between the parties arose from 
  the relationship created by the contract.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I recognize that it is established policy that courts should 
  encourage the resolution of disputes through arbitration.  As this court recently 
  reiterated, where the language of an arbitration clause is capable of bearing 
  more than one interpretation, one of which provides for arbitral resolution, 
  a court should favor that interpretation.  See:  <i>Canadian National Railway 
  Co. v. Lovat Tunnel Equipment</i> (1999), 174 D.L.R. (4th) 385 (Ont. C.A.).  
  In this case, were there any doubt whether the arbitration clause reasonably 
  contemplated the dispute in question, I would agree with the appellant that 
  the arbitration clause should be construed in favor of arbitration.  However, 
  for the above reasons, I am left in no doubt as to the plain meaning of the 
  arbitration clause which the parties included in their contract.  The dispute 
  does not fall within that clause.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In criticizing the motion judge’s finding that the arbitration 
  clause “cannot be construed as applying retrospectively” to a dispute relating 
  to events that occurred prior to the date of the contract, counsel for Primerica 
  relied on American authorities.  He submits that these authorities illustrate 
  that District Courts and Circuit Courts in the United States have overwhelmingly 
  held that arbitration clauses may apply to disputes arising prior to the signing 
  of a contract containing an arbitration clause.  In my view, these cases are 
  distinguishable on their facts.  The focus of each case was the interpretation 
  of an arbitration clause that was said to require the arbitration of all disputes 
  between the parties.  I do not read these cases as establishing any general 
  legal principle that arbitration clauses must always be construed as applying 
  to disputes between the parties arising prior to the contract in which  they 
  are found.  Like the American cases, this case involves the construction of 
  an arbitration clause in a contract and the determination of whether the dispute 
  between the parties falls within its terms.  Like the American cases, this case

  </span></span> In addition to finding that the dispute between the parties did 
  not fall within the arbitration clause, the motion judge also found that the 
  arbitration clause was  unconscionable, and that it was unenforceable under 
  s. 3(1) of the <i>Employment Standards Act.</i>  That section precludes any 
  agreement from contracting out of or waiving any employment standard mandated 
  by the Act.  In doing so, the motion judge appreciated that his findings regarding 
  unconscionability and the violation of s. 3(1) were unnecessary to the result.  
  There is no doubt that it was unnecessary for the motion judge to decide these 
  issues in order to determine whether to stay the respondent’s action under s. 
  7(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>.  These findings are clearly<i> obiter 
  dicta</i> and, therefore, not binding as a precedent.  Because these findings 
  are <i>obiter dicta</i>, it is not necessary to review their correctness, as 
  requested by counsel for Primerica.</p>
