<p align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On 
  appeal from the judgment of Mr. Justice Kenneth C. Binks dated May 26, 2000.</span></p>
<h4 align="center"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>ENDORSEMENT</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;text-decoration:none;text-underline:none'></span></h4>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [1]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We think 
  that there was evidence reasonably supporting the trial judge’s finding that 
  Loblaws was liable under s. 3 of the <i>Occupiers Liability Act</i> and that 
  in arriving at his conclusion he did not impose a standard of absolute liability.  
  Although there was evidence that Loblaws had a system of maintenance with respect 
  to its floors, there was no evidence that it was carried out on the day in question.</p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [2]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>With respect to contributory negligence, 
  the trial judge reviewed the evidence relating to it and, although he should 
  have made clear findings on the issue, it is reasonable to infer that he found 
  that there was no contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [3]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;'>On the subject of general damages, we are 
  satisfied that there was evidence on which the trial judge could have made the 
  award he did, that he did not proceed upon a wrong principle, and that the result 
  could not be called wholly erroneous.</span></p>
<p class=Mainparagraph align=left style='text-align:left;
'> [4]     <span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The difficulty 
  that arises relates to the trial judge’s treatment of the claim for loss of 
  income and the submitted inconsistency between his finding on this claim and 
  that on the claim for general damages.  While this causes us concern, it is 
  not sufficient to persuade us that his findings relating to general damages 
  and his resulting assessment were an error such that we should interfere with 
  it.  We would observe that, giving effect to the appellant’s position at his 
  highest, Mr. Hussein suffered for 18 months following the accident.  If this 
  were accepted, it would reduce his general damages but, in these circumstances, 
  he would be entitled to an award for loss of income.  The total award might 
  not exactly equal $60,000 but this is a factor to be taken into account.</p>
