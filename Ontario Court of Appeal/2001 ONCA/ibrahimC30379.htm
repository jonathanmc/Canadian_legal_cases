  </span></span> In this case, the trial judge was unequivocal in his finding 
  that he did not believe the evidence of the accused, did not find it to be reasonably 
  true and found it to be a concoction.  In these circumstances, any reference 
  to the instruction set out in <i>W.(D.)</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span> 
  [1] </span></a> would have been superfluous.  </p>
<p class=Headingnumber style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> That the appellant was the aggressor in this confrontation and 
  fight with the victim is beyond dispute.  The appellant pleads self-defence 
  but there is no independent evidence to suggest such a defence.  Once the trial 
  judge rejected the evidence of the appellant, there was no basis for instructing 
  himself as to this defence.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Any criticism of the language of the trial judge’s 
  reasons in arriving at his verdict are subsumed in the following concluding 
  paragraphs:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span>            </span>Mr. Mohammed Ibrahim had no reason whatsoever 
      to pick up that knife and to use it on the victim.  He was not in any fear 
      of his personal safety or of any grievous bodily harm or anything even more 
      serious.  He was the aggressor with respect to the knife.  He also used 
      Exhibit No. 6, the stick, and he used it as against Mr. Ahmed and he seriously 
      wounded Mr. Ahmed.</p>
    <p><span>            </span>The Crown has proven its case beyond a reasonable 
      doubt.  As I said, I simply cannot accept the version of events as related 
      in this court by the accused person which was, as I say, not straightforward 
      and it was rambling and evasive.  It’s not true, nor is it reasonably true.  
      To put it in simple terms, the accused person overreacted and reacted violently 
      when it was totally unjustified for him to do so.  As I have said, the Crown 
      has proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt on all counts, and I find 
      the accused guilty as charged.</p>
  </blockquote>

  </span></span> The trial judge’s two references earlier in his reasons to relying 
  on credible evidence, as opposed to the totality of the evidence, were in error.  
  However, considered in the context of his reasons as a whole, they were of little 
  significance.  There was simply no alternative verdict available to him in this 
  case.  In the last analysis, we would rely upon the proviso set out in s. 686.(1)(b)(iii) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>
