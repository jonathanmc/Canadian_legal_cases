  requirements of s. 9.1 of the Automobile Insurance Regulation, R.R.O. 1990, 
  Reg. 664, as amended (&quot;the regulation&quot;) under the Insurance Act, R.S.O. 
  1990, c. I.8 upon offers to settle pursuant to Rule 49.</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US>The Facts</span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following a motor vehicle accident on May 19, 1999, the plaintiff/respondent 
  Donald Igbokwe (the “plaintiff”) claimed and received statutory benefits (SABs) 
  from his insurer/appellant Coseco Insurance Company.  The insurer retained the 
  co-appellant HB&nbsp;Group Insurance Management Ltd. to adjust the claim.  I 
  will refer to both appellants as the “insurer”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A dispute arose as to certain parts of the plaintiff’s entitlement 
  to benefits.  On May 19, 2000, counsel for the plaintiff issued a statement 
  of claim seeking past and future accident benefits as well as general, punitive 
  and exemplary damages.  The insurer retained counsel and a statement of defence 
  was duly filed.  By way of a letter dated September 8, 2000, counsel for the 
  plaintiff wrote directly to the adjuster for the insurer, stating:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I have received instructions from Mr. Igbokwe to settle his accident benefits 
      claim, past and future, for an additional payment of $45,000.00, plus party 
      and party costs.            </p>
    <p>The offer was forwarded to counsel for the insurer who wrote to counsel 
      for the plaintiff on September 28, 2000, accepting the offer of “$45,000.00, 
      plus party and party costs”.  The letter requested that the plaintiff’s 
      costs be assessed.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Counsel for the plaintiff took the position that an assessment 
  of the costs was not acceptable.  He demanded a fixed amount for costs.  Counsel 
  for the parties could not agree on a fixed amount and the insurer moved under 
  Rule 49.09 to enforce the settlement of the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The motions judge dismissed the motion for judgment finding that 
  the matter had not been settled.  He did so on the basis that the alleged settlement 
  did not comply with s.&nbsp;9.1 of the regulation; and that the offer of September 
  8, 2000 was not a Rule 49 offer to settle since it had been improperly served.  
  I will deal firstly with the second issue.</p>
<h4><span lang=EN-US> </span><span lang=EN-US>Relevant Legislation</span></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <h4><i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i></h4>
    <p>49.02(1) A party to a proceeding may serve on any other party an offer 
      to settle any one or more of the claims in the proceeding on the terms specified 
      in the offer to settle (Form 49A). R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, r. 49.02(1). </p>
    <p><br>
      Automobile Insurance Regulation<br>
      &quot;Settlements - Statutory Accident Benefits&quot;</p>
    <p>9.1 (1) In this section,<br>
      &quot;settlement&quot; means an agreement between an insurer and an insured 
      person that finally disposes of a claim or dispute in respect of the insured 
      person's entitlement to one or more benefits under the Statutory Accident 
      Benefits Schedule.</p>
    <p>(2) Before a settlement is entered into between an insurer and an insured 
      person, the insurer shall give the insured person a written notice that 
      contains the following:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>1. A description of the benefits that may be available to the insured 
          person under the Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule and any other 
          benefits that may be available to the insured person under a contract 
          of automobile insurance.<br>
          2. A description of the impact of the settlement on the benefits described 
          under paragraph 1, including a statement of the restrictions contained 
          in the settlement on the insured person's right to mediate, litigate, 
          arbitrate, appeal or apply to vary an order as provided in sections 
          280 to 284 of the Act.<br>
          3. A statement that the insured person may rescind the settlement within 
          two business days after the settlement is entered into by delivering 
          a written notice to the insurer.<br>
          4. A statement that the tax implications of the settlement may be different 
          from the tax implications of the benefits described under paragraph 
          1.<br>
          5. If the settlement provides for the payment of a lump sum in an amount 
          offered by the insurer and, with respect to a benefit under the Statutory 
          Accident Benefits Schedule that is not a lump sum benefit, the settlement 
          contains a restriction on the insured person's right to mediate, litigate, 
          arbitrate, appeal or apply to vary an order as provided in sections 
          280 to 284 of the Act, a statement of the insurer's estimate of the 
          commuted value of the benefit and an explanation of how the insurer 
          determined the commuted value.<br>
          6. A statement advising the insured person to consider seeking independent 
          legal, financial and medical advice before entering into the settlement.</p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>(3) A settlement may be rescinded by the insured person, within two business 
      days after the settlement is entered into, by delivering a written notice 
      to the insurer.</p>
    <p>(4) If the insurer did not comply with subsection (2), the insured person 
      may rescind the settlement after the period mentioned in subsection (3) 
      by delivering a written notice to the insurer.</p>
    <p>(5) A restriction on an insured person's right to mediate, litigate, arbitrate, 
      appeal or apply to vary an order as provided in sections 280 to 284 of the 
      Act is not void under subsection 279 (2) of the Act if,</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>(a) the restriction is contained in a settlement; and<br>
          (a) the insurer complied with subsection (2). O. Reg. 780/93, s. 7.</p>
      </blockquote>

    <p><br>
      <i>Insurance Act</i></p>

      <blockquote> 
        <p>279.(1) Disputes in respect of any insured person's entitlement to 
          statutory accident benefits or in respect of the amount of statutory 
          accident benefits to which an insured person is entitled shall be resolved 
          in accordance with sections 280 to 283 and the Statutory Accident Benefits 
          Schedule.<br>
          <br>
          (2) Any restriction on a party's right to mediate, litigate, appeal 
          or apply to vary an order as provided in sections 280 to 284, or on 
          a party's right to arbitrate under section 282, is void except as provided

<h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
<p><span>            </span><b>1)</b> <b>Was the offer of September 8, 2000 a 
  Rule 49 offer?</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>Leaving aside for the moment the issue of the 
  service of the offer, there is, in my view, no question that the offer of September 
  8, 2000 complied with Rule 49 and was a proper offer to settle the plaintiff’s 
  claim.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The offer satisfies the requirements of Rule 49.02 as it relates 
  to a claim in the proceeding, being a claim included in the statement of claim, 
  namely, the entitlement to accident benefits.  It can only be interpreted as 
  a settlement of all the plaintiff’s claims because otherwise it would make no 
  sense to request party and party costs.  It is not suggested that the offer 
  applied to anything less than the whole of the plaintiff's claim.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect to service, the motions judge concluded that the 
  offer could not constitute an offer to settle under Rule 49 because it was not 
  properly served by the solicitor for the plaintiff on the insurer, in accordance 
  with rule 16.01(4)(a) (service on solicitor of record).  In my view, the motions 
  judge was clearly in error.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accepting that the offer should have been served on the insurer’s 
  solicitor of record pursuant to Rule 16.01(4)(a), failure to comply with this 
  technical requirement ought not to alter the nature and legal effect of the 
  offer under Rule 49.  Indeed, Rule 2.01(1) provides that a failure to comply 
  with the rules is an irregularity and “does not render a proceeding or a step, 
  document or order in a proceeding a nullity”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the circumstances of this case, the service of the offer to 
  settle on the adjuster did not create any difficulty, confusion or otherwise 
  mislead the plaintiff.  The plaintiff’s offer was properly received and subsequently 
  accepted by the solicitors for the insurer both as to the amount and as to costs.  
  The manner of service was never challenged by the insurer.  The plaintiff is 
  in effect relying on his own imperfect compliance with the rules to rescind 
  his own offer.  Although he had offered to settle for party and party costs, 
  he did not want the costs to be assessed but instead wanted a fixed amount.  
  This is not what he had asked for in the offer to settle.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The rules are designed to encourage and facilitate settlements 
  and should be interpreted accordingly.  An offer to settle, as a matter of principle, 
  should not be invalidated on a mere technicality of service, especially when 
  the error lies with the person attempting to rescind the settlement.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The offer of September 8, 2000 was a proper Rule&nbsp;49 offer 
  to settle ongoing litigation.  </p>

      at paragraph 12, where he states that the purpose of section 9 was to protect 
      unrepresented insureds from being pressured into unwise settlements.</p>
    <p>[para.&nbsp;15]  I would go further and find that it was intended that 
      the settlements to which the legislation was to apply were those arising 
      out of the settlement regime contained in the regulation.  The evil at which 
      the legislation was addressed was to prevent the exploitation by a party 
      experienced in the negotiation of claims, of its inexperienced insured to 
      whom it owed the duty of dealing in utmost good faith.</p>
    <p>[para.&nbsp;16]   It cannot be that the legislation was to apply in the 
      situation before me, in which the parties are in an adversarial process 
      represented by competent counsel, in the course of which, the insured plaintiff 
      instructs his counsel to put forward an offer to settle his claim.</p>
    <p>[para.&nbsp;17]   It is apparent to me that Section 9.1 and Rule 49 cannot 
      work in tandem.  I do not accept the submission to the contrary made by 
      Mr. Shields.  To permit an offer to be made under Rule 49, which can be 
      withdrawn two days after acceptance if Section 9.1(2) information is provided 
      with the offer, or if it is not, two days after the day on which the information 
      is provided, is to make a mockery of the Rule 49 procedure.</p>
    <p>[para.&nbsp;18]   Legislative enactments are presumed to operate in harmony 
      and to be consistent with one another.  Those dealing with the same subject, 
      here settlement, are to be presumed to be drafted with one another in mind, 
      thereby offering consistent treatment of the subject.     See <i>Driedger 
      on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed.,  Butterworths, 
      page 285/286.</p>
    <p>[para.&nbsp;19]   In my opinion, given the purpose of the Insurance Act 
      to which I have referred, it was not intended that the settlement regime 
      contained in the legislation was to apply to the settlement of ongoing litigation 
      to the exclusion of Rule 49.  Rule 49 takes over when the parties are, as 
      here, represented by counsel and into litigation.  Litigation is settled 
      for a variety of reasons, by no means all of which are related to the amount 
      of the claim.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'> [1] </span></a></p>
    <p>[para.&nbsp;20]   The Rule was invoked by plaintiff's counsel, as he states, 
      after receiving settlement instructions from his client.  To permit the 
      client to avoid the consequences of the proper acceptance of a proper offer 
      made under those circumstances would not only inflict upon the Rule a serious 
      wound, but would defy common sense.</p>

  </span></span> The judgment of Jennings J. in <i>Kibalian</i> was appealed to 
  the Divisional Court and the appeal was allowed.  O’Leary J., speaking for the 
  court, rejected the reasoning of Jennings J. and concluded that s.&nbsp;9.1 
  applied to offers to settle made under Rule 49.  He found comfort in the wording 
  of s.&nbsp;9.1(2)5. to the effect the section still applied during the arbitration 
  process.  If it applied during the arbitration process, in his view, it was 
  intended to apply during the litigation process.  O’Leary J. also quoted with 
  approval from the endorsement of the motions judge in the present case when 
  he said “that there is nothing in the wording of s.&nbsp;9.1 which could reasonably 
  lead to the conclusion that it does not equally apply to settlements made pursuant 
  to Rule 49”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, the reference in s.&nbsp;9.1(2)5. is to arbitration 
  (and mediation) under the <i>Insurance Act.  </i>That is an entirely different 
  process from the litigation process under the rules of practice, with its panoply 
  of disclosure rights.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The settlements to which s.&nbsp;9.1 is intended to apply are 
  those arising out of the settlement regime contained in the regulation<b>, </b>a 
  regime generally designed to accommodate unrepresented claimants.  However, 
  the section also clearly applies to an insured person who is represented by 
  counsel, prior to litigation: <i>Opoku v. Pal</i> (1999), 49 O.R. (3d) 100 (S.C.J.), 
  aff’d (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.).  In my view, s. 9.1 was intended to apply 
  to an insured person, whether represented or not by counsel, as part of a scheme 
  that deals with settlements which preceded court proceedings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, Jennings J.’s analysis of the correlation between 
  Rule 49 and s.&nbsp;9.1 of the regulation is essentially correct.  Rule 49 is 
  intended to encourage settlements of litigation and it carries costs consequences. 
  Section 9.1 is not concerned with offer, acceptance and cost consequences, but 
  rather with the right of rescission within a cooling-off period once an agreement 
  between the insurer and a claimant has been reached for benefits (SABs).  Its 
  purpose is to provide a claimant with adequate information <i>prior</i> to the 
  commencement of an action in order to avoid a quick and uninformed decision 
  as to the benefits the claimant is entitled to receive from the insurer. Once 
  an action is commenced, any such relevant information would be available in 
  the course of litigation, something an insured would not otherwise be entitled 
  to receive but for the requirements of s. 9.1.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 9.1 was never intended to affect Rule 49.  The difficulties 
  that would result from offers to settle under Rule 49 received on the eve of 
  trial and during trial, particularly jury trials, do not permit s.&nbsp;9.1 
  and Rule 49 to work in tandem.   Once an action has been commenced, the relationship 
  between claimant and insurer becomes adversarial.   Offers to settle litigation 
  fall under Rule 49 and the rule is a complete code.  Section 9.1 was not designed 
  to accord special rights or impose obligations on claimants and insurers in 
  settling their court proceedings<b>.</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The respondent also submits that the insurer 
  was required to comply with s. 9.1 because of s. 279 of the <i>Insurance Act.</i> 
  </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, s. 279 and hence s. 9.1 of the regulations have no 
  application once the parties are in litigation.  Sections 280 to 284 are in 
  a part of the Act headed “Dispute Resolution – Statutory Accident Benefits” 
  and deal exclusively with the scheme for resolving disputes through mediation 
  or arbitration.  The only reference to litigation is contained in s. 281 and 
  requires the parties to exhaust mediation before bringing a proceeding in a 
  court of competent jurisdiction.  If the parties have exhausted mediation under 
  ss. 280 and 280.1, chosen not to attempt arbitration in accordance with ss. 
  282 to 284, and embarked upon litigation, the Rules of Civil Procedure apply 
  and the litigation must be settled in accordance with the rules, including Rule 
  49.  As I have indicated, s.&nbsp;9.1 and Rule 49 cannot work in tandem.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As stated earlier, s.&nbsp;9.1 was intended to protect the right 
  to information an insured person would not otherwise have against the insurer 
  but which protection would be available in court proceedings.  Although s.&nbsp;9.1 
  and Rule&nbsp;49 operate in different spheres, it would indeed be an unwise 
  insurer who would attempt to have the court enforce a Rule&nbsp;49 offer to 
  settle, whether it came from the insurer or the unrepresented litigant, without 
  having provided the unrepresented litigant with the type of notice foreseen 
  under s.&nbsp;9.1(2).</p>

  </span></span> In the result, I conclude that the offer to settle of September 
  8, 2000 was a Rule 49 offer.  I also conclude that s.&nbsp;9.1 of the regulation 
  does not apply to a Rule 49 offer.  I would allow the appeal, set aside the 
  order of Matlow J. dated December 5, 2000 and grant judgment in accordance with 
  the terms of the plaintiff’s offer to settle of September&nbsp;8, 2000, as accepted 
  by the defendants on September 28, 2000.</p>
