    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Inco operates a nickel mining complex in the 
    town of Levack in the Regional Municipality of Sudbury.  Water is used in 
    the mining process and it becomes contaminated with high levels of nickel 
    and iron.  To reduce the level of heavy metals, Inco treats the water with 
    lime before releasing it into Grassy Creek, from where it ultimately flows 
    into the Onaping River.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>Between December 25, 1993 and March 1, 1994, 
    Inco conducted a planned shut- down of a number of its mining operations, 
    including the water treatment system.  It was a very cold winter, but a thaw 
    occurred in mid-February.  On February 23, 1994, an Inco employee detected 
    a flow of water from the mine treatment area, which is close to Grassy Creek.  
    The discharge was found, sampled and tested on the 23<sup>rd</sup>, 25<sup>th</sup> 
    and 28<sup>th</sup> of February, as well as the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> 
    of March.  Each of the tests revealed that the escaped water had very high 
    levels of nickel and iron, levels that significantly exceeded Inco's own treatment 
    objectives. An Inco employee reported the discharge to the Ministry of the 
    Environment (“MOE”) on March 2, 1994.   </span></p>

    They met with Inco employees and collected water samples for the purpose of 
    determining toxicity levels.  They also advised an Investigation and Enforcement 
    Officer of the MOE,  Officer Dennis Sloan (“IEB Officer”), that there had 
    been a discharge from the mine treatment area into Grassy Creek and that samples 
    were being analysed by the MOE.</span></p>

    including its in-house counsel, to advise that he intended to interview any 
    Inco employee who had knowledge of the incident.  Inco’s in-house counsel 
    identified the relevant personnel and arranged for interviews to be conducted 
    at Inco.  He also advised the employees that they were under a statutory obligation 
    to submit to the interviews.  On March 9 and 10, 1994, the IEB Officer attended 
    at Inco and interviewed the employees in the presence of in-house counsel.   
    At the beginning of each interview, counsel stated his objection to the interview 
    and indicated that his clients were co-operating to avoid potential charges 
    of obstruction.  He also voiced his objection without success to the taping 
    of the interviews by the IEB Officer.    After the questioning sessions, the 
    IEB Officer requested Inco personnel to provide various documents concerning 
    the discharges, including Inco’s sampling analysis of the discharges and Inco’s 
    operational procedures on shutdowns.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>At the trial, presided over by Justice of the 
    Peace Kitlar, Inco brought a motion to stay the charges against it based on 
    allegations of abuse of process.  Inco’s position was that the IEB Officer 
    did not have statutory authority to interview Inco’s employees nor to seize 
    documents from Inco.   Kitlar J.P. denied the motion, finding that if there 
    were a possibility that any of the Inco employees were going to be charged, 
    the IEB Officer would have cautioned them.   </span></p>

    the elements of the offences created by ss. 30(1) and (2) of the OWRA, Kitlar 
    J.P. found that there was a flow of water from the treatment area into Grassy 
    Creek on the dates in question and that the samples contained excessive nickel 
    and other metals.  He observed that the allowable level of nickel in the provincial 
    guidelines on water quality is 0.05 parts per million (“ppm”).  The nickel 
    concentration in Inco’s mine effluent on February 23rd ranged between 44 and 
    44.7 ppm.   Similarly high concentrations were found on the other dates.  
    He held that the discharge was of a nature that may impair the quality of 
    the water and that not all reasonable steps were taken to avoid the discharge, 
    contrary to s. 30(1) of the OWRA. With respect to s. 30(2), Kitlar J.P. concluded 
    that Inco should have contacted the MOE about the discharge on the first day 
    the flow was detected.   He entered a finding of guilt on both counts and 
    imposed a fine of $24,010.</span></p>

    <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (“POA”), Wilson J. overturned 
    both of the convictions and ordered a new trial.   He held that Kitlar J.P. 
    failed to apply the correct test for determining whether an offence under 
    s. 30(1) had occurred.  Wilson J. stated that the correct test was established 
    by Austin Prov. J. in <i>R. v. Imperial Oil</i> (1995), 17 C.E.L.R. (N.S.) 
    12 at 18 (Ont. Ct. (Gen.Div.)).  Wilson J. quoted the following passage from 
    <i>Imperial Oil</i>:</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>In a case such as the one before me, 
      the offence is made out where the Crown proves beyond any reasonable doubt 
      that the <i>discharge of material </i>may impair the quality of the water, 
      based upon not only the nature of the <i>material</i>, but also the nature 
      and circumstances of the <i>discharge</i> of that material, including its 
      quantity and concentration, as well as the time frame over which the discharge 
      took place.  Such factors may be very relevant to the issue of impairment.  
      In this case, for example, it is the large quantity of activated sludge 
      over a short time frame which renders the discharge of material potentially 
      impairing. [Emphasis in original].</span></div>

    as through compulsory interrogation sessions, when offences are being investigated.   
    Inco asserts that these powers expire after reasonable and probable grounds 
    exist for the laying of charges.  Under these provisions, IEB officers have 
    the power to seize items without a warrant only in very limited (exigent or 
    urgent) circumstances and, pursuant to the POA, only with a search warrant

    require Inco employees to submit to compulsory interrogation sessions nor 
    to produce documents. In engaging in such conduct, the IEB Officer infringed

    that the IEB Officer did not have lawful authority to conduct the questioning

    is closely tied to its argument that the investigation violated its s. 8 right 
    to remain secure against unreasonable search and seizure. If the IEB Officer’s 
    warrantless search and seizure was not authorized by law, then, in accordance 
    with <i>Hunter v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145,  there was a violation 
    of Inco’s rights under s. 8.   The jurisprudence in the context of regulatory

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The primary issue on the Crown’s appeal is 
    the proper test for determining whether the offence of impairing water quality 
    under s. 30(1) has been committed.  The Crown’s position is that Wilson J.’s 
    interpretation of that provision is unduly restrictive on a plain reading 
    of the Act.  The Crown asserts that the test described by Austin Prov. J. 
    in <i>R. v. Imperial Oil</i>, <i>supra</i>,and adopted by Wilson J., is not 
    relevant where the material discharged into water is such that it may impair 
    water quality by its very nature.   The <i>Imperial Oil </i>test, set out 
    above at paragraph  14, is repeated here for convenience: </span></p>
</div>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <div class=Section1><span lang=EN-US>In a case such as the one before me, 
      the offence is made out where the Crown proves beyond any reasonable doubt 
      that the <i>discharge of material </i>may impair the quality of the water, 
      based upon not only the nature of the <i>material</i>, but also the nature 
      and circumstances of the <i>discharge</i> of that material, including its 
      quantity and concentration, as well as the time frame over which the discharge 
      took place.  Such factors may be very relevant to the issue of impairment.  
      In this case, for example, it is the large quantity of activated sludge 
      over a short time frame which renders the discharge of material potentially 
      impairing. [Emphasis in original].</span></div>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div class=Section1>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-GB>According to the Crown, the <i>Imperial Oil</i> test is only applicable 
    in cases where the material discharged is innocuous by nature, but may become 
    harmful if it is discharged in a certain quantity, or under certain conditions.</span></p>

    </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>In contrast, Inco argues that this court’s 
    reasons dismissing the appeal from Austin Prov. J.’s decision in <i>Imperial 
    Oil</i> affirmed the general applicability of the <i>Imperial Oil</i> test 
    to charges under s. 30:  (1997), 25 C.E.L.R. (N.S.) 182.  Thus, according 
    to Inco, the relevant test for determining whether a discharge of material 
    may impair water quality requires a consideration of the entire circumstances 
    of the discharge, including the length of time over which it occurs, along 
    with the nature, quality, and concentration of the material that is being 
    discharged.   Inco submits that the Crown failed to adduce evidence directed 
    to establishing the nature of the metals in the discharge, the nature of the 
    discharge as a whole, and the circumstances of the discharge.  Inco contends 
    that it offered the only evidence on these issues and that this evidence showed 
    that the discharge had no potential to impair.  Inco thus asks that an acquittal 
    be entered on both charges.</span></p>

    <i>Imperial Oil</i> does not bear out Inco’s contention that the decision 
    affirms the general applicability of the <i>Imperial Oil</i> test.  Indeed, 
    the court stated that it was unnecessary to review and rationalize the impairment 
    jurisprudence under the OWRA to dispose of the appeal.  The court indicated 
    its agreement with Austin Prov. J.’s conclusion that a conviction imposed 
    by a justice of the peace under s. 16(1) of the OWRA [now s. 30(1) of the 
    OWRA] was not unreasonable considering the circumstances of the discharge 
    in that case.  But this court did not comment on the correctness or applicability 
    of the test that she articulated.</span></p>

    from the discharge by Imperial Oil of approximately 12,400 pounds of a material 
    known as activated sludge into the St. Clair River.  Activated sludge is described 
    by Austin Prov. J. at p. 17 as not being toxic, persistent or bioaccumulative, 
    but rather a micro-organic substance that is ubiquitous and pre-exists naturally 
    in small quantities in unpolluted waters.  She found that if activated sludge 
    were discharged at low levels, it would not have the capacity to impair water 
    quality.  However, the evidence was that if it were discharged at high concentrations, 
    it might deplete oxygen available for aquatic organisms and thereby impair 
    water quality.</span></p>

    (Ont. Ct. (Gen.Div.)).  At issue in that case was a discharge into Lake Ontario 
    of a very small quantity of polychlorinated biphenyls (“PCBs”).  The defence 
    argued that the small quantity of PCBs discharged did not have the capacity 
    to impair the receiving water and thus an offence under what is now s. 30(1) 
    of the OWRA was not made out.   Corbett J. rejected this argument on the basis 
    that the release of any quantity of PCBs would create impairment of the quality 
    of the receiving waters due to the inherent toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulativeness 
    of PCBs.  She stated at p. 316:  </span></p>

    to the discharge of toxic chemicals into Ontario waterways.  Having accepted 
    that the substance at issue before her was not toxic, she nonetheless held 
    at p. 18 that <i>Toronto Electric Commissioners</i> “…does not preclude a 
    conviction in circumstances where a substance which may have no potential 
    to ‘impair’ at low levels becomes capable of impairing as a result of the 
    excessive quantity or concentration of material discharged.”   This significant 
    qualifying sentence immediately precedes the statement in <i>Imperial Oil</i>

    effluent that was discharged over a short time frame.  These circumstances

    the high level of discharge over a short period of time may have depleted

    when determining whether an offence under s. 30(1) has been made out.  Inherently 
    toxic substances will always fail that test, reflecting zero-tolerance for 
    discharging materials that, by their nature, may impair water quality.  If 
    the material in the discharge is not inherently toxic, then it will be necessary

    of ss. 28 and 30(1) of the OWRA, which creates a wide ambit of protection 
    for Ontario waters.  Section 30(1) prohibits the discharge into water of materials 
    that <i>may impair</i> the quality of the water <i>of any waters</i>.  The 
    wording of s. 30(1) indicates two things:  i) the material need only have 
    the capacity to impair the water to be caught by the provision;  and ii)  
    the water that may be impaired is any water, not just the water where the 
    material is discharged.  Section 28(1) indicates that impairment under s. 
    30(1) will be deemed to have occurred where the material causes, or may cause, 
    injury to any living thing as a result of the use or consumption of living 
    matter in the water or surrounding soil.  Emitting materials into waters that 
    may impair water quality is forbidden, except under enumerated circumstances 
    where Certificates of Approval may be obtained:  see s. 53 of the OWRA. </span></p>

    to justify.  Environmental damage caused by discharging materials into Ontario 
    waters may not be immediately apparent after the discharge.   As well, impairment 
    may be caused by the accumulation of materials over time.  As Bourassa Terr.
