</span>In April 1994, as part of its effort to reduce government
spending, Ontario made significant alterations in its health care system,
including changes to the rules governing eligibility for coverage under the
Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP). 
The appellants were among many who were adversely affected by the new
rules.  Some of the appellants became
ineligible for OHIP for the duration of the three-month waiting period
introduced by the  changes.  For others, the ineligibility was indefinite
and continued as long as their status under the <i>Immigration Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-2 did not change.</p>

</span>The changes to OHIP challenged in this proceeding (the 1994
changes) did three things:</p>

<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>They narrowed the definition of resident, a precon<a
name="_Hlt503849623"></a>dition to eligibility for OHIP, by linking residency
to ones status under the <i>Immigration Act</i>.</p>

<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>They introduced a three-month waiting period for
residents of Ontario applying for OHIP coverage.</p>

<p class=headingblank align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>They eliminated, with two exceptions, eligibility for
OHIP based on dependency status.  Under
the changes, eligibility for OHIP was to be decided on an individual
basis.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellants brought an application seeking a declaration
that the 1994 changes contravened s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i> and were of no force and effect, and seeking compensation for
medical expenses incurred by them when, but for the 1994 changes, those
expenses would have been covered by OHIP. 
Dilks J. found there was no breach of s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i> and dismissed the application.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[1]</span></a>  He held that the more restrictive definition
of resident and the 3-month waiting period introduced by the 1994 changes
distinguished among applicants for OHIP on the basis of residency, and that the
distinction did not contravene s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.  He also held that the determination of
eligibility on an individual rather than family basis cannot create an
inequality under the law, but instead avoids potential discriminatory
distinctions based on family membership.</p>

</span>The appellants appeal from the judgment of Dilks J.,
submitting that he erred in finding that none of the impugned changes to OHIP
violated the appellants equality rights. 
The appellants are supported in the appeal by the Womens Legal
Education and Action Fund, the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants,
and the Disabled Womens Network Canada, all of whom were granted intervenor
status on the appeal.  The intervenors
were represented by the same counsel and filed a joint factum.</p>

</span>The claims advanced by the appellants require:  first, an examination of the legislative
provisions governing OHIP eligibility, particularly the changes made to those
provisions in 1994;  second, a review of
the factual circumstances of each appellant;  
third, an analysis of the relationship between s. 6 and s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>;  fourth, a consideration of the principles underlying s. 15 of the
<i>Charter</i>;  and fifth, an application of those principles to the appellants
claims. </p>

</span>Before turning to the analysis outlined above, three features
of the appellants submissions should be highlighted.  The appellants do not contest Ontarios right to limit the
availability of OHIP to persons who are ordinarily resident in Ontario.  They contend, however, that the definition
of residency introduced by the 1994 changes and the waiting period introduced
by those changes had the effect of discriminating against them and infringed
their s. 15 equality rights.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The appellants also do not challenge the 1994 changes to OHIP
on any basis other than s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.  There was no claim that the regulations
which effected two of the challenged changes are beyond the regulation making
power granted by the operative statute.

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Finally, the appellants do not challenge the constitutionality
of any of the federal laws or actions of the federal government that intertwine
with the operation of the OHIP scheme. 
Specifically, there is no challenge to any part of the federal
immigration scheme nor the <i>Canada Health
Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-6.  The
federal government is not a party to these proceedings.</p>

</span>OHIP is a provincial health care plan available to residents
of Ontario and administered by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (the
Ministry).  Its purpose is described in
s. 10 of the <i>Health Insurance Act</i>,
R.S.O. 1990, c. H.6: </p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>The Ontario Health
Insurance Plan is continued for the purpose of providing for insurance against
the costs of insured services on a non-profit basis on uniform terms and

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Services available through OHIP are provided to insured
persons without charge and without regard to pre-existing medical
conditions.  The services include
medically necessary physician services, in-patient and out-patient services provided
by public hospitals, some drug and home care costs, and some costs associated
with other health care services (<i>e.g.</i>
physiotherapy).</p>

</span>OHIP is part of the national health care scheme created in
1966 and presently maintained under the <i>Canada
Health Act</i>.  Under that scheme,
provincial health plans deliver health services and the federal government
provides assistance in funding those services. 
Provincial health plans that meet the five criteria set out in the <i>Canada Health Act</i> are eligible for full
federal funding.  Section 7 of the <i>Canada Health Act</i> identifies the five
criteria and subsequent sections define each criterion.  I need refer only to the universality and
portability criteria.  Section 10 of the
<i>Canada Health Act</i> defines
universality in these terms:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>In order to satisfy
the criterion respecting universality, the health care insurance plan of a
province must entitle one hundred per cent of the insured persons of the
province to the insured health services provided for by the plan on uniform
terms and conditions.</p>

insured persons.  Resident is defined in
s. 2 as:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'> a person lawfully
entitled to be or to remain in Canada who makes his home and is ordinarily
present in the province, but does not include a tourist, a transient or a

</span>One of the four categories of residents who are not insured
persons under the <i>Canada Health Act</i>
is relevant to this appeal.  A resident
of a province who has not completed any minimum period of residence as may be
required for eligibility under the provincial plan is not an insured person for
the purposes of the <i>Canada Health Act</i>.  The minimum period may not exceed three
months.</p>

</span>Section 11(1) addresses the portability criterion.  Two parts of that section are germane:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>In order to satisfy
the criterion respecting portability, the health care insurance plan of a
province</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)            must not impose any minimum period

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>(c)            must provide for and be administered

another province, of the cost of insured health services provided to persons
who have ceased to be insured persons by reason of having become residents of
that other province, on the same basis as though they had not ceased to be
residents of the province.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In summary, there are three aspects of the <i>Canada Health Act</i> that are important for
the purposes of this appeal.   First, it
contemplates that persons ordinarily resident in a province, with specified
exceptions, will be covered by that provinces health plan.  The <i>Canada
Health Act</i> also permits, but does not mandate, a waiting period of up to
three months before a resident of a province is eligible for coverage under
that provinces health plan.  Finally,
the <i>Canada Health Act</i> directs that
where a person is insured under a provincial health plan and moves to another
province that has a waiting period for eligibility for coverage under its plan,
the plan of the province from which the person has moved must extend coverage
to that person during the waiting period. </p>

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Residency in Ontario has always been a prerequisite to
eligibility for OHIP.  Section 11(1) of
the <i>Health Insurance Act</i> provides
that:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>Every person who is a
resident of Ontario is entitled to become an insured person upon application
therefor to the General Manager in accordance with this Act and the
regulations.</p>

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Prior to April 1994, the <i>Health
Insurance Act</i> defined resident in terms which were very similar to those
used in the <i>Canada Health Act</i>.  Resident was defined in s. 1 as:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'> a person who is
legally entitled to remain in Canada and who makes his or her home and is
ordinarily present in Ontario, but does not include a tourist, a transient or a
visitor to Ontario, </p>

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Under the definition of resident in the <i>Health Insurance Act</i> prior to April 1994, a persons immigration
status was irrelevant as long as that person could lawfully remain in
Canada.  People who were temporarily
resident in Ontario were also eligible for OHIP as long as they were not
tourists, transients or visitors.  For
example, foreign workers working in Ontario temporarily and foreign students
studying in Ontario could be eligible for OHIP.  </p>

</span>Prior to 1994, neither the <i>Health
Insurance Act</i> nor any regulation made under that <i>Act</i> imposed a waiting period for eligibility for OHIP on Ontario
residents.  Persons who were not covered
under another provincial health plan and met the residency requirement were
eligible for OHIP from the day they took up residency in Ontario.  Persons moving into Ontario who were insured
under another provinces health plan remained under that plan for two to three
months.</p>

</span>In 1993, Ontario, like the rest of the country, was in a deep
and prolonged recession.  Rapid
increases in government spending, combined with marked decreases in government
revenues, had created a serious fiscal crisis. 
Ontario struggled under a large and ever increasing debt load, and was
running a deficit of some $17 billion. 
In April 1993, the Minister of Finance said:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>Ontario is facing a
serious economic and financial problem. 
Escalating debt, driven by declining revenues, threatens to undermine
our long-term ability to provide important public services and invest in jobs

not allow the growing debt to knock us off our plan to get Ontario back to work

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The government concluded that the continued fiscal viability
of Ontario demanded immediate and extensive cuts to government expenditures.  A plan was announced that aimed at reducing
those expenditures by $4 billion in the next year.  Every government department and agency was required to develop a
plan that would significantly reduce its expenditures.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Health care costs accounted for some 32 per cent of all
government expenditures in 1993.  Those
costs had increased dramatically in the decade before 1993.  By 1994, total health care costs were some
$17.4 billion.  OHIP accounted for about
$4.7 billion of that amount.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The annual increases in health care costs, coupled with large
reductions in the federal transfer payments relied on to fund health care, made
the fiscal crisis faced by the province particularly acute within the health
care field.  The Ministry had to make
deep cuts in its budget.  The measures
it took to achieve these reductions affected every part of the health care
system, and virtually every resident of Ontario.  Physicians fees were reduced, hospital beds were eliminated, and
it was announced that services that had previously been covered by OHIP would
no longer be covered.  These changes
were seen as essential to the long-term preservation of an effective health
care system for residents of Ontario.</p>

</span>This appeal focuses on three of the many changes made to the
health care system in Ontario in 1993-94. 
Two of these, the more restricted definition of those eligible for OHIP
and the introduction of a three-month waiting period for all persons applying
for OHIP, were motivated principally by the need to reduce spending.  The third change, the removal of eligibility
for OHIP based on ones status as a dependant of a person eligible for OHIP,
was motivated partly by the need to reduce expenditures and partly by other
considerations that will be outlined below.</p>

</span>The first change, the more restricted definition of residency,
was aimed at eliminating OHIP coverage for persons who were temporarily
resident in Ontario.  The government
concluded that it could no longer afford to provide health care coverage for
those persons.  As of 1993, there were
approximately 190,000 temporary residents registered under OHIP.  The annual cost to the health care system
for the health services provided to those temporary residents was estimated at
$194.1 million.  The government proposed
that most temporary residents would no longer be eligible for OHIP.  The change targeted primarily foreign
workers and foreign students.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>[2]</span></a>  At the same time it proposed to exclude
temporary residents from OHIP coverage, Ontario also called upon the federal
government to assume the health care costs of refugees living in Ontario.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference>[3]</span></a>  The government also determined that persons
applying for landed immigrant status while residing in Ontario should not
receive OHIP unless and until they had passed the medical examination required
of persons applying for landed immigrant status.</p>

</span>The second change, the introduction of a three-month waiting
period of eligibility for OHIP was also a cost saving measure.  Forty-three per cent of persons newly
registered for OHIP made claims against OHIP within 30 days of
registration.  OHIP officials believed
that a significant but undetermined number of these claims were made by people
who had come to Ontario not with any intention of establishing a permanent residence,
but rather to take advantage of the services available under OHIP.  Consistent with its view that OHIP should be
available only to permanent residents, Ontario sought </p>

persons from coming into the province solely for the purpose of obtaining OHIP
coverage.  A three-month waiting period
applicable to all persons applying for OHIP was seen as the most effective
method of ensuring that persons would not move into Ontario temporarily simply

</span>The government also viewed the three-month waiting period as
providing an objective basis upon which to test residency that was less
intrusive, less expensive and more predictable than any attempt to determine
residency on a case-by-case basis. 
Ontario also justified the three-month waiting period on the basis that
it was consistent with the <i>Canada Health
Act</i> and provisions in some other provincial health plans.</p>

</span>The third change, the shift to individual eligibility for OHIP
from family-based eligibility, had its genesis in 1990 when it was announced
that OHIP would move from a family-based system to one which every individual
would have his or her own OHIP card. 
The change to individual eligibility was consistent with the elimination
of the premium system which had existed up to 1990 for the funding of
OHIP.  Under that system, insured
persons paid a premium for OHIP coverage that was calculated on the basis of
the number of dependants the insured person had.  After 1990, individuals were not required to pay premiums and
OHIP was funded in part by way of an employer health tax.  The abolition of the premium requirement
based on the number of dependants logically opened the way to a system based on
individual eligibility for OHIP.</p>

</span>OHIP officials also believed that the determination of
eligibility on an individual basis would result in more permanent and reliable
records of those covered by OHIP and the services provided to them, while at
the same time serving as a more effective safeguard for the confidentiality of
individuals health records.  It was
also anticipated that a system based on individual eligibility could be
administered more efficiently and that frauds against OHIP could be reduced.</p>

</span>The government realized that these changes to OHIP would have
serious ramifications for those affected by them.  Steps were taken to notify those who would lose OHIP as a result
of these changes, and a three-month grace period beyond April 1, 1994 was
introduced to allow those people to obtain private health care coverage.  The OHIP application form was changed to
show the date from which the applicant would be eligible (normally three months
beyond the date of the application). 
Applicants were advised to obtain private health care coverage during
the waiting period.</p>

the determination of residency and, therefore eligibility for OHIP, is a
two-step process.  First, a person must
be ordinarily resident in Ontario as defined in s. 1.1(2) of the regulation.  Second, persons who are ordinarily resident
in Ontario must bring themselves within one of the 11 categories set out in s.
1.1(1)(b).  These categories are in the

</span>The term ordinarily resident is defined somewhat differently
for persons moving into Ontario from another province (s. 1.1(2)(a)) than for
persons moving into Ontario from outside of Canada (s. 1.1(2)(b)).  The differences are not, however,
significant for present purposes.  Under
the regulation, as amended, persons moving into Ontario from outside of Canada
are regarded as ordinarily resident in Ontario if they intend to make their
permanent and principal home in Ontario, and are present in Ontario for five of
the six months  and at least six of the twelve months  immediately following
the making of the OHIP application.  </p>

</span>Although the regulation is somewhat unclear, the parties
advised the court that persons applying for OHIP are not required to fulfill
the ordinary residence requirements before receiving OHIP.  By that I mean it is not a condition
precedent that OHIP applicants reside in Ontario for 12 months before they
actually receive OHIP coverage. 
Assuming the applicant satisfies OHIP that he or she <u>will</u> fulfill
the residency requirements in s. 1.1(2), and assuming that the applicant meets
the other residency criteria, the applicant will be covered by OHIP upon the
expiry of the three-month waiting period. 
For most successful applicants, this means that OHIP coverage will commence
three months after the application is made.</p>

</span>According to Ms. Jacqueline Heath, a senior official at OHIP
whose affidavit was relied on by Ontario, the categories established in s.
1.1(1)(b) of the amended regulation were intended to make persons who had a
significant degree of permanence attached to their status in Canada eligible
for OHIP, and to deny OHIP to those persons whose status in Canada did not have
the requisite degree of permanence.  For
example, Ms. Heath pointed out that under the amended regulation, OHIP was
extended to applicants for landed immigrant status who were ordinarily resident
in Ontario only after those persons had passed their medical examination.  Ontario understood that the medical examination
was the last step in the process of applying for landed immigrant status and
that persons who passed their medical examinations were virtually assured of
becoming landed immigrants.  Their
status in Canada was, therefore, sufficiently permanent to warrant OHIP
eligibility.</p>

</span>At the time Ontario introduced the new definition of resident
in April 1994, the federal Immigration Department issued Ministers permits
under s. 37 of the <i>Immigration Act</i>
that fell into one of two broad categories. 
One category was referred to as visitor case type permits and the
other was referred to as early admission case type permits.  The permits identified in paragraph 10 of
the regulation (case types 86, 87, 88, and 89) were all early admission case
type permits.  Persons holding these
permits were eligible for OHIP.  Persons
holding a Ministers permit characterized as a visitor case type permit were
not eligible for OHIP.  This distinction
was consistent with the previous legislation, which had denied OHIP coverage to
visitors.</p>

persons in the position of Raja, having been granted entry to Canada on the
basis of a Ministers permit, would likely have been issued a case type 89
Ministers permit, referred to in the Immigration Department manual as member
of a family class permit.  The OHIP
eligibility of persons holding this type of permit was not affected by the
amendments to the regulation.  They were
eligible for OHIP before and after the amendments.</p>

</span>In 1994, there were approximately 5,000 persons holding
Ministers permits residing in Ontario. 
In announcing the changes to OHIP, the government stated that these
changes would have no effect on the OHIP eligibility of persons holding
Ministers permits.  Ms. Heath explained
that the government understood that persons holding Ministers permits were
placed in either the visitor or early admission category.  The former had not previously been covered
by OHIP and the latter had been eligible for OHIP.  It was the governments intention that the latter group of permit
holders would continue to be covered by OHIP after the 1994 changes.  This was consistent with Ontarios intention
to provide OHIP to persons who were well along in the process of obtaining a
permanent status in Canada.  According
to Ms. Heath, Ontario was not aware that some individuals who were granted
early admission case type permits prior to the 1994  changes had in fact been found to be medically inadmissible and
declared ineligible for landed immigrant status.  </p>

</span>In May 1995, after consultation with the provinces, the
Immigration Department established a new series of Ministers permits referred to
as case type 90 permits.  Holders of
these permits were described as refused applicants for permanent
residence.  These new permits were
intended to distinguish between those persons who were granted Ministers
permits in anticipation of receiving landed immigrant status (case type 80
permits other than visitors permits) and those who have been found to be
members of an inadmissible class, denied landed immigrant status, but still
allowed to enter and remain in Canada (case type 90 permit holders).  Holders of case type 90 permits included
individuals who were declared medically inadmissible and individuals who were
declared inadmissible for reasons relating to criminal activity or national
security concerns.  </p>

This classification meant that he was a person who had been sponsored

medically inadmissible under s. 19 of the <i>Immigration

that it would not extend OHIP coverage to persons receiving case type 90
permits.  Immigration officials took
steps to advise applicants who received case type 90 permits, that they would
not be eligible for OHIP.  Beginning in
March 1996, about a month after Raja arrived in Canada, persons who sponsored
family members who received case type 90 permits were required to sign a declaration
acknowledging that they were aware that the permit holder was not eligible for
coverage under provincial health plans. 
Sponsors were required to acknowledge their responsibility for the
medical expenses of the permit holder.</p>

the <i>Canada Health Act</i> requires that
the health plan of the province from which that person moved extend coverage to
that person during the waiting period. 
To comply with the portability requirement in the <i>Canada Health Act</i>, Ontario has entered into an inter-provincial
eligibility and portability agreement with the other provinces.  Persons moving into Ontario from another
province maintain their health care coverage under the plan of the province
from which they moved during the period that they are not eligible for
OHIP.  Under the agreement, the
ineligibility period will range from two months plus one day to three months,
depending on the timing of the application. 
Coverage under another provinces health plan is not necessarily the
same as coverage under OHIP.  Procedures
and costs covered by OHIP may or may not be covered by other provincial plans.</p>

absence from the province to make application to extend their OHIP coverage
while absent from the province.  If the
extension were granted, these persons would not have to reapply for OHIP upon
resuming their residence in Ontario. 
The policy applied to persons who were leaving Ontario for an extended
period of time, usually for employment, educational or travel purposes, but who
fully intended to return to Ontario and to make their permanent residence in
the province.  If an extension were
granted under the policy, those persons would maintain their OHIP eligibility

</span>There are two exceptions to the requirement that each
individual establish his or her own eligibility for OHIP.  They are found in R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, as
amended.  Dependants of persons working
temporarily in Ontario under an employment authorization issued under the <i>Immigration Act</i> are eligible for OHIP on
the basis of their dependant status alone (s. 1.1(1)(b) paras. 6, 7).  Dependants of members of the clergy who are
working in Ontario under a contract of employment to administer to a religious
congregation for a period of not less than six months are similarly eligible
for OHIP (s.&nbsp;1.1(1)(b) paras. 8, 9). 
The first exception was justified by the economic advantage to the
province produced by persuading persons from outside Ontario to fill certain
job needs on a temporary basis.  OHIP
coverage for the dependants of those persons was used as an inducement to
attract those persons to come to work in Ontario.  The second exception, while not the subject of extensive evidence
on the application, would appear to be based on the perceived need to attract
persons to fill a specific kind of employment. 
Once again, OHIP coverage for dependants is used as an inducement.</p>

</span>Ms. Simon knew that she was not covered by OHIP when she
arrived in Canada as a visitor.  She
explored the possibility of obtaining private health insurance but decided that
it was not worth the cost.  After she
was married, Ms. Simon and her husband assumed that she was covered under his
OHIP.  They learned differently in
January 1995 after she was hospitalized. 
Mr. Simon then applied for OHIP on his wifes behalf.  The OHIP authorities determined that the
three-month waiting period for Ms. Simon should run from December 1994 when she
passed the medical examination required on her application for landed immigrant
status.  Ms. Simons OHIP coverage took
effect in the middle of March 1995. 
During the period that she was not covered, Ms. Simon accumulated
medical bills of some $7,000.  Ms.
Simons ineligibility flowed both from the three-month waiting period and the
removal of coverage for dependants of insured persons.</p>

</span>Section 6(2)(a) recognizes that citizens and permanent
residents (landed immigrants) have a right to move to and take up residence in
any province in Canada.  Section 6(3)(b)
provides that the mobility right described in s. 6(2)(a) is subject to laws
that impose a reasonable residency requirement as a precondition to eligibility
for publicly provided social services. 
Put in terms of the present problem, Canadian citizens and landed
immigrants have a constitutional right to move into Ontario but they cannot
complain that their mobility rights are infringed by a law which makes their
eligibility for OHIP dependent upon their meeting a reasonable residency
requirement.</p>

</span>Dilks J. observed that the mobility rights in s. 6(2)(a)
applied to citizens and landed immigrants, but not to others who were living in
Canada.  He said, at para. 86:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'> However, it seems to
me that had parliament intended [to] enshrine such mobility rights in persons
such as the applicants it would have expressly provided for all persons
lawfully entitled to remain in Canada to have s. 6(2) rights, but it chose not
to do so.  Therefore, the class of those
entitled to s. 6(2) rights does not include non landed immigrants such as the
applicants.  While I certainly agree
that the applicants are not entitled to better treatment, <u>I do not interpret
s. 6 as affording them treatment equal to that afforded to Canadian citizens
and landed immigrants.  Accordingly,
they have no <i>Charter</i> right to insist
that residency requirements affecting them be reasonable.  If there is discrimination, it is
discrimination impliedly, but clearly, recognized and tolerated by the <i>Charter</i> itself.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>As I understand this analysis, Dilks J. found that as the
appellants could not invoke the mobility rights of s. 6(2) to challenge the
residency requirements for OHIP, it followed that they could not successfully
challenge those provisions under s. 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I cannot agree with that reasoning.  Section 6(3)(b) speaks to reasonable residency requirements in
the context of the mobility rights described in s. 6(2).  Any limit on eligibility for social services
imposed on citizens or landed immigrants who are residents must be reasonable
or it will infringe their right to move from province to province.  Section 6(2) affords no mobility rights to
individuals who are not citizens or permanent residents.  Those persons cannot complain that a
residency requirement is unreasonable. 
Section 6(2) does not, however, deny those persons the protection of
s.&nbsp;15.  Section 15 applies to
every individual.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A residency requirement as a prerequisite to access to a
publicly funded social service may be reasonable in the sense that it does not
unduly limit mobility rights but it may still be discriminatory either in its
purpose or its effect.  The
reasonableness of a residency requirement for the purposes of s. 6(3)(b) will
depend in large measure on the length of the waiting period established by the
residency requirement.  The s. 15
inquiry looks not to reasonableness, but to distinctions drawn between
individuals or groups by the impugned legislation.  Section 15 asks whether those distinctions are discriminatory and
contrary to the equality right protected by s. 15.</p>

</span>Section 6(2)(a) and s. 6(3)(b) do not immunize social service
programs that are limited to residents and impose a reasonable residency
requirement from scrutiny under s.&nbsp;15 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Two examples make
the point.  First, if the province
imposed a one-month waiting period for eligibility for OHIP on men and a
three-month waiting period for eligibility for OHIP on women, it could not be
said that either was an unreasonable residency requirement and, therefore, an
infringement of the mobility right in s. 6(2)(a).  It would, however, be open to a woman applicant to claim that the
provisions denied her the equal benefit of the law based on her sex.  Second, a law might provide that only
residents were eligible for OHIP.  It
might then go on to define resident by reference to race, excluding some while
including others.  A member of the
excluded race could challenge the legislation on the basis that it constituted
racial discrimination even if that person were not a citizen nor a permanent
resident.  He or she could not allege a
breach of any mobility right under s. 6(2)(a), but as an individual could
allege a breach of s.&nbsp;15.</p>

</span>Section 6(2)(a) and s. 6(3)(b) are not, however, irrelevant to
the s. 15 analysis where the alleged discrimination arises out of a law which
imposes limits on eligibility for publicly funded social services.  The meaning to be given to one section of
the <i>Charter</i> must be informed by the
language and meaning of other provisions in the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>R. v. Big M. Drug Mart Ltd.</i>, [1985] 1
S.C.R. 295 at 344;  <i>R. v. Mills</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668 at 688.  Distinctions which are part of and integral to the mobility right
recognized in s. 6(2) and s. 6(3)(b) cannot in and of themselves be
discriminatory under s.&nbsp;15:  <i>Chiarelli v. Canada (Minister of Employment
and Immigration)</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 711 at 736. </p>

</span>Section 6(2)(a) and s. 6(3)(b) when read together establish
residency in a province as an appropriate criterion for eligibility for
publicly funded social services.  Section 15 would not countenance an argument that a law providing
for access to publicly funded social services was discriminatory because it
drew an otherwise non-discriminatory distinction between residents and non-residents.  Similarly, s. 6(2)(a) and s. 6(3)(b)
recognize that, for the purposes of eligibility for publicly funded social
services, a distinction may appropriately be made between residents who have
met a reasonable residency requirement and those who have not.  Section 15 would not label that distinction
discriminatory.  As Chilcott J. said in <i>Clarken v. Ontario (Health Insurance Plan)</i>
(1998), 109 O.A.C. 363 at 373 (Div. Ct.):</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>[R]esidency is a

interaction between s. 6 and s. 15 that I have just described.  The appellants do not suggest that a
residency requirement for OHIP eligibility contravenes s. 15.  They accept that the definition of

status.  It is the appellants position
that the definition of resident based on the categories set out in s. 1.1(1)(b)
has nothing to do with residency, but is based on different grounds which are
discriminatory within the meaning of s. 15.

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'> Human dignity means
that an individual or group feels self-respect and self-worth.  It is concerned with physical and
psychological integrity and empowerment. 
Human dignity is harmed by unfair treatment premised upon personal
traits or circumstances which do not relate to individual needs, capacities, or
merits.  It is enhanced by laws which
are sensitive to the needs, capacities, and merits of different individuals,
taking into account the context underlying their differences.  Human dignity is harmed when individuals and
groups are marginalized, ignored, or devalued, and is enhanced when laws
recognize the full place of all individuals and groups within Canadian
society.  Human dignity within the
meaning of the equality guarantee does not relate to the status or position of
an individual in society <i>per se</i>, but
rather concerns the manner in which a person legitimately feels when confronted
with a particular law.  Does the law
treat him or her unfairly, taking into account all the circumstances regarding
the individuals affected and excluded by the law?  </p>

</span>The equality right cannot be calibrated as if it were a
precise point on a ruler.  Equality does
not exist in isolation, but is a comparative concept that takes on meaning in
the context of different treatment afforded different individuals or groups by
a law or state action.  A person alleging
a breach of s. 15(1) must contrast the way he or she is treated by the law with
the way others are treated and establish, first, that the treatment is
different, and second, that the different treatment amounts to discrimination
under s.&nbsp;15(1):  <i>Law, supra</i>, at 531-32.</p>

for the purpose of advancing that claim. 
The court must, however, adjust the terms of that comparison if they do
not accord with the actual distinctions drawn by the challenged law or other
form of state action.  Those
distinctions are found by a consideration of the context, purpose, and effect
of the challenged law or state action:  <i>Law, supra</i>, at 541; <i>Granovsky, supra</i>, at 730.

where the purpose or effect of the state action is to impose a disadvantage or
withhold a benefit based on factors that deny the claimants right to be

individual claimants equality rights have been infringed only by considering
the larger context of the legislation in question, and societys past and
present treatment of the claimant and of other persons or groups with similar
characteristics or circumstances.  The
objective component means that it is not sufficient, in order to ground a s.

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>Accordingly, a court
that is called upon to determine a discrimination claim under s. 15(1) should
make the following three broad inquiries:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>A.            Does the impugned law (a) draw a
formal distinction between the claimant and others on the basis of one or more
personal characteristics, or (b) fail to take into account the claimants
already disadvantaged position with Canadian society resulting in substantively
differential treatment between the claimant and others on the basis of one or
more personal characteristics?</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>B.            Is the claimant subject to

worthy of recognition or value as a human being or as a member of Canadian

impugned law.  If no distinction is

The second and third steps together determine whether distinctions which
are drawn by the law are discriminatory. 
To be discriminatory, the distinction must be made on an enumerated or

contend that the categories established under that section effectively exclude
new immigrants from OHIP eligibility even though they are ordinarily resident

describes this distinction as one based on residency status and contends that
residency status is not one of the grounds enumerated in s. 15(1) and is not an
analogous ground.  Ontario also submits
that status under the immigration laws provides a valid indicator of whether
residency is temporary or permanent.

I cannot accept any of them.  The
appellants primary submission was that the regulation draws a distinction
between new immigrants who are ordinarily resident in Ontario and other
persons who are ordinarily resident in Ontario.  The regulation does not draw that distinction.  Many new immigrants are eligible for OHIP (<i>e.g.</i> landed immigrants, some applicants
for landed immigrant status, refugees, some applicants for refugee status, and
some Ministers permit holders).  It is
simply wrong to suggest that new immigrants as a class cannot meet the
definition of resident in the regulation.</p>

are ordinarily resident in Ontario and non-citizens who are ordinarily resident
in Ontario.  On this submission, the
former are eligible for OHIP and the latter are not.  The language of the regulation does not reflect this
comparison.  Many non-citizens are
eligible for OHIP under the definition of resident.  Canadian citizenship is but one of many criteria which may bring
a person within the definition of resident and make that person eligible for
OHIP if he or she is ordinarily resident in Ontario.</p>

</span>It was forcefully argued on behalf of Raja, Sergio Bodington,
and Mr. Melvin that the definition of resident in the amended regulation draws
a distinction based on physical disability. 
Physical disability is one of the grounds enumerated in s. 15(1).  There can be no doubt but that Raja, Sergio
Bodington, and Mr. Melvin were denied landed immigrant status because of their
physical disability.  But for their
disabilities, they would have been granted that status and would have been
eligible for OHIP.</p>

</span>It was the federal immigration authorities who decided that
the physical disabilities of these appellants rendered them ineligible for
landed immigrant status.  These same
authorities classified the appellants for immigration purposes.  There is no constitutional challenge to the
action of the immigration authorities to nor to the underlying
legislation.  The validity of both must
be assumed in these proceedings.  Having
concluded that neither Raja nor Sergio Bodington should be granted landed
immigrant status, the immigration authorities, again acting under their legal
mandate, allowed Raja to enter Canada and permitted Sergio to remain in
Canada.  Mr. Melvin also remained in
Canada, although it would seem he had no legal right to do so.  </p>

</span>OHIP officials looked to the classification of the appellants
made by the immigration authorities in determining whether the appellants fell
within the definition of resident.  The
OHIP authorities were interested only in the permanence of the applicants
residency as evidenced by his or her immigration classification and not in the
physical condition of any of the appellants.</p>

</span>The categories of persons set out in the regulation who may be
residents of Ontario are not tied to the existence or absence of physical
disability, but are directed exclusively at the immigration status of
individuals as determined by the immigration authorities.  This distinction is made clear in the cases
of Sergio Bodington and Mr. Melvin. 
Sergio was initially classified as medically inadmissible because of his
severe bilateral hearing loss.  He was allowed
to remain in Canada on a student visa. 
Because of that status, he was ineligible for OHIP.  Subsequently, the immigration authorities
reclassified Sergio and he was granted landed immigrant status.  He immediately became eligible for
OHIP.  Sergios physical disability had
not changed, but the permanence of his immigration status had.  With that change came an entitlement to
OHIP.  Similarly, Mr. Melvin was refused
landed immigrant status because of his poor health after a series of
strokes.  The immigration authorities
later reconsidered that assessment and Mr. Melvin was granted landed immigrant
status.  There is no suggestion that his
physical condition changed.  Like Sergio,
however, once his immigration status changed, Mr. Melvin became eligible for
OHIP.</p>

</span>Of all the appellants, only Raja is still ineligible for
OHIP.  He is ineligible not because he
is physically disabled, but because he is allowed to remain in Canada on a
Ministers permit that is not one of the permit types referred to in the regulation.  Under the terms of his permit, Raja remains
entitled to stay in Canada only at the discretion of the Minister of
Citizenship and Immigration.  Sadly,
Rajas physical disability will never change. 
His entitlement to OHIP will, however, if the immigration authorities
reclassify him as happened in the case of Sergio and Mr. Melvin, or if after
five years the Minister sees fit to grant Raja landed immigrant status.  </p>

</span>I think Ontarios submissions accurately capture the basis
upon which the distinction is drawn in the definition of resident in s.
1.1(1)(b) of the amended regulation. 
Aside from those categories referring to temporary residents, which are
not in issue on this appeal, the various categories in the regulation refer to
persons whose status in the country gives their residency in Ontario a
potential permanence.  Persons who come
within the various enumerated categories are either entitled to remain in
Canada permanently or will shortly be entitled to remain in Canada
permanently.  Persons who are excluded
by the categories are persons who, despite their intention to remain in Ontario
permanently, do not have an immigration status that permits them to remain in
Canada and, therefore, Ontario on a permanent basis.  </p>

</span>The relevance of permanence to the definition of residence is
evident upon an examination of the unchallenged definition of ordinarily
resident found in s. 1.1(2) of the amended regulation.  That definition provides in part that a
person is ordinarily resident in Ontario only if that person intends to make
his or her permanent and principal home in Ontario.  The requirement that persons who are ordinarily resident in
Ontario have an immigration status that permits them or will shortly permit
them to remain permanently in Canada is a logical corollary to the requirement
that a person intend to make his or her permanent home in Ontario.  The categories set out in the amended
regulation do no more than require that persons who intend to make their
permanent home in Ontario have the legal status that permits them to
legitimately hold that intention. 
Viewed in this light, the categories established in s. 1.1(1)(b) of the
amended regulation are closely linked to the unchallenged definition of ordinarily
resident set out in s. 1.1(2) of the regulation.</p>

persons who are ordinarily resident in Ontario but who, by virtue of their
immigration status, are not entitled to become permanent residents in

</span>A persons status as a permanent or non-permanent resident of

is it an analogous ground.  In <i>Corbiere, supra</i>, at 219, McLachlin J.
said:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'>the thrust of
identification of analogous grounds at the second stage of the law analysis is
to review a ground based on characteristics we cannot change or that the

actually immutable, like race, or constructively immutable, like religion.</p>

persons status as a non-permanent resident for the purposes of OHIP
eligibility is not immutable.  In the
course of this litigation, four of the five appellants who were non-permanent
residents for the purposes of OHIP eligibility became permanent residents by
virtue of changes in their immigration status. 
The residency status of the fifth appellant, Raja, will also change if
his immigration status changes, either because he is reclassified or because
the Minister grants him landed immigrant status.  While Rajas physical disability is an immutable characteristic,
and that characteristic is the reason for his present immigration
classification and consequently his ineligibility for OHIP, there is no basis
in this record for concluding that his immigration status, unlike his physical
disability, is immutable.  To the
contrary, to the limited extent that the record speaks to the issue, it
demonstrates that the immigration status of persons with physical disabilities
changes.  When that status changes,
those persons may become eligible for OHIP.</p>

case.  The appellants have chosen not to
challenge any facet of the immigration process.  I think it must be assumed that the process operates within
constitutional limits and specifically within the spirit of s. 15(1).  Immigration status can determine a persons
right to take up permanent residence in a province.  Once it is accepted that the process that results in a particular
immigration status does not offend s. 15(1), I fail to see how Ontarios
reliance on that status in determining the nature of an individuals residence

from which they move does not affect their status under OHIP.  Like anyone else who is subject to the
waiting period, they cannot look to OHIP to cover their medical expenses, even
if those expenses are not covered under the plan of the province from which
those persons moved.</p>

</span>Nothing in the regulation prevents new residents of Ontario
who are not from another province from obtaining health care coverage for the
three-month waiting period.  All of the
appellants who were adversely affected by the waiting period could have
obtained alternate health care coverage. 
Indeed, those new immigrants who are most likely to be unable to obtain
health care coverage for the three-month period (<i>e.g.</i> refugees) are exempt from the waiting period.</p>

</span>The appellants submission would also undermine the
portability provisions of the <i>Canada
Health Act</i>.  Those provisions
require that provinces extend health coverage to former residents who move to a
province in which they are subject to a waiting period before they become
eligible for coverage under that provinces health care plan.  The obvious intent of the requirement is to
avoid gaps in health care coverage when residents of one province take up
residence in another province.  If the
appellants submission is correct, however, compliance with the portability
requirement demands that a province extend immediate coverage to all new
residents from outside of Canada.  Only
persons from other provinces would be subject to the waiting period.  Consequently, a person moving into Ontario
in need of a health service covered by OHIP but not by the plan in the province
from which that person moved would be in a worse position than a person moving
into Ontario from outside of Canada. 
This result seems entirely inconsistent with the spirit of the <i>Canada Health Act</i>.  That legislation has, of course, not been
challenged in these proceedings.</p>

</span>Even if I were to conclude that the waiting period set out in
the regulation, combined with the terms of the inter-provincial agreement,
creates a distinction which bestows a benefit on some Ontario residents that is
not available to others, I would not find that the distinction is based on a
ground enumerated in s. 15 or on a ground which is analogous to those
enumerated in s. 15.  The distinction is
between persons covered by provincial health care plans at the time they apply
for OHIP and persons who are not covered by any provincial health care plan
when they apply for OHIP.  In my view,
this distinction is not based on anything that could reasonably be described as
a personal characteristic.  It is
certainly based neither on residency nor on Canadian citizenship.  Persons living in other provinces may or may
not have been covered under that provinces health plan when they applied for
OHIP.  Canadian citizens may or may not
have been covered by a health care plan of another province when they applied
for OHIP.  Similarly, persons who may
properly be described as new immigrants who resided in another province
before moving to Ontario may or may not have been covered by another provincial
health plan when they applied for OHIP.</p>

</span>The appellants attempt to compare their situation with
residents of Ontario who are permitted to maintain their OHIP coverage during
extended absences from the province is also misplaced.  The problem with this comparison is that the
group identified by the appellants does not comprise persons applying for OHIP,
but rather persons who are insured by OHIP and who are seeking an exemption
from the normal residency requirement so that they may maintain their OHIP
coverage during a temporary absence from Ontario.  This exemption is available to anyone who is insured by OHIP and
meets the requirements of the regulation. 
Anyone seeking such an exemption who became insured under OHIP after
April 1994 will already have gone through the three-month waiting period.  There is no valid comparison between the
treatment of persons applying for OHIP upon taking up residence in Ontario and
the treatment of persons who are resident in Ontario, insured by OHIP, and
seeking to maintain that status during a lengthy, but temporary, absence from
the province.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
from the specific exemptions in s. 3(4) of the amended regulation, the waiting
period requirement does not distinguish between different groups or
persons.  Everyone who applies for OHIP
after April 1994 is subject to the waiting period.  The law neither draws a formal distinction between groups based
on personal characteristics nor fails to take into account the disadvantaged
position of a group within Canadian society. 
The waiting period requirement does not impose differential treatment
and cannot, therefore, be discriminatory within the meaning of the equality
guarantee.</p>

<h4>(c) The requirement that
each individual establish his or her eligibility for OHIP</h4>

</span>Residency as defined in R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 552, as amended, is
the sole requirement for OHIP eligibility. 
With two narrow exceptions, every person must establish that he or she
is a resident within the meaning of the regulation.  Prior to the 1994 changes, dependants of insured persons were
insured persons without establishing their own residency.  In seeking to establish a discriminatory
distinction, the appellants cannot compare their treatment under the present legislation
to that provided to persons like them under the previous legislation.  Having initially determined OHIP coverage on
the basis of dependency, the province is not constitutionally obliged by s.
15(1) to maintain coverage on that basis: 
<i>Ferrell v. Ontario (A.G.)</i>
(1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 97 at 110-11 (C.A.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
of the appellants lost existing OHIP coverage because of the change from
dependency-based eligibility to eligibility based on individual
assessment.  The elimination of
eligibility for OHIP based on dependency status did, however, affect the
entitlement of Raja, Ms. Assan, and Ms. Simon to OHIP.  All were dependants of insured persons and
would have been eligible for OHIP on that basis prior to the 1994 changes.  </p>

</span>A scheme which requires each individual to establish his or
her residency and, therefore, his or her entitlement to OHIP would not on its
face appear to raise s. 15(1) concerns. 
Individual assessments for eligibility do not necessarily exclude discrimination.  They do, however, contraindicate
discrimination:  <i>Winko v. B.C. (Forensic Psychiatric Institute</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625

</span>The appellants contention that individually-based eligibility
for OHIP is discriminatory arises out of the two exceptions to the elimination
of dependency-based eligibility for OHIP made by the 1994 changes.  Persons who fall within two discrete groups
are eligible for OHIP if they are dependants of persons insured by OHIP.  Dependants of persons working in Ontario for
a specified period of time under a specific immigration authorization, and
dependants of clergy working temporarily in Ontario under specified contracts,
are eligible for OHIP.  Although there
is no evidence of the size of either group, it is obvious that together they
make up a very small minority of the total OHIP-eligible population. </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;
text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
appellants contend that the distinction drawn in the present regulation between
those who are eligible for OHIP because they are dependants of persons who are
eligible and those who cannot rely on that status to establish their
eligibility for OHIP amounts to discrimination and infringes s. 15.  If this argument is correct, the vast
majority of the residents of Ontario who are dependants of persons insured by
OHIP are the victims of discrimination.</p>

</span>The appellants describe the distinction they rely on in the
following terms in their factum:</p>

<p class=headingQUOTE align=left style='text-align:left'> a similar formal
distinction is drawn between children of new immigrants, who must establish
their individual eligibility, and others who continue to be assessed on a family
basis, such as the spouses and children of certain short-term contract
employees and members of the clergy who have contracted for employment in
Ontario,   Again, this distinction is
made on the basis of the personal characteristic of status as new immigrants.</p>

text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[157]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
distinction set out in the appellants factum applies only to Raja, the only
one of the affected appellants who is a child of new immigrants.  In any event, the distinction the appellants
would draw simply does not exist in the impugned regulation.  With the exception of the two limited groups
described above, everyone applying for OHIP must establish his or her own
eligibility based on residency. 
Canadian citizens must do so, landed immigrants must do so, and all
other persons who are potentially residents of Ontario within the definition
must do so.  An applicants immigration
status has nothing to do with the requirement that the applicant establish his
or her entitlement to OHIP on an individual basis.  Nor does the length of time one has been in the province affect
ones obligation to establish entitlement on an individual basis.  Persons who apply for OHIP the day they
arrive in Canada must establish their individual entitlement to OHIP, as must
persons who have lived in Canada all their lives.</p>

</span>The only distinction drawn in the legislation is between
dependants of the two groups described above, who are eligible for OHIP on that
basis, and the rest of the population of Ontario.  This distinction denies to the vast majority of the population of
Ontario a benefit which is available to the two identified groups.  The first step in the three-step analysis of
a s. 15(1) claim set out in <i>Law</i> is,
therefore, satisfied.</p>

</span>The basis upon which the distinction is drawn is not one
enumerated in s. 15(1) and is not analogous to any of those grounds.  The distinction is between dependants of
certain clergy and some persons working temporarily in Ontario, and dependants
of the rest of the population of Ontario. 
A group identified in such wide terms can hardly be the subject of
stereotypical discriminatory decision making. 
The governments decision to offer an incentive by way of OHIP
eligibility for dependants of certain persons who can fill specified workplace
needs hardly denigrates the human dignity or self-worth of the vast majority of
persons who do not come within those groups. 
The fact that dependants of two specified small groups are eligible for
OHIP in no way demeans the human dignity or self-worth of the vast majority of
persons who may not qualify on that basis but must qualify on an individual
basis.</p>

</span>The requirement that each person establish his or her
eligibility for OHIP does not place any undue burden on the appellants.  Neither Ms. Assan nor Ms. Simon had any
difficulty establishing her residency. 
Raja had difficulty doing so, however, his difficulty stemmed not from
the requirement that he establish his individual entitlement to OHIP, but from
the definition of resident that excluded him because he was not eligible to
become a permanent resident of Ontario. 
I have already dealt with his s. 15(1) claim based on the definition of
resident.  </p>

</span>I am satisfied that no reasonable person in the position of
the appellants and fully apprised of the context, purpose, and terms of the
OHIP scheme could possibly conclude that the requirement that persons establish
their entitlement to OHIP on an individual basis demeans their sense of
self-worth or their entitlement to be treated as individuals, as worthy as any
other in the community to the benefit and protection of the law.</p>

</span>I would dismiss the appeal. 
In doing so, however, I must observe that the present interface between
the complex immigration process, as administered by the federal government, and
the determination of OHIP eligibility as made by the province is not entirely
satisfactory.  It seems inherently
contradictory, if not cruel, to permit a young boy like Raja to enter Canada on
compassionate grounds so that he might live with the rest of his family who
have been allowed to settle in Canada, while at the same time not taking
cognizance of Rajas need to access expensive medical services that can, to
some degree, at least alleviate his severe physical disability.  While I have found no constitutional
violation, I would think that the federal and provincial authorities could work
together to find some way to extend our countrys compassion beyond permission
to enter Canada to include access to the medical services available through
OHIP to persons like Raja.</p>

The issues raised by the appellants were complex and important.  The public at large, and especially those
charged with the difficult task of administering the OHIP scheme, benefitted by
the thorough, vigorous, and responsible manner in which those issues were

about 19,000 foreign students receiving OHIP and about 44,000 foreign workers
receiving OHIP.  It was anticipated that

half of the foreign workers from the OHIP rolls.</p>
