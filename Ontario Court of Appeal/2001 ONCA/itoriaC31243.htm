<p>On appeal from the judgment of Justice James D. Carnwath, dated December 4, 
  1998.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant takes no issue with the trial judge’s finding as to the 
  area of ignition of the fire that destroyed a Quonset hut located on the respondent’s 
  golf club property.  More specifically, it is accepted that ignition took place 
  in the partition wall in a furnace room in the Quonset hut.  The wall was located 
  two inches to the right of the furnace as one looks at the furnace.  The appellant 
  was responsible for the general maintenance of the furnace.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was evidence which the trial judge accepted that the fire started 
  through a process known as pyrolysis.  This process required the emission of 
  heat from the furnace of at least 80 to 100 degrees centigrade over an extended 
  time.  The appellant submits that only an uninsulated furnace could generate 
  the degree of heat required for pyrolysis.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Although it would have been better had the trial judge explicitly dealt 
  with the issue whether the furnace in question was or was not insulated, we 
  think that by accepting the evidence of the respondent’s expert witness, Professor 
  Sandler, and evidence as to the manner in which the fire started, the trial 
  judge implicitly found that the furnace was not insulated.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We are not persuaded that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence.  
  His critical findings were supported by evidence that he accepted.  Thus, our 
  interference is not warranted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs fixed on consent at $10,000 
  plus G.S.T. and assessable disbursements.</p>
