dated March 13, 2000.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><span lang=EN-US>ORAL   ENDORSEMENT</span></h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span
lang=EN-US>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A majority of the
Discipline Committee of the College of Physicians and Surgeons (“the
Committee”) found Dr. Bisnauth Jagoo (“the Doctor”) guilty of professional
misconduct in that he failed to maintain the standard of practice of the
profession in his examination of three complainants and engaged in sexual
impropriety with two of the three complainants.</p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Doctor
appealed and the Divisional Court set aside the decision of the Committee.  We agree with the decision of the Divisional
Court.  It did not, as the appellant
submits, set aside the Committee’s decision because of mere deficiencies in its
reasons but, rather, because the Committee made errors in its apprehension of
the evidence which went to he root of its findings of credibility on which the
case turned.</p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Credibility was
central to the issue before the Committee and it is obvious that the evidence
of collusion had an important bearing on that issue.  The evidence of the close relationship between the complainants,
the timing of their complaints and the fact that, in a statement one of the
complainants gave to the police, it was evident that the complainants had
discussed their complaints among themselves, ought to have been addressed by
the Committee.  Instead, the Committee
dismissed the submissions of the defence on this point as a theory for which
there was no evidence.  The fact that
the Committee dealt with the evidence of each complainant separately and did
not consider it as similar fact evidence does not address the problem.</p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Committee
accepted that the complainants had discussed their complaints with each
other.  In dealing with “the defence”
submission that K.C. may have influenced the evidence of the other two
complainants, the Committee, as we have noted, said that they “failed to find
evidence to support the above theories”. 
This conclusion must have been based on a failure to consider, or a
misapprehension of, relevant evidence, which also included that K.C. denied falsely
that the other complainants had discussed with her the details of their stories
and the fact that J.H.’s allegations changed following her letter of complaint
to come into line with K.C.’s allegations.</p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Further, the
Committee’s decision on credibility appeared to have been based principally on
the sincerity and demeanour of the complainants while giving evidence and
because they recalled detail not matched by the Doctor.  With respect to the latter, if the Committee
had in mind that the doctor had to recall what occurred from his clinical notes,
it did not fully appreciate the evidence because it was his evidence that the
visits were routine.  More importantly,
as the Divisional Court said, in paragraphs 6 to 8 of its reasons, the
Committee clearly misapprehended important evidence relating to the credibility
of K.C. and J.H.</p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Based on the
errors made by the Committee, the Divisional Court set aside its decision.  We are advised that the issue of a rehearing
was never raised before the Divisional Court. 
It has, however, been raised before us. 
The record discloses evidence which, if properly apprehended, was
capable of supporting a finding of professional misconduct.  We are of the opinion that the appropriate
disposition is an order for a rehearing.</p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>There was
evidence presented at the Doctor’s penalty hearing that he is terminally
ill.  While we shall order a new
hearing, in light of this evidence and the fact that the Doctor has
substantially closed his practice, the College may wish to exercise its discretion
not to proceed. </p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The Divisional Court
ordered the College to pay the costs of the hearing before the Committee.  The Committee of the College has no power to
order costs of the hearing in favour of the Doctor unless a finding is made
that the proceedings should never have been instituted.  As the Divisional Court did not make that
finding, no order as to costs before the Committee should have been made.  The Doctor is entitled to the costs of the
hearing before the Divisional Court. 
Before this court, because success was divided, there should be no costs
of the appeal, including the costs of the leave motion. </p>

<p class=Headingnumber style='margin-left:0cm;text-indent:0cm;line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the result,
the appeal is allowed, without costs, to the extent of adding to the order of
the Divisional Court an order for a rehearing and deleting from it the
direction that the College pay the costs of the hearing before the Committee.</p>
