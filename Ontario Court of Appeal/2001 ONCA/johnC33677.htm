<p><span lang=EN-US>On appeal from the judgment of Justice James M. Donnelly, 
  sitting with a jury, dated September 1, 2000.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>FINLAYSON J.A.:</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is an appeal by Eaton Yale Ltd. (“Eaton Yale”) from a judgment 
  of the Honourable Mr. Justice Donnelly of the Superior Court of Justice in which 
  he gave judgment in accordance with the award of a jury in a motor vehicle accident 
  case.  The trial took place over nineteen days and resulted in an award of $620,052.88 
  to the plaintiffs (now respondents) Claude John and Rose John.  The jury apportioned 
  70 per cent liability as against the defendant Flynn and 30 per cent as against 
  the defendant Eaton Yale.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The appeal by Eaton Yale addresses the issue 
  of whether an employer owes a duty of care to third parties who suffer injuries 
  as a result of the negligent driving of an employee who has become intoxicated 
  partly during working hours and partly outside working hours but, in any event, 
  in circumstances unrelated to his employment.</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>I. Background</span></p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>i. The Accident</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The basic facts are fairly straightforward.  The defendant (now 
  respondent) Shawn Flynn (“Flynn”) had been an employee of the appellant Eaton 
  Yale since 1984.  Eaton Yale operates a unionized plant in Wallaceburg, Ontario 
  that manufactures “leaf springs” for use in certain truck suspension systems.  
  Flynn worked in the forge department, where raw steel is heated and bent into 
  the appropriate shape to make springs.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> During the week of December 7, 1992, Flynn worked the midnight 
  or “overnight” shift from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m.  After completing his shift on the 
  morning of December 9, 1992, Flynn drove his truck home in order to get some 
  sleep before a noon dentist appointment.  His home was located outside Wallaceburg, 
  and he estimated it was a 20-25 minute drive from the plant.  Upon his return 
  home from the dentist and an errand, he drank steadily from approximately 2:30&nbsp;p.m. 
  until shortly before he reported to work that night.  He drank at the Wallaceburg 
  Glassworkers’ hall (five 8-oz. beers), at the home of a friend, Robert Blake 
  (three or four 2-oz. shots of vodka/Clamato), at his own home, and a second 
  time at the union hall (four more 8-oz. beers).  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> That night, Flynn reported to work at 10:55 p.m. and received 
  his nightly assignment, which involved tooling the proper size for steel and 
  making adjustments for a new job order.  During his breaks, at 1 a.m., 3 a.m. 
  and 5 a.m., Flynn went to his truck in the plant’s parking lot and drank more 
  alcohol.  He drank a bottle of beer during the first break, a “couple” of bottles 
  during his second break and a rum-and-Coke during the final break.  Because 
  the plant was noisy and hot, it was normal and expected for employees to take 
  their breaks in their vehicles so that they could eat, smoke and enjoy a respite 
  from the plant.  Eaton Yale did not serve or provide alcohol to any of its employees, 
  nor did it on that night host a party or social event of any kind.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the night in question, Flynn performed his job without incident 
  or harm to himself or anyone else at the plant.  Further, Flynn’s supervisor 
  did not observe any signs of impairment.  This may have been due to the fact 
  that Flynn took steps to conceal that he had been drinking and that he was impaired.  
  Before he started his shift, Flynn “checked himself” in the bathroom for signs 
  of intoxication.  Realizing that his breath might smell of alcohol, he had only 
  a very brief conversation with his supervisor and restricted his responses to 
  phrases such as “okay” and “yes, Sir.”  He reported for work wearing his dark 
  green safety glasses and safety hat, which completely covered his eyes.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Flynn completed his shift, without incident, at approximately 
  6:30 a.m. on December 10, and then went to his truck and drank another bottle 
  of beer.  He then drove home, arriving at his house shortly before 7 a.m. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Upon arriving home, Flynn had a snack and then headed out again 
  to play cards and drink beer at a friend’s house.  He placed an open bottle 
  of beer between his legs as he drove.  At approximately 7:15 a.m. on December 
  10, while driving on the wrong side of a snow-covered highway, Flynn collided 
  with a car driven by the plaintiff (now respondent), Claude John.  The plaintiff, 
  who already suffered from many ailments and had previously been badly injured 
  in a work-related fall, sustained serious injuries as a result of which he became 
  partially disabled.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> A blood sample, taken from Flynn at 8:34 that morning, revealed 
  a blood alcohol concentration (“B.A.C.”) of 160 mg/100 ml (0.16), or twice the 
  legal limit.  Eaton Yale’s breathalyzer expert testified at trial that Flynn’s 
  B.A.C. would have been in the range of 0.078 to 0.15 at the time Flynn left 
  work that morning.  The respondents Johns’ breathalyzer expert testified that 
  Flynn’s B.A.C. would have been in the range of 0.201 to 0.268 when Flynn left 
  work.</p>

  Last Chance Agreement</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Previous to, and throughout the time Flynn worked at Eaton Yale, 
  the company had a well-publicized policy against employees presenting unfit 
  for work due to alcohol consumption and against drinking at work.  Employees 
  who arrived at work in an unfit state due to drinking were sent home in taxis, 
  disciplined the following day and subject to termination.  The company acknowledges 
  that it was aware that some alcohol consumption “was likely taking place” in 
  the plant’s parking lot because its security personnel, on occasion, found empty 
  beer/liquor bottles at the back of the lot.  It is the respondents’ contention 
  that Eaton Yale knew as a fact that alcohol consumption was taking place in 
  the company parking lot on an ongoing basis and that the company knew the magnitude 
  of the actual drinking that was occurring on company property.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In May of 1990, Flynn notified Eaton Yale that he had an alcohol 
  abuse problem.  Flynn had never been observed by management in an impaired state 
  at work and had never been found or suspected to have been drinking in the parking 
  lot.  Prior to that date, Flynn had never told the company that he had a problem 
  with alcohol and he conceded that Eaton Yale had no knowledge of his alcoholism.  
  Rather, it was Flynn who took the initiative and requested the company’s support, 
  through Eaton Yale’s Employee Assistance Program (“EAP”), for him to attend 
  a residential substance abuse treatment program known as Brentwood.  The EAP 
  was managed jointly by Eaton Yale and the workers’ union.  Eaton Yale agreed 
  to Flynn’s request and Flynn attended the treatment program from May 1990 until 
  August 1990.  Upon Flynn’s discharge in August of 1990, the prognosis from Brentwood 
  for his abstaining from alcohol in the future was not favourable.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>When Flynn returned to work after completing 
  the treatment program, he voluntarily signed a standard one-page document entitled 
  a “Last Chance Agreement”, under which he agreed that the conditions of re-employment 
  would be: (a) attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings weekly, with documented 
  proof, for one year; (b) reporting weekly to a representative of the Employee 
  Assistance Committee; and (c) maintaining complete abstinence from “any non-prescription 
  mind altering or psychoactive substance” for one year. </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Breach by an employee of the Last Chance Agreement would not 
  necessarily result in an employee’s termination, as the union grievance process 
  would still be available in the event of any such firing.  Eaton Yale concedes 
  that the company did not monitor Flynn’s obligations under the Last Chance Agreement.  
  Flynn had two more documented absentee incidents between the time of his return 
  to work in 1990 and the 1992 accident.  However, owing to the company’s confidentiality 
  obligations, Flynn’s new supervisor during this period was not told that Flynn 
  had entered the EAP or that he had attended the residential treatment program.  
</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>iii. Flynn’s Testimony At Trial</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Following the accident, the Johns commenced an action against 
  several defendants, including Shawn Flynn and Eaton Yale.  Prior to trial, Flynn 
  entered into a “Mary Carter” Agreement with the respondents John that discharged 
  his liability to the Johns by the payment of $100,000. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Flynn testified at trial and while he did not say that his employer 
  knew or ought to have known that he had been drinking on the night in question 
  or indeed on any occasion, he did express his views on what he perceived to 
  be the consequences of having attended the treatment program.  In overview, 
  I think it is fair to say that Flynn thought that once he had made use of the 
  EAP and disclosed to his employer that he was an alcoholic, Eaton Yale assumed 
  the responsibility of controlling his drinking. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Flynn testified that on the night of the accident, he arrived 
  for work in an impaired state and he continued to drink in the parking lot at 
  every break and before he left the plant.  He said that the company had actual 
  knowledge, since May 1990, that he was an alcoholic, and that his abuse of alcohol 
  was tied to absenteeism.  According to Flynn, through its EAP and the disciplinary 
  “Last Chance Agreement,” the company had the opportunity and the obligation 
  to enforce its no-drinking policy and to monitor his consumption of alcohol, 
  but chose not to use those tools to do so.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Flynn further stated that Eaton Yale knew as far back as 1978 
  that drinking in the parking lot, by employees who worked in the “back end” 
  of the plant where Flynn worked, was “rampant” and that the company never developed 
  a strategy to address drinking on the premises and did not consider drinking 
  to be a “problem.”  Flynn and other employees knew that there was a policy against 
  workplace drinking, but they also knew from experience that the policy was not 
  enforced and that there was no supervision of the parking lot, which was dimly 
  lit.  The one security guard that was typically on duty during the shift did 
  not watch the employees and could not see an employee who was in the back of

<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>III. Analysis</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>It is my view that the essential error made 
  by the parties to these proceedings, including the trial judge, was in confusing 
  cases citing the duty of an employer to its employees to provide them with a 
  safe work environment with cases where the courts have found a duty on the part 
  of a commercial host (and occasionally a social host) to its patrons/guests 
  where the host has knowledge of the intoxication of the patrons/guests.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, the plaintiff, in particular, sought to fuse together 
  these two unrelated duties and in doing so, lost sight of the fact that the 
  respondent Flynn left his home, not his place of employment, when he set out 
  on the fateful drive that culminated in the motor vehicle accident and the grievous 
  injuries to the innocent Claude John.  When the accident occurred, Flynn was 
  not at work, he was not going to or from work, he was not supposed to be at 
  work and he was not travelling during his working hours.  The fact is that before 
  Flynn negligently drove and injured Mr. John, he had been at his home following 
  the end of his shift, and had driven home safely from work, as was his custom.  
  Flynn had not been sent home, suspended or disciplined in any way for his conduct 
  at work on the night in question and there was no criticism of his work that 
  day.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Throughout Flynn’s shift on the night and morning in question, 
  there was no suggestion from anyone at the plant that Flynn might be intoxicated 
  or in any way under the influence of alcohol or other chemical substance.  Unfortunately, 
  and contrary to his initial denials, Flynn was in fact intoxicated due to alcohol 
  at all relevant times.  He now proclaims that he had been drinking steadily 
  before reporting to work, while at work and after he returned to his home.  
  He had an open bottle of beer between his knees when the accident occurred.  
  There can be no question that his intoxication was the major contributor to 
  the accident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Notwithstanding the above facts, none of which is in dispute, 
  the plaintiffs alleged that Flynn’s employer, Eaton Yale, was legally responsible 
  for the fact that Flynn was driving on that day with a blood alcohol reading 
  that exceeded the legal limit.  In their Fresh as Amended Statement of Claim, 
  the plaintiffs alleged the following facts in support of their allegation of 
  liability against Eaton Yale:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>14.   The Plaintiffs plead that the collision and resulting damages were 
      caused as a result of the negligence of the Defendant, Eaton, who permitted 
      and promoted the consumption of alcoholic beverages on its premises by its 
      employees including the Defendant, Flynn, and in particular in the parking 
      lot of its premises when it knew or ought to have known that its employees, 
      including the Defendant, Flynn, would become impaired and would attempt 
      to drive his vehicle and thereby cause a danger to himself or to others 
      with whom he may come into contact on the roadway after leaving Eaton’s 
      premises.  The Defendant, Eaton, acted in reckless disregard of the safety 
      of others and in particular individuals such as the Plaintiff, Claude John, 
      who were on the roadway.<b></b></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is to be noted that the paragraph quoted above does not explicitly 
  assert the existence of any duty of care owed by the defendant Eaton Yale directly 
  to the Johns as plaintiffs.  The only duty specifically pleaded is that owed 
  by Eaton Yale to its employees as a class, resulting from the fact that Eaton 
  Yale knew or ought to have known that its employees, including Flynn, would 
  become impaired and would attempt to drive their vehicles and thereby cause 
  a danger to themselves or to others with whom they might come into contact after 
  leaving Eaton’s premises. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The absence of a basis for asserting a duty of care owed by Eaton 
  Yale to the Johns is reflected in the answers of the jury to the questions posed 
  to them by the trial judge.  The jury’s answers relate to the general system 
  that Eaton Yale had in place to monitor the behaviour and safety of its employees, 
  and the jury’s findings regarding Eaton Yale’s liability appear to be based 
  solely on the general manner in which Eaton Yale supervised its employees, rather 
  than on any explicit duty owed to the Johns.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The jury’s findings on this matter are not surprising, since 
  the trial judge did not  properly instruct the jury to consider the basic issue 
  of whether Eaton Yale owed the Johns a duty of care, such that if Eaton Yale’s 
  conduct did not meet the required standard of care, a claim for negligence could 
  be made out.  Instead, the trial judge focused the jury’s attention on the question 
  of foreseeability.  He addressed the issue of the duty of care of Eaton Yale 
  to the Johns in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>I want to deal with the legal basis for this claim.  The claim against 
      Eaton Yale is based on Eaton Yale’s claimed failure to control and supervise 
      its premises and its employees, particularly the employee Flynn, whom Eaton 
      Yale knew, or should have known, was for some time identified to them as 
      a problem drinker.  As a matter of law I instruct you that a duty of care 
      exists if two conditions are met:  <u>Firstly, there is a sufficiently close 
      relationship between Eaton Yale as employer, and Flynn as employee, so that 
      in the reasonable contemplation of Eaton Yale, carelessness on its part 
      might cause harm to Flynn</u>; and secondly, there are no considerations 
      that negate or limit that duty of care, the class of persons to whom it’s 
      owed, or the damages that may flow from the breach.  <u>If there is a finding 
      that Eaton Yale owed a duty of care to Mr. Flynn relating to the peril of 
      highway travel, it is a logical step to extend that duty to users of the 
      highway who may encounter him.</u>  [Emphasis added.]<u></u></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This is where, in my view, the case went off the rails.  There 
  is a clear duty on an employer to provide a safe work environment for its employees.  
  Where safety rules have been promulgated, management should insist that they 
  be observed.  Where an individual employee is observed to be in violation of 
  a work rule (e.g., not wearing safety goggles) he should be admonished for his 
  own safety.  Where he is operating a piece of machinery in a manner that endangers 
  other workers, he should receive further instruction.  But the focus is on the 
  workplace and in broad terms the duty of care to its employees does not extend 
  beyond the workplace.  The notion that an employer, operating a plant for the 
  manufacture of truck and automobile parts, has a duty to monitor its employees 
  to determine if it is safe for them to drive home is novel in the extreme.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The second error was in perceiving the duty to provide a safe 
  work environment as a duty to the delinquent employee as opposed to the work 
  force as a whole.  The concept advanced by the respondents and accepted by the 
  jury, that there was a duty to identify and control problem workers to the point 
  of discharging them if necessary, may be said to be part of the employer’s duty 
  to secure a safe workplace but it can not be construed as a duty to the problem 
  employee.  The argument of the respondents was successful in turning the duty 
  issue on its ear.  When Flynn told Eaton Yale that he had a drinking problem 
  and asked for help, this did not impose a special duty on the company to monitor 
  Flynn for Flynn’s sake.  It did not create any new duty.  It simply put the 
  company on notice that Flynn was a problem.  The fact that Flynn was re-employed 
  on terms did not impose an obligation on the company to insist that he carry 
  out the terms.   That was Flynn’s responsibility and his failure to live up 
  to it would expose him to discharge for cause.  This is why the union was involved 
  in setting up this EAP.  It was designed as a compassionate alternative to helping 
  problem employees instead of simply getting rid of them. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At trial, counsel for Eaton Yale put forward a motion for a directed 
  verdict and raised the issue of whether, as a matter of law and fact, Eaton 
  Yale owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs given that Mr. John was someone whom 
  Flynn harmed <i>after</i> Flynn arrived home safely from work.  The trial judge 
  held that Flynn’s arrival home did not relieve Eaton Yale from liability for 
  the harm Flynn caused to Mr. John.  In coming to this conclusion, the trial 
  judge stated:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>Flynn drank for eight hours preceding his work shift; he drank at every 
      opportunity while at work.  It was readily foreseeable that he would continue 
      that established pattern, and that upon leaving work he would drive his 
      car.  Foreseeability is the foundation of liability.  At page 378 in <i>Cotic 
      v. Gray</i> (1981), 33 O.R. (2d) 356 (Ont. C.A.), Lacourcière J.A. states 
      the general rule:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><span lang=EN-US>“A break in the line of causation is subject to the 
          qualification that if the intervening act is such that it might reasonably 
          have been foreseen as anticipated, as the natural and probable result 
          of the original negligence, then the original negligence will be regarded 
          as the proximate cause of the injury, notwithstanding the intervening 
          event.”</span></p>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The arrival at his home did not did not represent the outer limit of Eaton 
      Yale’s liability.  The natural and probable result of the original negligence 
      was that Flynn would drive his car.  It was reasonably foreseeable that 
      Flynn would come to harm on the highway.  Eaton Yale failed to act in the 
      face of obvious risk.  Forty minutes later that risk became reality.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It will be observed that the trial judge assumed as proven that 
  the employer knew that Flynn had been drinking extensively before, during and 
  after he left work.  The evidence was all to the contrary and there was no such 
  finding of fact by the jury in its verdict.  The jury, following the lead of 
  the trial judge, assumed that Eaton Yale had a duty of care to protect Flynn 
  from the consequences of his alcoholism, and that this duty of care extended 
  beyond the workplace and beyond Flynn himself, encompassing all those that Flynn 
  might encounter on the highway at anytime after leaving the workplace.  In his 
  directions to the jury, the trial judge proceeded on the basis already set out 
  in his response to the motion for a directed verdict, that it was not necessary 
  for the jury to consider and reflect upon whether Eaton Yale actually did in 
  fact owe the Johns a duty.  More important, having regard to the current case 
  law dealing with employer/host liability which I will develop, the jury was 
  not asked if anyone in a position of authority on the night in question knew 
  that Flynn had a problem with alcohol or whether anyone observed any indication 
  that he was under the influence of alcohol.  </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>As noted in <i>Stewart v. Pettie </i>(1995), 
  121 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 222 at 229 (S.C.C.), the modern approach to determining 
  the existence of a duty of care is that established by the English House of 
  Lords in <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i>, [1978] A.C. 728, and 
  adopted by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Kamloops (City) v. Nielsen</i>, 
  [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>(1) is there a significantly close relationship between the parties …. 
      so that, in the reasonable contemplation of the authority, carelessness 
      on its part might cause damage to that person?  If so, </p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>(2) are there any considerations which ought to negative 
      or limit (a) the scope of the duty (b) the class of persons to whom it is

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The basis for this test is the historic “neighbour principle”, 
  which holds that actors owe a duty of care to those whom they ought reasonably 
  have in their contemplation as being at risk when they act.  According to the 
  Supreme Court in <i>Stewart v. Pettie, supra</i>, in assessing negligence, the 
  existence of a duty of care must not be confused with the standard of care required 
  of an actor, nor with the issue of causal connection:  </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…This [appeal] raises the question of whether the establishment owed any 
      duty of care to that third party.  If a duty of care is found to exist, 
      then it is necessary to consider what standard of care was necessary and 
      whether that standard was met.</p>
    <p>Another consideration is whether there was a causal connection between 
      the defendant’s allegedly negligent conduct and the damage suffered by the 
      plaintiff.  (p. 228)</p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
    <p>The question of whether a duty of care exists is a question of the relationship 
      between the parties, not a question of conduct.  The question of what conduct 
      is required to satisfy the duty is a question of the appropriate standard 
      of care. (p. 231.)</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Accordingly, the first issue to be decided in assessing whether 
  Eaton Yale is liable in negligence to the Johns is whether the relationship 
  between the parties is such that a duty of care can be said to flow from Eaton 
  Yale to the Johns.  Notwithstanding that liability cannot be established without 
  first demonstrating the existence of a duty of care flowing from the allegedly 
  negligent party to the injured party, counsel for the respondents had difficulty 
  before this court in focusing upon the duty of care owed in law by the appellant 
  Eaton Yale to Claude John as a member of the driving public.  The argument consistently 
  advanced by the respondents was that the employer, as an institution, had been 
  put on notice that Flynn was an alcoholic and that this created a duty to monitor 
  his conduct in order to ensure that he was complying with the Last Chance Agreement.  
  The fact that there is no suggestion on the evidence that Flynn’s impairment 
  was observable or known to anyone is explained by counsel for the respondents 
  as being a result of the negligence of the company in not monitoring Flynn.  
  It is then claimed that that negligence led to the motor vehicle accident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the respondents have not established that Eaton Yale 
  owed the Johns a duty of care, which, if breached, could form the foundation 
  of a claim for liability in the circumstances of this case.  The fact that Flynn 
  was involved in the EAP (though this was not known by his supervisor on the 
  night in question) and the fact that Eaton Yale was aware that some drinking 
  was occurring on its premises, without more, are not sufficient to establish 
  an expansive duty of care on Eaton Yale to all members of the public who may 
  come into contact with Eaton Yale employees outside the Eaton Yale plant.  The 
  trial judge failed to adequately focus on the issue of whether in the specific 
  circumstances of this case, a duty of care was owed by Eaton Yale to the Johns.  
  The trial judge erred in assuming that Eaton Yale, as employer, owed a duty 
  to Flynn, as employee, to protect Flynn from harm, in general, and that this 
  duty of care could be properly extended to hold Eaton Yale liable for all of 
  Flynn’s actions following his departure from work.  A more thorough examination 
  of the prerequisite issue of duty would have revealed that in the case at bar, 
  there is simply no basis to hold Eaton Yale liable for the loss suffered by 
  the Johns, given that Eaton Yale was not aware that Flynn was intoxicated on 
  the night in question, did not provide him with alcohol on that night and did 
  not condone his driving while intoxicated, combined with the fact that the accident 
  was not associated with Eaton Yale in any way other than that one of its employees, 
  who had finished his shift for the night, was involved in the crash.  The Johns 
  were not within the class of persons to whom a  duty of care was owed by Eaton 
  Yale.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> None of the commercial host cases cited by the respondents supports 
  the imposition of the very wide duty of care or the very broad standard of care 
  urged by the respondents.  Those cases are all distinguishable on the facts 
  and on the evidence since for the most part, they involve situations where one 
  party provides another party with alcohol, condones the direct serving of alcohol 
  on its premises, or knows that the other party is intoxicated, and yet does 
  nothing to prevent the intoxicated party from acting in a potentially dangerous 
  manner, such as driving while impaired.</p>

  </span></span> For example, in <i>Hall v. Hebert</i> (1993), 101 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  129 (S.C.C.), the owner of a car permitted his friend, known by both of them 
  to be highly intoxicated, to drive the owner’s vehicle.  The friend drove off 
  the road and into a gravel pit, injuring himself.  While a duty of care was 
  imposed on the owner of the vehicle, both parties were held equally to blame.  
  It is significant to note that in the case at bar, Eaton Yale was not found 
  by the jury to have had knowledge of Flynn’s intoxication, which differentiates 
  Eaton Yale from the owner of the car in <i>Hall and Hebert</i>,<i> supra</i>. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In <i>Jacobsen v. Nike Canada Ltd.</i> (1996), 133 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 
  377 (B.C.S.C.), an employer who supplied a cooler of beer to its employees during 
  working hours was found to have breached its duty of care to an employee when, 
  after work, the intoxicated employee was injured in an accident while driving 
  home.  The employee, and other employees, drank openly and notoriously during 
  working hours and displayed obvious signs of impairment.  The court held that 
  the duty owed by the employer was equivalent to the duty owed to patrons by 
  commercial vendors of alcohol.  Nike provided alcohol and then required, in 
  effect, that the employees drive home from the remote, non-usual, work location.  
  By doing so it made drinking-and-driving part of the day’s working conditions.  
  On these facts, the employer’s responsibility went beyond merely watching for 
  signs of impairment, and included an obligation to take positive steps to prevent 
  the employee from driving while impaired.  Again, this case is distinguishable 
  from the case at bar, since in the latter, Eaton Yale did not supply Flynn with 
  alcohol, was not aware of his intoxication and did not condone employees driving 
  while impaired.  In fact, when employees presented to work in an intoxicated 
  state, Eaton Yale’s practise was to send them home by taxi.</p>

  B.C.L.R. (3d) 303 (B.C.S.C.), the defendant had been drinking for three hours 
  in a bar of which he was a frequent patron.  Although the server knew that the 
  defendant was intoxicated, she walked him to his van and was aware that he drove 
  away.  The van struck the plaintiff, who was driving his bicycle, causing the 
  plaintiff catastrophic head injuries.  The court held that there was a clear 
  breach of the duty of care owed by the bar to the patron.  The bar was held 
  30 per cent liable, the defendant 60 per cent, and the plaintiff was assessed 
  10 per cent contributory negligent because he did not wear a helmet.  Again, 
  the negligent party in the <i>Lum</i> case was an establishment that supplied 
  a patron with alcohol, knew the patron was intoxicated, knew the patron was 
  driving himself home and actually facilitated his departure.  None of these 
  facts is present in the case now before this court.</p>

  </span></span> An example of a case dealing with a private host incurring liability 
  is that of <i>Prevost (Committee of) v. Vetter</i> (2001), 197 D.L.R. (4th) 
  292 (B.C.S.C.).  In that case, it was found that the parents of under-age persons 
  knew about and acquiesced in impromptu “parties” at which the children and their 
  guests (who were not invited by the parents) became very intoxicated.  In the 
  past, one parent had assumed the duty of taking steps to prevent intoxicated 
  teenagers from driving.  That parent had not been present on the occasion of 
  the party at issue in the case.  The court held that the parents were under 
  a duty of care to prevent the plaintiff from coming to harm while off the premises 
  at the hands of a person who had become impaired as a result of the direct service 
  of alcohol at the premises.  Further, since the parent who had usually been 
  present had failed to exercise the control she had exercised at parties in the 
  past, the court held that she had breached her duty.  In <i>Prevost (Committee 
  of) v. Vetter</i>,<i> supra</i>, the trial judge, Coultas J., followed the “paternalistic 
  relationship” language that the trial judge used in the case at bar and adopted 
  the reasoning used by Donnelly J. in this case.  However, Coultas J., in making 
  his finding of liability, made the following cautionary statement at pp. 315-316:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Would a finding of breach of the Vetters’ duty open the floodgates of unlimited 
      liability upon hosts?  It would not.  Adults are not expected to be human 
      breathalyzer machines.  To find liability there must be evidence that would 
      cause a reasonable adult to suspect that a minor was intoxicated based on 
      the consumption of alcohol consumed at the adult’s home or based on physical 
      symptoms of insobriety.  This is a threshold requirement.</p>

  </span></span> The leading case dealing with commercial host liability, <i>Stewart 
  v. Pettie</i>,<i> supra</i>, deserves further comment.  Here, the defendant 
  operated a theatre-restaurant.  The plaintiff was one of a group of four persons 
  who dined together at the restaurant.  One of the group, having consumed 10 
  to 14 ounces of alcohol, decided that he would drive the rest of the group home.  
  Two members of the group had consumed no alcohol, but after a discussion in 
  the parking-lot, had concluded that the driver was capable of driving them all 
  home.  Though driving cautiously, the driver of the vehicle lost control of 
  the car and injured the plaintiff.  The Supreme Court of Canada addressed the 
  question of whether the defendant met the standard of care required of a vendor 
  of alcohol or whether it was negligent in failing to take the necessary steps 
  to ensure that the intoxicated person did not drive after leaving the establishment.

  </span></span> Major J. began his analysis in <i>Stewart v. Pettie</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> 
  </i>by acknowledging that there were a number of lower court decisions in which 
  commercial establishments had been found liable to third parties injured by 
  a patron who had become inebriated in their establishment.  Major J. then noted 
  that the first question for the court to decide was whether the establishment 
  owed any duty of care to that third party.  If a duty of care was found to exist, 
  the court would then go on to consider what standard of care was necessary and 
  whether that standard was met.  A final consideration would be whether there 
  was a causal connection between the defendant’s allegedly negligent conduct 
  and the damage suffered by the plaintiff.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>In terms of the duty of care, Major J. stated 
  at p. 230:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is a logical step to move from finding that a duty of care is owed to 
      patrons of the bar to finding that a duty is also owed to third parties 
      who might reasonably be expected to come into contact with the patron, and 
      to whom the patron may pose some risk.  It is clear that a bar owes a duty 
      of care to patrons, and as a result, may be required to prevent an intoxicated 
      patron from driving where it is apparent that he intends to drive.  Equally 
      such a duty is owed, in that situation, to third parties who may be using 
      the highways.  In fact, it is the same problem which creates the risk to 
      the third parties as creates the risk to the patron.  If the patron drives 
      while intoxicated and is involved in an accident, it is only chance which 
      results in the patron being injured rather than a third party.  The risk 
      to third parties from the patron’s intoxicated driving is real and foreseeable.</p>
    <p>In this case, there was a sufficient degree of proximity between Mayfield 
      Investments Ltd. [the defendant] and Gillian Stewart [the plaintiff] that 
      a duty of care existed between them.  The more difficult question is what 
      was the standard of care and whether or not it was breached.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Major J. then went on to consider the standard of care, noting 
  that he did not believe any liability could flow from the mere fact that the 
  defendant may have over-served the driver: “It is only if there is some foreseeable 
  risk of harm to the patron or to a third party that Mayfield [the defendant] 
  and others in their position will be required to take some action.” (p. 232.)  
  Noting that courts have historically been reluctant to impose liability for 
  a failure by an individual to take some positive action, Major J. stated that 
  a finding of liability in such cases is only proper if there is some “special 
  relationship” between the parties warranting the imposition of a positive duty.  
  According to Justice Major, there is little difficulty with the proposition 
  that the necessary special relationship exists between vendors of alcohol and 
  the motoring public.  However, Justice Major did not accept the proposition 
  that the mere existence of this special relationship, without more, permits 
  the imposition of a positive obligation.  He stated at pp. 235-236:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Every person who enters a bar or restaurant is in an invitor-invitee 
      relationship with the establishment, and is therefore in a “special relationship” 
      with that establishment.  However, it does not make sense to suggest that, 
      simply as a result of this relationship, a commercial host cannot consider 
      other relevant factors in determining whether in the circumstances positive 
      steps are necessary.</p>
    <p>The existence of this “special relationship” will frequently warrant the 
      imposition of a positive obligation to act, but the <i>sine qua non</i> 
      of tortious liability remains the foreseeability of the risk.  Where no 
      risk is foreseeable as a result of the circumstances, no action will be 
      required, despite the existence of a special relationship.  The respondents 
      argue that Mayfield should have taken positive action, even though Mayfield 
      knew that the driver was with three other people, two of whom were sober, 
      and it was reasonable to infer from all of the circumstances that the group 
      was travelling together.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>On the facts of the case, Major J. held that 
  the establishment, while under a duty of care to the third party, had sufficiently 
  discharged that duty and should incur no liability for the injuries caused by 
  the intoxicated driver:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… I disagree with the Court of Appeal that the presence of the two sober 
      women at the table cannot act to relieve Mayfield of liability.  Laskin 
      J. in<i> Jordan House Ltd. v. Menow </i>[[1974] S.C.R. 239] made it clear 
      that the hotel’s duty to Menow in that case could have been discharged by 
      making sure “that he got home safely by taking him under its charge <i>or 
      putting him under the charge of a responsible person</i> . . .” (p. 249, 
      emphasis added).  Had Pettie been alone and intoxicated, Mayfield could 
      have discharged its duty as established in <i>Jordan House Ltd. v. Menow</i> 
      by calling Pettie’s wife or sister to take charge of him.  How, then, can 
      Mayfield be liable when Pettie was already in their charge, and they knew 
      how much he had had to drink?  While it is technically true that Stuart 
      Pettie was not “put into” the care of his sober wife and sister, this is 
      surely a matter of semantics.  He was already in their care, and they knew 
      how much he had to drink.  It is not reasonable to suggest in these circumstances 
      that Mayfield had to do more.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Just as in the previous examples, the duty of care found to exist 
  in <i>Stewart v. Pettie</i>,<i> supra</i>, cannot simply be translated to the 
  case at bar, since in the former, the duty of care was founded on the special 
  relationship – not present in this case – between a commercial vendor of alcohol 
  and an intoxicated person who could be expected to use the highways.  Not only 
  does the case of <i>Stewart v. Pettie</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i> provide insight 
  into the duty of care, but its discussion of the standard of care is also instructive.  
  Major J. found that the establishment’s duty was discharged by the fact that 
  when he left the restaurant, the intoxicated person was in the care of two sober 
  friends.  This was held to be the functional equivalent of putting the intoxicated 
  person under the charge of a responsible person, which previous cases had held 
  to be sufficient to discharge a commercial host’s liability.  In the case at 
  bar, while it is true that Eaton Yale did not drive Flynn home, the fact remains 
  that he got home safely before going out driving again and causing harm.  Major 
  J. cautioned against using semantics to decide whether the standard of care 
  has been met.  In the case at bar, even assuming that Eaton Yale owed a duty 
  of care to the Johns, the trial judge did not instruct the jury to make any 
  finding as to whether the chain of forseeability and causation had been broken 
  when Flynn arrived safely home from work.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Not only can the liability arguments advanced in the case at 
  bar be distinguished from those made in cases that involve commercial or social 
  host liability, so, too, can they be differentiated from conclusions reached 
  in cases in which the employer has been found to have a duty of care to its 
  employees to provide a safe work environment.  For an example of negligence 
  in providing a safe work environment, reference can be made to an unusual case, 
  <i>Rice v. Chan Estate</i> (1998), 62 B.C.L.R. (3d) 113 (S.C.).  In that case, 
  it was found that there was a clear breach of the duty to provide a safe workplace 
  by the defendant employer, who took an employee, aged 16, on a long car ride 
  during which he supplied the employee with alcohol and made sexual advances.  
  The employer drove into a closed garage and left the vehicle running, and as 
  a result, the defendant died of carbon monoxide poisoning and the plaintiff 
  suffered carbon monoxide poisoning.  The court held that the defendant owed 
  a duty to the plaintiff to maintain a safe workplace and breached this duty.   
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US>The duty being asserted by the respondents in 
  the case at bar goes far beyond a duty to provide Flynn and the other Eaton 
  Yale employees with a safe work environment, and could potentially hold employers 
  liable for harm caused by employees to themselves or to all others with whom 
  they come into contact, even in circumstances when those employees are not working 
  and not on company property, </span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Despite the differences between the present case and the cases 
  detailed above that dealt with host and employer liability, the Johns in this 
  case, enthusiastically supported by Flynn, took the position on appeal that 
  Flynn was the victim of his employer’s lack of enforcement of its alcohol ban 
  and that, had the employer been more strict in the exercise of its “parental” 
  responsibilities to supervise him and other employees, Flynn would not (or could 
  not) have become intoxicated and then collided with the plaintiff’s vehicle.  
  This may have some emotional appeal to those concerned about the serious consequences 
  to the driving public created by drivers such as Flynn, but as a statement of 
  an extended duty of care, it finds no support in the case law.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I do not believe that the law should be altered in order to give 
  effect to the arguments advanced by the Johns relating to an extended duty of 
  care.  Eaton  Yale is sought to be held liable because it established an enlightened 
  policy in co-operation with its employees (acting through their union) in an 
  attempt to help individual employees who have personal problems which impact 
  negatively on their ability to function in the workplace.  By adopting an Employee 
  Assistance Program, jointly with the union, the company chose to provide services 
  to its employees, including Flynn, who expressed a desire for assistance, rather 
  than to simply discard “problem” employees. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It should be noted that the program established was not limited 
  to personal problems, such as alcoholism, that were a potential threat to the 
  safety of the employee and his or her co&#8209;workers, but also embraced problems 
  such as matrimonial difficulties, emotional disorders and financial troubles.  
  To say that a failure on the part of the employer to make sure that the employee 
  is following through with whatever program or advice the employee has received 
  under the program can, without more, involve the company in liability to a third 
  party would be a powerful disincentive to employers to set up programs such 
  as the EAP.  I do not think that this court, as a matter of policy, wants to 
  send such a message.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The answers to issues 1 and 2 is “No”.  There is no duty of care 
  on the part of Eaton Yale to members of the driving public arising out of Flynn’s 
  participation in the EAP and if there was such a duty, it did not extend beyond 
  the point where Flynn left the company premises and drove safely to his home.  
  Any suggestions as to how Eaton Yale could have controlled Flynn’s activities 
  beyond that point are hopelessly speculative.</p>

  </span></span> In light of my proposed disposition of the appeal, this cross-appeal 
  is moot.  However, the issue was argued fully and so far as I am aware, this 
  court has not dealt with this precise point.  Section 266 of the <i>Insurance 
  Act</i> (in force after October 23, 1989 and before January 1, 1994) creates 
  a general immunity from damage claims arising directly or indirectly from the 
  use or operation of an automobile by the owner, occupants or any person present 
  at the incident.  No other persons were relieved from liability.  Recovery against 
  non-automobile defendants was restricted to their degree of liability with no 
  right of indemnification, contribution or subrogation: see <i>Meyer v. Bright</i> 
  (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 129 (C.A.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-US>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Mandatory deduction of no-fault benefits prevented double recovery 
  in specified circumstances.  The legislative intent of s. 266 was to limit significantly 
  the right of a victim of a motor vehicle accident to maintain a tort action 
  against the tortfeasor.  The compensation scheme provides for an exchange of 
  rights – the victim loses the right to sue unless coming within the statutory 
  exemptions, but receives more generous first-party benefits, regardless of fault, 
  from his or her own insurer.  </p>

  </span></span> In this case, following judgment at trial, Eaton York, a non-automobile 
  defendant claimed deduction of collateral benefits that were agreed to be $355,993.58.  
  The trial judge concurred and the deduction was applied to heads of damages 
  such as out of pocket expense, past income loss and future care costs.  The 
  cross-appellant submits that the deduction is restricted to the class created 
  by s. 266(1), being owner, occupant or person present on the basis that s. 267(1) 
  does not specifically provide for deduction by defendants who are beyond the 
  insurance structure.  It is further submitted that recovery against Eaton Yale 
  is founded on the independent tort of negligent supervision.  The automobile 
  is said to be no more than the instrument through which Eaton Yale’s negligence 
  caused the loss.</p>

lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I reject the cross-appellants’ argument.  All of the damages 
  that the cross-appellants suffered arose directly out of the operation of an 
  automobile.  The conduct of Eaton Yale as found by the jury did not effect the 
  quantum of those damages in any sense.   Its findings of liability only made 
  Eaton Yale a contributor to those damages.  Section 267(1) is clear and specific.  
  The damages awarded are to be reduced by the itemized deductions set out there.  
  The distinction between protected parties and others, identified in s. 266 (1) 
  and (2), is not carried into s. 267(1).  No legislative intent to exclude non-automobile 
  defendants is demonstrated.  Section 266 relates to access to the court system.  
  Section 267 relates to proceedings in the system.  The principle that motivates 
  s. 267(1) is the exclusion of double recovery.  The deductibility provision 
  in s.&nbsp;267(1) is available to Eaton Yale.  This construction is consistent 
  with authorities in this province dealing with related issues:  see <i>Wight 
  v. Marra</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 544 at 550 (Div. Ct.), <i>Rutherford v. Niekrawitz</i>

  the appellant is entitled to its costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.  Since
