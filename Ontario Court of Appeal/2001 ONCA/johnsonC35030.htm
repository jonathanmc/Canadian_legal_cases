<h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>COURT OF APPEAL FOR ONTARIO</h3>
<p>RE:                              HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN (Respondent) v. ORIN 
  JOHNSON (Appellant)</p>
<p>BEFORE:                   DOHERTY, ROSENBERG and MOLDAVER JJ.A.</p>
<p>COUNSEL:                Joseph Di Luca for the appellant</p>
<p>                                    John North for the respondent</p>
<p>HEARD:                     July 10, 2001</p>
<p>On appeal from the conviction imposed by Justice William J. Morrison dated 
  December 3, 1999.</p>
<h3 align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>

  </span> The sole issue at trial was identification.  The undercover officer 
  identified the appellant as one of three persons who sold him a substantial 
  amount of cocaine in a hotel room.  No arrests were made at that time as the 
  investigation was an ongoing one.  About 8 months after that transaction, the 
  officer selected the appellant’s photograph from a photo array.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant absconded prior to trial in 1993 and was not arrested 
  until 1999.  He did not testify at trial.  Two defence witnesses testified to 
  the effect that the appellant was in New York at the relevant time.  The trial 
  judge rejected that testimony and no issue is taken with his treatment of that 
  evidence on this appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellant contends that the verdict is unreasonable.  The scope 
  of appellate review of the reasonableness of a verdict is set out in <i>R. v. 
  Biniaris</i> (2000), 143 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our view, the reasonableness of this verdict stands or falls on the 
  reliability of the identification made at the photo array.  The officer was 
  shown 12 photographs.  Four, including the photo of the appellant, had a person’s 
  name underneath the photograph.  The officer did not know the appellant’s name.  
  The trial judge rejected the appellant’s submission that the name underneath 
  the appellant’s photo somehow directed the officer’s attention to that photo 
  and detracted from the fairness of the photo array.  The trial judge described 
  the photo array as “a fair line-up consisting of numerous males at least 10 
  of whom were approximately the same age and colour as the accused”.  We see 
  no reason to disagree with that assessment.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge’s reasons indicate that he was alive to the frailties 
  of identification evidence generally and to the specific features of the evidence 
  adduced in this case which potentially undermined the reliability of the officer’s 
  identification.  The trial judge decided that the officer’s evidence was credible 
  and reliable.  Bearing in mind our limited jurisdiction to reassess the officer’s 
  credibility and reliability, we are not prepared to come to a different conclusion.</p>
