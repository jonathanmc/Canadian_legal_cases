  </span></font></span><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"> The 
  appellant was convicted of first degree murder.  He raises two principal grounds 
  of appeal. </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The first relates to the sufficiency of the <i>Vetrovec</i> ((1982), 
  67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.)) warning in relation the evidence of Graves.  The 
  trial judge instructed the jury to approach Graves's evidence with caution, 
  but the appellant argues that the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was not sufficiently 
  strong.  The judge used language that Mr. Gold conceded has been approved in 
  other cases, instructing the jury that it should approach the evidence of Graves 
  with “care and caution”.  Mr. Gold submitted, however, that the word “dangerous” 
  should have been used.  </font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While it certainly would have been open to the trial judge to 
  have given a stronger warning relating to Graves' evidence, he committed no 
  error in approaching the matter as he did.  He was very clear on the points 
  which made Graves’ evidence suspect, her prior criminal record, the fact that 
  she was also charged with the murder and stood to gain from inculpating the 
  appellant, and the fact her evidence was inconsistent with prior statements.  
  In our view, this warning was sufficient to bring home to the jury the dangers 
  her evidence posed.  <i>Vetrovec</i> itself holds at p. 17 that no particular 
  formula is required and that the matter lies within the discretion of the trial 
  judge.  In our view the trial judge did not go outside the acceptable limits 
  of his discretion.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The other <i>Vetrovec</i> point regarding the trial judge's failure 
  to direct the jury as to what could amount to confirmatory evidence was not 
  pressed in oral argument.  As pointed out by the respondent, defence counsel 
  asked the judge not to do that as it would only harm the defence by bringing 
  such evidence to the jury’s attention.</font></p>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='

  </span></span> The principal argument relied on by the appellant was that the 
  trial judge erred in leaving with the jury the possibility of convicting him 
  as a party to the offence of murder under s. 21.  The appellant submits that 
  the Crown should have been restricted to its theory that the appellant was the 
  killer and that the entire transaction was his.  As Mr. Gold put it, the Crown 
  alleged a transaction over which the appellant, not Graves, had “ownership”.  
  Mr. Gold argued that there was no factual basis to leave with the jury the alternate 
  theory that the appellant was a party to a murder committed by Graves.  It is 
  argued that would constitute a separate and distinct transaction for which the 
  Crown laid no evidential basis, and that leaving the s. 21 theory with the jury 
  unfairly undercut the appellant's essential defence that Graves was the killer.</font></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr. 
  Gold conceded that there is no authority for his &quot;ownership&quot; theory, 
  but he argues that the appellant was charged with one offence, advanced a defence 
  to that offence, and then had his defence undercut when the trial judge invited 
  the jury to consider the very different offence of being a party to a murder 
  committed by Graves.</span></font></p>

  </span></span> It is common ground that the test for when to put a &quot;party 
  to an offence&quot; theory to the jury in cases such as this is that offered 
  by Martin J.A. in <i>R. v. Sparrow</i> (1979), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 443 at p. 460 
  , a passage adopted by the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Thatcher</i> (1987), 32 
  C.C.C. (3d) 481 at p. 507.  Martin J. A. stated:</font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3">I am of the view that 
      it is also appropriate, where an accused is being tried alone and there 
      is evidence that more than one person was involved in the commission of 
      the offence, to direct the jury with respect to the provisions of s. 21 
      of the <i>Code</i>, even though the identity of the other participant or 
      participants is unknown, and even though the precise part played by each 
      participant may be uncertain.  It is, in my view, however, improper to charge 
      the jury with respect to the liability of the accused as a party under s. 
      21 where there is no evidence proper to be left with the jury that more 
      than one person was actually involved in the commission of the offence.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='

lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Martin J.A. 
  went on to state:</span></font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There 
      do not appear to be any Canadian or Commonwealth decisions which have examined 
      or discussed the question presented by this ground of appeal. There are, 
      however, a number of American decisions which have considered the question 
      and, in particular, there is a long line of decisions in the State of Michigan 
      which hold that it is reversible error to charge the jury with respect to 
      aiding and abetting where there is no evidence to support a theory that 
      the accused was acting in concert with another.</span></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=MsoBodyText align=left style='
text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> <font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span
lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, there was ample evidence in this case from which 
  the jury could conclude that both Graves and Jones were involved in the commission 
  of the offence and that they were acting in concert.  If the jury was prepared 
  to entertain the suggestion that Graves was the killer, there was ample evidence 
  of acts of the appellant that could give rise to his liability as a party.  
  The weapon was his, he was in the car at the time of the shooting, he went together 
  with Graves to pick up the deceased, and with Graves assistance, he disposed 
  of the body and other incriminating materials including the murder weapon after 
  the crime was committed. </font></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In view of this substantial body of evidence from which the jury 
  could conclude that both the appellant and Graves were involved in the murder 
  and that if Graves was the killer,  the appellant knew in advance of the plan 
  to kill the victim, by advancing the defence that Graves was the actual killer, 
  the appellant effectively invited a direction on s.&nbsp;21 as a possible theory 
  of liability.</font></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It 
  is important to add that the trial judge clearly charged the jury that if they 
  were to convict on the basis of s. 21, the crown had to prove beyond a reasonable 
  doubt that the appellant knew of a plan by Graves to commit murder before its 
  actual commission.</span></font></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In our view, the circumstances of this case fall within the principles 
  set out in <i>Sparrow</i> and <i>Thatcher</i> allowing the crown to advance 
  alternative theories of liability where those alternatives are supported by 
  the evidence.  In <i>Sparrow</i> at p. 460, Martin J.A. concluded: </font></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif" size="3"><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>I am disposed to think that if there 
      had been evidence to warrant charging the jury on s. 21, the charge was 
      sufficient to convey to the jury in simple language the elements of liability 
      under s. 21(1). . . . There was, in my view, simply no evidence of a &quot;plan&quot; 
      to kill Garden involving the appellant as a participant, with another or 
      others, to which this instruction could be related.</span></font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> We do not accept the submission that leaving s. 21 with the jury 
  unfairly undercut the appellant's defence or subjected him to liability for 
  a different transaction. There was a single murder and evidence that two people 
  were involved in its commission before, during and after.  Even if there were 
  doubt about who was the actual killer, there was ample evidence from which the 
  jury could conclude that both the appellant and Graves were implicated from 
  the beginning.  The trial judge properly left with the jury two possible theories 
  of liability, both of which were supported by the evidence.</font></p>
