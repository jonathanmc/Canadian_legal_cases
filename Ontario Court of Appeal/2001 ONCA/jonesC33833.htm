<p ><b>On appeal from the judgment of Justice Bruce A. 
  Glass dated February 4, 2000. </b></p>
<h3 style='line-height:100%' align="center">ENDORSEMENT</h3>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b>Released Orally: August 16, 2001</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge failed to conduct a proper analysis in his consideration 
  of whether the donor of the Florida property, Mr. Szafran, intended to make 
  a gift of the property only to his daughter, the respondent, or to both her 
  and her husband, the appellant.  The proper analysis required the court to determine 
  the intention of the donor at the time the gift was made.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The evidence was that the reason the property was transferred by the 
  donor to his daughter and her husband was that there were tax advantages in 
  doing so.  Notwithstanding this evidence, in concluding that the donor did not 
  intend to make a gift of the property to the appellant, the trial judge gave 
  effect to evidence of subsequent facts which, although they had limited probative 
  value, did not overcome the evidence of the donor’s intention to transfer the 
  property to his daughter and her husband to take the benefit of the tax advantages.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> To give effect to the respondent’s submission that the donor did not 
  intend to transfer the property beneficially to the appellant requires to court 
  to conclude that the donor acted dishonestly.  This, of course, was not suggested 
  by the respondent.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and paragraph 9 of the judgment is 
  varied to reflect the foregoing reasons.  In addition, paragraph 10 of the judgment 
  is set aside.  The appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As the result of this appeal affects the costs of the trial awarded 
  by the trial judge, paragraph 13 of the judgment is varied to provide that the 
  appellant is to pay the respondent’s costs in the amount of $17,680, plus G.S.T.</p>
