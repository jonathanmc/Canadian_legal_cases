  </span> In 1998 Marshall Jourdain worked as the manager of a bingo hall on the 
  Couchiching First Nation Reserve near Fort Francis, Ontario. As a result of 
  activities conducted at the bingo hall, he was charged on June 9, 1998 with 
  keeping a common gaming house. He was tried in June 1999 and was found not guilty 
  in a decision dated December 13, 1999.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This is the appeal by the Crown from that acquittal. It raises four 
  issues. First, Mr. Jourdain moves to quash the appeal for delay. Second, he 
  argues that the Crowns appeal is not based on a question of law alone and therefore 
  no appeal lies from his acquittal. Third, the Crown submits that in acquitting 
  Mr. Jourdain the trial judge committed reversible error. Fourth is the question 
  of the appropriate remedy if the appeal from acquittal is allowed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that the appeal should 
  not be dismissed for delay and that it does raise a question of law alone. Further, 
  I think the trial judge erred in law and that the acquittal must, therefore, 
  be set aside. In the circumstances, the appropriate remedy is a new trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>THE FACTS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Prior to October 17, 1997 the Couchiching First Nation Bingo Palace 
  (Bingo Palace) was licensed by the Province of Ontario, pursuant to the <i>Gaming 
  Control Act</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 24 as amended, to carry on bingo and other gambling 
  activities such as the sale of break open tickets. However, on that date its 
  licence was suspended and subsequently revoked by the provincial regulator, 
  the Alcohol and Gaming Commission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On March 18, 1998 the police served a notice on the Band Chief that 
  the continued conduct of bingos and selling of break open tickets may result 
  in increased enforcement action. Nevertheless, the Bingo Palace continued both 
  activities. As a result, Mr. Jourdain, as manager of the facility, was charged 
  with keeping a common gaming house contrary to s. 201(1) of the<i> Criminal 
  Code.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial the defence argued that the Bingo Palace was not required to 
  comply with the provincial gaming legislation, as the registration fee imposed 
  by the legislation was in reality a tax, and therefore, inapplicable to the 
  Bingo Palace pursuant to s. 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5. 
  Mr. Jourdain says he could not lawfully be convicted under s. 201(1) of the 
  <i>Code, </i>because that law required him to give up his right to tax exemption 
  in order to acquire protection from criminal prosecution. This position draws 
  on the reasoning of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Bob</i> (1991), 
  3 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 348.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The position of the Crown at trial was that all gaming is illegal unless 
  specifically exempted under the <i>Criminal Code. </i>As the Bingo Palace was 
  not complying with the provincial regulatory scheme, it could not benefit from 
  any <i>Code</i> exemptions and was therefore operating illegally.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge did not address the arguments raised by the parties. 
  Rather, he disposed of the case by following <i>R. v. Boggs</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 
  49, (1981) 58 C.C.C. (2d) 7 (S.C.C.). The core of his reasons read as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><u>Issues to be Determined</u></p>
    <p>(1)       The issue as to whether the licensing scheme set up by the Province 
      of Ontario is in reality a system of taxation and therefore inapplicable 
      to the First Nations Territories was the focus of the greatest part of the 
      submissions of counsel. It is an interesting issue and must in the courts 
      view be determined in the very near future to give certainty to those operating 
      or seeking to operate similar facilities on or off First Nations Communities.</p>
    <p>(2)       It is my view that this case must be resolved on another ground, 
      making the determination of the Licensing or taxation issue moot.</p>
    <p>(3)       The issue that concerns this court is whether the criminal law 
      is being used here to enforce compliance with the Provincial regulatory 
      scheme. It is noted that no Notice of Constitutional Question was served 
      in this case and little time was spent in reference to it in argument. The 
      court has not been asked to declare the gaming sections of the <i>Criminal 
      Code</i> to be inoperative, and in the absence of that issue being raised 
      in the appropriate manner, has no authority to do so.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>(7)       Similarly, it may seem that what is objected to here is the failure 
      or refusal of the operators of the subject Bingo Palace to comply with the 
      Provincial regulatory scheme, not that they are operating a gaming house 
      from which the public needs the protection afforded by the application of 
      the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
    <p>(8)       On the facts of this case, I find that while the accused has 
      not complied with the provinces licensing regulations, he is not subject 
      to prosecution under the <i>Criminal Code</i> by reason of that non-compliance. 
      I find him not guilty.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The respondents motion to quash the appeal for delay is based on the 
  following chronology. Mr. Jourdain was acquitted on December 13, 1999. The Crown 
  served its notice of appeal on January 7, 2000. The transcripts were received 
  on February 1, 2000. The time for perfection allowed by rule 18 of the <i>Criminal 
  Appeal Rules</i> expired on May 3, 2000. The appeal was finally perfected on 
  January 12, 2001.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There is no doubt that there is a higher onus on the Crown than on the 
  accused to comply with the rules of this court, particularly when it is appealing 
  an acquittal. See <i>R. v. Walsh</i>, [1998] O.J. No.4356 (C.A.). The explanation 
  offered for the delay, namely the complexity of the appeal, its potentially 
  far reaching  impact, and the need therefore to consult with other branches 
  of government, does not carry the Crown very far. Nor does the Crown dispute 
  that the respondent has suffered stress, anxiety and uncertainty as a result 
  of the delay. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On the other side of the scales there has been no effect on the respondents 
  liberty, or on his ability to make full answer and defence given his fundamental 
  position that he cannot be required to give up his right to tax exemption to 
  avoid prosecution. Moreover, the respondent took no steps over this timeframe 
  to hold the Crown to the required time lines. Finally, and most importantly, 
  the issue raised by this case, namely, the application of the principles in 
  <i>R. v. Bob, supra, </i>to these facts, is one of significant public importance. 
  In all the circumstances, I am of the view that the draconian remedy of quashing 
  the appeal is not warranted. The motion to quash is therefore dismissed.</p>

  </span> The respondent also argues that this appeal from acquittal does not 
  involve a question of law alone as required by s. 676(1)(a) as of the <i>Criminal 
  Code.</i> I disagree. The ultimate finding of the trial judge is that s. 201(1) 
  of the <i>Code</i> does not extend to someone who simply fails or refuses to 
  comply with the provincial scheme regulating gambling. The Crown challenges 
  the correctness of this proposition of law in this appeal. The requirement of 
  s. 676(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i> is clearly met since the appeal raises a question 
  of law alone.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Turning to the merits of the appeal, I agree with the Crown that the 
  acquittal is founded on an error of law and therefore cannot stand. Although 
  <i>R. v. Boggs</i>, <i>supra</i>, was not argued by either party at trial, the 
  trial judge applied it to the case before him. In that case, the Supreme Court 
  of Canada found that the <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions went too far in making 
  it an offence to drive while disqualified even if the reason for disqualification 
  was for a purely provincial purpose unrelated to public safety. Hence, the <i>Code</i> 
  provision was found unconstitutional.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge applied this principle and acquitted the respondent 
  on the basis that he had simply breached the provincial regulatory scheme for 
  gambling and that Parliament could not criminalize such activity. However, in 
  <i>R. v. Furtney</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 89, (1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 498, the Supreme 
  Court of Canada decided otherwise. That court made clear that the scheme to 
  prohibit gambling, except as provincially regulated, is valid criminal law, 
  constitutionally unimpeachable, and is not an improper delegation to the provinces 
  by Parliament of its constitutional law authority. More recently, this court 
  put an end to any suggestion that the passage of time has made commercial gaming 
  any less criminal an activity then it ever has been. See <i>R. v. Andriopoulos</i>, 
  [1994] O.J. No. 2314 (C.A.). I therefore conclude that the trial judge based 
  the acquittal of the respondent on an error of law when he concluded that the 
  criminal law could not extend to someone who merely failed or refused to comply 
  with the provincial scheme regulating gambling.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> With considerable ingenuity, Mr. Colborne offered two other arguments 
  to sustain the decision of the trial judge. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> First, he argued that in determining that s. 201(1) of the <i>Code</i> 
  did not apply to the respondent, the trial judge was simply reading down the 
  legislation as a matter of statutory interpretation rather than constitutional 
  analysis.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I cannot agree. Although the trial judge said that he had not been asked 
  to declare the gaming sections of the <i>Code</i> inoperative and had no authority 
  to do so, his reliance on <i>R. v. Boggs, supra, </i>and his conclusion that 
  the criminal law cannot punish the simple breach of a provincial regulatory 
  scheme, in these circumstances, clearly reflects a constitutional analysis. 
  The trial judge does not purport to reach his conclusion merely by interpreting 
  the language of s. 201(1). Nor could any reasonable interpretation of the words 
  of that section alone result in an acquittal in these circumstances, where the 
  failure of the respondent to comply with the provincial regulatory scheme was 
  beyond dispute.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Mr. Colbornes second argument was that the trial judge was doing no 
  more than finding that the respondent lacked the requisite criminal intent or 
  <i>mens rea</i> for the offence. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Again I disagree. There is nothing in the reasons of the trial judge 
  to suggest that he made such a finding or that such a finding was the basis 
  of his decision. Nor could it have been, since the intention of the respondent 
  to operate the bingo hall in violation of the provincial regulatory scheme was 
  clear. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Since the acquittal cannot stand there remains only the question of 
  remedy. In their original factums both parties urged the court to adjudicate 
  the issue placed before the trial judge, but which he by-passed  namely, whether 
  the reasoning in <i>R. v. Bob</i>, <i>supra,</i> provided the respondent with 
  a defence to this charge. In its reply factum the Crown altered its position 
  and urged us not to do so. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view the latter position is the appropriate one for this court 
  to take in this case. The trial judge made none of the findings of fact that 
  would be necessary to properly resolve this issue. Nor is the record sufficiently 
  clear and complete that this court can do so. This issue is too important to 
  be decided on the basis of factual guesswork at the appellate level. There must 
  be a new trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons therefore, I would allow the appeal, set aside the 
  acquittal and direct a new trial.</p>
