  </span> The trial began with pre-trial motions in September 1992.  For various 
  reasons, these motions were not completed until February 1995.  They consumed 
  some 10,000 pages of transcript.  Jury selection began in February 1995 and 
  the verdict was returned on July 13, 1995<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

  </span> The appellants argued several grounds of appeal.  The Crown was asked 
  to respond to three.  These reasons address only those three grounds of appeal.  
  They are:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      Did the trial judge err in law in refusing to admit certain out-of-court 
      statements made by David Teed in which he admitted killing Dr. Warrick?</p>
    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      Did the trial judge misdirect the jury as to the meaning of a reasonable

    <p> <span style='font-family:Symbol'>¨<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
      Did the trial judge err in refusing to direct a verdict of acquittal on 
      the first degree murder charge, and if not, did he misdirect the jury on 
      the elements of first degree murder as found in s. 231(5)(e) of the <i>Criminal 
      Code</i>?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown contended that both Kimberley and Clancey were parties to 
  murder as defined in s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, and that the murder 
  was first degree murder because Dr. Warrick’s death was jointly caused by the 
  appellants in the course of committing an unlawful confinement or forcible seizure 
  (s. 231(5)(e)).</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> By way of alternative submission, the Crown argued that if Clancey acted 
  alone in beating and kicking Dr. Warrick to death, Kimberley was guilty of murder 
  as a party to a common design under s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The 
  trial judge told the jury that on this theory, Kimberley could be convicted 
  of second degree murder or manslaughter, but not first degree murder.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It was Clancey’s defence that he had nothing to do with the killing 
  and was not at the scene of the crime.  He did not testify.  Kimberley, who 
  did testify, acknowledged that he was in the building where the crime occurred, 
  with Clancey.  According to Kimberley, Clancey acting on his own decided to 
  steal Dr. Warrick’s purse and followed her out of the elevator.  Kimberley insisted 
  that he had no prior knowledge of this plan and no involvement in the assault 
  on Dr. Warrick.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  the person who killed Dr. Warrick.  </p>

line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The jury convicted both appellants of first degree murder.  To do so 
  they must have been satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that both appellants 
  participated in the assault culminating in Dr. Warrick’s death and that both 
  had the requisite intention to commit murder.  The jury must also have been 
  satisfied that Dr. Warrick’s death was caused while she was being unlawfully 
  confined and/or forcibly seized.</p>

  </span> On January 27, 1991, at about 11:00 p.m., Dr. Carolyn Warrick, a medical 
  resident at the Toronto Hospital for Sick Children, was killed in the underground 
  parking area of the condominium building where she lived.  The physical evidence 
  indicated that Dr. Warrick was attacked and struck at least twice just outside 
  the doors of the elevators on level D of the building.  Her eyeglasses, earrings 
  and a bloodstain were found directly in front of one of the elevators.  She 
  was dragged some 27 feet across the elevator lobby, through a door and down 
  a carpeted ramp to a door leading to the parking garage.  Her body was found 
  with her head at that door leading to the parking area.  Blood smears found 
  between the elevators and Dr. Warrick’s body, and abrasions on her face indicated 
  that she was unconscious when she was dragged from the elevator area to the 
  door at the end of the ramp.  Dr. Warrick was repeatedly kicked and/or beaten 
  as she lay unconscious at the end of the ramp.  Most of the blood loss occurred 
  at the spot where her body was found.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The post-mortem revealed that Dr. Warrick was savagely beaten.  She 
  was struck on the head, face, neck and chest area at least 15 times.  She suffered 
  a fractured skull, broken jaw, broken nose and extensive bruising on her face, 
  neck and upper chest.  She was repeatedly kicked as she lay on the ground at 
  the end of the ramp.  Footwear impressions found on her face, neck and coat 
  suggested that she was kicked by two different people.  The forensic evidence 
  also suggested that she was struck on one or more occasions with a blunt instrument 
  such as a pipe.  There were no defensive injuries.  </p>

  </span> It was the Crown’s theory that Kimberley and Clancey, who were living 
  together on the streets of Toronto in January 1991, needed money to support 
  their cocaine addictions.  Kimberley also owed money to a drug supplier who 
  was known to react violently towards those who did not pay their debts.  According 
  to the Crown, Kimberley and Clancey went to the condominium building intending 
  to steal a leather coat from a vehicle parked in the garage area, and to sell 
  the coat to support their drug habit.  By chance, they encountered Dr. Warrick 
  in the elevator and decided to rob her.  As Dr. Warrick left the elevator, she 
  was struck and knocked unconscious.  Her body was then dragged out of the range 
  of the security camera to the end of the ramp where she was beaten to death.  
  Kimberley and Clancey took her purse and fled.</p>

  </span> Todd Vermillion, a transvestite prostitute, heavy drug user and Clancey’s 
  lover in January 1991, was the main Crown witness.  According to Vermillion, 
  he and Clancey spent a great deal of time together in January 1991.  Both were 
  heavy cocaine users.  Clancey supported his habit by selling hash and Vermillion 
  supported his by working as a prostitute.  Vermillion also testified that Kimberley 
  was often with him and Clancey.  Kimberley was also a heavy cocaine user and 
  financed his habit by selling hash, sometimes with Clancey.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Vermillion testified that on January 27, 1991, Clancey spoke of stealing 
  a leather jacket which he had seen in a car parked in an underground garage.  
  The jacket could be sold and the money used to buy cocaine.  Later that evening, 
  Clancey suggested that they go and steal the coat.  Kimberley agreed.  The three 
  men walked to the condominium building.  Clancey and Kimberley went inside and 
  Vermillion waited outside.  Some time later, Vermillion saw Clancey running 
  towards him with Kimberley running close behind.  Clancey had a purse in his 
  hand.  He told Vermillion to run and all three men ran back to an abandoned 
  apartment several blocks away where they stayed from time to time.  At the apartment, 
  Clancey emptied the contents of the purse and put some money (about $40 or $50) 
  in his jacket.  According to Vermillion, Clancey and Kimberley counted the money 
  together.  Clancey said that he had “bitch slapped” the woman when he took her 
  purse and had “knocked her silly”.  He assured Vermillion that the victim was 
  “fine”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Clancey and Kimberley left to purchase some cocaine with the stolen 
  money.  They returned to the abandoned apartment and shared the cocaine with 
  Vermillion.  He asked Clancey what had happened.  Clancey said that he had encountered 
  a woman in the building and took her purse.  He repeated that he had “bitch 
  slapped” the victim, but assured Vermillion that she was not seriously hurt.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Vermillion testified that on the day of the homicide, Kimberley had 
  a length of pipe stuck up the sleeve of his shirt.  Kimberley referred to this 
  pipe as “his convincer”.  Vermillion did not see the pipe in Kimberley’s possession 
  when the three men went to steal the coat.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There was good reason to doubt Vermillion’s veracity and his reliability.  
  The Crown conceded that Vermillion was a participant in a plan to steal the 
  coat from the parked car.  He had a lengthy criminal record, including several 
  crimes of dishonesty.  He was under the influence of cocaine when the relevant 
  events occurred, he gave several inconsistent statements to the police, and 
  his relationship with Clancey had soured by the time he gave his first statement 
  to the police.  Vermillion also admitted that he had lied under oath at his 
  bail hearing on an unrelated matter.  He received payments totalling several 
  thousand dollars while he was in the witness protection program. There was also 
  some evidence that the Toronto police had assisted him in resolving, at least 
  temporarily, a problem he had with his immigration status. The trial judge gave 
  a strong “<i>Vetrovec</i>” warning to the jury and no issue is taken with that 
  instruction on appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Vermillion’s testimony was confirmed in many details by statements made 
  by Kimberley to the police and to an undercover officer placed in the cells 
  with Kimberley in April 1991.  In these statements, Kimberley repeatedly said 
  that he was “stoned” on the day of the homicide and had very little recollection 
  of the events.  He insisted that he had not killed anyone.  He told the undercover 
  officer that he recalled going to a condominium building to steal a coat and 
  he recalled running out of that place back to an abandoned apartment.  He said 
  that a “friend” had got him into this mess and he was going to do “10 to 15 
  years”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his first interview with the police, Kimberley said that he had been 
  in the condominium building and that Vermillion had waited outside the building.  
  Kimberley also recalled that Clancey had a purse with him when they got back 
  to the abandoned apartment and that they used money from the purse to purchase 
  cocaine.  Kimberley insisted that he did not kill anyone.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his second statement to the police, Kimberley provided more detail.  
  He gave this detail after he was shown part of the statement made by Vermillion.  
  Kimberley told the police that he, Clancey and Vermillion were sitting at the 
  abandoned apartment when they decided to go and steal a leather coat from a 
  car parked in an underground garage.  Clancey and Kimberley entered the condominium 
  building and took the elevator to the basement.  There was a woman on the elevator.  
  As the doors opened, Clancey followed her off the elevator, telling Kimberley 
  that he was going to “take her out” and would be back shortly.  Kimberley waited 
  at the elevator and could hear some kind of scuffle going on.  A short time 
  later Clancey came running towards the elevator.  He seemed nervous and said 
  to Kimberley “Let’s go.  Let’s get out of here”.  Kimberley and Clancey exited 
  the building, found Vermillion who was waiting outside and proceeded back to 
  the abandoned apartment.  Kimberley told the police that he did not see the 
  purse until they arrived back at the abandoned apartment.  Clancey took the 
  money from the purse and used it to purchase cocaine for Kimberley, Clancey 
  and Vermillion.  Kimberley insisted that he was not responsible for Dr. Warrick’s 
  death.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown also led evidence of statements made by Kimberley to a friend, 
  Ray Lowe, prior to Kimberley’s arrest in April 1991 in Montreal.  Kimberley 
  told Lowe that a woman had been robbed and that the robbery “had gone overboard”.  
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Clancey also made two statements to the police.  In his first statement 
  in April 1991, shortly before his arrest, Clancey told the police that he and 
  Kimberley had hitchhiked to Montreal on the day Dr. Warrick was killed.  He 
  recalled the day because it was Superbowl Sunday.  According to Clancey, he 
  and Kimberley split up after they arrived in Montreal.  Clancey returned to 
  Toronto in March.  Clancey was shown a copy of Vermillion’s statement.  He said 
  it was “bullshit” and denied any involvement in the robbery or death of Dr. 
  Warrick.  </p>

  told Clancey that a ticket issued to him for hitchhiking on Highway 401 confirmed 
  that he went to Montreal on February 3, 1991<sup> </sup>and not January 27<sup>th</sup>.  
  Clancey said that he must have mixed up the dates.  He then provided details 
  as to his whereabouts on January 27<sup>th</sup>.  He confirmed that he was 
  with Vermillion in Toronto at various times on that date and was unsure whether 
  Kimberley was with them.  He insisted that he had nothing to do with Dr. Warrick’s

  </span> In December 1991, counsel for Clancey provided a formal notice of alibi 
  detailing his whereabouts on January 27<sup>th</sup>.  There was evidence at 
  trial that Clancey gave different accounts of his whereabouts on the evening 
  of January 27<sup>th</sup> to different people in the weeks following the homicide.  
  There was also some evidence that Clancey tried to solicit the assistance of 
  one person to support his false story that he was not in Toronto on January 
  27<sup>th</sup>.  Apart from evidence given by Vermillion and Kimberley which 
  placed Clancey at the scene of the crime, no other witness gave evidence as 
  to where he was at the time of the killing.  </p>

  </span> The Crown attempted to connect Clancey to shoe impressions found at 
  the scene of the crime.  These impressions were found in blood near the body.  
  Expert evidence established that the impressions were made by a 1990 Nike Air 
  Jordan running shoe, likely a size 10 and perhaps a size 11.  Clancey had size 
  12 1/2 feet and the shoes seized from him when he was arrested were size 12.  
  They were not Nike Air Jordan running shoes.  At trial, Clancey was able to 
  get his feet into a size 11 Nike Air Jordan, but his toes were right at the 
  end of the shoe.  </p>

  running shoes which Vermillion described as “Nike Air something”.  Vermillion 
  said that the shoes looked too small for Clancey.  Kimberley also testified 
  that Clancey was wearing new  Nike Air Jordan running shoes on January 27<sup>th</sup>.  
  A day or two later, Kimberley noticed reddish stains on the toes of those shoes.  
  A few days later, Clancey was wearing different shoes.</p>

  with Clancey to steal a coat from a parked car.  He denied any involvement in 
  the robbery and killing of Dr. Warrick.  He also denied that he had a pipe in 
  his possession.  He insisted that he was under the influence of drugs and had

  condominium building on their way to the garage.  They encountered a woman on 
  the elevator.  As she stepped out of the elevator, Clancey turned to Kimberley 
  and told him to wait at the elevator as he was going to “take her out”.  Kimberley 
  thought that Clancey was going to take the woman’s purse.  After Clancey left 
  the elevator and followed the woman, Kimberley took the elevator up a couple 
  of floors to find a place where he could defecate.  He also ingested some cocaine.  
  Kimberley then took the elevator back to the floor where he had left Clancey.  
  When the elevator opened on that floor, Clancey entered and said “come on let’s 
  get out of here, you don’t want to see this”.  Kimberley said he wasn’t sure 
  what had happened and could not see anything unusual outside of the elevator.  
  He testified that he and Clancey left the building, joined Vermillion and returned 
  to the abandoned apartment.  Clancey went through the contents of the purse 
  and in response to a question from Vermillion said that he had “bitch slapped” 
  the victim but had not hurt her.</p>

  led evidence that he had a reputation as a non-violent person and as someone 
  who would not physically abuse women.  The potential value of this evidence 
  was somewhat diminished by other evidence to the effect that he did have a propensity 
  to rob or “rip off” others to support his drug habit.  Kimberley also led evidence 
  that Clancey, by his own admission to others, and by his conduct on other occasions, 
  had demonstrated a propensity to act violently when in need of cocaine.</p>

  (Ont. C.A.), aff’d., [1977] 2 S.C.R. 824, the trial judge held that there was 
  sufficient other evidence connecting Teed to the homicide to open the evidentiary 
  door to the defence claim that Teed and not Kimberley or Clancey had killed 
  Dr. Warrick.  As the Crown does not challenge that ruling on appeal, I can briefly 
  summarize the evidence admitted by the trial judge which connected Teed to the 
  homicide.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> Teed was seen leaving the Sutton Place Hotel, located next to Dr. Warrick’s 
  building, at about 10:30 p.m. on January 27, 1991.  He had consumed many beers 
  and argued with the hotel personnel just before leaving the hotel.</p>

  as Dr. Warrick.  He had tried to contact her by telephone several times during 
  the evening of January 27<sup>th</sup> while he was drinking beer at the Sutton 
  Place Hotel.  Ms. Docherty was not at home.  There was also circumstantial evidence 
  from which it could reasonably be inferred that Teed went to Ms. Docherty’s 
  residence in the building some time before 10:30 p.m. when Ms. Docherty arrived 
  home.  There was also evidence from which it could be reasonably inferred that 
  he knocked on her door at some time after 11:00 p.m. when Ms. Docherty was asleep.  
  Ms. Docherty heard the knock but did not answer the door.</p>

  </span> In addition to the evidence placing Teed at or near the scene of the 
  crime when it occurred, there was evidence that Teed was wearing a new pair 
  of size 10 Nike Air Jordan running shoes on January 27<sup>th</sup>.  He gave 
  those shoes to the son of a friend a few days after January 27<sup>th</sup>.  
  The shoes were never recovered.  </p>

  </span> The trial judge also admitted evidence that Teed had pleaded guilty 
  to the first degree murder of Dawn Chwartacki in British Columbia on November 
  26, 1991.  Ms. Chwartacki was murdered in Abbotsford, British Columbia on April 
  16, 1991.  The trial judge allowed the defence to lead evidence of the plea

  </span> In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge explained the purpose 
  of the evidence of Teed’s plea and conviction on the Chwartacki murder in these 
  words:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Evidence of the plea of guilty and the circumstances that gave rise to 
      the offence admitted by David Teed is offered as evidence of David Teed’s 
      tendency or disposition to or character for violence.  This evidence, either 
      alone or with other evidence, may support an inference that it was David 
      Gordon Teed, not Thomas Clancey nor Craig Kimberley, who unlawfully caused 
      the death of Carolyn Warrick ….</p>

line-height:normal'> [39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The trial judge repeatedly told the jury that the defence was not obliged 
  to prove that Teed had murdered Dr. Warrick.  He made it clear that if the “Teed” 
  evidence left the jury with a reasonable doubt as to Clancey’s involvement in 
  the murder, the jury was required to acquit Clancey.  He gave the same instruction 
  with respect to Kimberley and reminded the jury that they must give separate 
  consideration to the case against each accused.</p>

  </span> As is evident from the jury’s verdict, the “Teed” evidence admitted 
  by the trial judge did not leave the jury with any doubt as to the culpability 
  of the appellants.  The appellants contend, however, that the trial judge erred 
  in refusing to also admit statements made by Mr. Teed in which he admitted killing 
  Dr. Warrick.</p>

  </span> Teed’s statements concerning Dr. Warrick’s killing can be placed into 
  three groups.  The first consists of statements made by Teed while in custody 
  in British Columbia.  These statements were made before and after his testimony 
  at the preliminary inquiry.  They were made primarily to the British Columbia 
  police officers investigating the Chwartacki homicide.  In these statements, 
  which I will refer to as the British Columbia statements, Teed admits killing 
  Dr. Warrick.  His description of the relevant events changes, however, in the 
  course of these various statements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second group consists of statements made by Teed to Toronto police 
  officers.  These statements were made when Teed was being brought from British 
  Columbia to Toronto to testify at the preliminary inquiry and while he was incarcerated 
  in Toronto during the preliminary inquiry.  I will refer to these as the Toronto 
  statements.  In these statements Teed recants his earlier admissions which he 
  describes as “lies”.  Teed makes various statements concerning his knowledge 
  of the Warrick homicide.  At one time he says he saw the murder and was involved 
  in it.  He later states that he was not involved in the murder but spoke to 
  Clancey in downtown Toronto shortly afterwards and that Clancey admitted the 
  killing.  Still later, Teed says he was a witness to the murder of Dr. Warrick 
  and that she was murdered by two people.  In the Toronto statements Teed provided 
  various reasons for falsely admitting to the British Columbia investigators 
  that he killed Dr. Warrick.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The third category of Teed’s statements consists of those made by him 
  during the 16 days he testified at the preliminary inquiry.  Teed’s testimony 
  at the preliminary inquiry was remarkable for its inconsistency.  He was a very 
  difficult witness with no apparent regard for the obligation to tell the truth.  
  At one point in the preliminary inquiry after Teed had been testifying for several 
  days, counsel for Clancey observed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>We have already been a long time with this witness and I am trying to keep 
      it from going another two weeks on the stand with this one witness.  The 
      more stories we get, the more he is going to have to be cross-examined on.  
      <u>And while he is patently unreliable</u>, I think it’s an unusual enough 
      situation, Your Honour, that there should be some restrictions placed on 
      him and he should be forced to be more responsive to the questions that 
      are being asked …</p>
    <p>Your Honour will recall that I basically put a theory to this witness earlier 
      in his testimony, to the effect that <u>Mr. Teed appears to me to be an 
      individual who will say anything, at any time, for any reason, mostly on 
      whim, in order to assume some control of the situation and in order to try 
      and influence other people to follow up and investigate.  To use the vernacular, 
      Your Honour, I think he is trying to jerk us around.</u>  This other story 
      that he is bursting to tell us is just another attempt at sending us on 
      further red herrings, down the road, after other endless chases, after ridiculous 
      evidence that has no semblance, or bearing whatsoever to reality…[emphasis 
      added]</p>

line-height:normal'> [45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is difficult to provide a comprehensive and comprehensible summary 
  of Teed’s evidence at the preliminary inquiry.  Initially, in response to questions 
  from the Crown, Teed described his whereabouts on January 27<sup>th </sup>without 
  any reference to Dr. Warrick’s homicide and readily acknowledged that he had 
  lied to the police officers in British Columbia about killing her.  A short 
  time later, while still under questioning by Crown counsel, Teed said that he 
  may or may not have killed Dr. Warrick.  On the second day of his testimony, 
  Teed said that he was very drunk on the evening of January 27<sup>th </sup>and 
  although he had no recollection of killing her, he must have done so because 
  he did recall having her purse and blood stains on his clothes when he left 
  her building.  On the afternoon of the second day of his evidence, while still 
  being questioned by Crown counsel, Teed announced that none of what he had said 
  earlier in his testimony was true and that he had not killed Dr. Warrick.  Still 
  later, he testified that he was in the building and came upon Dr. Warrick as 
  she was being assaulted.  On this version he was a witness to the murder.  As 
  this version developed during Teed’s evidence, Teed described an attack by two 
  men, one of whom he identified as Clancey.  Previously, Teed had said he did 
  not know Clancey.  At one point in his evidence, Teed said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now, whether or not there were other witnesses that saw – if there were 
      witnesses that saw me leave the area – come out of the elevator into the 
      front lobby or saw Mr. Clancey and his partner running out of the park, 
      I don’t know.  So I did not want to get caught in a lie either way.  Whether 
      I was to continue on with my lie as to whether I did commit the murder, 
      or I didn’t commit the murder or I have any involvement in the murder, I 
      didn’t want to be caught in a lie either way, because <u>I knew there were 
      two people there.  I know that two people committed the murder.  But, nobody 
      saw that except me. I am the only one that saw that there were two people 
      there with the victim.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'> [46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his testimony Teed gave many different explanations for how he came 
  to know some of the details of the Warrick homicide.  He said that he had heard 
  some of the details while living in the area in the weeks following the homicide.  
  He also said that the officers investigating the Chwartacki homicide had given 
  him some of the details surrounding the Warrick homicide.  According to Teed, 
  those same officers had corrected some of the errors he made when purporting 
  to recount the events surrounding the Warrick homicide.  Teed also said that 
  he had read some of the details in various newspapers and learned further details 
  from talking to newspaper reporters.  Finally, Teed said that he had simply 
  guessed at some of the details.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In his testimony Teed also gave many reasons for falsely admitting to 
  the British Columbia investigators that he had killed Dr. Warrick.  He said 
  he had been promised $1,000 by the defence if he co-operated and produced evidence 
  exculpating the accused.  Teed also said that he had nothing to lose as he knew 
  he would be serving a life sentence for the Chwartacki murder and that in any 
  event, he intended to commit suicide.  Teed also said taking responsibility 
  for the Warrick murder would improve his status in prison and embarrass his 
  mother.  At another stage in his evidence, Teed said that he simply enjoyed 
  “screwing the system”.  Finally, Teed said that he thought the admissions he 
  made concerning the Warrick murder would help him get some of the things he 
  was seeking from the British Columbia investigators, such as a television set 
  for his jail cell.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> At trial the appellants sought to lead evidence of Teed’s British Columbia 
  statements.  They also brought a motion to exclude Teed’s preliminary inquiry 
  testimony, arguing that police misconduct resulted in a breach of the appellant’s 
  constitutional rights and rendered Teed’s preliminary inquiry testimony inadmissible 
  under section 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown did not seek to tender any of Teed’s statements or testimony 
  as part of its case.  It did, however, take the position that if, and only if, 
  the trial judge admitted Teed’s British Columbia statements, he should also 
  admit Teed’s Toronto statements and the preliminary transcript so that the jury 
  would have a “complete picture” of what Teed had said concerning the Warrick 
  homicide.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Near the end of the long argument that followed the lengthy <i>voir 
  dire</i>, counsel for Clancey took the position that if the trial judge would 
  admit the British Columbia statements only if the Toronto statements and the 
  preliminary inquiry testimony were also admitted, then it was counsel’s position 
  that all of the statements should be admitted.  In other words, counsel took 
  the position that he preferred the admission of all of the statements over the 
  exclusion of all of the statements.  While the position taken by counsel for 
  Kimberley is less clear, it is at least arguable that he eventually took that 
  position as well.  At trial Crown counsel objected to what she described as 
  a last minute change of position by the defence.  She argued that counsel’s 
  reply submissions were contrary to the position they had taken throughout the 
  long <i>voir dire</i>.  In his reasons, the trial judge did not refer to counsel’s 
  submission that the admission of all of Teed’s statements was preferable to 
  the exclusion of all of the statements.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> On appeal, counsel for the appellants abandoned the primary position 
  taken at trial.  In their facta, they argued not that the trial judge should 
  have admitted the British Columbia statements standing alone, but that he erred 
  in not admitting those statements and the evidence given by Teed at the preliminary 
  inquiry.  In his oral submissions, counsel for Kimberley went a step further.  
  He submitted that even if the British Columbia statements were inadmissible 
  under any circumstances, the trial judge erred in not admitting Teed’s preliminary 
  inquiry evidence alone.  Counsel for Clancey did not join in this submission.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Crown counsel strenuously argued that it should not be open to the appellants 
  to take either position advanced on appeal as those positions contradicted tactical 
  decisions made at trial.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree in part with Crown counsel’s submission.  During the over two 
  years that passed during the <i>voir dire</i> into the admissibility of Teed’s 
  statements, the appellants never asked the trial judge to admit Teed’s preliminary 
  inquiry testimony on its own.  Throughout the <i>voir dire</i>, the defence 
  argued that the preliminary inquiry evidence was tainted by constitutional misconduct.  
  Nor did Crown counsel ever ask the trial judge to admit the preliminary inquiry 
  testimony standing alone.  It was the Crown’s position that the potential admissibility 
  of the preliminary inquiry evidence became relevant only if the British Columbia 
  statements were admitted.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Clearly, defence counsel at trial saw no advantage to the admission 
  of Teed’s preliminary inquiry testimony standing on its own.  That testimony 
  contained no clear admission by Teed that he had killed Dr. Warrick.  The most 
  benign view of that testimony from the defence perspective was that Teed was 
  a totally unreliable person.  This hardly assisted the defence.  At worst for 
  the defence, the last version of events given by Teed in his testimony was evidence 
  that two men, one of whom was Clancey and the other who looked like Kimberley, 
  were engaged in a joint assault on Dr. Warrick at the time and place where she 
  was eventually killed.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Kimberley’s submission on appeal that the trial judge erred in not admitting 
  the preliminary inquiry testimony on its own amounts to a contention that the 
  trial judge should have made a ruling that he was never asked to make, and that 
  directly conflicted with the position taken by both the Crown and the appellants 
  at trial.  I have no doubt that had the trial judge been so bold as to make 
  such a ruling, it would have constituted the appellants’ first ground of appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> While appellate counsel are not locked into positions taken on behalf 
  of their clients at trial, appeals cannot be conducted without any regard to 
  the conduct of the trial.  To permit counsel to advance a position which was 
  not only not put forward at trial, but which is a direct contradiction of the 
  position advanced at trial, would be to make a mockery of the process.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span>  I do not, however, agree with Crown counsel’s submission that the appellants 
  should not be allowed to argue on appeal that the British Columbia statements 
  along with Teed’s preliminary inquiry testimony should have been admitted.  
  This argument was made at trial, albeit at the eleventh hour.  The Crown has 
  not satisfied me that any prejudice befalls the Crown or the administration 
  of justice by allowing the appellants to make what was a secondary position 
  at trial their primary position on appeal.  The linking of the admissibility 
  of the British Columbia statements to the admission of the preliminary inquiry 
  transcript does not, however, change the fundamental issue to be addressed.  
  Whether alone, or in combination with the preliminary inquiry testimony, the 
  British Columbia statements were admissible only if the appellants could demonstrate 
  that their admission was reasonably necessary and that the statements were sufficiently 
  reliable to justify placing them before the jury.</p>
<p class=headingsubsubtitle> <b>(e)</b>   <b>The Admissibility of Teed’s British 
  Columbia Statements</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The British Columbia statements were tendered for their truth and were 
  hearsay.  Hearsay is normally inadmissible.  At trial, counsel argued that the 
  British Columbia statements were admissible either as declarations made against 
  penal interest by a person who was not available to give evidence, or under 
  the principled approach to the admissibility of hearsay evidence developed by 
  the Supreme Court of Canada in a line of cases beginning with <i>R. v. Khan</i>, 
  [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531.  On appeal, counsel did not rely on the penal interest 
  exception to the rule against the admission of hearsay evidence but focussed 
  exclusively on the necessity/reliability analysis required by the principled 
  approach.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I agree with counsel’s approach to the admissibility of the British 
  Columbia statements.  As Iacobucci J., for the majority, recently said in <i>R. 
  v. Starr</i> (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449 at 534:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Hearsay evidence may only be admitted if it is necessary and reliable, 
      and the traditional exceptions should be interpreted in a manner consistent 
      with this requirement.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The words of Iacobucci J. are particularly apt where the statement against 
  penal interest is the “traditional exception” said to provide a ticket to admissibility.  
  That exception was first recognized in <i>R. v. O’Brien</i> (1977), 35 C.C.C. 
  (2d) 209 (S.C.C.).  Unlike many of the older exceptions it has not congealed 
  into a rule dependent upon the existence of certain predetermined factors.  
  Instead, the exception as recognized in <i>R. v. O’Brien, supra</i>, at p. 216, 
  depends on the existence of sufficient “guarantees of trustworthiness” to warrant 
  the admission of the statement.  The approach to the admissibility of statements 
  against penal interest adopted in <i>R. v. O’Brien, supra</i>, presaged the 
  principled approach to the admissibility of all hearsay developed in later cases 
  by the Supreme Court of Canada.  Whether characterized as a statement against 
  penal interest, or simply viewed as hearsay, the British Columbia statements 
  were admissible only if the appellants established the separate requirements 
  of necessity and reliability:  <i>R. v. Hawkins</i> (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 
  129 at 155 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. U. (F. J.)</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764 at 787.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The necessity inquiry mandated by the principled approach to hearsay 
  is straightforward in this case.  The admission of hearsay evidence is necessary 
  where the declarant is unavailable to testify and the party tendering the hearsay 
  statement is unable to obtain evidence of a similar quality from some other 
  source: <i>R. v. Hawkins, supra</i>, at p. 156.  Teed killed himself prior to 
  trial and was obviously unavailable to testify.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Crown counsel echoing comments made by the trial judge, suggested that 
  Teed’s preliminary inquiry testimony amounted to another source from which Teed’s 
  evidence could be obtained thereby negating the need to admit the British Columbia 
  statements.  There would be considerable merit to this submission if the substance 
  of the British Columbia statements and Teed’s preliminary inquiry testimony 
  were the same.  They were not.  In fact, most of Teed’s preliminary inquiry 
  evidence amounted to a retraction of the admissions he had made in the British 
  Columbia statements and explanations for the lies he told.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> From the appellants’ perspective, the crucial parts of the British Columbia 
  statements were the detailed admissions by Teed concerning Dr. Warrick’s killing.  
  Those admissions could only get before the jury if the British Columbia statements 
  were received into evidence.  In my view, even if Teed were alive, and assuming 
  his position at trial would have been the same as at the preliminary inquiry, 
  the appellants would have made out a case for the necessity of receiving the 
  British Columbia statements: <i>R. v. B. (K.G.)</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 257 
  at 295-6 (S.C.C.).  Teed’s demise only strengthens the need to receive the British 
  Columbia statements.  The necessity criterion is met.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The reliability requirement looks to threshold reliability and not the 
  ultimate truth of the statements tendered.  Hearsay evidence is inherently suspect 
  for many reasons:<i> R. v. B. (K.G.), supra</i>, at pp. 271-272; <i>R. v. Starr, 
  supra</i>, at p. 515.  The threshold reliability inquiry looks to the circumstances 
  in which the out-of-court statements were made to determine whether those circumstances 
  negate or at least ameliorate the dangers inherent in hearsay evidence to the 
  degree that the jury can safely evaluate those statements and determine their 
  ultimate reliability.  In <i>R. v. Hawkins, supra</i>, at p. 157, threshold 
  reliability was described in these terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The criterion of reliability is concerned with threshold reliability, not 
      ultimate reliability.  <u>The function of the trial judge is limited to 
      determining whether the particular hearsay statement exhibits sufficient 
      indicia of reliability so as to afford the trier of fact a satisfactory 
      basis for evaluating the truth of the statement.</u>  More specifically, 
      the judge must identify the specific hearsay dangers raised by the statement, 
      and then determine whether the facts surrounding the utterance of the statement 
      offer sufficient circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness to compensate 
      for those dangers.  The ultimate reliability of the statement and the weight 
      to be attached to it, remain determinations for the trier of fact.  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

  </span> The hearsay dangers presented by Teed’s British Columbia statements 
  run the full gamut of the dangers associated with hearsay evidence.  He was 
  not under oath or any imperative to speak the truth.  The statements were not 
  videotaped so there was no basis upon which a jury could assess Teed’s demeanour 
  and, perhaps more importantly, the interaction between Teed and his questioners.  
  There is nothing approaching a detailed summary, much less a verbatim record, 
  of what was said by Teed and what was said to Teed in these interviews.  Teed 
  insisted that his conversations concerning the Warrick killing should not be 
  recorded.  The only record of what he said consists of brief notes made by the 
  British Columbia investigators some time after the various interviews.  In the 
  absence of anything approaching a full and accurate record of what was said, 
  it is virtually impossible to discern either the contents or the context of 
  Teed’s British Columbia statements.  Finally, Teed was not subject to cross-examination 
  when he made these statements.</p>

  </span> The appellants submit that the dangers outlined above are overcome by 
  the fact that Teed’s British Columbia statements amounted to a confession to 
  a murder made to police officers.  The appellants argue that Teed could fully 
  expect serious penal consequences as a result of the British Columbia statements 
  and that his willingness to make those statements gives them a high degree of 
  reliability.</p>

  </span> The circumstance relied on to establish the reliability of Teed’s British 
  Columbia statements is the same as the rationale driving the penal interest 
  exception to the exclusion of hearsay evidence.  However, as explained in <i>R. 
  v. O’Brien, supra</i>, at pp. 215-16, the rationale only operates where the 
  statement is made in circumstances where the declarant apprehends an immediate 
  vulnerability to penal consequences.  A person who confesses a murder to police 
  officers will usually apprehend that immediate penal consequences will flow 
  from that confession.  Teed was, however, in a very unusual situation.  He fully 
  intended to plead guilty to the Chwartacki homicide knowing that he would be 
  sentenced to life imprisonment.  Any consequences which might flow from his 
  admissions concerning Dr. Warrick would not really alter his future or impose 
  any additional penal consequences: <i>R. v. Demeter</i> (1975), 25 C.C.C. (2d) 
  417 at 440 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d., (1977), 34 C.C.C. (2d) 137 at 139-142 (S.C.C.).</p>

  </span> In my view, Teed apprehended no additional penal consequences flowing 
  from his British Columbia statements.  Consequently, the fact that the statements 
  amounted to confessions to murder made to police officers does not enhance the 
  reliability of those statements.</p>

  </span> In addition to finding that Teed did not apprehend penal consequences 
  as a result of his British Columbia statements because of his intention to plead 
  guilty to the Chwartacki homicide, the trial judge also found that Teed had 
  motives to falsely admit responsibility in the Warrick homicide.  According 
  to the trial judge, Teed was motivated by self-aggrandizement, a desire to manipulate 
  the criminal justice system and a desire to improve his living conditions in 
  the Kent Institution.  The trial judge said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>While most would consider confessing to a crime that carried a minimum 
      punishment of imprisonment for life decidedly against their interests, it 
      was of not great moment to David Teed who wanted to spend the rest of his 
      life in prison, and did.  </p>

  </span> I accept the trial judge’s finding that Teed had reasons to falsely 
  confess to the Warrick homicide.  Those motives to lie rendered the British 
  Columbia statements all the more unreliable:  <i>R. v. Starr, supra</i>, at 
  pp. 534-35; <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 257 at 272-73 (S.C.C.).</p>

  </span> The trial judge’s finding that the British Columbia statements were 
  not against Teed’s interests as he perceived them, but rather, promoted those 
  interests, and that Teed had motives to falsely confess to Dr. Warrick’s killing 
  combined with the absence of any circumstance that would counter the hearsay 
  dangers inherent in Teed’s statements, compel the finding that the appellants 
  did not demonstrate threshold reliability.  </p>

  </span> While I could stop the analysis here, there are additional factors referred 
  to by the trial judge and the Crown in argument that warrant some reference.  
  As indicated above, the statements were not recorded when made.  The absence 
  of any video or even audio recording of the statements creates the reliability 
  problems that I have referred to above.  In this case, however, the statements 
  were not recorded because Teed insisted that they not be recorded.  It is obvious 
  that Teed did not want a record of what he said to the British Columbia police 
  concerning the Warrick homicide.  His insistence that there be no record of 
  those statements further undermines their reliability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Teed’s various statements concerning the details surrounding the killing 
  of Dr. Warrick were inconsistent in some material particulars.  Inconsistency 
  in itself may be some indicator of unreliability.  More important to me is Teed’s 
  reaction when confronted with apparent inconsistencies between his statements 
  and the actual circumstances surrounding the killing.  For example, Teed initially 
  told the British Columbia police that after he murdered Dr. Warrick, he left 
  the building through the lobby.  The physical evidence made it clear, however, 
  that whoever killed Dr. Warrick left through the garage.  When the British Columbia 
  police (contrary to the instructions of the Toronto police) advised Teed that 
  the killer had left through the garage, Teed simply changed his story and indicated 
  that he had left through the garage.  Teed’s reaction to the apparent inaccuracies 
  in his statements hardly inspires confidence in their reliability.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is also significant in my mind that although Teed had willingly discussed 
  the details of the Warrick homicide with the British Columbia investigators 
  on many occasions, he refused to discuss the details with the Toronto police 
  when they travelled to British Columbia in August 1991.  The Toronto police, 
  unlike their British Columbia counterparts, knew the details of the Warrick 
  homicide.  Teed was not prepared to discuss the details with those who were 
  in a position to make an informed assessment of the truth of Teed’s statements.  
  This circumstance, like the others outlined above, heightens reliability concerns.

  </span> The appellants submit that Teed’s testimony at the preliminary inquiry 
  overcomes any reliability concerns inherent in the circumstances in which the 
  British Columbia statements were made.  As I understand the submission, counsel 
  argue that the opportunity at the preliminary inquiry to cross-examine Teed 
  on any statements he made in British Columbia overcomes the hearsay dangers 
  inherent in the statements themselves.  This argument misunderstands the nature 
  of the threshold reliability inquiry.  As Iacobucci J. said in <i>R. v. Starr, 
  supra,</i> at p. 535:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><u>At the stage of hearsay admissibility, the trial judge should not consider 
      the declarant’s general reputation for truthfulness, nor any prior or subsequent 
      statements, consistent or not.  These factors do not concern the circumstances 
      of the statement itself.</u>  Similarly, I would not consider the presence 
      of collaborating or conflicting evidence… .</p>
    <p>In summary, under the principled approach, a court must not invade the 
      province of the trier of fact and condition admissibility of hearsay on 
      whether the evidence is ultimately reliable.  However, it will need to examine 
      whether the circumstances in which the statement was made lend sufficient 
      credibility to allow a finding of threshold reliability.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

  </span> The circumstances attendant upon Teed’s preliminary inquiry testimony, 
  including the opportunity to cross-examine him, are relevant to the threshold 
  reliability of statements he made at the preliminary inquiry, but can have no 
  impact on the threshold reliability of what he said in British Columbia.  It 
  may be (and I stress may) that the circumstances surrounding Teed’s preliminary 
  inquiry testimony were such as to render what he said about the British Columbia 
  statements in his testimony sufficiently reliable to warrant admissibility.  
  It does not, however, follow that the statements themselves are sufficiently 
  reliable to warrant their admissibility.  The distinction is crucial in this 
  case since Teed did not adopt his British Columbia statements in his testimony.  
  To the contrary, he effectively recanted them.</p>

  </span> The appellants rely on <i>R. v. Hawkins, supra</i>, in support of their 
  submission.  I do not think this case helps.  In <i>Hawkins, supra</i>, a declarant 
  had testified at the preliminary inquiry.  She gave two conflicting versions 
  of many of the relevant events.  At trial, the Crown sought to introduce the 
  declarant’s testimony from the preliminary inquiry.  The court held that the 
  preliminary inquiry testimony met the threshold reliability requirement particularly 
  as the declarant was available as a witness for the defence (but not the Crown) 
  at trial.  <i>R. v. Hawkins, supra</i>, would have relevance had the trial judge 
  been asked to admit Teed’s preliminary inquiry evidence.  It offers no support, 
  however, for the appellants’ contention that reliability considerations applicable 
  to evidence given at a preliminary inquiry can somehow render statements made 
  prior to the preliminary inquiry sufficiently reliable to justify their admission 
  into evidence.</p>

  </span> Counsel for Kimberley also argued that Teed’s preliminary inquiry evidence 
  would have no meaning unless the British Columbia statements were also admitted.  
  Counsel for Kimberley was invited to demonstrate the validity of this submission 
  by reference to any part of the preliminary inquiry transcript.  He was unable 
  to do so.  I am certainly not prepared to accept this submission on faith.  
  In any event, even if there was some merit to this contention, it does not enhance 
  the reliability of the British Columbia statements.  If anything, it would be 
  an argument against admitting the preliminary inquiry testimony on its own.</p>

  </span> The appellants also argued that where hearsay evidence is tendered by 
  an accused, the court should take a more relaxed view of the prerequisites to 
  admissibility.  It is well established that although the rules of evidence generally 
  apply equally to the Crown and defence, a trial judge can relax those rules 
  in favour of the defence where it is necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice: 
  <i>R. v. Williams</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 356 at 372, 378 (Ont. C.A.); <i>R. 
  v. Finta</i> (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 65 at 200-203 (Ont. C.A.), aff’d. (1994), 
  88 C.C.C. (3d) 417 at 527-28 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Folland</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. 
  (3d) 14 at 31-32 (Ont. C.A.).  Those cases do not, however, invite an abandonment 
  of the threshold reliability inquiry where hearsay evidence is tendered by the 
  defence.  As Martin J.A. said in <i>R. v. Williams, supra</i>, at p. 378:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>…  It seems to me that a court has a residual discretion to relax in favour 
      of the accused a strict rule of evidence <u>where it is necessary to prevent 
      a miscarriage of justice and where the danger against which an exculpatory 
      rule aims to safeguard does not exist. </u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>

line-height:normal'> [81]<span

  </span> Where hearsay evidence cannot pass the threshold reliability standard, 
  the “danger” which justifies the exclusionary rule is very much in existence.  
  What the cases referred to above do recognize is that fairness concerns may 
  sometimes militate in favour of admitting defence evidence.  These concerns 
  may tip the reliability/necessity analysis in favour of the accused.  Fairness 
  concerns could not assist the Crown were it to tender the same evidence:  <i>R. 
  v. Finta, supra</i>;  <i>R. v. Folland, supra</i>.  Similarly, due process concerns, 
  particularly the concern that an accused have a full opportunity to confront 
  inculpatory evidence presented against that accused, may operate against admitting 
  hearsay evidence tendered by the Crown.  That concern would not have any relevance 
  if the same evidence was tendered by an accused.</p>

  </span> The kinds of concerns which can lead a court to admit hearsay evidence 
  tendered by the defence when the same evidence would not be admitted if tendered 
  by the Crown do not operate here.  The appellants have failed to demonstrate 
  that the circumstances surrounding the making of the British Columbia statements 
  by Teed offer any basis for a finding that those statements are sufficiently 
  reliable to warrant their admissibility.  The admission of evidence of such 
  inherently unreliable statements would hardly prevent a miscarriage of justice.  
  Indeed, it could occasion a miscarriage of justice.</p>

    <p>What is meant by “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”?  As I told you earlier, 
      it has been said that the term explains itself.  It is achieved when you, 
      as jurors, feel sure of the guilt of an accused.  It is that degree of proof 
      which convinces the mind and satisfies the conscience so you, as conscientious 
      jurors, feel bound or impelled to act upon it.  You must be able to say 
      to yourselves, “he is really guilty.  Of that I am morally certain.”  I 
      said morally certain, not mathematically certain.  You must feel sure of 
      his guilt before finding guilt in respect of any accused in relation to 
      any offence.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, should the evidence which you have heard leave you, 
      as a responsible juror, with some lingering or nagging doubt with respect 
      to the proof of some essential element of the offence with which the accused 
      are charged, first degree murder, or any offence which is included in it, 
      so you are unable to say to yourself in respect of that accused in relation 
      to that offence that the case has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, 
      your duty is then to find that accused <u>not guilty</u> in relation to 
      that offence.</p>
    <p>The doubt, I emphasize, members of the jury, must be reasonable doubt based 
      on the evidence that you have heard in this case.  It must <u>not</u> be 
      a speculative, fanciful, imaginary, illusory doubt, conjured up in the mind 
      of a timid juror so he or she may avoid his or her plain duty or responsibility.  
      It must be, as well, with regard to an essential element of the crime, <u>not</u> 
      in respect of some unessential matter.  It must <u>not</u> be a doubt born 
      of sympathy for nor prejudice against either the accused or the deceased.  
      In other words, it must be a reasonable doubt, founded upon the evidence, 
      neither speculative, fanciful, illusory, imaginary, born of sympathy nor 
      animated by prejudice.</p>

  was part of the violence used to effect the robbery of Dr. Warrick.  They argued 
  that as Parliament has chosen not to add robbery to the offences in s.&nbsp;231(5), 
  it cannot have intended that a confinement which occurs during a robbery and 
  in furtherance of a robbery should trigger liability for first degree murder 
  under s.&nbsp;231(5)(e).  It is the appellants’ position that there was no evidence 
  of confinement that did not form part of the robbery of Dr.&nbsp;Warrick and 
  that the trial judge should have acceded to their motion for a directed verdict 
  on the first degree murder charge.</p>

  (3d) 272 (B.C.C.A.).  In that case, the deceased was killed in the course of 
  a home invasion.  The deceased had been tied up in the bedroom but got free 
  and came into the living room to help a family member.  He was stabbed to death 
  in the melee which followed.  On these facts the trial judge told the jury that 
  the appellant could not be convicted of first degree murder under s.&nbsp;214(5) 
  [now s.&nbsp;231(5)] if the confinement of the victim was incidental to the 
  robbery or for the purpose of facilitating escape after the robbery.</p>

  at p.&nbsp;279:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>… Nothing is expressed or implied in those sections about the purpose of 
      the confinement.  Neither is there anything in the history of the legislation 
      to suggest a limitation of that nature to be placed upon the word “confinement”.  
      The interpretation that confinement for the one purpose of robbery is excluded 
      cannot be supported.  I think the jury should have been instructed that, 
      if they decided that Gourgon did murder the victim, that murder was first 
      degree murder if the jury also found that the victim’s death was caused 
      by Gourgon while he was confining or attempting to confine any one or more

  and property rights of the person.  The organizing principle of s.&nbsp;231(5) 
  is the recognition that murders committed in the course of the unlawful domination 
  of the victim are particularly blameworthy, and those who commit such murders 
  are deserving of the greater punishment imposed for first degree murder: <i>R. 
  v. Luxton</i>, <i>supra</i>, at pp. 458-59.  To the extent that the crime of 
  robbery addresses property rights, its inclusion in s.&nbsp;231(5) would be 
  inconsistent with the underlying rationale of that section.  However, to the 
  extent that a particular robbery involves a crime of domination enumerated in 
  s.&nbsp;231(5), I see no reason why the murder which occurs in the course of 
  that robbery becomes less blameworthy because the crime of domination was motivated

  The references to the charge contain no suggestion that a forcible confinement 
  incidental to robbery was not included in s. 231(5)(e).  Nor is anything said 
  by the Chief Justice in upholding the constitutionality of the section consistent 
  with the argument advanced by the appellants.  Three passages from the Chief 
  Justice’s reasons are germane:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>… Murders that are done while committing offences which involve the illegal 
      domination of the victim by the offender have been classified as first degree 
      murder.  Forcible confinement is one of those offences involving illegal 
      domination.  <u>The added element of forcible confinement in the context 
      of the commission of a murder markedly enhances the moral blameworthiness 
      of the offender</u>.  Indeed, forcible confinement is punishable by up to 
      ten years in prison. … (p.&nbsp;458)</p>
    <p>. . .</p>
    <p>… <u>Where the act causing death and the acts constituting the forcible 
      confinement all form part of one continuous sequence of events forming a 
      single transaction the death is caused “while committing”</u> an offence 
      for the purposes of 214(5) [citation omitted].  To commit the underlying 
      offence of forcible confinement, the offender must use “physical restraint 
      contrary to the wishes of the person restrained but to which the victim 
      submits unwillingly thereby depriving the person of his or her liberty to 
      move from one place to another”.</p>
    <p>. . .</p>
    <p>… Further, the policy decision of Parliament to classify these murders 
      as first degree murders accords with the broader objectives of a sentencing 
      scheme.  <u>The elevation of murder while committing a forcible confinement 
      to first degree reflects a societal denunciation of those offenders who 
      choose to exploit their position of dominance and power to the point of 
      murder</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>R. 
  v. Luxton</i>, <i>supra</i>, makes it clear that if in the course of a continuous 
  sequence of events an accused commits the crime of unlawful confinement and 
  chooses to exploit the position of dominance over the victim resulting from 
  that confinement to murder the victim, then the accused has committed first 
  degree murder as defined in s.&nbsp;231(5)(e).  The purpose of the confinement 
  is not relevant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While 
  I would reject the contention that unlawful confinements in the course of a 
  robbery cannot provide the basis for liability under s. 231(5)(e), I do accept 
  that a confinement which is inherent in the very act of killing could not be 
  relied on to impose liability under s. 231(5)(e).  This is not because there 
  is no confinement, but because s. 231(5)(e) requires two discrete criminal acts, 
  a killing that amounts to murder and a confinement that is unlawful.  It is 
  the occurrence of the two criminal acts in the course of the same transaction 
  or series of events that justifies the added punishment imposed for first degree 
  murder.  Thus, for example, if, with the requisite intent for murder, the appellants 
  had struck and killed Dr. Warrick as she left the elevator and then took her 
  purse, there would be no basis upon which the appellants could be convicted 
  of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e).  On this example, the act of confinement 
  and the act of killing are one and the same.  Where, however, there is a confinement 
  and then in the course of the same series of events, the victim is murdered 
  while under the unlawful domination of the killer, the rationale underlying 
  s. 231(5)(e) is fully engaged.  There is not only a murder, but there is a murder 
  of a person under the domination of the attacker.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> On 
  the evidence, the appellants restrained Dr.&nbsp;Warrick as she left the elevator.  
  They physically disabled her and dragged her some twenty-seven feet to the end 
  of the ramp.  They then exploited their position of dominance, not just by taking 
  her money, but by also taking her life.  They did so with one of the mental 
  states required for murder as defined in s.&nbsp;229.  I have no difficulty 
  concluding that their conduct fits easily within the definition of unlawful 
  confinement and falls four square within the kind of conduct Parliament sought 
  to denounce by elevating certain murders to the status of first degree murder.

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'> [110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For 
  completeness’ sake I would add that even on the approach favoured in <i>R. v. 
  Strong</i>, <i>supra</i>, there was ample evidence of an unlawful confinement 
  of Dr.&nbsp;Warrick beyond the transitory restraint inherent in the violence 
  of the robbery perpetrated against her.  On the physical evidence it seems clear 
  that Dr.&nbsp;Warrick was rendered unconscious by the blows administered at 
  the elevator door.  She was helpless to resist any robbery.  The confinement 
  and the attack, however, continued.  As Taylor&nbsp;J.A. said in <i>R. v. Peer</i>, 
  <i>supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;256:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The murder of persons already in this manner rendered helpless should, 
      in my view, be taken to be within the intent of Parliament in enacting s.&nbsp;231(5)(e) 
      — that is to say, the murder of persons who have previously been deprived 
      of mobility and placed in an unnatural and helpless position so as to be 
      subject to the will of their captors.  Such confinement, as I have said, 
      clearly went well beyond that necessarily involved in robbery….</p>

  appellants’ complaint that the jury was not properly instructed on the ambit 
  of s.&nbsp;231(5)(e) rests mainly on the assertion that the trial judge erred 
  in instructing the jury that confinement incidental to a robbery could suffice 
  for the purposes of s.&nbsp;231(5)(e).  For the reasons set out above I do not 
  accept this submission.</p>

  trial judge properly defined unlawful confinement.  He made it clear to the 
  jury that the act of unlawful confinement was distinct from the act of killing 
  and that both had to occur in the context of the same sequence of events.  He 
  repeatedly referred to the confinement requirement and the murder requirement 
  as two separate elements of the offence of first degree murder as defined in 
  s.&nbsp;231(5)(e).  His further instruction that the confinement “must be for 
  some appreciable time” would further dispel any possibility that the jury would 
  make a finding of confinement based only on the restraint produced by the blows 
  that caused Dr.&nbsp;Warrick’s death.  In my view, the charge adequately captured 
  the essence of s.&nbsp;231(5)(e) as explained in <i>R. v. Luxton</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
