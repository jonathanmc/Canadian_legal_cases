  </span> On January 31, 1998, Shirley Stoesser was seriously injured in a motorcycle 
  accident while on vacation in Florida. Pursuant to her out-of-province emergency 
  medical insurance policy, her insurer, Canada Life Assurance Company (Canada 
  Life) paid $392,523.77 Cdn for the medical treatment she received in Florida. 
  The question in this appeal is whether Canada Life can assert a subrogated claim 
  for this amount against Kingsway General Insurance Company (Kingsway) the 
  insurer of the driver said to be responsible for the accident.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Spence J. held that Canada Life has no such right because of the terms 
  of its policy. For the reasons that follow, I agree.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>FACTS</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The relevant facts are essentially undisputed. Shirley Stoesser and 
  her husband, Ronald Stoesser were residents of Ontario. Prior to leaving on 
  vacation for Florida in the winter of 1998, they purchased an emergency hospital/medical 
  travel insurance policy from Canada Life, an insurance company incorporated 
  pursuant to the laws of Canada, with its head office in Toronto. The policy 
  was issued in Ontario and provided coverage for emergency hospitalization or 
  medical treatment required while travelling outside the insureds province of 
  ordinary residence.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Central to this appeal are two provisions found in the general conditions 
  of that policy. They are as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>8.3            Subrogation  If the Insured Person shall acquire any right 
      of action against any person, firm or organization for loss covered hereunder, 
      the Insured Person shall, if requested by the Company, assign and transfer 
      such a claim or right of action to the Company and will permit suit to be 
      brought in the Insured Persons name under the direction and expense of 
      the Company. The Insured Person shall do nothing after a loss to prejudice 
      such rights.</p>
    <p>8.4            If any of the terms or conditions of this policy are in 
      conflict with the statutes of the province or territory wherein this policy 
      is issued the terms and conditions are hereby amended to conform to such 
      statutes.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The accident on January 31, 1998 occurred when the motorcycle driven 
  by Ronald Stoesser went off the road in Florida   Mr. Stoesser was killed in 
  the accident and Shirley Stoesser, his passenger on the motorcycle, was seriously 
  injured. Before returning to Canada she required extensive medical treatment 
  in Florida, which was paid for by Canada Life pursuant to the travel insurance 
  policy.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The motorcycle was registered in Ontario and was insured under a policy 
  issued in Ontario by Kingsway.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Canada Life notified Kingsway of its intention to make a subrogated 
  claim against Kingsway, as Ronald Stoessers insurer, for the payment of Shirley 
  Stoessers medical expenses. Canada Lifes position was that Ronald Stoesser 
  was at fault in the accident. However, before Canada Life commenced proceedings, 
  Kingsway launched an application to determine whether Canada Life could assert 
  this right of subrogation, and stand in the shoes of its insured Shirley Stoesser.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The application was heard by Spence J. In addition to these facts, Spence 
  J. received an expert opinion tendered on behalf of Canada Life on a number 
  of aspects of Florida law. The opinion noted that Florida has long recognized 
  the subrogation rights of an insurer to recover payments made to an insured 
  for injuries caused to the insured by a tortfeasor. However, the opinion also 
  makes clear that in construing restrictions in an insurance policy a Florida 
  court would look to Canadian statutory and common law where the policy in question 
  was issued in Canada. Spence J. concluded that Canada Life was not entitled 
  to assert a subrogated claim in respect of the medical expenses which it had 
  paid on behalf of Shirley Stoesser. He found that the issue was not one to be 
  determined by the Florida law before him, but by an interpretation of the Canada 
  Life policy, particularly paragraphs 8.3 and 8.4. He determined that the provision 
  for subrogation in paragraph 8.3 conflicted with s. 267.8(17) of the <i>Insurance 
  Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, which excludes the right of subrogation for the 
  payment of health care expenses. As a result, paragraph 8.4 required the Canada 
  Life policy to be read as excluding the right of subrogation sought by Canada 
  Life. He therefore allowed the Kingsway application.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Analysis</b></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In this court, Canada Life raised two issues in argument. First, it 
  said that Spence&nbsp;J. erred in failing to find that, as the law of the place 
  where the accident occurred, the law of Florida applied, thus permitting the 
  insurer the right of subrogation to recover the payments made on behalf of its 
  insured. Second, it argued that Spence J. erred in according any benefit to 
  Kingsway pursuant to the Canada Life insurance policy since Kingsway was not 
  a party to that policy. I will deal with each of these in turn.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In arguing for the applicability of Florida law to determine whether 
  Canada Life has a right of subrogation the appellant relied on the jurisprudence 
  exemplified by <i>Tolofson v. Jensen, </i>[1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022. In that case 
  La Forest J. for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada held that the rule 
  of private international law that should generally be applied in torts is the 
  law of the place where the accident occurred. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In my view, it does not follow from this that because the accident in 
  this case happened in Florida, Florida law is applied to determine whether Canada 
  Life has a right of subrogation. It may be that the determination of whether 
  the driver of the motorcycle was at fault for the accident is to be determined 
  according to Florida law.  However, the right of Canada Life to subrogate to 
  the position of its insured depends not on tort law but on its contract with 
  its insured. The question is whether Canada Life has contracted away its right 
  of subrogation in the circumstances of this case. That question is one of contract 
  law not tort law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I do not think there is any doubt that the policy issued by Canada Life 
  must be interpreted according to Ontario law, not Florida law. The policy was 
  issued to residents of Ontario by a Canadian company headquartered in Ontario. 
  The clear implication of paragraph 8.4 is that the policy is to conform to the 
  statutes of Ontario. There is no suggestion in the language of the policy that 
  it is to be interpreted according to Florida law. Hence I think Spence J. was 
  correct in concluding that the evidence of Florida law tendered before him was 
  not relevant to his task of interpreting the contract between Canada life and 
  its insured Shirley Stoesser. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, I think Spence J. was correct in finding that this contract 
  precluded Canada Lifes right of subrogation in the circumstances of this case. 
  I have reached this conclusion as follows.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It is not disputed that the payment by Canada Life of Shirley Stoessers 
  Florida medical bill comes within the scope of health care expenses described 
  in s. 267.8(4) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>. It is, of course, this payment which 
  Canada Life says accords it a right of subrogation.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> However, s. 267.8(17) makes clear that a person making such a payment 
  on behalf of another person has no right of subrogation in respect of that payment. 
  This subsection reads as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Limitation on subrogation</p>
    <p> (17)            A person who has made a payment described in subsection 
      (1), (4) or (6) is not subrogated to a right of recovery of the insured 
      against another person in respect of that payment.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Moreover, s. 267.4 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> makes clear that these 
  provisions apply to damage claims for bodily injury arising from the use of 
  an automobile in Canada or the United States.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These three statutory provisions of the province where the Canada Life 
  policy was issued, when read together, provide no right of subrogation in respect 
  of  the payment made by Canada Life on behalf of its insured Shirley Stoesser. 
  They are in conflict with the right of subrogation provided in paragraph 8.3 
  of the Canada Life policy. Paragraph 8.4 of the policy therefore requires that 
  the policy be amended to conform to this legislation. The policy therefore must 
  be interpreted to provide that Canada Life has no right of subrogation in respect 
  of this payment.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The second issue advanced by the appellant is that even if the Canada 
  Life policy, properly interpreted, provides that the insurer has no right of 
  subrogation, Kingsway and its insured (the alleged tortfeasor) cannot take the

  </span> I disagree. I think the principles enunciated in <i>Fraser River Pile 
  &amp; Dredge Ltd. v. Can-Dive Services Ltd.,</i> [1999] 3 S.C.R. 108 are a full 
  answer to this argument. </p>

  </span> That case establishes that a third party can claim the benefit of a 
  waiver of subrogation clause in a contract to which it is not a party if the 
  contracting parties intended to extend the benefit to the third party and if 
  the activities of the third party are those contemplated as coming within the 
  scope of that clause.</p>

  </span> Both factors exist here. The Canada Life policy provides no right of 
  subrogation to the insureds right of recovery in an action in respect of health 
  care expenses arising from the use of an automobile. This must have reference 
  to proceedings against third parties (and their insurers) who are alleged to 
  have necessitated the expenses incurred by the insured. The policy must also 
  encompass claims for such expenses based on the alleged tortious activities 
  of those third parties. The parties to the Canada Life policy must therefore 
  have intended to extend the benefit of the waiver of subrogation clause to third 
  parties in the position of the alleged tortfeasor Ronald Stoesser and his insurer, 
  Kingsway.</p>

  </span> I would therefore dismiss the appeal with costs.</p>
