  appeal from the convictions by Justice Barry Matheson, sitting with a jury,

lang=EN-GB>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant, Joseph Kocsis, was convicted of two offences, 
  possession of explosive substances with intent to enable another person to endanger 
  life or to cause serious damage to property and conspiracy to commit the same 
  offence, following a jury trial presided over by Justice B. Matheson.  He was 
  sentenced to five years imprisonment on each count, to be served concurrently.  
  The appellant appeals against his convictions.  He also seeks leave to appeal 
  his sentence and, should leave be granted, appeals his sentence.  The principal 
  ground on the conviction appeal is that the trial judge did not properly charge 
  the jury on the crucial issue of possession.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Crown alleged that, in the context of a year-long police 
  undercover operation, the appellant was identified as the main supplier of a 
  large number of pipe bombs.  The chief Crown witness was an alleged confederate 
  of the appellant, Michael DeSantis, who testified that the appellant was directly 
  involved in the supply and delivery of the pipe bombs.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant denied any involvement with the pipe bombs.  He 
  testified that he regularly purchased cocaine from DeSantis.  On the critical 
  day, DeSantis drove the appellant to an abandoned farm house owned by the appellant’s 
  family in order to complete a cocaine transaction.  DeSantis had been in the 
  house as he was doing some drywalling there.  When they arrived at the farm 
  house, DeSantis lifted a blanket in the back of the truck and said there were 
  bombs in there.  The appellant testified that he told DeSantis to get off the 
  property.  After arguing and yelling, DeSantis drove the appellant back to Prudhommes 
  Landing Mall with the pipe bombs still inside the truck.  At the mall, the appellant 
  got out of the truck and departed.  The sale of the pipe bombs to undercover 
  police officers proceeded, but not in the presence of the appellant.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The principal issue at trial was whether the appellant possessed 
  the pipe bombs.  The Crown’s main contention was that the appellant was deeply 
  involved, with others, in the criminal enterprise and that he was in actual 
  possession of the pipe bombs.  However, Crown counsel did not limit his case 
  to actual possession.  In his closing address, Crown counsel said:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The first point that I wish to raise concerns the definition of possession.  
      The <i>Criminal Code </i>defines possession in a number of different ways.  
      A person can have possession of something when they’re holding it in their 
      hands or have it in their pocket.  That’s actual possession.  Or a person 
      may have it in possession of another person.  For example, if I give something 
      to a friend to keep for me, I’m still in possession of it.  A person can 
      have possession of something when they hold it in a place.  For example, 
      if I put something in a barn and it’s held there for me or left at a friend’s 
      place and <i>finally if one of two or more people has possession of something 
      and they each know and consent to that possession, then the possession will 
      be deemed on all of them</i>.  My point is, is that Joseph Kocsis had been 
      charged with possession of these bombs so even if you are unsure on the 
      evidence whether he actually physically handled the bombs on the 31<sup>st</sup> 
      of January, you can still find that he is in possession of the bombs if, 
      for example, you find that DeSantis was keeping them for him, waiting until 
      he got paid the money or you can find him in possession of the bombs if 
      you find that he had them at a certain place.  For example, 4131 Greenlane<i> 
      or if Desantis or anybody else had them and Joe Kocsis knew about it and 
      consented to that particular possession, then you can find him in possession.  
      I am suggesting to you, members of the jury, that the evidence will show 
      that he was in possession of those bombs in all those three ways.</i>  [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In addition, in the pre-charge discussion, Crown 
  counsel submitted that the trial judge should instruct the jury on all of the 
  components of the definition of possession in s. 4(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>There would have to be a charge with respect to a possession, since the 
      possession in this particular case is not a possession of actual physical 
      possession, save and except for that perhaps one reference by Mr. DeSantis.  
      But I would respectfully submit that all four parts of the possession section 
      of the <i>Code</i>, s. 4.3 would apply here.</p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Near the beginning of his charge, the trial 
  judge read s. 4(3) of the <i>Code</i> to the jury:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>S. (4)(3) </b><span lang=EN-US>For the purposes of the Act,</span></p>
    <p><b><i>(a) </i></b><span
lang=EN-US>a person has anything in possession when he has it in his personal

      </span></span></b> <span lang=EN-US>has it in the actual possession or custody 
      of another person, or</span></p>
    <p><b>(ii) </b><span lang=EN-US>has it in any place, whether or not that place 
      belongs to or is occupied by him, for the use or benefit of himself or of 
      another person; and</span></p>
    <p> <b><i><span
lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span></span></i></b> 
      <span
lang=EN-US>where one of two or more persons, with the knowledge and consent of 
      the rest, has anything in his custody or possession, it shall be deemed 
      to be in the custody and possession of each and all of them.</span></p>

lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> During a recess, defence counsel mentioned that the trial judged 
  had failed to instruct the jury on the definition of possession, specifically 
  the three ingredients of knowledge, consent and control.  The trial judge acknowledged 
  this point and later in his charge returned to the definition of possession.  
  He read s. 4(3) of the <i>Code</i> to the jury again and added the following 
  comment:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>In order to have possession you must have knowledge of 
      the object that you are alleged to have possession of; you must have the 
      intent to have that possession and you must have consented to have that 
      possession.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Following a further recess and prior to the 
  return of the jury, defence counsel repeated his concerns regarding the instruction 
  on possession:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>MR. WALKER: . . . With regard to your definition of possession you did 
      not mention control at all.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: Okay.  I will do that again.</p>

</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Upon resuming, the trial judge gave a further 
  instruction regarding possession:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>With respect to the question of possession – remember 
      I gave you the definition, which I won’t repeat, but in order for an individual 
      to have possession they must have knowledge, control, either directly or 
      indirectly, and have the intent.</span></p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> After several hours of deliberation, the jury posed a question 
  about the legal definition of possession.  The trial judge and defence counsel 
  engaged in this exchange relating to how the jury’s question should be answered:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>THE COURT: Could I see the question, please.  As I indicated, the jury 
      would like the legal definition of the word, “possession” so I’ll read from 
      the <i>Code</i> and also the personal possession aspect of control, etcetera.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: Well, Your Honour, with respect, uhh, your earlier charge on 
      possession, the definition of possession itself verses the various ways 
      one can be in possession.  I would submit you’ve got to indicate to the 
      jury there was knowledge of what the object is, consent to the object being 
      there. . .</p>
    <p>THE COURT: Mmhmm.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: . . .and there must be some element or some degree of control 
      exercised over the object.  And if you don’t have all three co-existing 
      then you don’t have possession.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: I think as far as personal is concerned.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: That’s right, but you’re still. . . </p>
    <p>THE COURT: I hear that, sir.  Here’s what I am intending to do.  Personal 
      possession: The Crown must prove three things in order to prove personal 
      possession.  First, that Joseph Kocsis had actual physical possession of 
      the property.  Second, that Mr. Kocsis knew that he had actual physical 
      possession of the property.  And third, that he exerted control over while 
      he had possession, actual possession, physical possession.  For the personal 
      aspect of it.</p>
    <p><span> </span>Call the jury, please. </p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>When the jury returned, the trial judge again 
  read s. 4(3) of the <i>Code</i> and continued:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Now with respect  to personal possession the Crown must prove three things 
      in order to prove personal possession.  First, that Joseph Kocsis had actual 
      physical possession of in this case, 74 pipe bombs on the 31<sup>st</sup> 
      or one on the 29<sup>th</sup>.</p>
    <p><span

  </span></span> When the jury retired again, defence counsel mentioned his concern 
  about the trial judge’s response to the jury’s question.  The following exchange 
  took place:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>MR. WALKER: Excuse me, Your Honour.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: Certainly.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: I am concerned about this.  <i>Beaver v. The Queen</i> – when 
      you’re talking about actual possession. . . </p>
    <p>THE COURT: Yes sir.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: . . .you’re talking about possession by that person.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: Yes Sir.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: And then there are other means of possession as well.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: Yes.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: But, you’ve still got to have the three ingredients.  I mean, 
      I can know that there are pipe bombs in the back of that truck, but if I 
      for instance have said, “I want nothing to do with that. . .</p>
    <p>THE COURT: And you have no control over it.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: That’s right.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: That’s right.  And the – if he had the pipe bombs in the back 
      of the truck and the jury believes that he had no knowledge of them until 
      that time – until that time, and it was a surprise, the jury will acquit.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: Well shouldn’t that have been explained to the jury?</p>
    <p>THE COURT: No sir.</p>
    <p>MR. WALKER: Okay.</p>
    <p>THE COURT: I think it has been explained.  Thank you.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Less than 10 minutes later, the jury returned 
  with guilty verdicts on both counts in the indictment.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellant contends that constructive possession was a live 
  issue in the trial because of the appellant’s testimony explaining his presence 
  in the truck with the pipe bombs, the closing address of Crown counsel which 
  directly addressed the issue and the trial judge’s charge which included all 
  of s. 4(3) of the <i>Code</i>.  The appellant submits that, in the context of 
  this issue, the trial judge’s response to the jury question was inadequate.  
  Although the trial judge correctly told the jury that, in relation to actual 
  possession, they must find that the appellant “exerted control over the pipe 
  bombs while he had actual physical possession of them”, he did not advise the 
  jury that a measure of control was also required in relation to constructive 
  possession under s. 4(3)(b) of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At the appeal hearing, Crown counsel candidly conceded that there 
  were “significant difficulties at first blush” with what the trial judge said 
  in his charge on the issue of constructive possession.  He acknowledged that 
  the disparity between Crown counsel’s jury address and the trial judge’s charge 
  and re-charge in response to the jury’s question “does create a problem”.  However, 
  in spite of these concessions, the Crown contends that the appeal should still 
  be dismissed, essentially for two reasons.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> First, the Crown points out that the appellant was convicted 
  of conspiracy as well as possession.  The conviction for the former, says the 
  Crown, is not tainted by the trial judge’s inadequate answer to the jury’s question.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> With respect, I disagree.  There was an almost total overlap 
  in the two offences, from the actual wording of the two counts in the indictment 
  through to the trial judge’s charge.  Indeed, even the Crown in his closing 
  address to the jury explicitly linked conspiracy and possession:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Such possession of bombs is an offence all by itself and that’s what we 
      have charged in count two and where <i>such possession</i> of bombs is the 
      subject of a conspiracy, that is a separate offence.               [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
    <p>This statement was followed immediately by Crown counsel’s discussion (set 
      out previously) of the various definitions of possession including, explicitly, 
      constructive possession and his application of the definitions to the evidence.  
      Accordingly, when Crown counsel used the words “such possession of bombs 
      is the subject of a conspiracy”, he intended that constructive possession 
      be a potential foundation for the conspiracy offence as well as for the 
      possession offence.  </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Moreover, the trial judge’s charge raised the potential basis 
  for conviction on the conspiracy charge flowing from the events that suggested 
  the possibility of constructive possession.  At a general level, the trial judge 
  told the jury that “the question of possession . . . is in the second count 
  as well as in the first”, and “in that charge [the possession count] and in 
  the first conspiracy [count] the crown must establish that Joe Kocsis had the 
  criminal intent to possess explosives knowing that they were a danger and could 
  cause danger or serious damage to property”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>More specifically, and bearing directly on the 
  truck ride from the farm house to the mall involving the appellant, DeSantis 
  and the pipe bombs, the trial judge instructed the jury:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The evidence directly admissible against the accused on 
      the issue of his membership in the conspiracy includes . . . his going to 
      Prudhommes and meeting Mr. DeSantis and driving back to 4131 Greenlane and 
      returning with Mr. DeSantis.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>This was precisely the evidence that raised the constructive 
      possession issue in the trial.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For these reasons, in my view it is not safe to conclude that 
  the trial judge’s error, admitted by the Crown, relates only to the possession 
  offence.  On the evidence, the position of Crown counsel at trial and the trial 
  judge’s instructions, it would be possible for the jury to consider both conspiracy 
  and possession in the context of the disputed evidence surrounding the appellant’s 
  truck ride with the pipe bombs from the farm house to the mall.  In light of 
  this possible scenario, a correct response to the jury’s question – one which 
  covered the elements of constructive possession – was essential.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Second, the Crown contends that this is an appropriate case for 
  the application of the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Code.  </i>There 
  is no doubt that there was evidence supporting the conclusion that the appellant 
  was in actual possession of the pipe bombs.  That was also the Crown’s principal 
  position in its closing address.  Further, the trial judge’s charge on this 
  issue was appropriate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> However, with constructive possession being a live issue based 
  on the evidence, the Crown’s closing address and the trial judge's decision 
  to read all of s. 4(3) of the <i>Code</i> to the jury, the trial judge erred 
  by answering the jury’s question only in terms of actual possession.  By doing 
  so, he did not bring home to the jury that the three components of possession 
  needed to be present if the jury was considering constructive possession as 
  a basis for finding the appellant guilty.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In short, in their final exchange, it is clear that the trial 
  judge understood the elements of constructive possession; he expressly mentioned 
  both control and knowledge.  Moreover, he clearly understood how an acquittal 
  could arise in this case; he said that “the jury will acquit” if there was no 
  knowledge of, and no control over, the pipe bombs in back of the truck.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Defence counsel said: “Well shouldn’t that have been explained 
  to the jury?”  The trial judge replied: “I think it has been explained”.  With 
  respect, defence counsel was correct – it had not been explained to the jury.  
  Since the verdict came almost immediately after an inadequate answer to a jury 
  question relating to the very definition of the offences with which the appellant 
  was charged, I cannot say with confidence that, in the words of the proviso, 
  “no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>For these reasons, I would allow the appeal, 
  set aside the convictions and order a new trial.</span></p>
