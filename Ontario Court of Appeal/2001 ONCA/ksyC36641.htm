style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> This endorsement addresses Mr. Y.’s appeal from his conviction, 
        and an application brought by the Attorney General for Canada, and supported 
        by the Attorney General for Ontario, for an order that an affidavit filed 
        by the Attorney General Canada on the appeal be sealed pending further 
        order of this court.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference>*</span></a>  </p>
      <p class=headingtitle style='line-height:normal;
'> [2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> It recently came to the attention of the federal Crown that Mr. 
        Y.’s conviction occasioned a miscarriage of justice.  The Crown was not 
        aware of the circumstances giving rise to the miscarriage of justice when 
        Mr. Y. entered his guilty plea and was convicted.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> When the federal Crown became aware of the circumstances giving 
        rise to a miscarriage of justice, it notified counsel for Mr. Y. and invited 
        counsel to launch an appeal.  Crown counsel indicated that he was prepared 
        to agree to an extension of time to commence the appeal and would agree 
        that the appeal should be allowed.  Counsel for the federal Crown also 
        told counsel for Y. that the Crown would stay any further proceedings 
        should this court allow the appeal and quash Mr. Y.’s conviction.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> An affidavit in support of the Crown’s position that the conviction 
        of Mr. Y. was a miscarriage of justice was filed on July 11, 2001.  On 
        the same day, Osborne A.C.J.O. ordered the affidavit sealed pending this 
        hearing.  Pursuant to the terms of that order, no member of the public, 
        including counsel for Mr. Y. was permitted access to the affidavit.  The 
        order made by Osborne A.C.J.O. was made with the consent of Mr. Y.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>       We have examined 
        the affidavit and received it as fresh evidence on this appeal.  The contents 
        of the affidavit fully justify the federal Crown’s position.  An order 
        will go granting Mr. Y. an extension of time to today’s date to commence 
        an appeal from his conviction.  An order will also go quashing the conviction 
        and directing a new trial.  The Crown has undertaken to stay any further 
        proceedings on this charge.            </p>
      <p class=headingtitle><u>The Application to Continue the Sealing Order </u></p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Both the federal and provincial Crown seek a further sealing order.  
        The affidavit which the Crown seeks sealed, sets out in detail the basis 
        upon which the sealing order is requested.  If a sealing order is granted, 
        the public will not have access to the information on which the order 
        allowing this appeal is based.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> The order requested is an extraordinary one and runs against the 
        presumption that court proceedings are open and accessible to the public.  
        There will, however, be rare circumstances in which an order like that 
        sought here will be appropriate.  The grounds set out in the affidavit 
        offer strong support for the order requested.  The court is concerned, 
        however, about making a sealing order in the absence of submissions from 
        any party who may have an interest in resisting the sealing order sought 
        by the federal and provincial Crown.  Mr. Y. has no interest in resisting 
        that order.  </p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> In <i>Dagenais v. Canada Broadcasting Corp.</i> (1994), 94 C.C.C. 
        (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), the court dealt with the procedures to be followed 
        where applications are made for publication bans.  While the order sought 
        here is not in the nature of a publication ban, it does require a consideration 
        of the same principles that were engaged in <i>Dagenais</i>.</p>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> In <i>Dagenais</i>, Lamer C.J.C. discussed the practical problems 
        associated with giving notice of non-publication motions to those who 
        may have an interest in opposing them, but were not otherwise involved 
        in the proceedings.  The Chief Justice said, at p. 310:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <blockquote> 
          <p>The judge hearing the application [for a non-publication order] thus 
            has the discretion to direct that third parties (e.g. the media) be 
            given notice.  Exactly who is to be given notice and how notice is 
            to be given should remain in the discretion of the judge to be exercised 
            in accordance with the provincial rules of criminal procedure and 
            the relevant case law.</p>
        </blockquote>
      </blockquote>
      <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
        </span> Just as with non-publication orders, the media may have an interest 
        in challenging the order made here.  While we are satisfied that a sealing 
        order should be made, we also think that the media should receive notice 
        of this proceeding and the sealing order. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
