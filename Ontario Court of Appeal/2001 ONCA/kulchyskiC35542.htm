  </span></span> This is an appeal, with leave of this court, from the judgment 
  of the Divisional Court dismissing an application for judicial review of a resolution 
  of the Board of Governors (the “Board”) of Trent University (the “University”).  
  The resolution authorized the closure and sale of the premises of Peter Robinson 
  College and Catharine Par Traill College, two of the University’s colleges located 
  in downtown Peterborough.</p>
<p class=headingtitle><span lang=EN-US>I. Facts</span><span lang=EN-US

lang=EN-GB>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In the late 1950s, the Mayor of Peterborough and a number of 
  community leaders began to promote the establishment of a university in the 
  Peterborough area.  In August, 1960, Trent College Limited was incorporated 
  under <i>The</i> <i>Corporations Act, 1953.</i>  Efforts commenced to raise 
  money and locate a site for the university.  At the time, there was a mounting 
  demand for post-secondary education in Ontario.  The Provincial Government actively 
  encouraged the establishment of Trent University, as well as a number of other 
  new universities.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1962, approximately 100 acres of land on the outskirts of 
  Peterborough were donated to Trent College Limited.  Subsequently, Trent College 
  Limited authorized the purchase of additional adjacent lands.  This site was 
  to become the University’s main campus and was ultimately named the “Symons 
  Campus”.  In October 1962, the Trent University Board of Directors announced 
  the appointment of Thomas H.B. Symons as the President designate of Trent University, 
  to assume office in July 1963.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> At that time, a committee was established to prepare the new 
  university’s charter. The charter which the committee proposed was enacted in 
  April of 1963 as <i>An Act to Incorporate Trent University</i>,<i> </i>S.O. 
  1962-63, c.192 (cited as “<i>The Trent University Act, 1962-63</i>”, hereinafter 
  the “<i>Trent Act</i>”).  The <i>Trent Act </i>formally established the University 
  and set up a form of bicameral governance that divided governance of the University 
  between a Board of Governors and a Senate (the “Senate”).  The Board was given 
  authority over<i>, inter alia</i>, the “government, conduct, management and 
  control of the University and of its property, revenues, expenditures, business 
  and affairs”. (<i>Trent Act</i>, s. 10)  The Senate was given authority, <i>inter 
  alia</i>, to “ control, regulate and determine” educational policy within the 
  University. (<i>Trent Act</i>, s. 12)</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the enactment of the <i>Trent Act</i> in April 1963, the University’s 
  lands were transferred from Trent College Limited to Trent University and, thereafter, 
  maintenance of these lands became the responsibility of the Board.  The University’s 
  Symons Campus was chosen as the “permanent” home of the University. However, 
  development of the necessary facilities did not proceed as originally planned 
  and when it became evident that the Symons Campus would not be ready for use 
  by September 1964, arrangements were made to secure temporary facilities in 
  downtown Peterborough.  The City of Peterborough made an old high school available 
  and additional buildings were purchased, including larger residential houses 
  for use as temporary residential colleges.  Peter Robinson House for men and 
  Catharine Parr Traill House for women were opened in September 1964 in premises 
  located in different areas of downtown Peterborough. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In 1967, the first residential college opened on the Symons Campus.  
  The second opened in 1968 and the third in 1973.  At no time has the University 
  been in a financial position to proceed with its plan for twelve residential 
  colleges on the Symons Campus.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Today, the University provides residential accommodation for 
  some 1,100 of its 3,800 undergraduate students through its five residential 
  colleges.  Peter Robinson College houses 135 students and Catharine Parr Traill 
  houses 193 students.  They are located in different areas of downtown Peterborough 
  approximately five to seven kilometres from the Symons Campus.  The buildings 
  consist of turn-of the century converted residential houses, a residence/office 
  building constructed in 1966, a renovated apartment building and town houses.  
</p>

lang=EN-GB>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It appears from the material filed by the respondent University 
  that the relationship between the academic side of the University (the Senate) 
  and those responsible for the financing and maintenance of the facilities (the 
  Board) has historically been far from harmonious. Over time, the University’s 
  bicameral governance system, which appears to have worked satisfactorily in 
  other universities, created fractiousness in the Trent University community 
  and led to numerous internal conflicts.  The deterioration of the governance 
  system was one of the matters addressed by an external review of the University’s 
  administration conducted in 1997 by H.W. Arthurs and Joyce Lorimer.  Their report, 
  <i>External Review of the Administration of Trent University</i>, stated in 
  part at p. 4:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The fractiousness which has characterized the Trent community for over 
      two decades, we suggest, reflects very real and unresolved internal conflicts.  
      These conflicts are manifest in debates over governance structures. Trent’s 
      formal allocation of decision-making responsibility between the Board, senior 
      administration, Senate, Faculty Council, departments and colleges and management 
      resemble provisions elsewhere.  However, in practice, Trent appears to have 
      translated the informal habits of earlier and smaller days into a politically 
      fragmented system, which, while properly anticipating widespread consultation 
      of all constituencies, has no clear means of moving on from disagreement 
      amongst them.  <b>This system, described to us as a system of “multiple 
      vetoes”, is particularly problematic because of the difficulty of balancing 
      the priorities of different constituency interests in a climate of economic 
      stringency. </b>[Emphasis added.]  </p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span

  </span></span> Adding to the University’s troubles, a financial crisis developed 
  in the 1990s because of unprecedented cuts in government funding to Ontario 
  universities.  Trent University did not have the resources to continue its mandate 
  and meet the increased demand by students for enrolment.  It operated at substantial 
  deficits for the years ending 1998 through 2000.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The University’s current President, Bonnie Patterson, was appointed 
  on July 1, 1998.  She was given a mandate by the Board to develop a plan to 
  restore the University to financial viability and to design a plan to balance 
  the operating budget.  In addition to suffering from a substantial operating 
  deficit and an ever-increasing cumulative debt, the University was also having 
  difficulty meeting enrolment targets and its infrastructure was deteriorating.  
  Many of the buildings had extraordinarily high current and deferred maintenance 
  costs associated with them.  Many buildings also had deteriorated below acceptable 
  standards for a post-secondary institution.  Many of the University’s ancillary 
  operations, including its residential colleges, had depleted their maintenance 
  reserves and were accumulating operating deficits.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Fortuitously, in response to similar problems confronting other 
  universities, the Ontario Government announced in its May 1999 Budget the creation 
  of a SuperBuild Growth Fund (the “Fund”).  The Fund was aimed at renewing infrastructure 
  and providing new facilities to accommodate anticipated enrolment increases 
  at existing educational institutions.  Accordingly, in May of 1999, President 
  Patterson established a Task Force to review and evaluate the University’s space 
  planning and capital needs within the context of the provincial SuperBuild program.  
  The eleven-person Task Force was composed of three faculty members, two students, 
  the University’s Associate Vice-President and Registrar, its Director of Student 
  Affairs, its Manager of Facility Services, its Co-ordinator of Institutional 
  Research and Planning, its Science Facilities Manager, and a seconded Ontario 
  Government Realty Analyst.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On October 25, 1999, the University’s Task Force delivered its 
  unanimous report recommending increased student enrolment and the consolidation 
  of the University’s Peterborough operations on the Symons Campus.  The Task 
  Force did not recommend any alterations to Trent’s existing educational policy.  
  The Task Force Report noted the University’s mission as an institution specializing 
  primarily in liberal undergraduate education in the Humanities, Natural Sciences 
  and Social Sciences.  The Report acknowledged the University’s commitment to 
  “small scale personalized teaching and learning”, to the encouragement of interdisciplinary 
  studies and to the importance of the residential college system.  The Task Force 
  reviewed the University’s economic position and analyzed its aging infrastructure 
  and the deferred maintenance and operating costs associated with many of the 
  University’s buildings.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Task Force recommended a program of infrastructure renewal 
  through the erection of new buildings, the renovation of certain buildings on 
  the Symons Campus and the closure and sale of the University’s downtown facilities.  
  It proposed the construction of a new $11.25 million facility on the Symons 
  Campus to provide the Humanities disciplines with state of the art infrastructure.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The University maintains that it consulted widely within the 
  university community on the recommendations in this report.  Additionally, President 
  Patterson retained Educational Consulting Services (“ECS”) to prepare a report 
  on the University’s current and projected infrastructure needs.  The ECS report 
  concluded that the downtown colleges had higher annual operating costs than 
  those on the Symons Campus and noted that their closure would assist in reducing 
  annual operating deficits, permit the University to retire outstanding mortgage 
  debt and substantially reduce deferred maintenance costs.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In early November of 1999, President Patterson proposed a Capital 
  Development Strategy which was to form the basis of the University’s SuperBuild 
  application.  The Capital Development Strategy addressed the need to eliminate 
  deficits in the annual operating and ancillary budgets and to address deferred 
  maintenance liabilities.  It recommended increased enrolment targets.  The principal 
  elements of the strategy were:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>

      for 313 resident undergraduates, this college will house faculty and staff

      will meet the needs identified for a First People’s House of Learning and

  </span></span> In what the University maintains was simply part of its normal 
  consultative process, President Patterson sought the Senate’s endorsement of 
  the Capital Development Strategy.  The Senate responded by adopting two motions.  
  In one motion, the Senate supported the recommended pattern of enrolment growth.  
  In the other, the Senate supported an application for SuperBuild funding but 
  rejected the notion that the application could be based on a change of location 
  or reduction of facilities at any downtown or Symons Campus college.</p>

  </span></span> On November 12, 1999, the Audit and Finance Committee of the 
  Board recommended the Capital Development Strategy to the Board.  The Board 
  then met and passed a resolution approving the Capital Development Strategy

  Growth Fund consistent with the Capital Development Strategy.</p>

  </span></span> In my opinion, the appellants’ appeal on the merits should be 
  dismissed.  The appellants have attempted mightily to convert a financial management 
  decision made in response to economic necessity into an educational policy issue 
  that requires the assent of the Senate.  I do not accept their submissions that 
  the Board lacked the overriding jurisdiction to authorize the closure and sale 
  of certain facilities despite the objection of the Senate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The basic facts are not in dispute. The only issue is how they 
  are to be interpreted for governance purposes.  While the Senate has taken no 
  part in these proceedings, the appellants maintain that the Senate’s refusal 
  to endorse the Capital Development Strategy is fatal to its implementation because 
  that strategy involves a fundamental change in the educational policy of Trent 
  University that must be approved of by the Senate.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is clear that the resolution passed by the Board was based 
  on a recognition that the University desperately needed to restructure its administration 
  in order to cut costs and put it in a position to take advantage of a Government 
  initiative whereby scarce capital funds would be made available for capital 
  improvements and renewal of the infrastructure.  The Task Force set up by President 
  Patterson recommended that the buildings in downtown Peterborough that had been 
  the temporary base for two of the colleges should be sold, and that the faculty, 
  administrative staff and student bodies should be moved to the main campus, 
  where it was always intended that they should be.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On the face of it, this restructuring program appears to be fully 
  within the jurisdiction of the Board, which is charged under s. 10 of the <i>Trent 
  Act</i> with the “government, conduct, management and control of the University 
  and of its property, revenues, expenditures, business and affairs”.  One would 
  have thought that the academic side of the University, as represented by the 
  Senate, would have welcomed a necessary cost-cutting move that would upgrade 
  the facilities of the two colleges without any loss of faculty or staff, and 
  that would re-locate the two colleges a few kilometers away in new facilities 
  on the main campus. However, as is often the case when a segment of an institution 
  becomes isolated from its centre core, even to a small degree, it appears to 
  take on an identity of its own.  The orphan colleges in the downtown core of 
  Peterborough fostered a special <i>esprit de corps</i> but that is no basis 
  for resisting change.  In supporting the members of the faculty and alumni who 
  oppose the restructuring plan, the Senate lost sight of the broader interests 
  of the university as a whole.  While a variety of factors, including nostalgia, 
  appear to support the appellants’ opposition to the Capital Development Strategy 
  as implemented by the Board’s resolution, in my opinion they do not provide 
  the legal foundation to support a court challenge.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In this case, the appellant professors, and other like-minded 
  individuals, argue that the University’s decentralized nature has always been 
  one of its greatest academic strengths.  According to the appellants, the decentralization 
  has allowed individual members of the University to pursue teaching and learning 
  within an environment not fenced in by narrow disciplinary boundaries.  They 
  further assert that the University has failed to acknowledge that the downtown 
  colleges are integral to the educational policy of Trent University, and maintain 
  that with their distinctive defining characteristics, these colleges counterbalanced 
  the departmental concentration typical of many universities and permitted students 
  and faculty to explore a wider range of intellectual options.  It is the submission 
  of the appellants that centralizing all of the University’s academic units in 
  one location would endanger this diversity, strengthen administrative prerogatives 
  and weaken the exploratory and experimental tendencies that keep the University 
  vibrant. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants justify this somewhat extravagant language by 
  referring the court to promotional brochures enticing student enrolment and 
  to the University’s Academic Calendar.  However, as the appellants’ counsel 
  fairly conceded, the decentralization of the University only occurred as a result 
  of a delay in the construction of the Symons Campus.  When the University was 
  forced to open its doors prematurely in 1964 and to make use of temporary downtown 
  accommodations, it chose to make the best out of unfortunate and unforeseen 
  circumstances and extol the virtues of a necessity forced upon it.  It promoted 
  the rewards of what it then characterized as a unique educational experience.  
  Unfortunately, the appellants now attempt to elevate this educational experience 
  into settled educational policy.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> It is important to remember that the founders of the University 
  contemplated the creation of one central campus, and not the dispersed campus 
  that was forced upon them.  In retrospect, the use of property in the downtown 
  area might have created a unique campus at the University, but it is a stretch 
  to say, as the appellants maintain, that spreading the University out in various 
  locations was part of the academic mission of the University or that this decentralization 
  constitutes an essential part of the educational policy of the University.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, all these opinions about the value of the present 
  isolation of the two colleges and its effect on the delivery of the academic 
  curriculum are of little assistance in determining the central issue under appeal 
  which is whether the Board possesses the jurisdiction and authority to pass 
  the resolution at issue without the concurrence of the Senate.  Similarly, the 
  extensive evidence about how unpopular the Board’s decision is in some quarters 
  is equally irrelevant. This is particularly true in the light of the appellants’ 
  oft-repeated assurance that the court should not be concerned about the merits 
  of the Board’s resolution.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I support the conclusion of the Divisional Court that “the Board’s 
  specific and residuary powers grant it exclusive jurisdiction over the management 
  and control of the University’s property, revenues and expenditures including 
  financial responsibility for provision of facilities”.  It follows, in my view 
  that under the <i>Trent Act</i> the Board is the keeper of the University purse 
  and has no obligation to indefinitely provide financial support to any policy, 
  educational or otherwise that is draining the coffers of the University, even 
  if that policy originally was agreed upon by both the Board and the Senate.  
  In saying this, I do not accept that on the record before us, the decision to 
  open the University in downtown Peterborough was ever a considered change in 
  educational policy from that envisioned by the founders of Trent University.  
  It was a pragmatic decision that was not beyond the reach of the Board had it 
  sought to act alone.  However, even if it was a decision involving educational 
  policy, and even if it can be said that the Board acted under s. 12 of the <i>Trent 
  Act </i>and approved the “expenditure of funds and the establishment of faculties” 
  to implement such policy, it cannot be argued that by so doing, the Board divested 
  itself of its powers and obligations under s. 10 covering “the government, conduct, 
  management and control of the University and its property, revenues, expenditures, 
  business and affairs”.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The language of s. 12 giving limited power to the Senate to initiate 
  and control educational policy is always subject to the overriding provision 
  that the Senate requires the approval of the Board “in so far as the expenditure 
  of moneys is concerned”.  There is no language in the <i>Trent Act</i> to support 
  the contention that once financial approval is given by the Board to a particular 
  policy, such support can never be withdrawn by the Board no matter how deleterious 
  the policy venture is to the financial well being of the University as a whole. 
</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Section 4 of the <i>Trent Act</i> gives the University the power 
  to establish and maintain such faculties and departments “as the Senate deems 
  necessary and as shall be approved with respect to finances and facilities by 
  the Board”.  However, once again I suggest that the legislature could never 
  have intended that the University’s bicameral governance system would be so 
  inflexible that once a decision was jointly made, it could never be revoked 
  or modified except by the joint agreement of both deliberative bodies.  In this 
  instance, the Board cannot be forced to continue to support the existence of 
  the downtown colleges in the face of economic loss, financial necessities and 
  concerns for the future of the entire University.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I further believe that in bringing this application, the appellants 
  have confused educational policy with the educational experience.  Living in 
  residence in a converted turn of the century house in downtown Peterborough 
  may well provide a different experience than living in a building constructed 
  as a residence on the main campus just outside the city.  I accept that students 
  from the downtown colleges may meet different people and be exposed to somewhat 
  different environments than students from the main campus.  Against this, I 
  would observe that while elimination of the downtown colleges may affect certain 
  students’ educational experiences, not every change to a student’s educational 
  experience involves a shift in educational policy.  There is nothing in this 
  record to suggest that the consolidation of the University will prevent any 
  of the relocated students from receiving academic and other courses of the same 
  quality that was possible under the decentralized college system or that this 
  change reflects a modification of the University’s educational goals and policy 
  aspirations.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> As submitted by the respondent University, the implementation 
  of the Capital Development Strategy and the Board’s resolution will not affect 
  (a) the subject matter or organization of any of the academic courses or programs 
  taught at the University (b) the availability of any academic courses or programs 
  to any of the University’s students (c) the role of faculty in developing or 
  teaching academic courses (d) the number of faculty employed at the University 
  (e) the role of research and scholarship in the University (f) the University’s 
  admission or academic standards (g) the importance of interdisciplinary study

  appropriate fields or (i) the continued role of the residential college system

lang=EN-GB>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> On my analysis of the full record before the court, the restructuring 
  of the University was necessitated by financial realities and changing economic 
  conditions, not by a desire to alter the educational mission of the University.  
  The Board, which acted in order to safeguard the survival of the University, 
  is therefore correct in regarding the restructuring as a matter that does not 
  fall under the category of educational policy.  </p>

  </span></span> It is significant that the Attorney General of Ontario has intervened 
  in this appeal in support of the position of the respondent University.  The 
  Ministry is understandably concerned that if Trent University goes bankrupt 
  the undertaking will become the charge of the Government of Ontario. In support 
  of the position taken before this court by the respondent University, the Attorney 
  General of Ontario points out that the Board would be unable to discharge its 
  statutory duties if the concurrence of the Senate was required for any decision 
  deemed by the Senate to have an impact on educational policy.  If the governance 
  system was interpreted in this manner, the Attorney General submits that the 
  result would be that the Senate would have an effective veto power over all 
  Board decisions.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Further, the Attorney General notes that while the <i>Trent Act</i> 
  (unlike the legislation establishing most publicly funded universities in Ontario) 
  does not require that the majority of members of its Board be external to the 
  university or that a certain number of spaces on the Board be reserved for government 
  appointees, in point of fact 16 of the 24 Board members are external to Trent 
  University, in that they are not faculty, students, staff or alumni.  According 
  to the Attorney General, those constituting the majority of the Board are external 
  to the University because they are responsible for governance decisions, including 
  the expenditure of public funds, and must have a certain degree of objectivity 
  regarding business practices and financial management in order to properly discharge 
  their duties in the public interest.  That is why, submits the Attorney General, 
  all decisions regarding overall budget and strategic directions regarding the 
  expenditure of funds require the approval of the Board, and this includes even 
  those decisions that the Senate may consider to have an impact on educational 
  policy.  </p>

  </span></span> I conclude that the Board did have the jurisdiction under the 
  <i>Trent Act</i> to act as it did and to pass the resolution relating to the 
  Capital Development Strategy. While it would have been more helpful if the Senate 
  had supported this initiative, the Senate’s approval of such a resolution is 
  not legally required.  Accordingly, I would find that the Divisional Court did 
  not err in reaching its decision on the central issue in appeal.</p>

  </span></span> According to the respondent, courts have consistently demonstrated 
  a reluctance to intervene in the affairs of universities by means of discretionary 
  writs, based on the recognition that universities are autonomous independent 
  institutions which themselves may best ensure the fulfilment of their objectives. 
  Further, those cases in which courts have intervened by way of discretionary 
  writs generally involve circumstances in which the legal rights or privileges 
  of the applicant are affected.  On this point, the respondent cites: <i>Re Harelkin 
  and University of Regina</i> (1979), 96 D.L.R. (3d) 14 S.C.C. at 56-57;<i> Wong 
  v. University of Toronto</i> (1989), 45 Admin L.R. 113 (Ont. Div. Ct.) aff’d

  </span></span> I agree with the position of the respondent that the appellants 
  have not adequately demonstrated that the Board’s resolution has any effect 
  on their legal rights or privileges.  While the appellants may feel strongly 
  about the Board’s resolution and may be personally affected or inconvenienced 
  by it, this does not establish a sufficient basis to justify granting the appellants 
  standing to petition the court to interfere with university governance on this 
  matter.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants assert that since the appellant McLachlan was 
  a member of the Senate when it adopted the resolution that the Board purported 
  to override, this, alone, supports granting the appellant McLachlan standing 
  in the matter.  I do not accept this submission.  The notion that a single member 
  of a deliberative body can initiate a legal proceeding on behalf of the body 
  itself is mischievous and destructive of the democratic process. The appellants 
  are both in the same situation.  They are members of the Trent University Faculty 
  Association Union and their legal rights and privileges are governed by the 
  collective agreement between their union and the University and by the <i>Labour 
  Relations Act</i>, 1995, S.O. 1995, c.1.  Any individual complaints about matters 
  such as changes to their work environment should be brought through the appropriate 
  union or statutory channels, rather than in the form of a <i>certiorari </i>application 
  against their employer.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The appellants further argue that both appellants had standing 
  to challenge the Board’s resolution on the basis of public interest.  I do not 
  believe that this is a case where the public interest justification can be invoked 
  to grant standing to the appellants.  At the risk of being repetitive, I note 
  that the Senate is not a party to these proceedings and has not intervened as 
  a body in order to present its own submissions. The fact that the body which 
  the appellants assert would be most directly affected by the Board’s resolution 
  did not participate in the challenge to that resolution indicates that the issue 
  which the appellants – two of the University’s two hundred and ten full-time 
  teaching faculty – seek to have judicially reviewed is not as critical to the 
  public interest as suggested by the appellants.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Further, while it is true that the bicameral governance model 
  in place at Trent University remains in place at most other Ontario universities, 
  it appears from the report of Arthurs and Lorimer that the dispute at issue 
  is particular to Trent University. Certainly no other university has sought 
  to intervene in this proceeding or to advance the position of the appellants 
  and those they represent.  Accordingly, I do not believe that this local controversy 
  rises to the degree of justifying judicial intervention on public interest grounds.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is another aspect of the public interest that I believe 
  the appellants are ignoring.  The respondent University desperately needs the 
  proposed re-organization in order to survive.  The Board recognized the urgency 
  of the University’s situation and after careful consideration, authorized the 
  restructuring as a means to ensure the University’s continued existence as a 
  quality educational institution.  It hardly makes sense to delay this carefully 
  thought out redevelopment program, designed to benefit the interests of the 
  entire University and its student body, simply based on an application by two 
  professors who have their own view of the mission of Trent University.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> <span
lang=EN-GB>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> This aspect of the public interest is not an <i>in terrorem</i> 
  argument.  The Attorney General has access to more information than is available 
  to this court and in his factum, after strongly supporting the position of the 
  respondent Board, he states that if the respondent University would become insolvent, 
  the Board would likely appeal to the government for additional funding, and 
  if the University were to become bankrupt its property would escheat to the 
  Crown under the <i>Escheats </i>Act, R.S.O. 1990, c.E.20.</p>

lang=EN-GB>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> For these reasons it is my opinion that the two appellants have 
  no standing to bring this application or to pursue it on appeal.  For this reason 
  alone, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>

<p><b><u>The <i>Trent Act</i> and Bicameral Governance</u></b></p>
<p style='
'> [57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> <i>The</i> <i>Trent University Act</i>, S.O. 1962-63, c. 192 (the “<i>Trent 
  Act</i>”) establishes a bicameral governance structure, allocating authority 
  to the Board of Governors and to the Senate respectively.  Each body is given 
  certain enumerated powers.  For the purposes of this appeal, as Finlayson J.A. 
  has noted, the crucial powers are that of the Board with respect to “the government, 
  conduct, management and control of the University and of its property, revenues, 
  expenditures, business and affairs” (s. 10) and that of the Senate “to control, 
  regulate and determine the educational policy of the University”. (s. 12). </p>
<p style='
'> [58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The allocation of powers as between the Board and the Senate represents 
  an attempt to reflect and accommodate the interests and concerns that have to 
  be taken into account in the governance of a modern university.  Decisions relating 
  to educational policy are assigned to the Senate, a body comprised primarily 
  of members of the University’s academic community.  Decisions relating to management 
  and finances are assigned to the Board, a body comprised primarily of lay members, 
  who reflect the broader community interest in the sound and prudent management 
  of an important publicly funded institution.  The bicameral scheme of governance 
  is designed to provide an institutional framework that will allow the University 
  to identify and achieve its academic and educational goals in a manner consonant 
  with the interests of the community and public at large.  </p>
<p style='
'> [59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As I read the <i>Trent Act</i>, the powers of the Board and the Senate 
  are both exclusive and overlapping.  They are exclusive in the sense that where 
  a matter is specifically assigned to one body, the other body lacks authority 
  over that matter.  For example, the Board has no authority to determine educational 
  policy for the University.  Similarly, the Senate has no authority to manage 
  or control the property, revenues, and expenditures of the University.  However, 
  not all issues fall neatly into the categories of the matters assigned to the 
  Board and the Senate respectively.  As many issues confronting the University 
  present more than one aspect, to that extent, the powers of the Board and Senate 
  overlap.  From one aspect, the issue will fall within a power assigned to the 
  Board, while from another aspect, the same issue will fall within a power assigned 
  to the Senate.  </p>
<p style='
'> [60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The overlapping nature of the respective powers of the Board and the 
  Senate where educational policy intersects with financial matters is evident 
  from the terms of the <i>Trent Act</i>.  Section 4 of the <i>Trent Act</i> provides 
  as follows:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p>The University has power to establish and maintain such faculties, schools, 
      institutes, departments, chairs and courses <i>as the Senate deems necessary 
      and as shall be approved with respect to finances and facilities by the 
      Board</i>. [emphasis added]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Similarly, s. 12 of the <i>Trent Act </i>provides that “[t]he Senate is responsible 
  for the educational policy of the University”, and that it may create such faculties, 
  departments, schools, institutes or chairs as it determines “with the approval 
  of the Board <i>in so far as the expenditure of funds and the establishment 
  of faculties are concerned</i>” (emphasis added).  </p>
<p style='
'> [61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> These provisions plainly envisage a power-sharing relationship between 
  Senate and the Board.  Decisions falling within these provisions give rise to 
  issues of both financial management and educational policy and hence require 
  the concurrence of both bodies.  As the President of the University, Bonnie 
  Patterson, conceded on cross-examination, where a matter has both educational 
  policy and financial implications, the approval of both Senate and the Board 
  is necessary. </p>
<p style='
'> [62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Quite apart from these specific provisions, it seems to me that a power-sharing 
  relationship between the Board and the Senate is implicit in the bicameral scheme 
  of governance created by the <i>Trent Act</i>.  Where an issue gives rise to 
  aspects falling within the powers of both the Board and the Senate, bicameralism 
  requires the concurrence of both bodies.  While each body has exclusive authority 
  to decide that aspect of the decision that falls within its powers, neither 
  body has exclusive or paramount authority over the entire question. </p>
<p style='
'> [63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Bicameralism was first introduced in Ontario following the <i>Report 
  of the Royal Commission on the University of Toronto</i> (Toronto: Queen’s Printer, 
  1906).  The Royal Commission concluded at p. xxi that the history of the University 
  of Toronto had “demonstrated the disadvantage of direct political control.”  
  It sought to establish a scheme that would provide the university with independent 
  governance, reflecting both the public interest in sound management and respect 
  for academic judgment on academic issues.  The Royal Commission’s plan aimed 
  “at dividing the administration of the University between the Governors, who 
  will possess the general oversight and financial control now vested in the State, 
  and the Senate, with the Faculty Councils, which will direct the academic work 
  and policy.”  (<i>Ibid.</i>)</p>
<p style='
'> [64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Bicameralism has both advantages and disadvantages.  On the positive 
  side, it provides a system of governance that distinguishes management issues 
  from issues of educational policy and allocates responsibility for each to specialized 
  governing bodies capable of reflecting the interests and concerns bearing upon 
  the matters assigned.  On the negative side, by dividing governing authority, 
  bicameralism may complicate decision-making and, as the experience at Trent 
  sadly shows, result in deadlock.  Bicameralism was abandoned by the University 
  of Toronto thirty years ago in favour of a unicameral Governing Council in which 
  all estates are represented.  Some other universities have retained the bicameral 
  structure but have altered its operation by affording significant academic and 
  student participation at the Board level.  One could only gain an accurate appreciation 
  of how bicameralism actually works at a particular university by careful study 
  of that institution’s arrangements, practices, and traditions. </p>
<p style='
'> [65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see nothing in the <i>Trent Act</i> that accords priority, paramountcy 
  or “overriding jurisdiction” to the decision of the Board in the event of conflict 
  between the Board and the Senate on an issue requiring the concurrence of both 
  bodies.  The <i>Trent Act</i> specifically excepts from the Board’s powers “such 
  matters specifically assigned by this <i>Trent Act</i> to the Senate or the 
  councils of the faculties...”.  These words qualify all of the Board’s powers, 
  including its general governance power and its specific authority over property 
  and expenditures.  I agree with the appellants’ submission that by enacting 
  these words, the legislature provided its own solution to potential conflicts 
  between the Board and the Senate.  The legislature subtracted authority over 
  educational policy from the Board’s powers and protected Senate’s power over 
  educational policy from encroachment by any power of the Board.  Neither the 
  Board’s power of general governance nor its power of the purse allow it to usurp 
  the role of the Senate to control, regulate, and determine the educational policy 
  of the University.  The <i>Trent Act</i> makes no provision for a “tie-break” 
  mechanism to resolve a conflict between the Board and the Senate.  The way out 
  of deadlock is not unilateral action by the Board but debate, discussion, negotiation, 
  and compromise, or all else failing, legislation. </p>
<p style='
'> [66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There are two governing bodies, each with its own area of expertise 
  and concern to be brought to bear upon the educational issues confronting the 
  University.  The Board cannot decide where to spend the University’s resources 
  without the Senate’s determination of educational policy.  Similarly, the Senate 
  cannot implement an educational policy without the Board’s determination to 
  make available the required resources.  </p>
<p style='
'> [67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Board could, of course, require the University to change and curtail 
  its academic program for valid financial reasons, but the role of the Senate, 
  the body responsible for the University’s educational policy, in identifying 
  the activities or programs to be eliminated or curtailed would have to be respected.  
  The power of the Board to determine the resources available for the University’s 
  program cannot be doubted, but neither should the Senate’s power to define and 
  shape the institution’s educational policy with the resources that are available.</p>
<h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Characterization of 
  the Decision to Close the Two Downtown Colleges</h4>
<p style='
'> [68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I turn from this assessment of the legislative scheme to the central 
  issue to be resolved on this appeal, namely, is the decision to close Peter 
  Robinson and Catharine Parr Traill Colleges properly classified as a matter 
  of educational policy?  If it is, the concurrence of the Senate is required 
  and the application for judicial review succeeds.  If it is not, the Board is 
  free to proceed without the agreement of the Senate and the application for 
  judicial review fails. </p>
<p style='
'> [69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I respectfully disagree with the proposition that the decision to close 
  the two downtown colleges can be properly characterized as nothing more than 
  a decision in relation to the “management and control of the University and 
  its property”.  For the reasons that follow, I have concluded that this decision 
  has sufficiently significant implications for the educational policy of the 
  University so as to require the approval of the Senate.  </p>
<p style='
'> [70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In reaching this conclusion, I am mindful of the financial problems 
  the University faces.  It may well be that, viewed solely from the perspective 
  of sound fiscal management, the decision to close the downtown colleges is in 
  the best interests of the University.  On that question, I express no view.  
  Nor do I think it appropriate for us to comment on the wisdom of or the motives 
  for the Senate’s refusal to approve the decision to close the two downtown colleges.  
  It is not the task of this court to decide the legal issue before us on the 
  basis of what might seem to us to be best in the broader interests of the University 
  as a whole.  The reconciliation of conflicting views on how best to govern the 
  affairs of the University must be achieved in accordance with the scheme of 
  governance mandated by the legislature.  Our role is restricted to the legal 
  interpretation of that legislation and to ensuring that those involved in the 
  affairs of the University respect the legislative scheme.</p>
<p style='
'> [71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I would also offer the following caveat.  The legal characterization 
  of the decision at issue here must take into acco<a><span>unt the history, traditions, 
  practices, and policies of Trent University and the specific situation posed 
  by the facts of this case.  While the <i>Trent Act</i> follows a pattern that 
  is found in the statutes of most Ontario universities, the terms of the <i>Trent 
  Act</i> are in certain respects distinctive.  One must never lose sight of the 
  specific context within which a decision is made.  The courts must, of course, 
  adopt a principled approach based on rules of general application, but in another 
  case, involving a different institution with a different history and faced with 
  a different problem, a different decision as to the respective powers of a Board 
  and Senate may well obtain.</span></a></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I group under two headings the arguments that lead me to conclude 
  that the decision to close the two colleges does implicate the University’s 
  educational policy.  First, I consider the significance of the colleges within 
  Trent’s college-based system of education.  Second, I will examine the University’s 
  past practice in relation to the issue of closure or change of status of the 
  two downtown colleges.</span></p>

  </span></span> The educational policy considerations that informed the decision 
  to adopt the college system included the importance of integrating cultural 
  and social life with academic life, the high value to be placed on small group 
  teaching, and the educational value of colleges as interdisciplinary communities 
  with their own identities and traditions.  Among the central elements of Trent’s 
  college-based system are the recognition that the nature of a university’s physical 
  premises has a profound effect on the academic experience of students and the 
  recognition that student involvement in social, artistic, and community events 
  is an essential part of education.  </span></p>

  </span></span> When announcing the establishment of Trent’s first colleges in 
  1964, founding President Symons described the colleges as “the central academic 
  units of the University … around which the whole life of the University will 
  be focussed.”  The colleges were to function as “communities within the University”, 
  which would reinforce “the essential purpose of the University as a place of 
  learning”.  Each college was to develop a unique identity, providing a unique 
  academic environment for the cultural and social life of Trent’s students. </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The University has maintained and followed these policies to 
  the present day.  In its current Academic Calendar, the University states that 
  the colleges “are central not only to the organizational structure of the University, 
  but to the academic and social experience of Trent students.”  It confirms that 
  “[o]ver the years, each of the colleges has developed its own unique character, 
  creating for Trent students a variety of distinct intellectual and social communities.”  
  It recognizes that the colleges are “centres of learning and focal points of 
  social and cultural activity.”  The University describes the Academic Calendar 
  as its “most authoritative academic publication”.  The Calendar represents a 
  formal statement of the University’s educational policy and the statements it 
  makes cannot be disregarded as mere promotional hype. </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> While the University’s original plan envisaged all colleges being 
  located at what is known as the Symons Campus, that plan changed early on.  
  In the announcement of the establishment of “the two city colleges” in 1964, 
  President Symons stated that they would be “permanent parts of the University” 
  helping to bridge “[t]he ‘great divide’ among university students … between 
  those who live at home and commute daily, and those who live in university residences 
  and who can thus be full-time members of the university community.”  The uncontradicted 
  evidence before us indicates that the downtown colleges have become more important 
  than was originally conceived.  They have evolved into vital centres of activity 
  for the University and the local community, bridging the gap between “town and 
  gown.”  Their significance to the present can be gauged from the fact that, 
  throughout the 1990’s, Trent’s main priority for capital projects was the downtown 
  colleges. </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The University has encouraged each of its colleges to develop 
  a distinctive identity.  The resulting diversity of the academic communities 
  that comprise the University is regarded as a significant aspect of the educational 
  experience offered by Trent.  I do not accept my colleague’s suggestion that 
  there is a meaningful distinction to be drawn between educational policy on 
  the one hand and educational experience on the other.  It seems to me that the 
  two are inextricably linked.  The very purpose of an educational policy is to 
  provide a certain kind of educational experience.  The success or failure of 
  an educational policy will be measured by the quality of the educational experience 
  it provides.  A change to the educational experience offered to students represents 
  a change in educational policy. </span></p>

  </span></span> Trent is now comprised of five colleges: Peter Robinson College 
  and Catharine Parr Traill College, the original two downtown colleges at issue 
  in this appeal, and three colleges located at the Symons Campus, along the banks 
  of the Otonabee River, some five kilometres from downtown.  All Trent students 
  must be affiliated with one of the five colleges.  For the academic year 1999-2000, 
  approximately one third of students in residence at Trent were located in the 
  two downtown colleges (193 at Traill and 135 at Peter Robinson of a total of 
  1092).  Similarly, approximately one third of all Trent students were affiliated 
  with the downtown colleges (674 at Traill and 554 at Peter Robinson of a total 
  of 3,793).  Most lectures and seminars for first year students are offered at 
  the Symons campus.  The University’s science program is offered at the science 
  buildings located at the Symons campus.  Lectures, seminars, and tutorials for 
  all other courses are offered at either the Symons or downtown campuses.  The 
  University administrative offices, main library, bookstore, sporting facilities, 
  and other like amenities are located at the Symons campus.</span></p>
<p style='

  </span></span> Peter Robinson College is located in converted heritage houses 
  and new buildings in downtown Peterborough.  These buildings incorporate both 
  residences and areas for academic activities.  Sadleir House, the focus of college 
  life, is an historic home, redesigned to integrate modern additions with its 
  original architecture.  The University’s undergraduate Cultural Studies Program 
  is based in the college.  The History Program was also based at Peter Robinson 
  at the time that the Board’s resolution was passed.  The Frost Centre for Canadian 
  Heritage and Development Studies, a graduate program and research centre, and 
  the graduate program in Methodologies for the Study of Western Culture and its 
  associated research centre are also located at the College. </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The University’s Academic Calendar states that Peter Robinson’s 
  location and size make it “particularly appealing to those students who are 
  interested in an intimate university milieu which is not isolated from the city 
  community.”  The College has always emphasized the need for student involvement 
  in wider social issues in the community and abroad.  Students often use their 
  experience with community organizations as a base for their course work in Cultural 
  Studies, Philosophy, Politics, and Sociology.  Many of the after-hours activities 
  that form part of the Native Studies program take place at Peter Robinson.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Calendar also recognizes the College’s active program of 
  visiting scholars, artists, broadcasters, musicians, and cultural theorists, 
  and the role that Sadleir House plays as the venue for a variety of cultural 
  events.  These cultural events are not only an important, but also in many cases 
  a required, part of the educational experience for students in Cultural Studies.</span></p>
<p style='

  </span></span> Named in honour of the noted author, botanist, and pioneer Peterborough 
  settler, Catharine Parr Traill College comprises a number of architecturally 
  and historically significant older houses together with a relatively modern 
  building.  In addition to residence space, it houses teaching offices, seminar 
  rooms, a lecture hall, an academic skills centre, a library, a computer lab, 
  and study rooms.  The College serves as the base for Trent’s Canadian Studies, 
  Philosophy, English, and Classical Studies Departments.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The Academic Calendar describes Traill as “an active centre for 
  teaching and learning” as both “an integral part of the academic and social 
  life of Trent University as a whole” and “a self-contained and active community”.  
  A thriving visitors’ program supplements its intellectual life, giving members 
  of the College an opportunity to meet informally with writers, artists, professionals, 
  politicians, musicians, and scholars.  As the Calendar again acknowledges, “[t]he 
  college’s proximity to downtown Peterborough has also permitted Traill students 
  to be actively involved in community cultural organizations ... and in organizations 
  working for social change”.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The evidence before us indicates that the presence of the downtown 
  colleges has helped Peterborough to develop a unique and varied cultural, artistic, 
  and theatrical community that provides a significant educational opportunity 
  for students, particularly important for those in Cultural Studies.  </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Another notable aspect of Peter Robinson College is that it serves 
  as a focal point for the activities of native political and cultural groups.  
  Students frequently participate in aboriginal spiritual and cultural events.  
  The evidence suggests that these activities, as well as the proposal adopted 
  in 1998 by the Senate and Board for a First Peoples’ House of Learning and Humanities 
  Centre at Peter Robinson College, would be severely threatened by closure of 
  the College.  </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> There is also evidence that closure of the College would imperil 
  the distinctive interdisciplinary programs that are facilitated by the downtown 
  location of faculty, student, and community resources at Peter Robinson College.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> In my view, the distinctive educational opportunities offered 
  by Peter Robinson and Catharine Parr Traill Colleges reflect Trent’s college-centred, 
  interdisciplinary educational policy.  They are thriving academic institutions, 
  anything but “orphan colleges”.  </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> I would emphasize that the Board’s decision is to close these 
  Colleges, not to relocate them.  The decision cannot, in my view, be characterized 
  simply as selling one or more outdated buildings that are too costly to maintain, 
  a matter that would fall within the Board’s exclusive authority in relation 
  to the management of the University’s property.  The decision is rather to terminate 
  the existence of two of the five colleges that form the basis of a University 
  that has as its educational policy a college-based system.  I would also note 
  that it is by no means clear that either or both of the two closed Colleges 
  will be replaced by new colleges.  We were advised during oral argument that 
  no final decision has been taken on whether to create new colleges in their 
  place at the Symons campus.  </span></p>
<p style='

  </span></span> In my view, the Board’s decision would put an end to the distinctive 
  educational experience offered by the two downtown colleges and, accordingly, 
  would change the educational policy of the University.</span></p>

  </span></span> Administrative interpretation and practice may be used to assist 
  in determining the meaning of legislation and can be an important factor in 
  case of doubt about legislative meaning: R. Sullivan, ed., <i>Driedger on the 
  Construction of Statutes</i>,<i> </i>3d ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1994) at 
  p. 471; <i>Mattabi Mines Ltd. v. Ontario (Minister of Revenue)</i>, [1988] 2 
  S.C.R. 175 at pp.195-196.  As explained by Dickson J. in <i>Nowegijick v. R</i>., 
  [1983] 1 S.C.R. 29 at p. 37: “Administrative policy and interpretation are not 
  determinative but are entitled to weight and can be an ‘important factor’ in 
  case of doubt about the meaning of legislation.”</span></p>

'><span> <span>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The record before this court demonstrates that from an early 
  stage in the history of the University to the present, it has been accepted 
  that Board decisions regarding physical premises had to respect the Senate’s 
  role in establishing educational policy.  This is hardly surprising.  The physical 
  resources required by a university can only be determined in the light of the 
  university’s academic and educational mission.</span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> University buildings exist for no other purpose than to allow 
  the university to achieve its academic and educational goals.  A building that 
  would well serve one educational policy might frustrate the realization of a 
  different educational policy.  A large research-oriented University would require 
  significant investment in libraries and laboratories.  A small University devoted 
  to undergraduate education premised on the college system would require a very 
  different physical plant.  A primarily undergraduate university structured on 
  the model of interdisciplinary, residential colleges will require different 
  premises than a primarily undergraduate university structured around its various 
  academic disciplines.  It follows that decisions regarding physical premises 
  in an academic setting cannot be made purely on the basis of financial or administrative 
  criteria.  Such decisions can only proceed on the basis of the institution’s 
  educational and academic policies and priorities.  The close connection between 
  educational policy and physical premises grows and matures over time and does 
  not end once the initial planning has been done.  An academic community develops 
  its own distinctive character that is more subtle and profound than the list 
  of courses it offers.  That character, and the consequent academic and educational 
  opportunities the academic institution offers, is strongly influenced and shaped 
  by the institution’s physical premises and geographic surroundings. </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> Trent’s founders recognized that academic considerations had 
  to precede any decisions about planning of the University buildings and campus.  
  The premise of Trent’s original planning process was that the physical layout 
  of the University, its architecture, and matters of financial planning had to 
  follow the educational policy of the University.  At the first meeting of the 
  Campus Planning Committee in September 1962, President Symons stated that it 
  was “fundamental to the kind of university Trent is to be that planning of this 
  sort should originate from the responsible academic staff.” </span></p>
<p style='
'><span> <span>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> The record indicates that this approach has been followed in 
  subsequent years, and that the Senate has played a significant role in planning 
  the University’s physical plant.  In 1986-1987, the then President, with the 
  approval of the Board, commissioned a comprehensive space study.  The process 
  included a Senate-Board consultative committee.  The administration undertook 
  to report to Senate as to how the space planning report would “relate to the 
  academic policy of the University, as controlled by Senate”.  Senate was to 
  approve the report before it went to the Board.  The resulting space plan was 
  indeed brought before Senate, where it received unanimous approval, before it 
  was presented to the Board.</span></p>

  </span></span> The current debate about the future of the downtown colleges 
  is anything but new.  As the University’s Task Force on the SuperBuild Growth 
  Fund observed, “the ‘campus consolidation’ [debate] has taken place many times 
  over the years.  When this has occurred, strongly diverging views have emerged 
  regarding the relative merits of maintaining multi-campus structure vs consolidating 
  the University to a single campus location.”  Until the events that led to this 
  proceeding, the Board seems to have recognized and accepted Senate’s active 
  role in planning.  In particular, it appears to have been more or less accepted 
  that the Senate had to approve any initiatives to relocate or close the downtown 
  colleges.  </span></p>

  statutory amendment that requires a specially conducted Senate vote.  That bylaw 
  remains in effect.  There is no indication that the jurisdiction to enact this 
  by-law has been questioned in the ensuing 27 years, during which the status 
  of the downtown colleges has been a matter of on-going debate and concern.

  </span> There can be no doubt that within the present Trent community, there 
  is a strong perception that the decision to close the two downtown colleges 
  implicates in a significant way the University’s educational policy.  While 
  these perceptions are not determinative of the legal issue before the court, 
  neither should they be ignored, particularly as even those proposing closure 
  of the downtown colleges couched their arguments in terms of educational policy.

  </span> The Report of the Task Force that recommended the closure of the two 
  downtown colleges expressly weighed from the perspective of educational policy 
  the benefits and shortcomings of maintaining the downtown colleges.  The Task 
  Force noted the benefits resulting from the flourishing of a distinctive, college-based 
  ethos, the wide diversity in the attributes that the University can offer to 
  its constituents, and the perception of a meaningful link to the Peterborough 
  community.  On the negative side, the Task Force mentioned counterproductive 
  internal rivalry, logistical difficulties, and the blurring of Trent’s image 
  in a way that impedes effective marketing.  It concluded that closing Peter 
  Robinson and Traill Colleges and consolidating the University at the Symons 
  campus “would bring the greatest benefits of an integrated, inter-disciplinary 
  academic community”.  The Task Force’s recommendations plainly did not rest 
  on purely financial grounds but reflected, at least in part, a judgment on educational 
  policy. </p>

  a divided campus.  She acknowledged the “traditions, vitality and contributions

  two downtown colleges has been perceived as engaging the Senate’s authority

  a genuine issue as a citizen in its legal validity; and (3) there is no other 
  reasonable or effective manner to bring the issue before the court.</p>
<p style='

  </span> It is apparent from the earlier portion of my reasons that I find that 
  the appellants’ application for judicial review raises a serious justiciable 
  issue.  It is well established that as statutory bodies, universities are amenable 
  to judicial review where the exercise of a statutory power is challenged: <i>Paine 
  v. University of Toronto</i> (1981), 34 O.R. (2d) 770 (C.A.); <i>Page v. Hull 
  University Visitor</i>, [1993] 1 All E.R. 97 (H.L.).  This is not a case that 
  raises concerns about judicial interference with internal University matters 
  that are best left to be resolved by the University’s own institutional means.  
  The decision at issue does not concern matters of judgment on academic standards 
  and, as I have already observed, there is nothing in the University’s internal 
  scheme of governance that is capable of resolving this dispute. </p>
<p style='
'> [111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The appellants are both directly affected by the decision.  One appellant 
  is a member of the Senate and both head programs at a downtown college.  In 
  any event, they clearly have a genuine interest as citizens in the validity 
  of the administrative decision being challenged.  </p>
<p style='
'> [112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Nor am I persuaded that there is another reasonable or effective manner 
  to bring the issue before the court.  It is not at all clear to me that the 
  application could be brought in the name of the Senate, an unincorporated body 
  that may well lack capacity to bring legal proceedings.  Standing has been recognized 
  in favour of individual members of a university community to challenge the legality 
  of similar Board decisions on the basis that statutory powers have been exceeded: 
  <i>Jeffrey v. Université de Moncton (No.1)</i> (1985), 62 N.B.R. (2d) 413 (N.B. 
  Q.B.).  The appellants can hardly be characterized as “busy-bodies”, bringing 
  an unnecessary meddling type proceeding.  If there is one thing on which the 
  record is clear, it is that the legality of the Board’s actions is a matter 
  of pressing concern that has divided the Trent community.  Whatever view one 
  might take of the rights or wrongs of the Board’s decision, it seems to me to 
  be imperative that its legality be determined once and for all so that the University 
  can get on with its important academic work.  This case is analogous to <i>Energy 
  Probe v. Canada (A.G.)</i> (1989), 68 O.R. (2d) 449 (C.A.) at p. 469 where this 
  court accorded standing to “serious individuals … presenting concerns that are 
  of fundamental significance” in a proceeding that “is not an abuse of the public 
  interest exception, but rather [one that] tends to serve it very well.”</p>
<p style='
'> [113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> For these reasons, I conclude that the appellants satisfy the requirements 
  for public interest standing and the court should exercise its discretion in 
  favour of entertaining the application.</p>
<h4 align=left style='text-align:left'><u>Conclusion</u></h4>
<p style='
'> [114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Board’s decision to close two of Trent’s five residential colleges 
  and eliminate the University’s presence in downtown Peterborough would destroy 
  two of its five constituent distinct intellectual and social communities and 
  would eliminate two of its five centres of learning and focal points of social 
  and cultural activity.  I conclude that the decision to close two of Trent’s 
  five colleges engages an important issue of educational policy for the University 
  that, pursuant to s. 12 of the <i>Trent Act</i>, requires the approval of the 
  Senate.</p>
<p style='
'> [115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I am also of the view that the appellants satisfy the requirements for 
  standing to bring these proceedings.</p>
<p style='
'> [116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the 
  Divisional Court, and substitute an order quashing the resolution of the Board 
  of Governors of Trent University dated November 12, 1999, insofar as it purports 
  to authorize the closure of Peter Robinson College and Catharine Parr Traill 
  College.  I would allow the appellants their costs, both here and below.</p>
