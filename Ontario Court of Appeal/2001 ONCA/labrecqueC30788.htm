  </span> The weight of this appeal rests on the adequacy of the trial judges 
  charge to the jury on reasonable doubt. It is therefore unnecessary to elaborate 
  on the facts other than to observe that the trial was almost entirely a credibility 
  confrontation between the appellant and the young women who gave evidence that 
  they had been assaulted.</p>

  </span> This court has had many occasions to consider the application of the 
  reasons of Cory J. in <i>R. v. Lifchus </i>(1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)  
  and  the Supreme Court of Canada has expounded further upon those reasons in 
  <i>R. v. Starr </i>(2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 449, <i>R. v. Avetysan</i> (2000), 
  149 C.C.C. (3d) 77<i>, R. v. Russell</i> (2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 66 and<i> R. 
  v. Beauchamp </i>(2000), 149 C.C.C. (3d) 58. In essence, these post-<i>Lifchus</i> 
  authorities indicate that appellate courts should review jury charges with an 
  eye to determining whether there has been substantial compliance with the principles 
  delineated in <i>Lifchus.</i></p>

  </span> The charge in this case was delivered on October 6, 1998, following 
  publication of <i>Lifchus</i> and prior to the release of <i>Starr</i>. After 
  commenting on the onus of proof resting upon the Crown, the trial judge instructed 
  the jury on reasonable doubt in the following terms:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an accused person is 
      guilty of the offence with which he or she is charged before he or she can 
      be convicted. If you have a reasonable doubt as to whether the accused committed 
      any one or more of the offences with which he or she is charged, it is your 
      duty to give that accused the benefit of the doubt and find him or her not 
      guilty on such charge or charges. When I speak of reasonable doubt, I use 
      the words in their ordinary natural meaning, not as a legal term having 
      some special connotation. A reasonable doubt is an honest and fair doubt 
      based upon reason and common sense after having considered all of the evidence 
      as a whole. It is a real doubt, not an imaginary or frivolous doubt. Reasonable 
      doubt must not be based upon conjecture or speculation and applies only 
      to essential as opposed to non-essential matters. I will later tell you 
      what the essential matters are in this case.</p>
    <p>Finally, keep in mind that it is rarely possible to prove anything with 
      absolute or mathematical certainty. And so the burden of proof on the Crown 
      is to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This instruction closely resembles the charge to the jury in <i>Starr,</i> 
  which was found not to be in substantial accord with <i>Lifchus</i>. For immediate 
  comparison I set forth the relevant part of that charge, which is quoted in 
  <i>Starr</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 543:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is rarely possible to prove anything with absolute certainty and so 
      the burden of proof on the Crown is only to prove the guilt of the accused 
      beyond reasonable doubt. What, then, is proof beyond a reasonable doubt?</p>
    <p> The words reasonable doubt are used in their everyday, ordinary sense 
      and not as a legal term having some special connotation. The words have 
      no magic meaning that is peculiar to the law. A reasonable doubt is an honest, 
      fair doubt, based upon reason and common sense. It is a real doubt, not 
      an imaginary or frivolous one resting on speculation or guess rather than 
      upon the evidence you heard in this courtroom.</p>
    <p> So you can see, the words reasonable doubt are ordinary words we use 
      in our everyday language. So if you can say, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable 
      doubt, the Crown has met the onus upon it. If you cannot say those words 
       if you cannot say, I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt, the Crown 
      has not met the onus on it, and the accused is entitled to have your doubt 
      resolved in his favour. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> I see no material difference between the two. Both fail to distance 
  reasonable doubt from balance of probability and both speak of it as an expression 
  used in ordinary speech. It is these features that rendered the charge in <i>Starr</i> 
  inconsistent with <i>Lifchus</i> principles, and the charge on reasonable doubt 
  in this case was similarly deficient. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> This does not, however, end the matter, because the Crown did not seek 
  to convince us that the very words of the charge met the <i>Lifchus</i> test. 
  Rather, the Crown argued that an overall perspective of the trial indicates 
  that the jury would have properly understood reasonable doubt. It was submitted 
  that even though the trial judge did not instruct the jury that they could not 
  convict on a balance of probabilities, defence counsel made that clear to them 
  and there was nothing in the trial judges charge that was inconsistent with 
  what they heard in the summing up by defence counsel. A part of the defence 
  closing address on this subject reads:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Theres no room for maybe, possibly, probably or even almost certainly. 
      Proof beyond a reasonable doubt must be proof to a moral certainty. If you 
      think that Maurice Labrecque is probably guilty of each charge, then you 
      must acquit him of each charge. It must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
      to a moral certainty.[I]t must be proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a 
      moral certainty. Probably  probably guilty is not sufficient for a verdict 
      of guilty on any charge. </b>Moral certainty doesnt mean absolute certainty, 
      but it is a necessity for such moral certainty that prevents a jury in a 
      criminal trial from testing the guilt of an accused by that standard of 
      doubt which would influence you in your daily life. <b>In our daily lives, 
      we constantly act on probabilities and we seldom act on moral certainty. 
      It is rudimentary that a jury never convict if the jury simply concludes 
      that a person is probably guilty. </b>To convict a person on a charge, each 
      juror must be able to say He is really guilty, of that I am morally certain. 
       <b>A finding of guilt is never based on speculation or suspicion or probability</b>.Each 
      one of you separately and individually must be satisfied to the point of 
      moral certaintyEach one of you is separately and individually bound in 
      conscience to give him the benefit of any honest doubt you feel. [Emphasis 
      added.]</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Defence counsels discussion of reasonable doubt drew a clear distinction 
  between the civil and criminal standards of proof notwithstanding the reference 
  to moral certainty which was disapproved of in <i>Lifchus</i>. Had the trial 
  judge used similar language, there would have been greater compliance with the 
  <i>Lifchus</i> principles. However, I am hesitant in drawing an inference that 
  a jury has been guided by defence counsel on such a fundamental question of  
  law when the trial judge explicitly told the jury  to  take the law as I give 
  it to you  [and] put aside any notions which you now may have as to relevant 
  legal principles. It is your duty to be guided by my explanation of the law.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Crown relied upon this courts decision in <i>R. v. Wang </i> (2001), 
  153  C.C.C. (3d) 321 where Finlayson J.A. relied in part on defence counsels 
  address to support a trial judges charge as complying in substance with <i>Lifchus</i>. 
  Finlayson J.A. stated, at p. 338:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In any event, as the respondent Crown notes, while the trial judge did 
      not compare and contrast the different standards in the burden of proof 
      as between the criminal and civil contexts, defence counsel amply made this 
      point clear.</p>

<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I note that at pp. 337-38, 
  Finlayson J.A. set forth an independent justification of the charge and his 
  reference to defence counsels address is simply an added observation. He was 
  clearly satisfied that the charge itself conveyed the high standard of proof 
  required to convict. I am not similarly satisfied in the present case.</p>

  </span> Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, there is reason to doubt 
  that the defence closing submission on reasonable doubt impressed itself upon 
  the jury. The two complainants were cross-examined over a period of five days 
  and the trial lasted 12 days. One of the points of appeal is that the trial 
  judge interfered with defence counsel to such an extent that the trial was rendered 
  unfair. A review of the transcript indicates that defence counsel was prolix 
  in the extreme and most, if not all, of the interruptions were justified. This 
  led the jury to deliver three notes of admonition to the trial judge, a level 
  of response that is unprecedented in my experience.</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p> The first note reads:</p>
    <p> Your honor,</p>
    <p>With the greatest respect we have been listening to one witness for 4 days 
      up to now. Could you inform us when this case might wrap up. Could you tell 
      us how many other witnesses will be called. My concern is that this case 
      could be going on much too long. Will the defendant take the stand.</p>
    <p>Thank You </p>
    <p>             The second note from the jury was more impatient:</p>
    <p>Your honor</p>
    <p>We are now at the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> week!!</p>
    <p>The Defence has been on every day (11 days), the prosecution has had less 
      than 1 day. The defence is repeating herself with the same questions to 
      every witness. Even though its the 11<sup>th</sup> day she is still reviewing 
      evidence covered on the 1<sup>st </sup>day. Your honor how much do we need 
      to know about this intersection, truck,  windows, distances etc., etc., 
      etc.</p>
    <p>We have the picture very, very clear. I believe it is unfair to be wasting 
      unnecessary time. How did the defence calculate 1 1/2 wks for the duration 
      of this trial??</p>
    <p>Your honor, the jury is very tired and frustrated with this line of questioning. 
      We would like the Defence to introduce <u>new</u> evidence relevant to the 
      <u>charges</u> in question.</p>
    <p>Lets wrap up this case before we fall asleep!!</p>
    <p>Let the jury do its job.</p>
    <p> The trial judge received a third noted from the jury:</p>
    <p><u>Sir</u>,</p>
    <p>With respect to the court, the iteration and reiteration of questions from 
      defence counsel to the video expert [i.e. Boris] is irritating and has little 
      or no relevance to this trial. We seem to have taken an hour to confirm 
      data which the jury can understand in a minute.</p>

  </span> These three communications indicate that the members of the jury were 
  exasperated by the delays caused by defence counsel. Given this outspoken reaction 
  from the jury, it is hardly arguable that defence counsels words as to the 
  burden of proof would cast a shadow on the charge by the trial judge. When coupled 
  with the trial judges direction to ignore legal principles derived from other 
  sources, these expressions of frustration suggest that it would be dangerous 
  to assume that the jury accepted much of what it was told about reasonable doubt 
  from defence counsel.</p>

  </span> The Crown quite rightly did not rely on the curative proviso in s.686(1)(b)(iii) 
  of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The burden of proof lies at the heart of the case 
  and a failure to accurately communicate its meaning renders the trial unfair.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'> [13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> There were other grounds of appeal but none that are likely to arise 
  at a new trial and, therefore, it is unnecessary to deal with them. The appeal 
  should be allowed, the conviction and sentence set aside and a new trial directed.</p>
