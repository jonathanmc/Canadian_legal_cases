  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>This is an appeal from the judgment of the Divisional 
  Court (reported at (1999), 48 O.R. (3d) 50 (in English) and [1999] O.J. No. 
  4489 (in French)) quashing the directions of the Health Services Restructuring 
  Commission (the “Commission”) ordering the respondent Hôpital Montfort (“Montfort”) 
  to substantially reduce its health services.<span>  </span>The Court remitted 
  the question of restructuring of health services at Montfort to the Commission 
  for reconsideration in accordance with the Court’s decision.<span>  </span>The 
  Minister of Health (“Ontario”) has now replaced the Commission.<span>  </span>Ontario 
  appeals on the basis that the Divisional Court erred in fact and in law in ordering 
  it to reconsider its directions to Montfort.<span>  </span>Montfort cross-appeals 
  from the decision of the Divisional Court holding that the Commission’s directions 
  did not infringe the equality guarantees in s. 15 of the <i>Charter of Rights 
  and Freedoms</i>.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>This appeal raises important issues in relation 
  to the language rights of Ontario’s francophone minority.<span>  </span>Montfort, 
  located in Ottawa, is the only hospital in Ontario in which the working language 
  is French and where services in French are available on a full-time basis.<span>  
  </span>Montfort serves as the community hospital for the substantial francophone 
  community of eastern Ontario and also plays a unique role in the education and 
  training of French-speaking health care professionals.<span>  </span>The Divisional 
  Court held that as the Commission’s directions would cripple Montfort as an 
  important francophone institution, they should be quashed on the ground that 
  the Commission failed to respect the unwritten constitutional principle of respect 
  for and protection of minorities.<span>  </span>Ontario appeals, arguing that 
  linguistic rights are exhaustively defined by the written text of the Constitution.<span>  
  </span>As Montfort is not protected by the words of the Constitution, Ontario 
  says that the Commission was free to alter its status.<span>  </span>Montfort 
  and the intervenors urge us to uphold the decision of the Divisional Court.<span>  
  </span>They also rely on the quasi-constitutional protections of the <i>French 
  Language Services Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F. 32 (“<i>F.L.S.A</i>.”), and say 
  that the Divisional Court erred in rejecting their claim that Montfort is protected 
  by s.&nbsp;15 of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Montfort is located in the eastern part of Ottawa-Carleton.<span>  
  </span>Approximately 80% of Ottawa’s francophone population lives east of the 
  Rideau river.<span>  </span>Montfort draws the most significant portion of its 
  caseload from neighbourhoods in close proximity to the hospital.<span>  </span>Russell 
  County, a high-growth area with a population of 34,761, according to the 1991 
  census, has no hospital.<span>  </span>The population relies entirely on Montfort 
  and the Ottawa General Hospital for hospital services.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>Montfort is described in the reasons of the 
  Divisional Court, at pp. 58-60, as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote> 
    <p><span lang=EN-US><span>            </span>Hôpital Montfort was founded 
      in 1953 through the efforts of leaders of the Franco-Ontarian community 
      under the direction of a religious order of nuns, the Daughters of Wisdom.<span>  
      </span>Unlike other hospitals in the Ottawa area which were English or designated 
      bilingual, Montfort was a homogeneous francophone hospital.<span>  </span>Although 
      today it also provides bilingual services in English, its medical services 
      and training are essentially francophone.<span>  </span>Moreover, the hospital 
      plays an important role in the Franco-Ontarian community as a whole.<span>  
      </span>It is the <i>only</i> hospital in Ontario to provide a wide range 
      of medical services and training in a truly francophone setting.<span>  
      </span>In 1975 Montfort adopted an official policy regarding its francophone 
      nature, based upon the following premises:</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(a)<span>    </span>that its francophone character was its <i>raison 
      d’être</i>;</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(b)<span>    </span>that it was necessary to offer all hospital services 
      in French; and</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US>(c)</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol'><span> </span></span><span lang=EN-US><span>   </span>that 
      it was necessary to offer a complete range of medical care, except for certain 
      highly specialized services already available elsewhere in the region.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US><span>         </span>When the Commission began its work in Ottawa-Carleton 
      in July 1996, there were nine public hospitals providing services on 11 
      main sites.<span>  </span>These included seven acute care hospitals, six 
      of which maintained emergency departments.<span>  </span>Hôpital Montfort 
      was one of these six acute care hospitals.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US><span>            </span>Montfort has a total bed capacity 
      of 252 beds.<span>  </span>However, as of 1995-96, 56 of these beds had 
      been taken out of use.<span>  </span>Montfort provides services … at the 
      primary and secondary level … .<span>  </span>Some of its principal programs 
      include cardiology, surgery, pulmonary medicine, orthopaedics and obstetrics.<span>  
      </span>It offers emergency care. … Although it does not provide services 
      in certain specific highly specialized areas, Hôpital Montfort truly qualifies 
      as a full service “general hospital” and is perceived as such by the community 
      at large.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US><span>            </span>Montfort is a unique health care 
      institution in Ontario for a variety of reasons.<span>  </span>First, it 
      has a different history than other hospitals established in the eastern 
      part of Ontario by various orders of nuns.<span>  </span>Although all were 
      originally francophone institutions, the others have since become either 
      English hospitals (<i>e.g</i>., Hotel Dieu in Kingston) or bilingual hospitals 
      (<i>e.g.</i>, Ottawa General).<span>  </span>Only Montfort continues as 
      a francophone institution in Ottawa-Carleton.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US><span>            </span>Although Montfort lost its paediatrics 
      department in 1974, following the creation of the Children’s Hospital of 
      Eastern Ontario (“CHEO”), it continued to grow in size and to expand its 
      range of services.<span>  </span>It is significant –– both from the perspective 
      of the Hospital’s own view of its mandate, and in relation to the community’s 
      sense of that mandate –– that following the loss of its paediatrics specialty, 
      Montfort re-emphasized its commitment to continue as a francophone institution, 
      offering all levels of health care services in French and, as noted above, 
      declaring its francophone character to be its very “<i>raison d’être</i>”.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US><span>            </span>In 1984, Montfort began offering 
      bilingual services.<span>  </span>Today 20 per cent of its patients are 
      anglophone.<span>  </span>However, the working language of Montfort was 
      at all times and remains French.<span>  </span>Over 95 per cent of its employees 
      are capable of providing services in French.<span>  </span>Thus, doctors, 
      nurses, cafeteria employees, caretakers and others touching all aspects 
      and areas of Montfort’s services work in French.<span>  </span>A person 
      walking in the halls of Montfort hears the French language spoken as the 
      language of choice.<span>  </span>All internal communications –– verbal 
      or written –– are in French.<span>  </span>With rare exceptions all administrative 
      and medical meetings take place in the French language and the minutes of 
      such meetings are written in that language.<span>  </span>Consultations, 
      diagnoses, and communications with patients are in French.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US><span>            </span>This is unique in Ottawa-Carleton 
      and, indeed, in the province of Ontario.</span><span></span></p>

  </span></span> <span>Some further brief description and elaboration on Montfort’s 
  services is in order. As indicated, Montfort is a community hospital with approximately 
  196 beds in use.<span>  </span>It provides primary </span><span
lang=EN-GB>health care services (<i>i.e.</i>, care provided by a health care worker 
  on a patient’s first contact with the health care system, including emergency 
  services), secondary care (<i>i.e</i>., care provided by a specialist health 
  care professional, such as a general surgeon), and, according to the Commission’s 
  February 1997 report at p. 34, some tertiary level care (<i>i.e.</i>, care that 
  requires highly specialized skills, technology, and support services). </span><span><span> </span>In 
  addition, Montfort provides intensive care, treatment and referral services, 
  and outpatient or clinical activities.<span>  </span>In addition to cardiology, 
  surgery, orthopaedics and obstetrics, another of its principal inpatient programs 
  was psychiatry.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>Montfort also fills an important educational role.<span>  
  </span>In conjunction with the University of Ottawa, Montfort offers a training 
  program for health care providers who have chosen to be trained in French.<span>  
  </span>Montfort currently accommodates 186 students in Health Sciences, including 
  students in physiotherapy and occupational therapy, medical clerks and residents 
  in family medicine.<span>  </span>Many of the family physicians that admit patients 
  requiring hospitalization to one of the family medicine beds at the hospital 
  are actively involved in the family medicine training program for residents 
  and undergraduate medical students.<span>  </span>Once admitted, patients may 
  require the services of a specialist or a surgeon who would also be involved 
  with students and residents.<span>  </span>T</span><span lang=EN-GB>he training 
  program at Montfort has ramifications that go beyond Ottawa-Carleton and the 
  neighbouring Eastern district.<span>  </span>For example, a doctor trained at 
  Montfort may serve the large francophone populations in the Northern Ontario 
  communities of Hearst and Kapuskasing.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The respondents emphasize that the institutional 
  importance of Montfort to Ontario’s francophone minority extends beyond the 
  health care and educational needs of the francophone minority.<span>  </span>Montfort, 
  they say, is an institution that embodies and evokes the French presence in 
  Ontario.<span>  </span>It is asserted that the French speaking minority population 
  is constantly faced with the threat of assimilation.<span>  </span>The respondents 
  led evidence, accepted by the Divisional Court, to show that a linguistic minority’s 
  institutions are essential to the survival and vitality of this community, not 
  only for its practical functions, but also for the affirmation and expression 
  of cultural identity and sense of belonging.<span>  </span>Montfort, they insist, 
  is such an institution.</span></p>

  profile of Ottawa-Carleton.<span>  </span>Under this heading the Commission 
  noted that based on 1991 census data the population of the Ottawa-Carleton region 
  was 18.4% francophone.<span>  </span>In neighbouring counties served by Ottawa-Carleton 
  hospitals the francophone population was reported at 20.9%.<span>  </span>(This 
  figure is significantly lower than the stated figure of the Eastern District 
  Health Council which puts the rate at 44%.)<span>  </span>Many people who work 
  in Ottawa live in Quebec.<span>  </span>The report noted that the Western Quebec 
  population in the Outaouais region were significant users of Ottawa hospital 
  services.<span>  </span>Among the community hospitals, Montfort was the community 
  hospital used by the vast majority of Quebec residents.<span>  </span>In terms 
  of actual numbers, two teaching hospitals, Ottawa General and Ottawa Civic, 
  had higher admissions from Quebec particularly for secondary and tertiary care.<span>  
  </span>The report stated at p. 10 that:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Issues of access to services respecting the cultural and

      of Eastern Ontario.<span>  </span>It is the majority language in Prescott-Russell

      Stormont and Glengarry, the City of Cornwall and the Township of Winchester 
      in Dundas County are designated under the <i>French Language Services (FLS) 
      Act</i>.<span>  </span>Consequently, planning and development of health 
      services must be consistent with the provisions of the Act.</span></p>
    <p><b><span lang=EN-US>a)<span>   </span>Respecting Culture and Language</span></b></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US><span>      </span>While the Report mentions community representation 
      and regard for demographic, linguistic and cultural characteristics of the 
      Ottawa-Carleton region as well as identifying the facilities which have 
      complete and partial designations under the <i>FLS Act</i>, it does not 
      fully address the objectives of the <i>Act</i>.<span>  </span>The <i>FLS 
      Act</i> is designed to help preserve the French language and culture in 
      Ontario well into the future.<span>  </span>It also acknowledges the desire 
      of the Francophone community to have the long-standing contribution of their 
      language and culture recognized. <b><span> </span></b>Health services in

      to the recognition of its full and equal partnership.<span>  </span>A community

      members and to society in general.</span></p>
    <p><b><i><span lang=EN-US>Recommendation:<span>  </span>That the HSRC take 
      into account the need to preserve l’Hôpital Montfort since it is the only

      communities of Ottawa-Carleton and of Russell County.</span></i></b></p>

    <p><span
lang=EN-US><span>      </span>The permanency and quality of health services in 
      French is determined by the availability of French-speaking health professionals.<span>  
      </span>Recognizing this, the government of Ontario set up the “<i>Ontario-Quebec 
      Health Study Program</i>” to increase the number of French-speaking health 
      professionals available to provide health services in French.<span>  </span>By 
      applying to participate in this program, French-speaking Ontarians increase 
      their chances of being admitted to limited-enrolment programs in health 
      studies in Quebec, which are not available in French in Ontario.<span>  
      </span>In recent years, the number of Ontario colleges and universities 
      offering health studies in French has also increased, encouraging even more 
      French-speaking students in Ontario to pursue careers in the health field.</span></p>
    <p><span
lang=EN-US><span>      </span>Unfortunately, for the clinical component, very 
      few hospitals in Ontario are able to offer an environment in which French-speaking 
      students can actually work in French.<span>  </span>If this kind of work 
      environment is not available in Ontario, the above initiatives seem futile.<span>  
      </span>Such a situation serves to perpetuate Ontario’s dependence on outside 
      sources to provide training in French.</span></p>
    <p><b><i><span lang=EN-US>Recommendation:<span>  </span>That the HSRC take 
      into account the need to maintain l’Hôpital Montfort for its unique role

    <p><span
lang=EN-US>The process by which a hospital achieves a mandate to offer services

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Commission’s (HSRC’s) August report, however, 
  did significantly affect Montfort’s program configuration.<span>  </span>The 
  following extract from pp. 14-15 of the report dealt with the programs offered 
  by Montfort and the proposal to change them:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The largest inpatient program of the hospital in 1995/96 
      was psychiatry. <span> </span>The hospital provides both acute and longer-term 
      mental health care.<span>  </span>The HSRC supports the need to continue 
      to provide French language mental health services at the Hôpital Montfort 
      in a French language environment, to serve the needs of the unilingual francophone.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Hôpital Montfort’s second largest inpatient program 
      is cardiology.<span>  </span>To ensure greater integration of cardiology 
      and cardiac services, the HSRC directs that the program be moved to the 
      University of Ottawa Heart Institute and that the Institute become fully 
      designated under the French Language Services Act as soon as possible.<span>  
      </span>The Heart Institute, with its critical mass and concentration of 
      expertise, will be able to provide patients with a full range of cardiac 
      care services.<span>  </span>Concentrating inpatient services on one site 
      will also reduce transfers and expedite surgical intervention if required.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The Hôpital Montfort will continue to provide outpatient 
      cardiology services.<span>  </span>To improve communications between the 
      facilities, the Heart Institute and the Hôpital Montfort should explore 
      effective ways to share information, particularly diagnostic and other patient 
      care information.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>Low risk obstetrics is another program of sufficient size 
      to be maintained and enhanced on the Montfort site. …</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The hospital’s day care and primary care ambulatory services 
      will also be preserved. … The HSRC will direct Hôpital Montfort to seek 
      an affiliation with The Ottawa Hospital/ L’Hôpital d’Ottawa to provide support 
      for the services which are not available on a 24 hour basis at the Hôpital 
      Montfort and clinical back up for the programs it does provide (<i>e.g.</i> 
      day surgery and obstetrics).</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>All other inpatient activity at the Hôpital Montfort will 
      be transferred to the Alta Vista site of The Ottawa Hospital/ L’Hôpital 
      d’Ottawa, where the programs can be integrated with those currently provided 
      at the site.</span></p>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>The HSRC strongly endorses Hôpital Montfort’s role as 
      a teaching facility providing a French milieu for the education of physicians 
      and other health professionals and the training of resident physicians in 
      family medicine and other health care professionals.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>With respect to Montfort’s role as a teaching 
  facility, the Commission at pp. 73-74 directed the creation of an Academic Coordinating 
  Body composed of the Ottawa teaching hospitals (General and Civic) and the University 
  of Ottawa, with the participation of the French Language Health Services Network, 
  a network that the Commission directed Montfort to establish and lead.<span>  
  </span>The Academic Coordinating Body was to be responsible for “ensuring health 
  professionals have access to opportunities for education and training in French.”<span>  
  </span>The report further noted, at p. 74:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>While medical residents and other professionals will have 
      the opportunity to be educated and to train in a primary care environment 
      in the ambulatory setting at Hôpital Montfort, they will also require training 
      in other designated facilities.<span>  </span>The University of Ottawa, 
      the French Language Health Services Network and the Academic Coordinating

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Commission therefore recognized that, as

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>To summarize, Montfort would go from receiving 
  funds for a 196-bed general community hospital to a hospital receiving funds 
  for 51 mental health beds and 15 low-risk obstetrical beds.<span>  </span>It 
  would no longer provide emergency, intensive care, and general surgery services 
  associated with short-term hospital admission.<span>  </span>It would also no 
  longer offer short-term admission and treatment for a variety of ailments in 
  family medicine or internal medicine.<span>  </span>Cardiology, its second largest 
  program, would be transferred to the General campus of the amalgamated Ottawa 
  Hospital and the Heart Centre there was given a direction to obtain designation 
  under the <i>F.L.S.A. </i><span> </span>It would offer “urgent care”, a form

  as a community hospital despite the recommendations of both the Ottawa-Carleton 
  and Eastern Ontario Health Councils that Montfort continue to operate as a community 
  hospital to meet the needs of the francophone community.<span>  </span>Although 
  the University of Ottawa stated that the environment necessary for clinical 
  teaching of health care professionals included a francophone community hospital 
  setting, the Commission did not restore the services that it had directed be 
  removed and that made Montfort a general community hospital.<span>  </span>Although 
  the Commission professed to strongly endorse Montfort’s role as a teaching facility 
  for physicians in family medicine, it did not restore the family medicine beds 
  it had directed be taken away from Montfort.<span>  </span>The Commission gave 
  no explanation for the gap between its stated intentions and its directions.</span></p>

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>In September 1997, the Ottawa-Carleton Regional 
  District Health Council made a further representation to the Commission.<span>  
  </span>It noted that the opening of long-term care psychiatric beds at Montfort 
  would fill a gap in services in French.<span>  </span>The Council asked for 
  clarification of the mandate of the French Language Health Services Network.<span>  
  </span>It expressed concern that the diminished role of Montfort would entirely 
  eliminate the possibility of training certain categories of professionals in 
  French (examples given were general nurses and druggists).<span>  </span>It 
  recommended that Montfort be assigned a sufficient number of acute care beds 
  in internal and family medicine to permit it to maintain the critical mass of 
  patients it needed to offer a clinical education.<span>  </span>It further recommended 
  that the Commission give the Working Group charged with implementing the Directions 
  a mandate that clearly included responsibility for the provision of health care 
  services in French and that the Commission oversee a plan that clearly defined 
  the linguistic requirements for all positions in hospitals designated bilingual.<span>  
  </span>Additional funds for the costs of providing services in both official 
  languages were requested on an ongoing permanent basis for institutions designated 
  under the <i>F.L.S.A.</i><span>  </span>Finally, the Council recommended that, 
  to satisfy the requirements of the <i>F.L.S.A.</i>, no service or program be 
  transferred from Montfort until the Council, through its French Language Services 
  Committee, had confirmed that the transferee institution satisfied the requirements

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

  </span></span> <span>In its reasons quashing the directions of the Commission, 
  the Divisional Court made three important findings of fact.<span>  </span>First, 
  the Divisional Court found that the effect of the Commission’s directions was 
  to reduce the availability of health care services in French to the francophone 
  population in the Ottawa-Carleton region, a region designated as bilingual under 
  the <i>F.L.S.A</i>.<span>  </span>Secondly, the Divisional Court found that 
  the Commission’s directives affected the training program for doctors in the 
  French language and placed insurmountable obstacles on the ability of medical 
  personnel, particularly doctors, to become trained to adequately serve people 
  in the French language.<span>  </span>The Divisional Court found, thirdly, that 
  the Commission saw the importance of continued French language medical services 
  only in terms of the provision of bilingual services, but did not evaluate the 
  importance and need for a truly francophone institution or consider the broader 
  institutional role played by Montfort in helping to protect the francophone 
  population from assimilation.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>Montfort made three legal submissions before the Divisional 
  Court.<span>  </span>First, Montfort contended that the directions issued respecting 
  Montfort violated s. 15 of the <i>Charter.</i><span>  </span>The Divisional 
  Court dismissed this submission, holding that any differential treatment was 
  not based upon the analogous grounds enumerated in s. 15.<span>  </span>As we 
  have indicated, Montfort has cross-appealed this portion of the Divisional Court’s 
  judgment.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>Second, Montfort submitted that the Commission’s directions 
  should be invalidated on administrative law principles because they were patently 
  unreasonable.<span>  </span>The Divisional Court stressed that its role was 
  a very limited one.<span>  </span>It was only to decide whether the Commission 
  acted according to law in arriving at its decision.<span>  </span>The Divisional 
  Court rejected the submission that, apart from the constitutional grounds, the 
  Commission’s directions were “patently unreasonable” or “clearly irrational”, 
  the test the parties agreed was applicable.<span>  </span>Montfort has not cross-appealed 
  this portion of the Divisional Court’s judgment.</span></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> <span>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span></span> <span>Third, and most significantly, Montfort argued that the 
  Commission’s directions should be set aside because they violated one of the 
  fundamental organizing principles of the Constitution, the principle of respect 
  for and protection of minorities – in this case, a minority belonging to one 
  of the country’s founding cultures.<span>  </span>The Divisional Court accepted 
  this submission and quashed the directions.<span>  </span>The Court found at 
  p. 70 that Montfort’s designation under the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> gave the francophone 
  community a legislatively recognized right to receive health services in “a 
  truly francophone environment”, a right that included the facilities necessary 
  for the education and training of health care professionals in French.<span>  
  </span>The essence of the Divisional Court’s decision is found in its conclusion 
  at pp. 83- 84 as follows:</span></p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span>Directions which replace a wide variety of truly francophone medical 
      services and training at Montfort with services and training elsewhere in 
      a bilingual setting – however well those bilingual facilities may appear 
      to work in any given case – fail to conform to the principle underlying 
      our constitution which calls for the protection of francophone minority 
      rights.<span>  </span>This is the flaw in the Commission’s deliberations 
      and in the directions emanating from them.</span></p>
    <p><span>…</span></p>
    <p><span>Given the constitutional mandate for the protection and respect of 
      minority rights – an ‘independent principle underlying our constitution’, 
      a ‘powerful normative force’ – it was not open to the Commission to proceed 
      on a ‘restructured health services’ mandate only, and to ignore the broader 
      institutional role played by Hôpital Montfort as a truly francophone centre, 
      necessary to promote and enhance the Franco-Ontarian identity as a cultural/linguistic 
      minority in Ontario, and to protect that culture from assimilation.<span>  
      </span>We find this is what the Commission did.<span>  </span>Accordingly, 
      its directions cannot stand.</span></p>

</span> Ontario argues that the Divisional Court erred in making certain crucial 
factual findings. We note at the outset that Montfort successfully moved to strike 
from the notice of appeal certain grounds of appeal related to the Divisional 
Court's factual findings. However, in making that order, Charron J.A. noted in 
her endorsement that &quot;the extent to which [the remaining grounds of appeal] 
… require a consideration of the evidentiary basis will be a matter for the panel 
to determine.&quot; Appellate courts are often required to consider legislative 
or social facts which form the basis for constitutional arguments: see RJR-Macdonald 
Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 199 at 286-289 per La Forest 
J. Accordingly, we are prepared to consider Ontario's argument that there is an 
insufficient basis for the conclusion reached by the Divisional Court.

  </span> Ontario submits that the Commission’s directions ensured that those 
  health care services that would no longer be available at Montfort would continue 
  to be available in French at other health care institutions in the region.  
  These institutions were either designated as bilingual or ordered to become 
  bilingual.  This issue can be disposed of summarily. </p>

  </span> Montfort is the only hospital in Ontario that can guarantee continuous 
  access to a broad range of primary and secondary health care services in French.  
  Other health care institutions in the Ottawa-Carleton region cannot do so.  
  While the Ottawa General is designated under the <i>F.L.S.A.,</i> the Ottawa 
  Civic, with which it is merged, is only partially designated.  The Commission 
  ordered the amalgamated hospital to attain designation under the <i>F.L.S.A.</i>  
  The Heart Institute, now part of the merged Ottawa Hospital and to which the 
  Commission ordered Montfort’s cardiology programs transferred, does not have 
  any designation under the <i>F.L.S.A.</i>  It too was ordered to attain designation.  
  Even at the Ottawa General, a designated centre under the <i>F.L.S.A.</i>, health 
  care services are not available in French on a full-time basis in all areas.  
  The Commission’s August 1997 report  acknowledged that the quality of services 
  in French offered by designated health care providers other than Montfort varied 
  dramatically despite the fact of designation under the <i>F.L.S.A</i>. </p>

  </span></span> Ontario’s submission that health care services to the francophone 
  population would not be reduced by the implementation of the Commission’s directions 
  ignores reality.  Ontario submitted that the situation would gradually improve 
  with the implementation of the Commission’s directions to the transferee health 
  care providers and that patience was required.  Good intentions are not a substitution 
  for fact.  Four years after the Commission’s recommendations, the health care 
  providers directed by the Commission to become designated as offering bilingual 
  services have not yet achieved that designation and may never do so.</p>

  </span></span> The Divisional Court’s finding that the Commission’s directions 
  for restructuring Montfort would reduce the availability of health care services 
  in French to the francophone population in the Ottawa-Carleton region cannot 
  be disturbed.  Further, the evidence also establishes that Montfort offers significant 
  services outside the Ottawa-Carleton region to the outlying francophone rural 
  communities of eastern Ontario for whom it is the closest major hospital.  The 
  ability of these communities to receive the present range of health care services 
  in French would also be adversely affected if the Commission’s directives were 
  implemented.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>[64]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This finding is supported by 
  several sources.  Two of them are Dean Walker, the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine 
  at the University of Ottawa, and the Restructuring Coordination Task Force for 
  Ottawa-Carleton.  They are concerned that the Commission’s directions removing 
  emergency services, inpatient surgical activity and the acute care beds needed 
  to support these services mean that Montfort will no longer be able to offer 
  many of the rotations required for family medicine residency.  Dr. Frenette, 
  the expert from the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Laval consulted 
  by the Restructuring Coordination Task Force, estimated (supported by Dean Walker) 
  that 50 acute care beds were required for a sufficient educational exposure 
  to common primary and secondary diagnoses.  Without a sufficient number of acute 
  care beds, other health care professionals would no longer be interested in 
  being trained in French at Montfort because there would not be a large enough 
  clientele to attract their services. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ontario presented evidence from Dr. Ruth Wilson, Head of the Department 
  of Family Medicine at Queen’s University, that reconfiguration of Montfort in 
  accordance with the Commision’s directions would enable Montfort to continue 
  to provide an appropriate setting for training family medicine residents.  Dr. 
  Nick Busing, the Chair of the Department of Family Medicine at the University 
  of Ottawa, filed an affidavit in response disagreeing.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ontario submits that the Divisional Court misconstrued Dr. Wilson’s 
  evidence.  Dr. Wilson was of the opinion that, with proper monitoring, Montfort 
  would continue to provide an appropriate setting for family medicine residents 
  to complete the same number of rotations they currently do, namely, six of seven.  
  The Divisional Court indicated it was aware of her opinion that the training 
  program would continue to function as before.  The Court however stated at p. 
  64 that “she [Dr. Wilson] was concerned about the removal of services and conceded 
  that whether there would be a sufficient variety of conditions and of patients 
  was a matter that would have to be monitored.”  This sentence is in reference 
  to the fact that Dr. Wilson’s opinion was qualified by the words “with proper 
  monitoring”.  The impugned sentence does not indicate that the Divisional Court 
  misconstrued her evidence but only that her evidence was given with a qualification 
  that, in the Court’s opinion, was a very important one. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court was entitled to prefer the evidence submitted by 
  the respondents over that put forward by Ontario.  We do not agree that, in 
  doing so, the Court placed undue emphasis on speculative as opposed to demonstrable 
  concerns. Indeed, the Commission’s August 1997 report provides further support 
  for the Divisional Court’s finding.  It will be recalled that in that report, 
  the Commission noted that medical residents and other professionals would “also 
  require training in other designated facilities” in addition to the primary 
  care environment at Montfort.  The Commission itself  recognized that Montfort 
  would no longer be able to fulfill its function of training health care professionals 
  in the French language because it would no longer operate as a community hospital 
  offering secondary services.  Outside of Montfort, clinical training is only 
  offered in English.  The Commission left it to the University and the Academic 
  Coordinating Body, with input from the French Language Health Services Network, 
  to resolve the problem.  In other words, there would be a void unless these 
  bodies could come up with a solution themselves. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span></span> <span lang=EN-GB>The Divisional Court’s finding that implementation 
  of the Commission’s directions would jeopardize the entire program of training 
  doctors in French, as well as the training of many other health care professionals, 
  is amply supported by the evidence.</span></p>
<h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US><i>(c) 
  Montfort’s broader institutional role</i></span></h4>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court held at p. 76 that the fact that adequate, existing 
  health services and medical training in a truly francophone environment would 
  be taken away would have “a significant a negative impact on the continuing 
  vitality of that community, its language and its culture.”  In coming to its 
  conclusion, the Court relied on the evidence of Drs. Raymond Breton and Roger 
  Bernard, two sociologists with expertise in social trends affecting the existence 
  and viability of minority communities.  Their evidence was that although hospitals 
  are not institutions of the most important order to a culture, they are nevertheless 
  “very important in the network of institutions of a minority culture” and serve 
  as a means of expressing and affirming cultural identity.  Ontario called no 
  evidence in this regard. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ontario submits that hospitals are not institutions that prevent assimilation 
  because people do not frequent them regularly for lengthy intervals.  Ontario 
  submits that the experts’ analyses of Montfort’s broader institutional role 
  is abstract, highly speculative, not firmly rooted in fact, and inextricably 
  linked to the language of politics.  As a result, Ontario submits that the court 
  erred in accepting their opinions.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> In our opinion, the Divisional Court did not err in its consideration 
  or appreciation of the evidence of Drs. Breton and Bernard.  We agree that Montfort 
  has a broader institutional role than the provision of health care services.  
  Apart from fulfilling the additional practical function of medical training, 
  Montfort’s larger institutional role includes maintaining the French language, 
  transmitting francophone culture, and fostering solidarity in the Franco-Ontarian 
  minority.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ontario argues that the Commission did in fact take into consideration 
  Montfort’s larger institutional role in issuing its directions and that this 
  was all the Commission was obliged to do.  We have already referred to the letter 
  written by Dr. Sinclair, the president of the Commission, dated February 22, 
  1999, and addressed to Ms. de Courville Nicol, the president of the board of 
  directors of Montfort.  The Divisional Court relied on that letter at p. 75 
  of its reasons stating:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In that letter, Dr. Sinclair admitted the Commission had not addressed 
      the question of the necessity for homogeneous institutions for a linguistic 
      minority.  He took the position that such a question fell outside the mandate 
      of the Commission…</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>We agree that this is the effect of Dr. Sinclair’s letter. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Dr. Sinclair was correct that the Commission’s mandate made no mention 
  of Montfort’s institutional role (an important part of which comprised training 
  for healthcare providers in the French language).  The Commission was, however, 
  specifically mandated to have regard to District Health Council reports.  These 
  reports were sensitive to the importance of Montfort as an institution and recommended 
  that Montfort continue to function as a community hospital.  The Commission’s 
  original directions in February 1997 completely disregarded the Ottawa-Carleton 
  District Health Council’s recommendations with respect to Montfort.  The Commission’s 
  subsequent report and directions reflect an attempt to create a patchwork solution 
  in response to further submissions from the Ottawa-Carleton and Eastern District 
  Health Councils.  No reasons were ever given by the Commission for refusing 
  to follow the recommendations of the District Health Councils.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> As we have indicated at the outset of these reasons, the Commission 
  also had the authority, incorporated by reference to the relevant sections under 
  the <i>Public Hospitals Act</i>, to issue any direction relating to a public 
  hospital it considered to be in the public interest.  The preservation and promotion 
  of the French language in regard to community health care by the only francophone 
  institution performing this role was part of the public interest to which the 
  Commission ought to have had regard.  The Commission should also have had regard 
  to the public interest raised by the fact that Montfort’s institutional role 
  had province-wide implications that went beyond the local health care concerns 
  of Ottawa-Carleton.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Divisional Court did not err in its finding of fact concerning the 
  importance of the broader institutional role played by Montfort and the adverse 
  impact of the Commission’s directions on that role.  The Commission appears 
  to have been unaware of Montfort’s broader institutional role when it issued 
  its first report, particularly its teaching role; and as we have noted, the 
  Commission took a limited view of its mandate throughout. </p>

  </span></span> The <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i> contains specific language 
  rights, as does the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  The Constitution’s 
  specific language rights are not directly at issue in this appeal.  They do,

  An Act to Amend the Education Act (Ont.</i>), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 1148 at 1173-4, 
  Wilson J. observed that the protection of religious minorities was a “major 
  preoccupation” at the time of Confederation and the rights accorded to protect 
  these minorities from hostile majorities, in the words of Duff J. in <i>Reference

  </span></span> While the text of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867 </i>focused on 
  religious minorities, the minority Catholic community in Ontario at that time 
  was, to a significant extent, also the minority francophone community and linguistic 
  and denominational characteristics were typically twinned.  As Gonthier J. observed 
  in <i>Reference re Education Act (Que.)</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 511 at 529-30:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Section 93 is unanimously recognized as the expression of a desire for

  </span></span> Fifty years after Confederation, in a highly controversial decision, 
  the Privy Council held that s. 93 was limited to denominational protection and 
  included no minority language protection: <i>Trustees of the Roman Catholic 
  Separate Schools for the Ottawa Separate Schools Trustees v. Mackell</i>, [1917]

  </span></span> It should be mentioned as well that certain features of the <i>Constitution 
  Act, 1867</i> for the protection of minorities may have fallen into disuse, 
  but they still may be taken as expressions of the fundamental constitutional 
  importance attached to the protection of the French and Catholic minority outside 
  Quebec.  Linguistic and religious minorities were exposed to the risk that their 
  interests might be ignored at the provincial level, but there is little doubt 
  that it was implicit in the Confederation bargain that they could look to the 
  federal government for constitutional protection.  In the case of diminution 
  of religious education rights by a provincial government, s. 93(3) gave the 
  adherents of the religious minority a right of appeal to the federal cabinet, 
  and by s.&nbsp;93(4), Parliament had the right to enact remedial legislation.  
  The federal power of disallowance (ss. 55-57, 90) was available where the legitimate 
  interests of those minorities were imperiled by provincial action.</p>

  of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>in<i> </i>1982.  Section 
  16(1) of the <i>Charter</i> proclaimed English and French to be the official 
  languages of Canada with equality of status and equal rights of use “in all 
  institutions of the Parliament and government of Canada.”  The same status and 
  rights are also accorded to English and French in New Brunswick.  Section 16.1, 
  added by amendment in 1993, guarantees the equal status, rights, and privileges 
  of the English and French linguistic communities of New Brunswick.  The right 
  to use English or French in Parliament and in the legislature of New Brunswick 
  is conferred by s. 17 and provision is made for the publication of the statutes, 
  records and journals of those bodies in s. 18.  The right to use English or 
  French in any court established by Parliament and in the courts of New Brunswick 
  is guaranteed by s. 19.  The right to communicate with and receive available 
  services from the governments of Canada and New Brunswick in either official 
  language is detailed in s. 20.</p>

  </span></span> Montfort adopts an argument based on s. 16(3) of the <i>Charter</i> 
  advanced by two of the interveners, the Commissioner of Official Languages of 
  Canada and La&nbsp;Fédération des communautés francophones et acadienne du Canada.  
  They submit that once the province established Montfort as a homogeneous francophone 
  institution, s. 16(3) provided a constitutional shield, limiting the right of 
  Ontario to affect or reduce that status.  Section 16(3) embodies the constitutional 
  objective of advancing toward the substantive equality of Canada’s two official 
  languages.  This objective, it is submitted, is to be achieved by means of a 
  “ratchet” principle.  It is argued that once Ontario takes a step in the direction 
  of advancing the substantive equality of French, s. 16(3) “ratchets” that step 
  to the level of a constitutional right, limiting any retreat from that advance.  
  Although not constitutionally required, provincial measures advancing linguistic 
  equality are responsive to a constitutional aspiration.  Once taken, steps towards 
  substantive linguistic equality gain constitutional protection, and advances 
  can only be withdrawn if properly justified.  It is submitted that this interpretation 
  of s. 16(3) is supported by the principle, elaborated below, that language rights 
  are to be given a large and liberal interpretation.  Reliance is also placed 
  upon the unwritten constitutional principle of respect for and protection of 
  minorities as an interpretive aid.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>In my view, the difficulty in characterizing s. 16 of the <i>Charter</i> 
      stems in large part from the problems of construction inherent in s. 16(1).  
      I would read the opening statement “English and French are the official 
      languages of Canada” as declaratory and the balance of the section as identifying 
      the main consequence in the federal context of the official status which 
      has been declared, namely that the two languages have equality of status 
      and have the same rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions 
      of the Parliament and government of Canada.  Subsection (3) of s. 16 makes 
      it clear, however, that these consequences represent the goal rather than 
      the present reality; they are something that has to be “advanced” by Parliament 
      and the legislatures.  This would seem to be in the spirit of <i>Jones v. 
      Attorney General of New Brunswick</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 182, namely that 
      legislatures cannot derogate from already declared rights but they may add 
      to them.  Provided their legislation “advances” the cause of equality of 
      status of the two official languages it will survive judicial scrutiny; 
      otherwise not.  I do not believe, however, that any falling short of the 
      goal at any given point of time necessarily gives a right to relief.  I 
      agree with those who see a principle of growth or development in s. 16, 
      a progression towards an ultimate goal.  Accordingly the question, in my 
      view, will always be – where are we currently on the road to bilingualism 
      and is the impugned conduct in keeping with that stage of development?  
      If it is, then even if it does not represent full equality of status and 
      equal rights of usage, it will not be contrary to the spirit of s. 16.</p>

  </span></span> We are not persuaded that s. 16(3) includes a “ratchet” principle 
  that clothes measures taken to advance linguistic equality with constitutional 
  protection.  Section 16(3) builds on the principle established in <i>Jones v. 
  New Brunswick (A.G.)</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 182 that the Constitution’s language 
  guarantees are a “floor” and not a “ceiling” and reflects an aspirational element 
  of advancement toward substantive equality.  The aspirational element of s. 
  16(3) is not without significance when it comes to interpreting legislation.  
  However, it seems to us undeniable that the effect of this provision is to <i>protect</i>, 
  not<i> constitutionalize</i>, measures to advance linguistic equality.  The 
  operative legal effect of s. 16(3) is determined and limited by its opening 
  words: “Nothing in this <i>Charter</i> limits the authority of Parliament or 
  a legislature”.  Section 16(3) is not a rights-conferring provision.  It is, 
  rather, a provision designed to shield from attack government action that would 
  otherwise contravene s. 15 or exceed legislative authority.  See André Tremblay 
  and Michel Bastarache, “Language Rights” in <span>Gérald-A. Beaudoin &amp; Ed 
  Ratushny eds., <i>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, 2nd ed. (1989) 
  at 675:</span> </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>What was actually desired with this provision [s.&nbsp;16(3)] was to assure 
      that the power to provide a privileged status for French and English in 
      a statute could not be challenged by virtue of the rights forbidding discrimination 
      contained in section 15 of the Charter.  Section 16(3) could thus prevent 
      the measures designed to promote equal access to both official languages 
      from being struck down.</p>

  </span></span> Nor do we find any support for the “ratchet” principle in the 
  case law.  The passage relied on from <i>Société des Acadiens </i>is found in

  </span></span> This argument is made on the assumption that government was under 
  no obligation to create Montfort.  This court has held in another context that 
  in the absence of a constitutional right that requires the government to act 
  in the first place, there can be no constitutional right to the continuation 
  of measures voluntarily taken, even where those measures accord with or enhance 
  <i>Charter</i> values.  In <i>Ferrel v. Ontario (A.G.)</i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 
  97 (C.A.) a case dealing with the repeal of a statute intended to combat systemic 
  discrimination in employment, Morden A.C.J.O. stated as follows at 110-11:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>If there is no constitutional obligation to enact the

      the state of the statute book to what it was before the 1993 Act, without 
      being obligated to justify the repealing statute under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.</span></p>

    <p><span lang=EN-US>It would be ironic, in my view, if legislative initiatives

  </span></span> To summarize, Montfort is a public hospital that provides services 
  in French.  Section 16(3) of the <i>Charter</i> does not constitutionally enshrine 
  Montfort because it is not a rights-conferring provision.  Because Montfort 
  is not constitutionally protected by s.&nbsp;16(3), Ontario can, subject to 
  what follows, alter the status of Montfort as a community hospital without offending

  but is fully developed in Montfort’s factum.  In our view, the Divisional Court 
  was correct in rejecting this submission on the ground, at p. 79, that “s. 15 
  of the <i>Charter</i> may not be used as a back door to enhance language rights 
  beyond what is specifically provided for elsewhere in the <i>Charter</i>”.  
  Assuming, without deciding, that the respondents otherwise satisfy the test 
  for a violation of s. 15, we agree with the Divisional Court that, in view of 
  the very specific and detailed provisions of ss. 16-23 of the <i>Charter</i> 
  dealing with the special status of English and French, any differential treatment 
  to francophones resulting from the Commission’s directions is not based upon 
  an enumerated or analogous ground.  As the Divisional Court stated at p. 80: 
  “Section 15 itself…cannot be invoked to supplement language rights which the 
  <i>Charter</i> has not expressly conferred.”  </p>

  Columbia Court of Appeal held that, having regard to the specific rights conferred

  rule of court requiring documents to be filed in English.  In <i>R. v. Paquette</i> 
  (1987), 83 A.R. 41 at 51, the Alberta Court of Appeal rejected the contention 
  that the failure to accord a trial in French infringed s. 15:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>That argument elevates official language rights into a position of equality 
      in all cases.  There would be no need for ss. 16 to 23 of the <i>Charter</i>.  
      The argument makes the official languages sections redundant, as s. 15 would 
      transform the use of one official language into the use of both.  The discrimination 
      is not based on language and the official languages are simply not accorded

  It has been held in other contexts that where the Constitution accords special 
  rights to special groups, those specific guarantees must be respected and other 
  <i>Charter</i> rights cannot be used to expand or diminish the rights so granted.  
  In<i> Reference Re Bill 30, supra,</i> Wilson J. stated at pp. 1196-97 that 
  although the special minority religion education rights conferred by s. 93 of 
  the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i> “sit uncomfortably with the concept of equality 
  embodied in the Charter”, s. 15 can be used neither to nullify the specific 
  rights of the protected group nor to extend those rights to other religious 
  groups.  This position was affirmed in <i>Adler v. Ontario</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 
  609.  There, the Court dismissed a claim for funding health services for religious 
  schools falling outside the ambit of s. 93 based on the guarantee of freedom

  The most definitive and complete consideration of the unwritten or structural 
  principles, and the authority most pertinent to the respondents’ submissions 
  before this court, is the Supreme Court of Canada’s 1998 decision in the <i>Secession 
  Reference, supra</i>.  There, at p. 240, the Supreme Court affirmed the existence 
  of unwritten constitutional rules “not expressly dealt with by the text of the 
  Constitution” but which nonetheless have normative force as operative instruments 
  of our constitutional order.  The Court identified at p. 240 “four fundamental 
  and organizing principles of the Constitution” that bear upon the question of 
  the possibility of provincial secession, namely, federalism, democracy, constitutionalism 
  and the rule of law, and respect for minorities.</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  These unwritten principles, said the Court at p. 247,  “inform and sustain the 
  constitutional text: they are the vital unstated assumptions upon which the 
  text is based.” The Court held at p. 248 that the unwritten principles represent 
  the Constitution’s “internal architecture” and “infuse our Constitution and 
  breathe life into it”.  Further, “[t]he principles dictate major elements of 
  the architecture of the Constitution itself and are as such its lifeblood.”</p>

  Federalism, the division of legislative power between the Parliament of Canada 
  and the provincial legislatures, reflects a fundamental fact of Canada’s constitutional 
  and political structure.  As the Court stated at p. 251, “federalism is a political 
  and legal response to underlying social and political realities”.  Canada is 
  a country with a rich geographic, cultural, and political diversity.  Federalism 
  represents the constitutional definition of those aspects of our political life 
  that unite us while preserving appropriate scope to accommodate and to enhance 
  the heterogeneous social, cultural, and economic realities of the diverse and 
  distinctive provincial communities that make up our nation.  Federalism is, 
  as the Supreme Court of Canada explained in the <i>Secession Reference</i> at 
  p.&nbsp;244, “a legal response to the underlying political and cultural realities 
  that existed at Confederation and continue to exist today.”  At p. 245 the Court 
  added: “Federalism was the political mechanism by which diversity could be reconciled 
  with unity.”</p>

  The federalism principle has an important bearing on the situation of cultural 
  and linguistic minorities.  The reality of the distinctive language and culture 
  of the French speaking majority of Quebec was unquestionably a principal and 
  defining feature of the Canadian union of 1867 as it required the adoption of 
  a federal structure in the first place.  As the Court explained in the <i>Secession 
  Reference</i> at p. 252: “The federal structure adopted at Confederation enabled 
  French-speaking Canadians to form a numerical majority in the province of Quebec, 
  and so exercise the considerable provincial powers conferred by the <i>Constitution 
  Act, 1867</i> in such a way as to promote their language and culture.” </p>

  Democracy, as the Supreme Court said in the <i>Secession Reference</i> at p.&nbsp;252, 
  is “a fundamental value in our constitutional law and political culture” and, 
  at p.&nbsp;253, a “baseline against which the framers of our Constitution, and 
  subsequently, our elected representatives under it, have always operated.”  
  Although not mentioned in the text of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867</i>, democracy 
  has always been a fundamental feature of our constitutional structure.  In relation 
  to minorities, democracy means more than simple majority rule.  As Iacobucci 
  J. explained in <i>Vriend v. Alberta</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 493 at 577: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[T]he concept of democracy means more than majority rule….  In my view, 
      a democracy requires that legislators take into account the interests of 
      majorities and minorities alike, all of whom will be affected by the decisions 
      they make.  Where the interests of a minority have been denied consideration, 
      especially where that group has historically been the target of prejudice

  as the supreme source of law and authority.  In the <i>Secession Reference</i>

  In<i> Reference re Manitoba Language Rights</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 721, the Supreme 
  Court identified the rule of law as an operative constitutional principle.  
  The Court held at p. 752 that “in the process of Constitutional adjudication, 
  the Court may have regard to unwritten postulates which form the very foundation 
  of the Constitution of Canada.”  There, the Court found that the province’s 
  failure to comply with s. 23 of the <i>Manitoba Act</i> and enact its laws in 
  both English and French rendered legislation enacted since 1890 invalid.  Relying 
  on the fundamental principle of the rule of law, the Court adopted a temporary 
  suspension of its declaration of invalidity to avoid a state of legal chaos.

  The related principle of constitutionalism rests on the proposition that the 
  Constitution is the supreme source of law and that all government action must 
  comply with its requirements.  Constitutionalism qualifies majority rule and, 
  like federalism, has an important bearing on minorities.  As the Court explained 
  in the <i>Secession Reference</i> at p. 259, the constitutional entrenchment 
  of rights protects these rights against the will of the majority and ensures 
  that they are given due regard and protection.  A constitution may, the Court 
  explained at p. 259, “seek to ensure that vulnerable minority groups are endowed 
  with the institutions and rights necessary to maintain and promote their identities 
  against the assimilative pressures of the majority.” <b><i></i></b></p>

  Finally, in the <i>Secession Reference</i> the Court spoke of the principle 
  of “respect for minorities” or “protection of minorities”.  In these reasons, 
  we refer to this principle as “respect for and protection of minorities”.  The 
  principle of respect for and protection of minorities was described as follows 
  at p. 262:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The concern of our courts and governments to protect minorities has been 
      prominent in recent years, particularly following the enactment of the <i>Charter</i>.  
      Undoubtedly, one of the key considerations motivating the enactment of the 
      <i>Charter</i>, and the process of constitutional judicial review that it 
      entails, is the protection of minorities.  However, it should not be forgotten 
      that the protection of minority rights had a long history before the enactment 
      of the <i>Charter</i>.  Indeed, the protection of minority rights was clearly 
      an essential consideration in the design of our constitutional structure 
      even at the time of Confederation.  Although Canada’s record of upholding 
      the rights of minorities is not a spotless one, that goal is one towards 
      which Canadians have been striving since Confederation, and the process 
      has not been without successes.  The principle of protecting minority rights 
      continues to exercise influence in the operation and interpretation of our 
      Constitution [references omitted].</p>

  The protection of linguistic minorities is essential to our country.  Dickson 
  J. captured the spirit of the place of language rights in the Constitution in 
  <i>Société des Acadiens</i>, <i>supra</i>, at p. 564: “Linguistic duality has 
  been a longstanding concern in our nation. Canada is a country with both French 
  and English solidly embedded in its history.”  As stated by La Forest J. in 
  <i>R. v. Mercure</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234 at 269, “rights regarding the English 
  and French languages…are basic to the continued viability of the nation.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  As we have already mentioned, the <i>Charter</i> enhanced language rights.  
  The entrenched guarantee of equality in s. 15 and the provisions requiring the 
  respect and protection of aboriginal rights enhanced the protection of the rights 
  of other minorities and the right to be free from discrimination.  As the Supreme 
  Court of Canada explained in the <i>Secession Reference</i> at p. 269, “There 
  are linguistic and cultural minorities, including aboriginal peoples, unevenly 
  distributed across the country who look to the Constitution of Canada for the 
  protection of their rights.”  </p>

  The principle of respect for and protection of minorities is a fundamental structural 
  feature of the Canadian Constitution that both explains and transcends the minority 
  rights that are specifically guaranteed in the constitutional text.  This is 
  an area where, as the Supreme Court of Canada explained in the <i>Secession 
  Reference</i> at p. 292, “[a] superficial reading of selected provisions of 
  the written constitutional enactment, without more, may be misleading.”  This 
  structural feature of the Constitution is reflected not only in the specific 
  guarantees in favour of minorities.  It infuses the entire text and, as we have 
  explained, plays a vital role in shaping the content and contours of the Constitution’s 
  other structural features: federalism, constitutionalism and the rule of law, 
  and democracy.  </p>

  This appeal calls for careful consideration of the appropriate weight, value, 
  and effect to be accorded to the respect for and protection of minorities as 
  one of the fundamental principles of our Constitution.  Ontario submits that, 
  in the face of the very specific and detailed minority language guarantees in 
  the text of the Constitution, the Divisional Court erred by in effect adding 
  to the list of protected rights.  The text of the Constitution’s specific language 
  rights gives the Franco-Ontarian minority no right to a French language hospital 
  and, says the appellant, the courts have no role in adding to the list of protected 
  rights.  The respondents submit, on the other hand, that the absence of a specific 
  right in the text of the Constitution is not fatal to their case.  They say 
  that in view of the importance of Montfort as a cultural, social, and educational 
  institution in the Franco-Ontarian minority’s struggle for survival, the Constitution’s 
  fundamental principle of respect for and protection of minorities properly may 
  be invoked as a basis for reviewing the legality of the Commission’s directions.</p>

  The unwritten principles of the Constitution do have normative force.  In <i>Reference 
  re Remuneration of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince Edward Island; Reference 
  re Independence and Impartiality of Judges of the Provincial Court of Prince 
  Edward Island </i>(“<i>Provincial Judges Reference</i>”), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 3 
  at 75, Lamer C.J.C. made it clear that, in his view, the preamble to the Constitution 
  “invites the courts to turn those principles into the premises of a constitutional 
  argument that culminates in the filling of gaps in the express terms of the 
  constitutional text.”  This point was reinforced in the <i>Secession Reference</i> 
  at p. 249:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Underlying constitutional principles may in certain circumstances give 
      rise to substantive legal obligations (have “full legal force”, as we described 
      it in the <i>Patriation Reference</i>, <i>supra</i> at p. 845), which constitute 
      substantive limitations upon government action.  These principles may give 
      rise to very abstract and general obligations, or they may be more specific 
      and precise in nature.  The principles are not merely descriptive, but are 
      also invested with powerful normative force, and are binding upon both courts 
      and governments.</p>

  In the<i> Provincial Judges Reference</i>, the Court considered the “unwritten 
  constitutional principle” of judicial independence.  The Court held, at p. 67, 
  that implicit in s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>, which deals with the right 
  to trial by “an independent and impartial tribunal”, and ss. 96-100 of the <i>Constitution 
  Act, 1867</i>, which deals with the appointment, tenure, and remuneration of 
  superior court judges, is “a deeper set of <u>unwritten</u> understandings which 
  are not found on the face of the document itself” [emphasis in original].  There 
  are, the Court held at p. 69, “organizing principles” that may be used “to fill 
  out gaps in the express terms of the constitutional scheme” to ensure the protection 
  of all of the necessary and essential attributes of this vital structural feature 
  of the Constitution.  The Court found, at p. 75, that the preamble to the <i>Constitution 
  Act, 1867</i> “identifies the organizing principles of the <i>Constitution Act, 
  1867</i>, and invites the courts to turn those principles into the premises 
  of a constitutional argument that culminates in the filling of gaps in the express 
  terms of the constitutional text.”</p>

  In his very helpful discussion of the unwritten or organizing principles of 
  the Constitution, “References, Structural Argumentation and the Organizing Principles 
  of Canada’s Constitution” (2001) 80 Can. Bar Rev. 67 at 83-86, Professor Robin 
  Elliot draws an important distinction between the use of unwritten or structural 
  principles “as independent bases upon which to impugn the validity of legislation” 
  and their use “as aids to interpretation or otherwise to assist in the resolution 
  of constitutional issues.”  Professor Elliot suggests that when used to impugn 
  the validity of legislation or government action, the unwritten principles “<i>can 
  fairly be said to be generated by necessary implication from the text of the 
  Constitution</i>” [emphasis in original].  On this theory, when the organizing 
  principles give rise to rights capable of impugning the validity of legislation, 
  they <i>are</i> grounded in the text of the Constitution.  Although not expressly 
  stated by the Constitution’s text, such rights are immanent in the text when 
  it is understood and interpreted in a proper and complete legal, historical, 
  and political context.  When used in this way, the unwritten or organizing principles 
  allow the courts to unlock the full meaning of the Constitution and to flesh 
  out its terms, as explained by Lamer C.J.C. in the <i>Provincial Court Judges 
  Reference</i> at p. 69, even to the extent of allowing the courts “to fill out 
  gaps in the express terms of the constitutional scheme.” </p>

  Professor Patrick Monahan draws a similar distinction in “The Public Policy 
  Role of the Supreme Court of Canada and the <i>Secession Reference</i>” (1999) 
  11 N.J.C.L. 65 at 75-77.  He observes that when following the interpretive theory:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>[T]he court should attempt to fill in that gap by adopting 
      an interpretation that is most consistent with the underlying logic of the 
      existing text, and then to rely upon that logic in order to ‘complete’ the 
      constitutional text.</span></p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  This is to be contrasted with what Professor Monahan describes at p. 77 as an 
  unacceptable conception of judges “as akin to constitutional drafters.  On this 
  view, the court should fill in the gap by relying upon its own conception as 
  to the best or most appropriate set of constitutional norms that should be added 
  to the existing text.”</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The unwritten principles of the Constitution do not confer on the judiciary 
  a mandate to rewrite the Constitution’s text.  In the <i>Secession Reference</i> 
  at p. 249, the Supreme Court confirmed that recognition of these unwritten structural 
  principles:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>could not be taken as an invitation to dispense with the written text of 
      the Constitution.  On the contrary….there are compelling reasons to insist 
      upon the primacy of our written constitution.  A written constitution promotes 
      legal certainty and predictability, and it provides a foundation and a touchstone 
      for the exercise of constitutional judicial review.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  Similarly, in the <i>Provincial Judges Reference</i> at p. 68, the Court stated: 
  “There are many important reasons for the preference for a written constitution 
  over an unwritten one, not the least of which is the promotion of legal certainty 
  and through it the legitimacy of constitutional judicial review.”  Again, in 
  <i>Re Eurig Estate</i>, [1998] 2 S.C.R. 565 at 594, Binnie J. stated that “implicit 
  principles can and should be used to expound the Constitution, but they cannot 
  alter the thrust of its explicit text.”</p>

  Against the background of these general principles we turn to the precise issue 
  that confronts us in this appeal.  As the Divisional Court observed, we are 
  not concerned here with the validity of legislation that impinges upon the rights 
  of a linguistic minority: compare <i>Baie d’Urfé</i> (<i>Ville) v. Québec, supra</i>.  
  Nor are we confronted with a situation where a minority group is insisting on 
  the establishment of an institution that is not already in existence.  We are 
  asked to review the validity of a discretionary decision with respect to the 
  role and function of an existing institution, made by a statutory authority 
  with a mandate to act in the public interest. </p>

  In its submissions, Ontario has chosen to characterize the decision of the Divisional 
  Court as recognizing or creating a specific constitutional right capable of 
  impugning the validity of an act of the legislature or sufficient to require 
  the province to act in some specific manner.  We do not accept that as a proper 
  or necessary reading of the judgment.  The Divisional Court at pp. 83-84 quashed 
  the Commission’s directions on the ground that given the constitutional principle 
  of respect for and protection of minorities, “it was not open to the Commission 
  to proceed on a ‘restructured health services’ mandate only, and to ignore the 
  broader institutional role played by…Montfort as a truly francophone centre, 
  necessary to promote and enhance the Franco-Ontarian identity as a cultural/linguistic 
  minority in Ontario, and to protect that culture from assimilation.”  The Divisional 
  Court, at p. 68, explicitly recognized that “the constitutional validity or 
  invalidity of a piece of legislation is not at issue.”  The Divisional Court 
  added: “What is at issue is whether certain conduct of a government agency falls 
  within the parameters of what is permitted by the Constitution….[T]here is a 
  difference between the validity of legislation and the possibility of unconstitutional 
  behaviour under legislation.”  We agree with the Divisional Court’s characterization 
  of the constitutional issue.</p>

  For the reasons that follow, we have concluded that the Constitution’s structural 
  principle of respect for and protection of minorities is a bedrock principle 
  that has a direct bearing on the interpretation to be accorded the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> 
  and on the legality of the Commission’s directions affecting Montfort.  This 
  bedrock principle also informs our discussion below of the reviewability of 
  the Commission’s directions.</p>

  We proceed first to consider the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> and its application to the 
  facts of the present case in light of the interpretive principles applicable 
  to language rights and in light of the constitutional principle of respect for 
  and protection of minorities.  We then turn to the application of the unwritten 
  principles to the exercise and review of discretionary decisions of statutory 
  bodies with a statutory mandate to act in the public interest.  As the conclusion 
  we have reached on these two issues is sufficient to dispose of this appeal, 
  it is not necessary for us to answer the more general question – whether the 
  fundamental constitutional principle of respect for and protection of minorities 
  gives rise to a specific constitutional right capable of impugning the validity 
  of an act of the legislature or sufficient to require the province to act in 
  some specific manner.</p>

  were the result of “political compromise”, should be approached with judicial 
  restraint in contrast to human rights, which are “seminal in nature because 
  they are rooted in principle.”  It is now clear, however, that this narrow and

  In <i>Ford v. Québec (A.G.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 748, the Supreme Court rejected 
  the contention that the specific language rights protected by the Constitution 
  are exhaustive, leaving no room for the protection of the right to use one’s 
  language of choice as an aspect of freedom of expression.  The Court quoted 
  from its earlier decision in <i>Reference re Manitoba Language Rights</i>, [1985] 
  1 S.C.R. 721 at 744:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>The importance of language rights is grounded in the essential role that 
      language plays in human existence, development and dignity.  It is through 
      language that we are able to form concepts; to structure and order the world

  362 again referred to the cultural importance of language: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>[A]ny broad guarantee of language rights, especially in the context of 
      education, cannot be separated from a concern for the culture associated 
      with the language.  Language is more than a mere means of communication,

  The Chief Justice made reference at p. 363 to the importance of schools as institutions 
  that function as “community centres where the promotion and preservation of 
  minority language culture can occur”.  With reference to the strictures imposed 
  by the narrow approach taken in <i>Société des Acadiens</i>, Dickson C.J.C. 
  observed at p. 365: </p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Both its genesis and its form are evidence of the unusual nature of s. 
      23.  Section 23 confers upon a group a right which places positive obligations 
      on government to alter or develop major institutional structures.  Careful 
      interpretation of such a section is wise: however, this does not mean that 
      courts should not “breathe life” into the expressed purpose of the section, 
      or avoid implementing the possibly novel remedies needed to achieve that 
      purpose.</p>

<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Language rights must <u>in all cases</u> be interpreted purposively, in

      supra</i>, at pp. 579-80, stands for a restrictive interpretation of language 
      rights, it is to be rejected.  The fear that a liberal interpretation of 
      language rights will make provinces less willing to become involved in the 
      geographical extension of those rights is inconsistent with the requirement 
      that language rights be interpreted as a fundamental tool for the preservation

  </span> It was within the overall context of steady progression and advancement 
  of services in French that the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> was introduced and passed in 
  1986.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span> [2] </span></a>  In introducing the legislation on May 1, 1986, 
  the Honourable Bernard Grandmaître, the Minister for Francophone Affairs, stated 
  (<i>Debates of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario</i>, pp. 203-204):</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>Our province has a special responsibility in this regard [to ensure that 
      francophones receive services in their own language] because Ontario is 
      home to the largest group of French-speaking Canadians outside Quebec.  
      It is for that reason the government of Ontario intends to guarantee through 
      legislation the rights of francophones to receive government services in 
      French.  </p>
    <p>The various measures contained in this bill are inspired by the basic principles 
      of justice and equality which we value so highly in this province.  These 
      are two fundamental principles on which our country has been built by the 
      two founding peoples.  The government of Ontario believes that it is now 
      appropriate that this reality and this duality should be reflected in the 
      operations <i>of all ministries.  </i>(Emphasis added.)<i> </i></p>

  </span> This and other speeches made by members of the Legislature noted that 
  the governments of Ontario had, over the years, changed their policy toward 
  the French language.  The Bill was the result of years of successive steps toward 
  the goal of providing services to francophones in their own language.  The Bill 
  received the unanimous support of all three political parties represented in 
  the Legislative Assembly, and amendments were proposed with a view to ensuring 
  its protections would be met.  For example, s. 8(1)(d) of the <i>F.L.S.A.</i>, 
  which provides that services could be exempted from being offered in French 
  where, in the opinion of the Lieutenant Governor in Council, “it is reasonable 
  and necessary to do so” had added to it the words “<i>and where the exemption 
  does not derogate from the general purpose and intent of this Act”</i>: see 
  <i>Debates of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario</i>, November 6, 1986, at 
  pp. 3202-3203<i>.</i></p>

  </span> The legislative history and the comments of the members of the legislature 
  when the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> was enacted permit this court to draw a number of inferences 
  and conclusions about the underlying purposes and objectives of the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> 
  and the intention of the legislature enacting it.  One of the underlying purposes 
  and objectives of the<i> </i>Act was the protection of the minority francophone 
  population in Ontario; another was the advancement of the French language and 
  promotion of its equality with English.  These purposes coincide with the underlying 
  unwritten principles of the Constitution of Canada.  As already stated, underlying 
  constitutional principles may in certain circumstances give rise to substantive 
  legal obligations because of their powerful normative force: <i>Provincial Judges 
  Reference</i>, <i>supra</i>,<i> </i>at pp. 67-70 per Lamer C.J.C. and <i>Secession

<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The preamble states that the Act is a statutory recognition of the cultural 
  heritage of the French speaking population and a reflection of the Legislative 
  Assembly’s commitment to preserve that cultural heritage for future generations.  
  While a preamble is not a source of positive law in contrast to the provisions 
  that follow it, a preamble can contribute to the interpretation of a law: <i>Provincial 
  Judges Reference</i>,<i> </i>at p. 69. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Here, the preamble states “it is desirable to <u>guarantee</u> the use 
  of the French language in institutions of the…government of Ontario as provided 
  for in this Act” [emphasis added].  One of those institutions is Montfort, a 
  government agency under the Act.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 1 defines a government agency in part as a publicly-subsidized 
  non-profit corporation that provides service to the public and that is designated 
  by regulation.  That is Montfort.  The word “service” is also defined in s. 
  1 as any service or procedure provided by a government agency and “includes 
  all communications for the purpose”.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 2 requires the Government of Ontario to ensure that services 
  are provided in French in accordance with the Act.  The <i>F.L.S.A.</i> does 
  not impose a requirement of institutional bilingualism across the province.  
  Instead, it provides a measured policy that varies with the circumstances.  
  Thus our decision is a contextual one.  This is not a ruling about every hypothetical 
  situation that might arise concerning minority French language rights in the 
  province.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 5(1) of the Act gives a person the right “to communicate in 
  French with, and to receive available services in French from, any head or central 
  office of a government agency” and “the same right in respect of any other office 
  of such agency… that is located in or serves an area designated in the Schedule.”  
  The right in s. 5 does not apply to all government agencies.  It only applies 
  to those institutions that are defined as a government agency in s. 1.  Montfort 
  receives public money and is designated under the Act.  Montfort satisfies the 
  definition of a government agency.  Ottawa-Carleton is also a designated area 
  in the Schedule.  Thus, a person has the right to communicate in French with, 
  and to receive available services from, Montfort and any “office” of Montfort.  
  In order to understand the meaning of “available services” as used in s. 5, 
  it will be helpful to provide an overview of the other provisions of the Act.</p>

  </span> Section 6 gives some protection to existing practices with respect to 
  the use of  English or French outside the application of the Act.  It provides 
  that the Act cannot be used to limit the use of either language where the Act 
  does not apply.  </p>

  but requires first that “all reasonable measures and plans for compliance with 
  this Act have been taken or made.”<i></i></p>

  </span> Section 8 gives the Lieutenant Governor in Council the power to make 
  regulations a) designating public service agencies; b) amending the Schedule 
  by adding designated areas to it; and c) exempting services from the application 
  of ss. 2 and 5 where, in its opinion, “it is reasonable and necessary to do 
  so <i>and where the exemption does not derogate from the general purpose and 
  intent of this Act”</i> [emphasis added].</p>

  </span> Section 9 provides that the right to receive services in French from 
  a designated agency may be limited in that designation may apply only to certain 
  specified services, as opposed to all services, provided by the agency, or the 
  agency may exclude certain of its services from designation.  Montfort has not 
  specified certain of its services for inclusion or exclusion.  Thus the designation 
  applies to all of the services offered by Montfort.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 10 provides that where a regulation exempts a service, revokes 
  the designation of a public service agency, or amends a regulation designating 
  a public service agency so as to exclude or <i>remove a service</i> from the 
  designation, at least 45 days’ notice must first have been published in the 
  <i>Ontario Gazette</i> and a newspaper of general circulation in Ontario inviting 
  comments to be submitted to the Minister for Francophone Affairs.  After the 
  expiry of this period, the regulation may be made without further notice. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The implication of s. 10 is that when there is a change in the services 
  offered by a government agency, a regulation will be passed.  Before the regulation 
  passes, 45 days’ notice of the change must first be published in both the <i>Ontario 
  Gazette</i> and a general circulation newspaper, inviting comment. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

  </span> Ontario submits that designation as a government agency under the Act 
  merely confers the right to receive the services provided by the designated 
  agency at any given point in time.  In support of its position, Ontario relies 
  on the wording of s. 5: “A person has the right in accordance with this Act 
  to communicate in French with, and to receive <i>available services </i>in French 
  from, any…government agency” [emphasis added].  Ontario submits that the Act 
  only gives a person the right to receive whatever services Montfort offers.  
  If Montfort offers ten services in French one year and two services in French 
  the following year, that is all a person has the right to receive.  Ontario’s 
  position is, further, that the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> requires that only services are 
  to be provided in French, and “services” does not include the training of health 
  care professionals in French.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> We cannot accept this submission.  In our opinion the words “available 
  services”<i> </i>in s. 5 of the Act refer to available healthcare services at 
  the time the agency is designated under the Act.  The legislature has quite 
  clearly manifested its intention in the preamble of the <i>F.L.S.A. </i>to “guarantee” 
  the provision of services in French.  Ontario’s submission, if accepted, would 
  result in seriously undermining the guarantee.  Our interpretation is reinforced 
  by the French version of the statute which speaks only of “services” and not 
  “available services”.  Our interpretation is also consistent with the objectives 
  of the <i>F.L.S.A</i>, the aspirational element of s. 16(3) of the <i>Charter</i>,<i> 
  </i>and the unwritten constitutional principle of respect for and protection 
  of minorities. </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Ontario’s submission also fails to pay adequate attention to the overall 
  scheme of the legislation.  Montfort’s designation does not apply only in respect 
  of specified services.  It applies in respect of all the healthcare services 
  offered by Montfort at the time of designation.  If Ontario’s submission is 
  correct, there would never be any need to pass an amending regulation under 
  s.&nbsp;8 or give notice under s. 10 to exempt or remove a service from the 
  designation.   In our opinion, before removing an existing service, such as 
  cardiology, from Montfort’s designation, it would have been necessary to pass 
  a regulation because cardiology services were no longer going to be available 
  in French not only at Montfort but elsewhere in the Ottawa-Carleton region.  
  Of course, the requirement of s. 7 that circumstances make it “reasonable and 
  necessary” to limit the provision of French language healthcare services would 
  first have to be met.</p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> The Commission appears to have attempted to frame its directions so 
  as to make available equivalent healthcare services in French at other institutions.  
  Language and culture are not, however, separate watertight compartments.  The 
  reality of the matter is, as found by the Divisional Court, that the Commission’s 
  directions would reduce the availability and accessibility of healthcare services 
  in French, both directly in the Ottawa-Carleton region and eastern Ontario, 
  and indirectly by imperiling the training of health care professionals, which 
  would in turn increase the assimilation of Franco-Ontarians.  Montfort’s designation 
  under the <i>F.L.S.A. </i>includes not only the right to healthcare services 
  in French at the time of designation but also the right to whatever structure 
  is necessary to ensure that those healthcare services are delivered in French.  
  This would include the training of healthcare professionals in French.  To give 
  the legislation any other interpretation is to prefer a narrow, literal, compartmentalized 
  interpretation to one that recognizes and reflects the intent of the legislation.<i></i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> It can hardly be said that the serious adverse effects of the Commission’s 
  directions are consistent with the purpose and objectives of the <i>F.L.S.A.  
  </i>Nor do the directions accord with the government’s criteria for designating 
  an agency under the <i>F.L.S.A</i>.  The four criteria are: 1) permanency and 
  quality of services in French; 2) access to services in French; 3) francophone 
  representation in the governance and management of the institution; and 4) accountability 
  (H.S.R.C. August 1997 Report at p.&nbsp;82).  Designation entails preparing 
  and submitting a plan specifying the manner in which the institution seeking 
  designation meets these criteria.  By designating Montfort under the Act, Ontario 
  has signified it is government policy that the services of Montfort, a general 
  community hospital, are intended to be permanently offered and readily accessible 
  in French.  The Commission’s directions represent a shift in this policy.  Even 
  the Commission itself recognized that the transfer of services from Montfort 
  meant that “some” existing services would not be available in French in Ottawa-Carleton, 
  and that it would no longer be possible to train healthcare professionals completely 
  in French in a bilingual setting.  The Commission, and now Ontario, has given 
  no explanation for this shift in policy.  Nor has there been compliance with 
  s. 7 of the <i>F.L.S.A.</i></p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Section 7 of the <i>F.L.S.A.</i> states that the right to receive services 
  in French may only be limited “as circumstances make reasonable and necessary, 
  if all reasonable measures and plans for compliance with this Act have been 
  taken or made.”  The definition of “necessary” implies “une chose absolument 
  indispensable, ce dont on ne peut rigoureusement pas se passer.  En somme, une 
  nécessité inéluctable”: Pigeon,<i> </i><i><span lang=FR-CA>Rédaction et interprétation 
  des lois</span></i>, 3e éd. (1986) at 36.  The word “necessary” in this context 
  would appear to mean that existing services can only be limited when this is 
  the only course of action that can be taken.  </p>
<p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'> [165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  </span> Before limiting Montfort’s services as a community hospital, Ontario 
  must also have taken “all reasonable measures” to comply with the Act.  It is 
  possible to state with greater precision what falls short of “all reasonable 
  measures”.  “All reasonable measures” does not simply mean giving a direction 
  to the transferee hospital to attain <i>F.L.S.A.</i> designation and then transferring 
  the French services before that designation has been attained.  Nor does “all 
  reasonable measures” mean creating a seemingly insurmountable problem for the 
  training of healthcare professionals in French and leaving the affected community 
  to solve the problem itself.  The Commission’s directions do not comply with 
  s. 7 of the Act.</p>

  </span> Although it is impossible to specify precisely what is encompassed by 
  the words “reasonable and necessary” and “all reasonable measures”, at a minimum 
  they require some justification or explanation for the directions limiting the 
  rights of francophones to benefit from Montfort as a community hospital.</p>

  </span> While the Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations exempting 
  services from the application of ss. 2 and 5 where, in the opinion of the Lieutenant 
  Governor in Council, it is reasonable and necessary to do so, there has been 
  no attempt to pass a regulation exempting any of the healthcare services from 
  being provided in French.  We also note the requirement that any regulation 
  exempting a service from the application of the Act not derogate from the general 
  purpose and intent of the Act.  These words appear to invite some objective 
  scrutiny and indicate that the discretionary opinion of the Lieutenant Governor

  to be reconciled with the statutory requirements of the <i>F.L.S.A</i>.  The 
  Commission may not issue a directive removing available services in French from 
  Montfort, particularly when the services are not available in French on a full-time 
  basis elsewhere in the Ottawa-Carleton region, without complying with the “reasonable

  It has long been established in Canadian law that “there is no such thing as 
  absolute and untrammelled ‘discretion’”: <i>Roncarelli v. Duplessis</i>, [1959] 
  S.C.R. 121 at 140 per Rand J.  In <i>Mount Sinai, supra,</i> the Supreme Court 
  reviewed the exercise of discretion by the Quebec Minister of Health in relation 
  to Mount Sinai Hospital.  Section 138 of the <i>Act Respecting Health Services 
  and Social Services, </i>R.S.Q., c. S-4.2 is similar to s. 6 of the <i>Public 
  Hospitals Act.  </i>Both statutes give the Minister of Health a wide discretion 
  to act in the manner he or she considers justified in the public interest.  
  In his concurring reasons at para. 16, Binnie J. observed:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p>It is true, as the appellant points out, that the Minister’s power under 
      s. 138 is framed as a broad policy discretion to be exercised “<b>in the 
      public interest</b>”.  Yet the discretion, however broadly framed, is not 
      unfettered.  At the very least the Minister must exercise the power for 
      the purpose for which it was granted: <i>Roncarelli v. Duplessis, </i>[1959] 
      S.C.R. 121, at p. 140; <i>Padfield v. Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries

  <blockquote>
    <p>The Minister has a duty to exercise his discretion in accordance with the 
      dictates of the <i>Charter;</i> see <i>Operation Dismantle Inc. v. The Queen</i>, 
      [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441; <i>Slaight Communications Inc. v. Davidson</i>, [1989] 
      1 S.C.R. 1038.  In reaching his decision, the Minister failed to give proper 
      weight to the promotion and preservation of minority language culture and 
      to the role of the French Language Board in balancing the pedagogical and 
      cultural considerations.  This was essential to giving full regard to the 
      remedial purpose of the right.  The approach adopted by the Minister therefore 
      increased the probability that his decision would fail to satisfy constitutional 
      review by the courts.</p>

  Fundamental constitutional values have normative legal force.  Even if the text 
  of the Constitution falls short of creating a specific constitutionally enforceable 
  right, the values of the Constitution must be considered in assessing the validity 
  or legality of actions taken by government.  This is a long-established principle 
  of our law.  Before the advent of the <i>Charter</i> and the constitutional 
  entrenchment of rights and freedoms, there can be no doubt that those same rights 
  were fundamental constitutional values.  Although they had not been crystallized 
  in the form of entrenched and directly enforceable rights, they were regularly 
  used by the courts to interpret legislation and to assess the legality of administrative 
  action.  See <i>R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 295 at 344.  
  The fundamental rights and freedoms of a liberal democracy are very much a product 
  of our British parliamentary heritage.  As explained by Rand J. in <i>Saumur 
  v. Quebec (City)</i>,<i> </i>[1953] 2 S.C.R. 299 at 329, “[F]reedom of speech, 
  religion and the inviolability of the person, are original freedoms which are 
  at once the necessary attributes and modes of self-expression of human beings 
  and the primary conditions of their community life within a legal order.”  Although 
  these fundamental rights and freedoms had no place in the text of the Constitution 
  until 1982, the courts were entitled to take them into account when deciding 
  cases and interpreting statutes, and when considering the legality of governmental 
  actions. </p>

  Similarly, since the enactment of the <i>Charter</i>, the application of constitutional 
  values to situations not strictly governed by the text of the Constitution has 
  been recognized and accepted.  The <i>Charter </i>does not apply as between 
  private individuals, yet <i>Charter</i> values are to be applied by the courts 
  in common-law decision making: <i>R.W.D.S.U., Local 580 v. Dolphin Delivery 
  Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[1986] 2 S.C.R. 573; <i>Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto</i>,

  Unwritten constitutional norms may, in certain circumstances, provide a basis 
  for judicial review of discretionary decisions.  As Bora Laskin wrote as a professor 
  of constitutional law in “An Inquiry Into the Diefenbaker Bill of Rights” (1959) 
  37 Can. Bar Rev. 77 at 81, although not entrenched in the Constitution, civil 
  liberties were frequently used “as a means of curial control of administrative 
  adjudication.”  More recently, Professor David Mullan commented on the same 
  doctrine in <i>Administrative Law</i> (2001) at 114, noting that in the pre-<i>Charter</i> 
  era, the Courts were “alert in their scrutiny of the exercise of discretionary 
  power” where civil liberties and freedoms were at stake.  The statutory conferral 
  of the power to make a discretionary decision does not immunize from judicial 
  scrutiny the decision-maker who ignores the fundamental values of Canada’s legal 
  order.  In “Unwritten Constitutionalism in Canada: Where Do Things Stand?” (2001) 
  35 Can. Bus. L. J. 113 at 115, Professor Choudhry questions the propriety of 
  using unwritten principles to challenge the validity of legislation, but regards 
  as benign their use to review administrative action: “To the extent that unwritten 
  principles have been used to control executive action, they function in a manner 
  similar to the common law grounds of judicial review of administrative action.”

  The possibility of the review of discretionary decisions on the basis of fundamental 
  Canadian constitutional and societal values is reinforced by the Supreme Court 
  of Canada’s decision in <i>Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, 
  [1999] 2 S.C.R. 817: see Mullan, <i>supra,</i> chapter 6; Dyzenhaus and Fox-Decent, 
  “Rethinking the Process/Substance Distinction: <i>Baker v. Canada</i>” (2001), 
  51 U.T.L.J. 193; MacLachlan, “Transforming Administrative Law: The Didactic 
  Role of the Supreme Court of Canada” (2001) 40 Can. Bar Rev. 281.  In <i>Baker,</i> 
  the Court considered a challenge to the exercise of a ministerial decision to 
  refuse to exempt an applicant for permanent resident status, on compassionate 
  and humanitarian grounds, from the requirement that the application be made 
  from outside Canada.  Noting that a ministerial discretionary decision made 
  pursuant to a broadly worded statutory mandate is ordinarily entitled to a high 
  level of deference from the courts, L’Heureux-Dubé J. wrote at pp. 853-55 that 
  there were, nonetheless, significant judicially enforceable limits where fundamental 
  constitutional and societal values are at stake:<span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:12.0pt;'></span></p>

  L’Heureux-Dubé J. found that the Minister’s decision to refuse an exemption 
  for a woman who had given birth to four children during her 11 years in Canada 
  failed to respect the values expressed in the international <i>Convention on 
  the Rights of the Child</i>.  The <i>Convention </i>had been signed by Canada, 
  but not adopted in statutory form by Parliament.  The Minister, held the majority 
  of the Supreme Court of Canada at p. 859, was required “to give serious weight 
  and consideration” to the values of the <i>Convention</i> and the interests 
  of the applicant’s children who would be left behind if she were not admitted. 
   The Minister’s decision was quashed.  </p>

  The Commission was required by statute to exercise its powers with respect to 
  Montfort <i>in accordance with the public interest</i>.  In determining the 
  public interest, the Commission was required to have regard to the fundamental 
  constitutional principle of respect for and protection of minorities.  The Commission 
  was also required to have regard to the recommendations of regional health councils.  
  As noted earlier, the regional health councils recognized the unique role of 
  Montfort and its importance to the continued survival of the language and culture 
  of the francophone community.  The Commission, however, viewed consideration 
  of Montfort’s larger institutional role as beyond its mandate.  This is demonstrated 
  by the letter written by Dr. Sinclair dated February 22, 1999 to which reference 
  has already been made at paragraphs 49 and 72.</p>

  We agree with the Divisional Court, at pp. 65-66, that the language and culture 
  of the francophone minority in Ontario “hold a special place in the Canadian 
  fabric as one of the founding communities of Canada and as one of the two official 
  language groups whose rights are entrenched in the Constitution.”  If implemented, 
  the Commission’s directions would greatly impair Montfort’s role as an important 
  linguistic, cultural and educational institution, vital to the minority francophone 
  population of Ontario. This would be contrary to the fundamental constitutional 
  principle of respect for and protection of minorities.</p>

  There is little doubt that the Commission’s directions themselves are entitled 
  to a high level of curial deference: <i>Pembroke Civic Hospital v. Ontario (Health 
  Services Restructuring Commission)</i> (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 41 (Div. Ct.).  
  However, as we have pointed out, they are by no means immune from judicial review.  
  While the Commission’s directions are entitled to deference, as pointed out 
  in <i>Baker</i>,<i> supra</i>, at p.&nbsp;859, quoting Dyzenhaus, “The Politics 
  of Deference: Judicial Review and Democracy” in Taggart, ed. <i>The Province 
  of Administrative Law</i> (1997) 279 at 286, deference “requires not submission 
  but a respectful attention to the reasons offered or which could be offered 
  in support of a decision”.  See also “Transforming Administrative Law”,<i> supra,</i> 
  where Professor Maclachlan states at 289:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <blockquote>
    <p><span lang=EN-US>As explained by Justice McLachlin [in “The Roles of Administrative 
      Tribunals and Courts in Maintaining the Rule of Law” (1999) 12 CJALP 171], 
      the rule of law should be seen as an essential attribute of decision-making 
      in a democratic society, taking as its overarching principle “a certain 
      <i>ethos of justification</i>”, under which an exercise of public power 
      is only appropriate where it can be justified to citizens in terms of <i>rationality 
      and fairness</i>.</span></p>

  The Commission offered no justification for diminishing Montfort’s important 
  linguistic, cultural, and educational role for the Franco-Ontarian minority.  
  It said that matter was beyond its mandate.  The Commission failed to pay any 
  attention to the relevant constitutional values, nor did it make any attempt 
  to justify departure from those values on the ground that it was necessary to 
  do so to achieve some other important objective.  While the Commission is entitled 
  to deference, deference does not protect decisions, purportedly taken in the 
  public interest, that impinge on fundamental Canadian constitutional values 
  without offering any justification.</p>

  The Divisional Court did not find the Commission’s decision to be patently unreasonable 
  or clearly irrational, the test that the parties acknowledged was applicable 
  in the circumstances.  Ontario points out that the respondents have not appealed 
  this finding.  However, this aspect of the Divisional Court’s judgment must 
  not be taken out of context or read in isolation from the Court’s central findings.  
  The Divisional Court did find that the Commission ignored Montfort’s broader 
  institutional role and failed to pay appropriate heed to a fundamental principle 
  of the Constitution.  The application of that constitutional principle to the 
  circumstances of this case is squarely raised by Ontario’s appeal, and the point 
  under consideration was fully canvassed in argument.</p>

line-height:normal'> <span lang=EN-GB>[186]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> 
  The Divisional Court, viewing the matter in purely administrative law terms, 
  and  without considering the relevance of the constitutional issues to the standard 
  of review, found the standard to be patent unreasonableness.  Where constitutional 
  and quasi-constitutional rights or values are concerned, correctness or reasonableness 
  will often be the appropriate standard: see <i>eg.</i> <i>Baker, supra</i>; 
  <i>Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board)</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 
  5; <i>Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825.  
  In the circumstances, detailed consideration of the appropriate standard of 
  review is neither necessary nor appropriate as it is clear that the directions 
  cannot survive even the most deferential standard because the Commission refused 
  to take into account or give any weight to Montfort’s broader institutional 
  role. </p>

    the 1960s showed an increased sensitivity to French language rights both as 
    a question of fairness to Ontario’s own residents and as a larger backdrop 
    to national unity.  The Ontario government passed a motion giving members 
    of the Legislature the right to address the House in English or in French.  
    The <i>Schools Administration Act</i>, R.S.O. 1960, c. 361, and the <i>Secondary 
    Schools and Boards of Education Act</i>, R.S.O. 1960, c. 362, were passed 
    to facilitate the establishment and support of French elementary and secondary 
    schools.  On May 3, 1971, Premier Davis made a formal statement in the legislative 
    assembly in which he pledged to continue the general philosophy of former 
    Premier Robarts concerning bilingualism.  He indicated that Ontario’s policy 
    would be to provide, wherever practicable, public services in the English 
    and French languages.  He recognized the special emphasis given by the federal 
    government to bilingualism in the National Capital region and pledged  to 
    support the efforts made to date by the municipalities in the region to increase 
    provision of bilingual services: <i>Debates of the Legislative Assembly of 
    Ontario</i>, May 3, 1971 at pp. 1104-9.  In the field of justice, a pilot 
    project was begun in June 1976 to permit the use of French in trials before 
    the Criminal Division of the Provincial Court in Sudbury.  The project was 
    extended to Ottawa the following year.  Bilingual services were then extended 
    to the Family Court Division in Sudbury and Ottawa.  At the request of the 
    Attorney General for Ontario, the <i>Criminal Code</i> was amended in 1979 
    to provide for trials before a judge or jury who spoke the official language 
    of the accused or both English and French (S.C. 1978-79, c. 36).  In April 
    1984, the <i>Courts of Justice Act </i>was amended to provide in s. 135 (now 
    s. 125, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;C.43) that the official languages of the courts 
    in Ontario are English and French (S.O. 1984, c. 11).  At that time, the then 
    Attorney General for Ontario, the Honourable Roy McMurtry, stated that the 
    government had made it clear that services in the French language in relation 
    to health care had to be a priority: <i>Debates</i>, April 10, 1984 at pp. 
    616-17.</p>
